      <title>Frequency-dependent specific heat in quantum supercooled liquids: A mode-coupling study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frequency-dependence of specific heat in supercooled hard sphere liquid is computed using quantum mode-coupling theory (QMCT). Mode-coupling equations are solved using recently proposed perturbative method that allows to study relaxation in the moderate quantum regime where quantum effects assist liquid to glass transition. Zwanzig's formulation is used to compute the frequency-dependent specific heat in supercooled state using dynamical information from QMCT. Specific heat shows strong variation as the quantumness of the liquid is changed, which becomes more significant as density is increased. It is found that, near the transition point, different dynamical modes contribute to the specific heat in the classical and the quantum liquids.</description>

      <title>Tagged particle dynamics in supercooled quantum liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze dynamics of quantum supercooled liquids in terms of tagged particle dynamics. Unlike the classical case, uncertainty in the position of a particle in quantum liquid leads to qualitative changes. We demonstrate these effects in the dynamics of the first two moments of displacements, namely, the mean-squared displacement, $\langle \Delta r^2(t)\rangle$, and $\langle \Delta r^4(t)\rangle$. Results are presented for a hard sphere liquid using mode-coupling theory (MCT) formulation and simulation on a binary Lennard-Jones liquid. As the quantumness (controlled by the de-Broglie thermal wavelength) is increased, a non-zero value of the moments at zero time leads to significant deviations from the classical behavior in the initial dynamics. Initial displacement shows ballistic behavior $\langle \Delta r^2(t)\rangle\sim t^2$, but, as a result of large uncertainty in the position, the dynamical effects become weaker with increasing quantumness over this time scale.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Basis for Classifying Hyperuniform States of Two-Component Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperuniform states of matter exhibit unusual suppression of density fluctuations at large scales, contrasting sharply with typical disordered configurations. Various types of hyperuniformity emerge in multicomponent disordered systems, significantly enhancing their functional properties for advanced applications. This paper focuses on developing a theoretical framework for two-component hyperuniform systems. We provide a robust theoretical basis to identify novel conditions on structure factors for a variety of hyperuniform binary mixtures, classifying them into five distinct types with seven unique states. Our findings also offer valuable guidelines for designing multihyperuniform materials where each component preserves hyperuniformity, added to the overall hyperuniformity.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the hidden weak universality of the ZGB model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we revisited the Ziff-Gullari-Barshad (ZGB) model in order to investigate its critical behavior when carbon monoxide (CO) molecules are allowed to desorb from the catalytic surface. As shown by several authors, when this kind of desorption takes place, the first-order phase transition of the standard model disappears, and an Ising-like critical point is found for a very small value of the desorption rate. However, our time-dependent Monte Carlo simulations reveal that, instead of a single critical point, there exists a critical line that encompasses multiple universality classes, passing through the three- and four-state Potts points, as well as, the Ising one, resulting in an unprecedented critical line of weak universality.</description>

      <title>Theory of Order-Disorder Phase Transitions Induced by Fluctuations Based on Network Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Both quantum phase transitions and thermodynamic phase transitions are probably induced by fluctuations, yet the specific mechanism through which fluctuations cause phase transitions remains unclear in existing theories. This paper summarizes different phases into combinations of three types of network structures based on lattice models transformed into network models and the principle of maximum entropy. These three network structures correspond to ordered, boundary, and disordered conditions, respectively. By utilizing the transformation relationships satisfied by these three network structures and classical probability, this work derive the high-order detailed balance relationships satisfied by strongly correlated systems. Using the high-order detailed balance formula, this work obtain the weights of the maximum entropy network structures in general cases. Consequently, I clearly describe the process of ordered-disordered phase transitions based on fluctuations and provide critical exponents and phase transition points. Finally, I verify this theory using the Ising model in different dimensions, the frustration scenario of the triangular lattice antiferromagnetic Ising model, and the expectation of ground-state energy in the two-dimensional Edwards-Anderson model.</description>

      <title>Exact density profile in a tight-binding chain with dephasing noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the many-body dynamics of a tight-binding chain with dephasing noise on the infinite interval. We obtain the exact solution of an average particle-density profile for the domain wall and the alternating initial conditions via the Bethe ansatz, analytically deriving the asymptotic expressions for the long time dynamics. For the domain wall initial condition, we obtain the scaling form of the average density, elucidating that the diffusive transport always emerges in the long time dynamics if the strength of the dephasing, no matter how small, is positive. For the alternating initial condition, our exact solution leads to the fact that the average density displays oscillatory decay or over-damped decay depending on the strength of the dissipation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the asymptotic forms approach those of the symmetric simple exclusion process, identifying corrections from it.</description>

      <title>Interfacial Free Energy as the Key to the Pressure-Induced Deceleration of Ice Nucleation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The avoidance of water freezing is the holy grail in the cryopreservation of biological samples, food, and organs. Fast cooling rates are used to beat ice nucleation and avoid cell damage. This strategy can be enhanced by applying high pressures to decrease the nucleation rate, but the physics behind this procedure has not been fully understood yet. We perform computer experiments to investigate ice nucleation at high pressures consisting in embedding ice seeds in supercooled water. We find that the slowing down of the nucleation rate is mainly due to an increase of the ice I-water interfacial free energy with pressure. Our work also clarifies the molecular mechanism of ice nucleation for a wide pressure range. This study is not only relevant to cryopreservation, but also to water amorphization and climate change modeling.</description>

      <title>BKT transitions of the XY and six-state clock models on the various two-dimensional lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a two-dimensional (2D) spin system, the XY model, characterized by planar rotational symmetry, exhibits a unique phenomenon known as the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition. In contrast, the clock model, which introduces discrete rotational symmetry, exhibits the BKT transition at two different temperatures due to this discreteness. In this study, we numerically investigate the BKT transition for XY and six-state clock models over various two-dimensional lattices. We employ two primary methods: the Monte Carlo method, which analyzes the size dependence of the ratio of the correlation functions for two different distances, and a machine-learning approach to classify the different phases -- namely, the low-temperature ordered phase, the intermediate BKT phase, and the high-temperature disordered phase. We identify the BKT transition temperatures for the XY and six-state models on honeycomb, kagome, and diced lattices. Combined with the previously calculated data for the triangular lattice, we then compare these values with the second-order phase transition temperatures of the 2D Ising model, for which exact solutions are known. Our results indicate that the ratio of the BKT transition temperatures for each lattice relative to the Ising model transition temperatures are close, although the values are not universal.</description>

      <title>Boundary operator expansion and extraordinary phase transition in the tricritical O(N) model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the boundary extraordinary transition of a 3D tricritical $O(N)$ model. We first compute the mean-field Green's function with a general coupling of $|\vec \phi|^{2n}$ (with $n=3$ corresponding to the tricritical point) at the extraordinary phase transition. Then, by employing the technique of layer susceptibility, we solve the boundary operator expansion using the $\epsilon=3 - d$ expansion. Based on these results, we demonstrate that the tricritical point exhibits an extraordinary transition characterized by an ordered boundary for any $N$. This provides the first nontrivial example of continuous symmetry breaking in 2D dimensions in the context of boundary criticality.</description>

      <title>Scaling Analysis and Renormalization Group on the Mobility Edge in the Quantum Random Energy Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building on recent progress in the study of Anderson and many-body localization via the renormalization group (RG), we examine the scaling theory of localization in the quantum Random Energy Model (QREM). The QREM is known to undergo a localization-delocalization transition at finite energy density, while remaining fully ergodic at the center of the spectrum. At zero energy density, we show that RG trajectories consistently flow toward the ergodic phase, and are characterized by an unconventional scaling of the fractal dimension near the ergodic fixed point. When the disorder amplitude is rescaled, as suggested by the forward scattering approximation approach, a localization transition emerges also at the center of the spectrum, with properties analogous to the Anderson transition on expander graphs. At finite energy density, a localization transition takes place without disorder rescaling, and yet it exhibits a scaling behavior analogous to the one observed on expander graphs. The universality class of the model remains unchanged under the rescaling of the disorder, reflecting the independence of the RG from microscopic details. Our findings demonstrate the robustness of the scaling behavior of random graphs and offer new insights into the many-body localization transition.</description>

      <title>Exploring dynamical quantum phase transition from pure states to mixed states through generalized Su-Schrieffer-Heeger models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate dynamic quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) in both pure and mixed states within the framework of the generalized SSH model, specifically analyzing the SSH-3 and SSH-4 models, which exhibit different symmetries. We find that the SSH-3 model, characterized by a chiral-like point symmetry rather than true chiral symmetry, supports robust localized edge states associated with its topological properties. Our results show that DQPTs for pure states occur following a quench that crosses the topological transition, even with an open energy band gap. For mixed states, DQPT behavior is consistent at low temperatures, but significant changes are observed at high temperatures, resulting in the emergence of multiple critical times. In contrast, the SSH-4 model, which possesses chiral symmetry, allows for the analysis of two distinct energy spectrum configurations. We conclude that the occurrence of DQPTs for pure states in the SSH-4 model necessitates a quench from an initial state without a band gap while crossing the critical point of the topological transition, whereas DQPTs are absent for mixed states at elevated temperatures.</description>

      <title>Black-box optimization and quantum annealing for filtering out mislabeled training instances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study proposes an approach for removing mislabeled instances from contaminated training datasets by combining surrogate model-based black-box optimization (BBO) with postprocessing and quantum annealing. Mislabeled training instances, a common issue in real-world datasets, often degrade model generalization, necessitating robust and efficient noise-removal strategies. The proposed method evaluates filtered training subsets based on validation loss, iteratively refines loss estimates through surrogate model-based BBO with postprocessing, and leverages quantum annealing to efficiently sample diverse training subsets with low validation error. Experiments on a noisy majority bit task demonstrate the method's ability to prioritize the removal of high-risk mislabeled instances. Integrating D-Wave's clique sampler running on a physical quantum annealer achieves faster optimization and higher-quality training subsets compared to OpenJij's simulated quantum annealing sampler or Neal's simulated annealing sampler, offering a scalable framework for enhancing dataset quality. This work highlights the effectiveness of the proposed method for supervised learning tasks, with future directions including its application to unsupervised learning, real-world datasets, and large-scale implementations.</description>

      <title>Relativistic model of spontaneous wave-function localization induced by nonHermitian colored noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a relativistic model of spontaneous wave-function collapse, based on a random nonHermitian action where the fermion density operator is coupled to a universal colored noise. Upon quantization, the wave function obeys a nonlinear stochastic differential equation that respects statistical Lorentz symmetry. The localization mechanism is driven by the colored noise, derived from the d'Alembert equation using generalized stochastic calculus in 1+3-dimensional spacetime. We analytically determine the noise-induced localization length, which decreases as the size of the observable universe increases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a dense assembly of repulsive particles whose fluctuating sizes are subject to a landscape that defines three species: particles with finite size, either of type $A$ or of type $B$, and point particles $\varnothing$. We show that the nonequilibrium synchronization of sizes systematically leads to a homogeneous configuration associated with the survival of a single species. Remarkably, the relaxation towards such a configuration features a transient phase separation. By delineating and analyzing the dominant kinetic factors at play during relaxation, we recapitulate the phase diagram of species survival in terms of the parameters of the size landscape. Finally, we obtain a hydrodynamic mapping to equilibrium by coarse-graining the microscopic dynamics, which leads to predicting the nature of the transitions between various regimes where distinct species survive.</description>

      <title>Combined effect of incentives and coupling in multigames in two-layer networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The lack of cooperation can easily result in inequality among members of a society, which provides an increasing gap between individual incomes. To tackle this issue, we introduce an incentive mechanism based on individual strategies and incomes, wherein a portion of the income from defectors is allocated to reward low-income cooperators, aiming to enhance cooperation by improving the equitable distribution of wealth across the entire population. Moreover, previous research has typically employed network structures or game mechanisms characterized by homogeneity. In this study, we present a network framework that more accurately reflects real-world conditions, where agents are engaged in multiple games, including prisoner's dilemma games in the top-layer and public good games in the down-layer networks. Within this framework, we introduce the concept of ``external coupling'' which connects agents across different networks as acquaintances, thereby facilitating access to shared datasets. Our results indicate that the combined positive effects of external coupling and incentive mechanism lead to optimal cooperation rates and lower Gini coefficients, demonstrating a negative correlation between cooperation and inequality. From a micro-level perspective, this phenomenon primarily arises from the regular network, whereas suboptimal outcomes are observed within the scale-free network. These observations help to give a deeper insight into the interplay between cooperation and wealth disparity in evolutionary games in large populations.</description>

      <title>Bond Disordered Antiferromagnetic Quantum Spin Chains with Long Range Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and implement a reformulation of the strong disorder renormalization group (SDRG) in real space, which is well suited to study bond disordered power law long range coupled, antiferromagnetic quantum spin chains. We derive the distribution function of couplings $J$ with corrections to the previously derived strong disorder fixed point distribution, which depend on power exponent $\alpha$ and coupling anisotropy $\gamma.$
  As a consequence, the low temperature magnetic susceptibility is found to diverge with an anomalous power law. The distribution of singlet lengths is found to decay more slowly than obtained previously, with severe consequences for physical properties. The entanglement entropy of a subsystem of length $n$ is thereby found to increase with a power law, rather than logarithmically, corresponding to a subvolume law for sufficiently large $\alpha$. We argue that volume law entanglement entropy can appear due to the emergence of rainbow states. A formula for $\alpha_c$ below which such rainbow states emerge is given.</description>

      <title>Phenomenological model of crack patterns in thin colloidal films undergoing desiccation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A number of geometric and topological properties of samples of crack-template based conductive films are examined to assess the degree to which Voronoi diagrams can successfully model structure and conductivity in such networks. Our analysis suggests that although Poisson--Voronoi diagrams are only partially successful in modeling structural features of real-world crack patterns formed in films undergoing desiccation, such diagrams can nevertheless be useful in situations where topological characteristics are more important than geometric ones. A phenomenological model is proposed that is more accurate at capturing features of the real-world crack patterns.</description>

      <title>Momentum coupling of classical atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new method, dual-space cluster expansion, is proposed to study classical phases transitions in the continuum. It relies on replacing the particle positions as integration variables by the momenta of the relative displacements of particle pairs. Due to the requirement that the particles must be static, coupling via the momenta partitions the set of particles into a set of clusters, and transforms the partition function into a sum over the different cluster decompositions. This allows us to derive a formula for the density that finite clusters can carry in the infinite system. In a simplified example, we then demonstrate that in two and higher dimensions this density has a threshold, beyond which the particles form infinite clusters. The transition is accompanied by a singularity in the free energy. We also show that infinite clusters are always present in condensed phases, most likely submacroscopic in liquids and macroscopic in crystals.</description>

      <title>Chemical potential and variable number of particles control the quantum state: Quantum oscillators as a showcase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite their simplicity, quantum harmonic oscillators are ubiquitous in the modeling of physical systems. They are able to capture universal properties that serve as reference for the more complex systems found in nature. In this spirit, we apply a model of a Hamiltonian for open quantum systems in equilibrium with a particle reservoir to ensembles of quantum oscillators. By treating (i) a dilute gas of vibrating particles and (ii) a chain of coupled oscillators as showcases, we demonstrate that the property of varying number of particles leads to a mandatory condition on the energy of the system. In particular, the chemical potential plays the role of a parameter of control that can externally manipulate the spectrum of a system and the corresponding accessible quantum states.</description>

      <title>The shape of cleaved tethered membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A remarkable property of flexible self-avoiding elastic surfaces (membranes) is that they remain flat at all temperatures, even in the absence of a bending rigidity or in the presence of active fluctuations. Here, we report numerical results of these surfaces wherein we alter their topology by systematically cleaving internal bonds. While it is known that a random removal of membrane bonds does not disrupt the overall extended shape of the membrane, we find that cleaving an elastic surface with longitudinal parallel cuts leads to its systematic collapse into a number of complex morphologies that can be controlled by altering the number and length of the inserted cuts. For the simpler case of membranes with bending rigidity but in the absence of self-avoidance, we find that the radius of gyration of the surface as a function of number of cuts is represented by a universal master curve when the variables are appropriately rescaled.</description>

      <title>Zero-temperature phase-flip rate in a biased parametric oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A parametrically driven oscillator has two stable vibrational states at half the modulation frequency. The states have opposite phase and equal amplitudes. An extra drive at half the modulation frequency provides an effective bias that lifts the state symmetry. Quantum fluctuations lead to switching between the states, i.e., to phase-flip transitions. We develop a semiclassical approach that allows us to find the dependence of the switching rates on the amplitude of the bias and the parameters of the modulating field. We find that the rate of switching from a ''shallow'' state can become anomalously small at certain parameter values, leading to an efficient localization in this state. This is a consequence of the change of the topology of the oscillator phase trajectories. The results pave the way for implementing nonreciprocal quantum Ising systems based on parametric oscillators.</description>

      <title>Extend the random-walk shielding-potential viscosity model to hot temperature regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.16551v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The transport properties of matter have been widely investigated. In particular, shear viscosity over a wide parameter space is crucial for various applications, such as designing inertial confinement fusion (ICF) targets and determining the Rayleigh-Taylor instability. In this work, an extended random-walk shielding-potential viscosity model (ext-RWSP-VM) based on the statistics of random-walk ions and the Debye shielding effect is proposed to elevate the temperature limit of RWSP-VM [Phys. Rev. E 106, 014142] in evaluating the shear viscosity of one component plasma. In the extended model, we reconsider the collision distance that is introduced by hard-sphere concept, hence, it is applicable in wide temperature regime rather than a narrower one in which RWSP-VM is applicable. The results of H, C, Al, Fe, Ge, W, and U show that the extended model provides a systematic way to calculate the shear viscosity of arbitrary one component plasma at the densities from about 0.1 to 10 times the normal density (the density at room temperature and 1 standard atmosphere). This work will help to develop viscosity model in wide regime when combined with our previous low temperature viscosity model [AIP Adv. 11, 015043].</description>

      <title>Fluctuating hydrodynamics of active particles interacting via taxis and quorum sensing: static and dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05072v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we derive and test the fluctuating hydrodynamic description of active particles interacting via taxis and quorum sensing, both for mono-disperse systems and for mixtures of co-existing species of active particles. We compute the average steady-state density profile in the presence of spatial motility regulation, as well as the structure factor and intermediate scattering function for interacting systems. By comparing our predictions to microscopic numerical simulations, we show that our fluctuating hydrodynamics correctly predicts the large-scale static and dynamical properties of the system. We also discuss how the theory breaks down when structures emerge at scales smaller or comparable to the persistence length of the particles. When the density field is the unique hydrodynamic mode of the system, we show that active Brownian particles, run-and-tumble particles and active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck particles, interacting via quorum-sensing or chemotactic interactions, display undistinguishable large-scale properties. This form of universality implies an interesting robustness of the predicted physics but also that large-scale observations of patterns are insufficient to assess their microscopic origins. In particular, our results predict that chemotaxis-induced and motility-induced phase separation should share strong qualitative similarities at the macroscopic scale.</description>

      <title>Residual entropy from temperature incremental Monte Carlo method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17827v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Residual entropy, reflecting the degrees of freedom in a system at absolute zero temperature, is important for understanding quantum and classical ground states. Despite its key role in explaining low-temperature phenomena and ground state degeneracy, accurately measuring residual entropy remains a difficult task due to computational challenges. In this Letter, we introduce the Temperature Incremental Monte Carlo (TIMC) method, our new approach to solve these challenges. The TIMC method incrementally calculates the partition function ratio of neighboring temperatures within Monte Carlo simulations, enabling precise entropy calculations and revealing many other temperature-dependent properties in a single computational sweep of temperatures. We have thoroughly tested TIMC on several complex systems, such as the frustrated antiferromagnetic Ising model on both C60 and 2D triangular lattices, the Newman-Moore glassy model, and a 2D quantum transverse field Ising model. Notably, our method overcomes the difficulties encountered in partition function measurements when mapping $d$-dimensional quantum models to $d+1$-dimensional classical counterparts. These difficulties arise from the singular interactions that emerge in the small $\Delta_\tau$ limit during the quantum-to-classical mapping procedure. The TIMC method enables precise entropy calculations across the entire temperature range, as demonstrated in our studies of frustrated spin models, glassy phases, and phases exhibiting spontaneous symmetry breaking. This method's capability in calculating residual entropy could provide new insights when applied to systems lacking analytical solutions.</description>

      <title>A Minkowski space embedding to understand Markov models dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11238v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To describe the behavior of Markov models as parameters are varied, I show how to embed the space of Markov models within a Minkowski space. This embedding maintains the inherent distance between different instances of the model. The coordinates of this embedding emerge from the symmetrized Kullback-Leibler divergence and are expressed in terms of thermodynamic quantities, organizing the Minkowski space into equilibrium and nonequilibrium components. With this approach, we can visualize models' behaviors and gain a thermodynamic interpretation of information geometric concepts, even in far-from-equilibrium scenarios. I illustrate this approach using an analytically solvable molecular motor model.</description>

      <title>Typicality, entropy and the generalization of statistical mechanics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06537v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When at equilibrium, large-scale systems obey conventional thermodynamics because they belong to microscopic configurations (or states) that are typical. Crucially, the typical states usually represent only a small fraction of the total number of possible states, and yet the characterization of the set of typical states -- the typical set -- alone is sufficient to describe the macroscopic behavior of a given system. Consequently, the concept of typicality, and the associated Asymptotic Equipartition Property allow for a drastic reduction of the degrees of freedom needed for system's statistical description. The mathematical rationale for such a simplification in the description is due to the phenomenon of concentration of measure. The later emerges for equilibrium configurations thanks to very strict constraints on the underlying dynamics, such as weekly interacting and (almost) independent system constituents. The question naturally arises as to whether the concentration of measure and related typicality considerations can be extended and applied to more general complex systems, and if so, what mathematical structure can be expected in the ensuing generalized thermodynamics. In this paper we illustrate the relevance of the concept of typicality in the toy model context of the "thermalized" coin and show how this leads naturally to Shannon entropy. We also show an intriguing connection: The characterization of typical sets in terms of Renyi and Tsallis entropies naturally leads to the free energy and partition function, respectively, and makes their relationship explicit. Finally, we propose potential ways to generalize the concept of typicality to systems where the standard microscopic assumptions do not hold.</description>

      <title>Exploring the properties of quantum scars in a toy model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03234v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of ergodicity and explore its deviation caused by quantum scars in an isolated quantum system, employing a pedagogical approach based on a toy model. Quantum scars, originally identified as traces of classically unstable orbits in certain wavefunctions of chaotic systems, have recently regained interest for their role in non-ergodic dynamics, as they retain memory of their initial states. We elucidate these features of quantum scars within the same framework of this toy model. The integrable part of the model consists of two large spins, with a classical counterpart, which we combine with a random matrix to induce ergodic behavior. Scarred states can be selectively generated from the integrable spin Hamiltonian by protecting them from the ergodic states using a projector method. Deformed projectors mimic the `quantum leakage' of scarred states, enabling tunable mixing with ergodic states and thereby controlling the degree of scarring. In this simple model, we investigate various properties of quantum scarring and shed light on different aspects of many-body quantum scars observed in more complex quantum systems. Notably, the underlying classicality can be revealed through the entanglement spectrum and the dynamics of `out-of-time-ordered correlators'.</description>

      <title>Maximum power Stirling-like heat engine with a harmonically confined Brownian particle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08797v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Heat engines transform thermal energy into useful work, operating in a cyclic manner. For centuries, they have played a key role in industrial and technological development. Historically, only gases and liquids have been used as working substances, but the technical advances achieved over the past decades allow for expanding the experimental possibilities and designing engines operating with a single particle. In this case, the system of interest cannot be addressed at a macroscopic level and their study is framed in the field of stochastic thermodynamics. In the present work, we study mesoscopic heat engines built with a Brownian particle submitted to harmonic confinement and immersed in a fluid acting as a thermal bath. We design a Stirling-like heat engine, composed of two isothermal and two isochoric branches, by controlling both the stiffness of the harmonic trap and the temperature of the bath. Specifically, we focus on the irreversible, non quasi-static, case -- whose finite duration enables the engine to deliver a non-zero output power. This is a crucial aspect, which enables the optimisation of the thermodynamic cycle by maximising the delivered power -- thereby addressing a key goal at the practical level. The optimal driving protocols are obtained by using both variational calculus and optimal control theory tools. Also, we numerically explore the dependence of the maximum output power and the corresponding efficiency on the system parameters.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a natural mathematical definition of boundary states of a bulk gapped ground state, in the operator algebraic framework of $2$-d quantum spin systems. With approximate Haag duality at the boundary, we derive a $C^*$-tensor category $\tilde{\mathcal{M}}$ out of such boundary state. Under a non-triviality condition of the braiding in the bulk, we show that the Drinfeld center (with an asymptotic constraint) of $\tilde{\mathcal{M}}$ is equivalent to the bulk braided $C^*$-tensor category derived in [14].</description>

      <title>Macroproperties vs. Microstates in the Classical Simulation of Critical Phenomena in Quench Dynamics of 1D Ising Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08567v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the tractability of classically simulating critical phenomena in the quench dynamics of one-dimensional transverse field Ising models (TFIMs) using highly truncated matrix product states (MPS). We focus on two paradigmatic examples: a dynamical quantum phase transition (DQPT) that occurs in nonintegrable long-range TFIMs, and the infinite-time correlation length of the integrable nearest-neighbor TFIM when quenched to the critical point. For the DQPT, we show that the order parameters can be efficiently simulated with surprisingly heavy truncation of the MPS bond dimension. This can be used to reliably extract critical properties of the phase transition, including critical exponents, even when the full many-body state is not simulated with high fidelity. The long-time correlation length near the critical point is more sensitive to the full many-body state fidelity, and generally requires a large bond dimension MPS. Nonetheless, we find that this can still be efficiently simulated with strongly truncated MPS because it can be extracted from the short-time behavior of the dynamics where entanglement is low. Our results demonstrate that while accurate calculation of the full many-body state (microstate) is typically intractable due to the volume-law growth of entanglement, a precise specification of an exact microstate may not be required when simulating phases of matter of many-body systems (macrostates). We also study the tractability of simulation using truncated MPS based on quantum chaos and equilibration in the models. We find a counterintuitive inverse relationship, whereby local expectation values are most easily approximated for chaotic systems whose exact many-body state is most intractable.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Power Law: Estimation, Goodness-of-Fit, and a Semiparametric Extension in Complex Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11200</link>

Abstract: Scale-free networks play a fundamental role in the study of complex networks and various applied fields due to their ability to model a wide range of real-world systems. A key characteristic of these networks is their degree distribution, which often follows a power-law distribution, where the probability mass function is proportional to $x^{-\alpha}$, with $\alpha$ typically ranging between $2 &lt; \alpha &lt; 3$. In this paper, we introduce Bayesian inference methods to obtain more accurate estimates than those obtained using traditional methods, which often yield biased estimates, and precise credible intervals. Through a simulation study, we demonstrate that our approach provides nearly unbiased estimates for the scaling parameter, enhancing the reliability of inferences. We also evaluate new goodness-of-fit tests to improve the effectiveness of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, commonly used for this purpose. Our findings show that the Watson test offers superior power while maintaining a controlled type I error rate, enabling us to better determine whether data adheres to a power-law distribution. Finally, we propose a piecewise extension of this model to provide greater flexibility, evaluating the estimation and its goodness-of-fit features as well. In the complex networks field, this extension allows us to model the full degree distribution, instead of just focusing on the tail, as is commonly done. We demonstrate the utility of these novel methods through applications to two real-world datasets, showcasing their practical relevance and potential to advance the analysis of power-law behavior.</description>

      <title>Mean field coupled dynamical systems: Bifurcations and phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11076v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a bifurcation theory for infinite dimensional systems satisfying abstract hypotheses that are tailored for applications to mean field coupled chaotic maps. Our abstract theory can be applied to many cases, from globally coupled expanding maps to globally coupled Axiom A diffeomorphisms. To illustrate the range of applicability, we analyze an explicit example consisting of globally coupled Anosov diffeomorphisms. For such an example, we classify all the invariant measures as the coupling strength varies; we show which invariant measures are physical, and we prove that the existence of multiple invariant physical measures is a purely infinite dimensional phenomenon, i.e., the model exhibits phase transitions in the sense of statistical mechanics.</description>

      <title>Emergent polar order in non-polar mixtures with non-reciprocal interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05396v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Phenomenological rules that govern the collective behaviour of complex physical systems are powerful tools because they can make concrete predictions about their universality class based on generic considerations, such as symmetries, conservation laws, and dimensionality. While in most cases such considerations are manifestly ingrained in the constituents, novel phenomenology can emerge when composite units associated with emergent symmetries dominate the behaviour of the system. We study a generic class of active matter systems with non-reciprocal interactions and demonstrate the existence of true long-range polar order in two dimensions and above, both at the linear level and by including all relevant nonlinearities in the Renormalization Group sense. We achieve this by uncovering a mapping of our scalar active mixture theory to the Toner-Tu theory of dry polar active matter by employing a suitably defined polar order parameter. We then demonstrate that the complete effective field theory -- which includes all the soft modes and the relevant nonlinear terms -- belongs to the (Burgers-) Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class. This classification allows us to prove the stability of the emergent polar long-range order in scalar non-reciprocal mixtures in two dimensions, and hence a conclusive violation of the Mermin-Wagner theorem.</description>

      <title>Exact lattice bosonization of finite N matrix quantum mechanics and c = 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07629v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe a new exact lattice bosonization of matrix quantum mechanics (equivalently of non-relativistic fermions) that is valid for arbitrary rank N of the matrix, based on an exact operator bosonization introduced earlier in [1]. The trace identities are automatically incorporated in this formalism. The finite number N of fermions is reflected in the finite number N of bosonic oscillators, or equivalently to the finite number N of lattice points. The fermion Hamiltonian is exactly mappable to a bosonic Hamiltonian. At large N, the latter becomes local and corresponds to the lattice version of a relativistic boson Hamiltonian, with a lattice spacing of order 1/N. The finite lattice spacing leads to a finite entanglement entropy (EE) of the bosonic theory, which reproduces the finite EE of the fermionic theory. Such a description is not available in the standard bosonization in terms of fermion density fluctuations on the Fermi surface, which does not have a built-in short distance cut-off (see, however, [2]). The bosonic lattice is equipped with a geometry determined by the matrix potential or equivalently by the shape of the Fermi surface. Our bosonization also works in the double scaled c=1 model, where the bosonic EE again turns out to be finite, with the short distance cut-off turning as g_s l_s, and reproduces the matrix result. Once again, such a short distance cut-off cannot appear in the conventional dual of c=1 in terms of the 2D string ``tachyon'', where the expected short distance scale is l_s. This indicates our bosonization as a possibly different dual description to the c=1 matrix model appropriate for ``local physics'' like quantum entanglement, by contrast with the conventional duality to the eigenvalue density which works well for asymptotic observables like S-matrices. We briefly discuss possible relation of our bosonization to D0 branes.</description>

      <title>Corner Charge Fluctuation as an Observable for Quantum Geometry and Entanglement in Two-dimensional Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17023v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Measuring bipartite fluctuations of a conserved charge, such as the particle number, is a powerful approach to understanding quantum systems. When the measured region has sharp corners, the bipartite fluctuation receives an additional contribution known to exhibit a universal angle-dependence in 2D isotropic and uniform systems. Here we establish that, for generic lattice systems of interacting particles, the corner charge fluctuation is directly related to quantum geometry. We first provide a practical scheme to isolate the corner contribution on lattices, and analytically prove that its angle-dependence in the small-angle limit measures exclusively the integrated quantum metric. A model of a compact obstructed atomic insulator is introduced to illustrate this effect analytically, while numerical verification for various Chern insulator models further demonstrate the experimental relevance of the corner charge fluctuation in a finite-size quantum simulator as a probe of quantum geometry. Last but not least, for free fermions, we unveil an intimate connection between quantum geometry and quantum information through the lens of corner entanglement entropies.</description>

      <title>Molecular Nanomagnet $\text{Cu}^\text{II}\text{Ni}^\text{II}\text{Cu}^\text{II}$ as Resource for Bipartite and Tripartite Quantum Entanglement and Coherence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07037v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate key quantum characteristics of the mixed spin-(1/2,1,1/2) Heisenberg trimer under the influence of an external magnetic field. Specifically, we analyze the distributions of bipartite and tripartite entanglement quantified through the respective negativities, and the $l_1$-norm of coherence with the help of rigorous analytical and numerical methods. Our findings suggest that the heterotrinuclear molecular nanomagnet $[\{\text{Cu}^\text{II}\text{L}\}_2\text{Ni}^\text{II}(\text{H}_2\text{O})_2](\text{ClO}_4)_{2} . 3\text{H}_2\text{O}$, which represents an experimental realization of the mixed spin-(1/2,1,1/2) Heisenberg trimer, exhibits a significant bipartite entanglement between $\text{Cu}^\text{II}$ and $\text{Ni}^\text{II}$ magnetic ions along with robust tripartite entanglement among all three constituent $\text{Cu}^\text{II}\text{Ni}^\text{II}\text{Cu}^\text{II}$ magnetic ions. The significant bipartite and tripartite entanglement persists even at relatively high temperatures up to $37\,\text{K}$ and magnetic fields up to $46\,\text{T}$, whereby the coherence is maintained even at elevated temperatures. {It is evidenced that the aforementioned molecular complex with the magnetic core $\text{Cu}^\text{II}\text{Ni}^\text{II}\text{Cu}^\text{II}$ provides an intriguing quantum resource, which exhibits a star-shaped state within the singlet eigenstate at low magnetic fields and W-like state within the triplet eigenstate at moderate magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>NETS: A Non-Equilibrium Transport Sampler</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02711v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an algorithm, termed the Non-Equilibrium Transport Sampler (NETS), to sample from unnormalized probability distributions. NETS can be viewed as a variant of annealed importance sampling (AIS) based on Jarzynski's equality, in which the stochastic differential equation used to perform the non-equilibrium sampling is augmented with an additional learned drift term that lowers the impact of the unbiasing weights used in AIS. We show that this drift is the minimizer of a variety of objective functions, which can all be estimated in an unbiased fashion without backpropagating through solutions of the stochastic differential equations governing the sampling. We also prove that some these objectives control the Kullback-Leibler divergence of the estimated distribution from its target. NETS is shown to be unbiased and, in addition, has a tunable diffusion coefficient which can be adjusted post-training to maximize the effective sample size. We demonstrate the efficacy of the method on standard benchmarks, high-dimensional Gaussian mixture distributions, and a model from statistical lattice field theory, for which it surpasses the performances of related work and existing baselines.</description>

Abstract: The late time behaviour of OTOCs involving generic non-conserved local operators show exponential decay in chaotic many body systems. However, it has been recently observed that for certain holographic theories, the OTOC involving the $U(1)$ conserved current for a gauge field instead varies diffusively at late times. The present work generalizes this observation to conserved currents corresponding to higher-form symmetries that belong to a wider class of symmetries known as generalized symmetries. We started by computing the late time behaviour of OTOCs involving $U(1)$ current operators in five dimensional AdS-Schwarzschild black hole geometry for the 2-form antisymmetric $B$-fields. The bulk solution for the $B$-field exhibits logarithmic divergences near the asymptotic AdS boundary which can be regularized by introducing a double trace deformation in the boundary CFT. Finally, we consider the more general case with antisymmetric $p$-form fields in arbitrary dimensions. In the scattering approach, the boundary OTOC can be written as an inner product between asymptotic 'in' and 'out' states which in our case is equivalent to computing the inner product between two bulk fields with and without a shockwave background. We observe that the late time OTOCs have power law tails which seems to be a universal feature of the higher-form fields with $U(1)$ charge conservation.</description>

      <title>Young Researchers School 2024 Maynooth: Lectures on CFT, BCFT and DCFT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03381v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: These notes were presented at the Young Researchers School (YRS) in Maynooth in April 2024 and provide an introduction to Conformal Field Theory CFT, Boundary Conformal Field Theory (BCFT) and Defect Conformal Field Theory (DCFT). This class is mostly self-contained and includes exercises with solutions. The first part of these notes is concerned with the basics of CFT, and was taught by the author during the pre-school for the YRS 2024. Here the aim is to convey the notion of conformal families, their fusion and the construction of partition functions. The second part of these notes is dedicated to boundaries and defects in CFT and was presented by the author at the main school. As far as boundaries are concerned, emphasis is placed on boundary operators and their state spaces, as well as the boundary state formalism with the Cardy constraint. Topological defects are discussed in analogy, i.e. defect state spaces and the relevant consistency constraint are derived. Verlinde lines are constructed as their simplest solution and their properties are inspected.</description>

      <title>Dissipation alters modes of information encoding in small quantum reservoirs near criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18290v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum reservoir computing (QRC) has emerged as a promising paradigm for harnessing near-term quantum devices to tackle temporal machine learning tasks. Yet identifying the mechanisms that underlie enhanced performance remains challenging, particularly in many-body open systems where nonlinear interactions and dissipation intertwine in complex ways. Here, we investigate a minimal model of a driven-dissipative quantum reservoir described by two coupled Kerr-nonlinear oscillators, an experimentally realizable platform that features controllable coupling, intrinsic nonlinearity, and tunable photon loss. Using Partial Information Decomposition (PID), we examine how different dynamical regimes encode input drive signals in terms of redundancy (information shared by each oscillator) and synergy (information accessible only through their joint observation). Our key results show that, near a critical point marking a dynamical bifurcation, the system transitions from predominantly redundant to synergistic encoding. We further demonstrate that synergy amplifies short-term responsiveness, thereby enhancing immediate memory retention, whereas strong dissipation leads to more redundant encoding that supports long-term memory retention. These findings elucidate how the interplay of instability and dissipation shapes information processing in small quantum systems, providing a fine-grained, information-theoretic perspective for analyzing and designing QRC platforms.</description>
