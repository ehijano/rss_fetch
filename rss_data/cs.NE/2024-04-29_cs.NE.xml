      <title>Stochastic Spiking Neural Networks with First-to-Spike Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), recognized as the third generation of neural networks, are known for their bio-plausibility and energy efficiency, especially when implemented on neuromorphic hardware. However, the majority of existing studies on SNNs have concentrated on deterministic neurons with rate coding, a method that incurs substantial computational overhead due to lengthy information integration times and fails to fully harness the brain's probabilistic inference capabilities and temporal dynamics. In this work, we explore the merger of novel computing and information encoding schemes in SNN architectures where we integrate stochastic spiking neuron models with temporal coding techniques. Through extensive benchmarking with other deterministic SNNs and rate-based coding, we investigate the tradeoffs of our proposal in terms of accuracy, inference latency, spiking sparsity, energy consumption, and robustness. Our work is the first to extend the scalability of direct training approaches of stochastic SNNs with temporal encoding to VGG architectures and beyond-MNIST datasets.</description>

      <title>Non-Spatial Hash Chemistry as a Minimalistic Open-Ended Evolutionary System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is an increasing level of interest in open-endedness in the recent literature of Artificial Life and Artificial Intelligence. We previously proposed the cardinality leap of possibility spaces as a promising mechanism to facilitate open-endedness in artificial evolutionary systems, and demonstrated its effectiveness using Hash Chemistry, an artificial chemistry model that used a hash function as a universal fitness evaluator. However, the spatial nature of Hash Chemistry came with extensive computational costs involved in its simulation, and the particle density limit imposed to prevent explosion of computational costs prevented unbounded growth in complexity of higher-order entities. To address these limitations, here we propose a simpler non-spatial variant of Hash Chemistry in which spatial proximity of particles are represented explicitly in the form of multisets. This model modification achieved a significant reduction of computational costs in simulating the model. Results of numerical simulations showed much more significant unbounded growth in both maximal and average sizes of replicating higher-order entities than the original model, demonstrating the effectiveness of this non-spatial model as a minimalistic example of open-ended evolutionary systems.</description>

      <title>Quantized Context Based LIF Neurons for Recurrent Spiking Neural Networks in 45nm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we propose the first hardware implementation of a context-based recurrent spiking neural network (RSNN) emphasizing on integrating dual information streams within the neocortical pyramidal neurons specifically Context- Dependent Leaky Integrate and Fire (CLIF) neuron models, essential element in RSNN. We present a quantized version of the CLIF neuron (qCLIF), developed through a hardware-software codesign approach utilizing the sparse activity of RSNN. Implemented in a 45nm technology node, the qCLIF is compact (900um^2) and achieves a high accuracy of 90% despite 8 bit quantization on DVS gesture classification dataset. Our analysis spans a network configuration from 10 to 200 qCLIF neurons, supporting up to 82k synapses within a 1.86 mm^2 footprint, demonstrating scalability and efficiency</description>

      <title>GEEvo: Game Economy Generation and Balancing with Evolutionary Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Game economy design significantly shapes the player experience and progression speed. Modern game economies are becoming increasingly complex and can be very sensitive to even minor numerical adjustments, which may have an unexpected impact on the overall gaming experience. Consequently, thorough manual testing and fine-tuning during development are essential. Unlike existing works that address algorithmic balancing for specific games or genres, this work adopts a more abstract approach, focusing on game balancing through its economy, detached from a specific game. We propose GEEvo (Game Economy Evolution), a framework to generate graph-based game economies and balancing both, newly generated or existing economies. GEEvo uses a two-step approach where evolutionary algorithms are used to first generate an economy and then balance it based on specified objectives, such as generated resources or damage dealt over time. We define different objectives by differently parameterizing the fitness function using data from multiple simulation runs of the economy. To support this, we define a lightweight and flexible game economy simulation framework. Our method is tested and benchmarked with various balancing objectives on a generated dataset, and we conduct a case study evaluating damage balancing for two fictional economies of two popular game character classes.</description>

      <title>LLM-SR: Scientific Equation Discovery via Programming with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mathematical equations have been unreasonably effective in describing complex natural phenomena across various scientific disciplines. However, discovering such insightful equations from data presents significant challenges due to the necessity of navigating extremely high-dimensional combinatorial and nonlinear hypothesis spaces. Traditional methods of equation discovery largely focus on extracting equations from data alone, often neglecting the rich domain-specific prior knowledge that scientists typically depend on. To bridge this gap, we introduce LLM-SR, a novel approach that leverages the extensive scientific knowledge and robust code generation capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to discover scientific equations from data in an efficient manner. Specifically, LLM-SR treats equations as programs with mathematical operators and combines LLMs' scientific priors with evolutionary search over equation programs. The LLM iteratively proposes new equation skeletons, drawing from its physical understanding, which are then optimized against data to estimate skeleton parameters. We demonstrate LLM-SR's effectiveness across three diverse scientific domains, where it discovers physically accurate equations that provide significantly better fits to in-domain and out-of-domain data compared to the well-established equation discovery baselines</description>

      <title>Scalable Event-by-event Processing of Neuromorphic Sensory Signals With Deep State-Space Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Event-based sensors are well suited for real-time processing due to their fast response times and encoding of the sensory data as successive temporal differences. These and other valuable properties, such as a high dynamic range, are suppressed when the data is converted to a frame-based format. However, most current methods either collapse events into frames or cannot scale up when processing the event data directly event-by-event. In this work, we address the key challenges of scaling up event-by-event modeling of the long event streams emitted by such sensors, which is a particularly relevant problem for neuromorphic computing. While prior methods can process up to a few thousand time steps, our model, based on modern recurrent deep state-space models, scales to event streams of millions of events for both training and inference.We leverage their stable parameterization for learning long-range dependencies, parallelizability along the sequence dimension, and their ability to integrate asynchronous events effectively to scale them up to long event streams.We further augment these with novel event-centric techniques enabling our model to match or beat the state-of-the-art performance on several event stream benchmarks. In the Spiking Speech Commands task, we improve state-of-the-art by a large margin of 6.6% to 87.1%. On the DVS128-Gestures dataset, we achieve competitive results without using frames or convolutional neural networks. Our work demonstrates, for the first time, that it is possible to use fully event-based processing with purely recurrent networks to achieve state-of-the-art task performance in several event-based benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Multi-Task Wavelength-Multiplexed Reservoir Computing Using a Silicon Microring Resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16588v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Among the promising advantages of photonic computing over conventional computing architectures is the potential to increase computing efficiency through massive parallelism by using the many degrees of freedom provided by photonics. Here, we numerically demonstrate the simultaneous use of time and frequency (equivalently wavelength) multiplexing to solve three independent tasks at the same time on the same photonic circuit. In particular, we consider a microring-based time-delay reservoir computing (TDRC) scheme that simultaneously solves three tasks: Time-series prediction, classification, and wireless channel equalization. The scheme relies on time-division multiplexing to avoid the necessity of multiple physical nonlinear nodes, while the tasks are parallelized using wavelength division multiplexing (WDM). The input data modulated on each optical channel is mapped to a higher dimensional space by the nonlinear dynamics of the silicon microring cavity. The carrier wavelength and input power assigned to each optical channel have a high influence on the performance of its respective task. When all tasks operate under the same wavelength/power conditions, our results show that the computing nature of each task is the deciding factor of the level of performance achievable. However, it is possible to achieve good performance for all tasks simultaneously by optimizing the parameters of each optical channel. The variety of applications covered by the tasks shows the versatility of the proposed photonic TDRC scheme. Overall, this work provides insight into the potential of WDM-based schemes for improving the computing capabilities of reservoir computing schemes.</description>

      <title>Dealing with Structure Constraints in Evolutionary Pareto Set Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.20426v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the past few decades, many multiobjective evolutionary optimization algorithms (MOEAs) have been proposed to find a finite set of approximate Pareto solutions for a given problem in a single run, each with its own structure. However, in many real-world applications, it could be desirable to have structure constraints on the entire optimal solution set, which define the patterns shared among all solutions. The current population-based MOEAs cannot properly handle such requirements. In this work, we make the first attempt to incorporate the structure constraints into the whole solution set by a single Pareto set model, which can be efficiently learned by a simple evolutionary stochastic optimization method. With our proposed method, the decision-makers can flexibly trade off the Pareto optimality with preferred structures among all solutions, which is not supported by previous MOEAs. A set of experiments on benchmark test suites and real-world application problems fully demonstrates the efficiency of our proposed method.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning via Cooperative Coevolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14763v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, evolutionary reinforcement learning has obtained much attention in various domains. Maintaining a population of actors, evolutionary reinforcement learning utilises the collected experiences to improve the behaviour policy through efficient exploration. However, the poor scalability of genetic operators limits the efficiency of optimising high-dimensional neural networks. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel cooperative coevolutionary reinforcement learning (CoERL) algorithm. Inspired by cooperative coevolution, CoERL periodically and adaptively decomposes the policy optimisation problem into multiple subproblems and evolves a population of neural networks for each of the subproblems. Instead of using genetic operators, CoERL directly searches for partial gradients to update the policy. Updating policy with partial gradients maintains consistency between the behaviour spaces of parents and offspring across generations. The experiences collected by the population are then used to improve the entire policy, which enhances the sampling efficiency. Experiments on six benchmark locomotion tasks demonstrate that CoERL outperforms seven state-of-the-art algorithms and baselines. Ablation study verifies the unique contribution of CoERL's core ingredients.</description>

      <title>A supplemental investigation of non-linearity in quantum generative models with respect to simulatability and optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.00788v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated the utility of introducing non-linearity through repeat-until-success (RUS) sub-routines into quantum circuits for generative modeling. As a follow-up to this work, we investigate two questions of relevance to the quantum algorithms and machine learning communities: Does introducing this form of non-linearity make the learning model classically simulatable due to the deferred measurement principle? And does introducing this form of non-linearity make the overall model's training more unstable? With respect to the first question, we demonstrate that the RUS sub-routines do not allow us to trivially map this quantum model to a classical one, whereas a model without RUS sub-circuits containing mid-circuit measurements could be mapped to a classical Bayesian network due to the deferred measurement principle of quantum mechanics. This strongly suggests that the proposed form of non-linearity makes the model classically in-efficient to simulate. In the pursuit of the second question, we train larger models than previously shown on three different probability distributions, one continuous and two discrete, and compare the training performance across multiple random trials. We see that while the model is able to perform exceptionally well in some trials, the variance across trials with certain datasets quantifies its relatively poor training stability.</description>

      <title>NeuraChip: Accelerating GNN Computations with a Hash-based Decoupled Spatial Accelerator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15510v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are emerging as a formidable tool for processing non-euclidean data across various domains, ranging from social network analysis to bioinformatics. Despite their effectiveness, their adoption has not been pervasive because of scalability challenges associated with large-scale graph datasets, particularly when leveraging message passing.
  To tackle these challenges, we introduce NeuraChip, a novel GNN spatial accelerator based on Gustavson's algorithm. NeuraChip decouples the multiplication and addition computations in sparse matrix multiplication. This separation allows for independent exploitation of their unique data dependencies, facilitating efficient resource allocation. We introduce a rolling eviction strategy to mitigate data idling in on-chip memory as well as address the prevalent issue of memory bloat in sparse graph computations. Furthermore, the compute resource load balancing is achieved through a dynamic reseeding hash-based mapping, ensuring uniform utilization of computing resources agnostic of sparsity patterns. Finally, we present NeuraSim, an open-source, cycle-accurate, multi-threaded, modular simulator for comprehensive performance analysis.
  Overall, NeuraChip presents a significant improvement, yielding an average speedup of 22.1x over Intel's MKL, 17.1x over NVIDIA's cuSPARSE, 16.7x over AMD's hipSPARSE, and 1.5x over prior state-of-the-art SpGEMM accelerator and 1.3x over GNN accelerator. The source code for our open-sourced simulator and performance visualizer is publicly accessible on GitHub https://neurachip.us</description>

      <title>A Multi-objective Optimization Benchmark Test Suite for Real-time Semantic Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16266v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As one of the emerging challenges in Automated Machine Learning, the Hardware-aware Neural Architecture Search (HW-NAS) tasks can be treated as black-box multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs). An important application of HW-NAS is real-time semantic segmentation, which plays a pivotal role in autonomous driving scenarios. The HW-NAS for real-time semantic segmentation inherently needs to balance multiple optimization objectives, including model accuracy, inference speed, and hardware-specific considerations. Despite its importance, benchmarks have yet to be developed to frame such a challenging task as multi-objective optimization. To bridge the gap, we introduce a tailored streamline to transform the task of HW-NAS for real-time semantic segmentation into standard MOPs. Building upon the streamline, we present a benchmark test suite, CitySeg/MOP, comprising fifteen MOPs derived from the Cityscapes dataset. The CitySeg/MOP test suite is integrated into the EvoXBench platform to provide seamless interfaces with various programming languages (e.g., Python and MATLAB) for instant fitness evaluations. We comprehensively assessed the CitySeg/MOP test suite on various multi-objective evolutionary algorithms, showcasing its versatility and practicality.
