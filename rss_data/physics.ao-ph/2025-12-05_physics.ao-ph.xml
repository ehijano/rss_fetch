      <title>High-Resolution Retrieval of Atmospheric Boundary Layers with Nonstationary Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) plays a critical role in governing turbulent exchanges of momentum, heat moisture, and trace gases between the Earth's surface and the free atmosphere, thereby influencing meteorological phenomena, air quality, and climate processes. Accurate and temporally continuous characterization of the ABL structure and height evolution is crucial for both scientific understanding and practical applications. High-resolution retrievals of the ABL height from vertical velocity measurements is challenging because it is often estimated using empirical thresholds applied to profiles of vertical velocity variance or related turbulence diagnostics at each measurement altitude, which can suffer from limited sampling and sensitivity to noise. To address these limitations, this work employs nonstationary Gaussian process (GP) modeling to more effectively capture the spatio-temporal dependence structure in the data, enabling high-quality -- and, if desired, high-resolution -- estimates of the ABL height without reliance on ad-hoc parameter tuning. By leveraging Vecchia approximations, the proposed method can be applied to large-scale datasets, and example applications using full-day vertical velocity profiles comprising approximately $5$M measurements are presented.</description>

      <title>NORi: An ML-Augmented Ocean Boundary Layer Parameterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: NORi is a machine-learned (ML) parameterization of ocean boundary layer turbulence that is physics-based and augmented with neural networks. NORi stands for neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs) Richardson number (Ri) closure. The physical parameterization is controlled by a Richardson number-dependent diffusivity and viscosity. The NODEs are trained to capture the entrainment through the base of the boundary layer, which cannot be represented with a local diffusive closure. The parameterization is trained using large-eddy simulations in an "a posteriori" fashion, where parameters are calibrated with a loss function that explicitly depends on the actual time-integrated variables of interest rather than the instantaneous subgrid fluxes, which are inherently noisy. NORi is designed for the realistic nonlinear equation of state of seawater and demonstrates excellent prediction and generalization capabilities in capturing entrainment dynamics under different convective strengths, oceanic background stratifications, rotation strengths, and surface wind forcings. NORi is numerically stable for at least 100 years of integration time in large-scale simulations, despite only being trained on 2-day horizons, and can be run with time steps as long as one hour. The highly expressive neural networks, combined with a physically-rigorous base closure, prove to be a robust paradigm for designing parameterizations for climate models where data requirements are drastically reduced, inference performance can be directly targeted and optimized, and numerical stability is implicitly encouraged during training.</description>

      <title>Rotational and Irrotational Wind Forcing as dual drivers of El Nino Southern Oscillation variability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: El Ni\~no Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is the Earth's strongest source of interannual climate variability. Although its center of action is in the tropical Pacific, it has significant influences on the climate at the planetary scale. ENSO is sustained by a feedback process between equatorial winds, vertical displacements of the thermocline, and sea surface temperature (SST) anomaly gradients. This produces an oscillation in the SST anomaly between a warm (El Ni\~no) and a cold phase (La Ni\~na). While the natural time-scale of ENSO variability is interannual, variations in its behavior and characteristics have been observed over longer time scales, including decadal and interdecadal. Here, we use the Helmholtz decomposition to break down the wind stress into two components: irrotational (curl free) and solenoidal (divergence free). We show that the irrotational component of the wind stress drives the dynamics of the thermocline on the interannual time-scale, while the solenoidal component, whose action is influenced by the stratification of the water column, affects the variability of the thermocline over decadal or interdecadal time-scales. Furthermore, we develop an integral relation that links the variability of the thermocline depth anomaly across the entire tropical Pacific to the variability of the average SST anomaly in the central tropical Pacific (known as the Ni\~no-3.4 index) and conclude that the irrotational component of the wind stress determines the interannual variability of the Ni\~no-3.4 index, while the solenoidal component determines its long-term variability.</description>

      <title>Towards an end-to-end artificial intelligence driven global weather forecasting system</title>

Abstract: The weather forecasting system is important for science and society, and significant achievements have been made in applying artificial intelligence (AI) to medium-range weather forecasting. However, existing AI-based weather forecasting models rely on analysis or reanalysis products from traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP) systems as initial conditions for making predictions. The initial states are typically generated by traditional data assimilation components, which are computationally expensive and time-consuming. Here, by cyclic training to model the steady-state background error covariance and introducing the confidence matrix to characterize the quality of observations, we present an AI-based data assimilation model, i.e., Adas, for global weather variables. Further, we combine Adas with the advanced AI-based forecasting model (i.e., FengWu) to construct an end-to-end AI-based global weather forecasting system: FengWu-Adas. We demonstrate that Adas can assimilate global conventional observations to produce high-quality analysis, enabling the system to operate stably for long term. Moreover, the system can generate accurate end-to-end weather forecasts with comparable skill to those of the IFS, demonstrating the promising potential of data-driven approaches.</description>

      <title>Impact of Forecast Stability on Navigational Contrail Avoidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13529v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: MMitigating contrail-induced warming by re-routing flights around contrail-forming regions requires accurate and stable forecasts of the state of the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere. Forecast stability (i.e., consistency between forecast cycles with different lead times) is particularly important for "pre-tactical" contrail avoidance strategies that adjust routes based on forecasts with lead times as long as 24-48 hours. However, no study to date has systematically quantified the degree to which forecast stability limits the effectiveness of pre-tactical avoidance. This study addresses this gap by comparing contrail forecasts generated using ECMWF HRES weather forecasts with lead times up to 48 hours to contrail hindcasts generated based on ECMWF ERA5 reanalysis. An analysis of forecast errors show low pointwise consistency between persistent-contrail-forming regions in forecasts and reanalysis, with pointwise error rates similar to those found in previous comparisons of contrail-forming regions in reanalysis and reality. However, we also show that spatial errors in the locations of contrail-forming regions are relatively small, both when forecasts are compared to reanalysis and when reanalysis is compared to in-situ measurements. Finally, we show that designing a trajectory optimizer to take advantage of relatively small spatial errors allows flight trajectory optimizations based on contrail forecasts to reduce contrail climate forcing evaluated based on reanalysis by 80-90% at the 8-24 hour lead times most relevant to flight planning, with fuel penalties under 0.4%. Our results show that forecasts with lead times relevant to flight planning are stable enough to be used for pre-tactical contrail avoidance.</description>

      <title>Enhanced magnetostrophic waves with magnetic field orthogonal to the rotation axis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03120v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider an isolated Gaussian velocity vortex perturbation in an otherwise quiescent, electrically conducting, and rotating fluid permeated by a uniform magnetic field $\bf{B}$. Studies suggest a presence of strong azimuthal wave motions on the timescale of centuries within the Earth's liquid outer core at higher latitudes. To understand these long-period oscillations, we focus on magnetostrophic waves, a slow component of magnetic-Coriolis waves with $\bf{B}$ orthogonally aligned with the rotation vector $\bf{\Omega}$, which replicate the field lines in the azimuthal direction. We present an analytical solution to the magnetic-Coriolis wave equation in Cartesian coordinates. Later, with numerical solution, we validate our analytical estimates and show that magnetostrophic waves travel relatively faster along the magnetic field when $\bf{B} \perp \bf{\Omega}$ compared with the case when both are aligned. The study confirms that with a magnetic field $\bf{B}$ orthogonally aligned to the rotation vector $\bf{\Omega}$, wave vectors satisfying the condition $\bf{\Omega}\cdot\bf{k} \approx 0$, travel with Alfv\'en velocities along the magnetic field lines as a component of inertial-Alfv\'en waves. The timescales on which Alfv\'en waves travel are relatively short, and it is also less likely that inertial-Alfv\'en waves will be sustained inside the core at higher latitudes \citep{Davidson2017}. This study shows that, excluding the inertial-Alfv\'en waves contribution ($k_z\neq 0$), there exists intensified magnetostrophic wave propagation when $\bf{B} \perp \bf{\Omega}$, which can explain the strong periodic oscillations on the time scales of centuries along the azimuthal field at higher latitudes. Results show persistence of the magnetostrophic waves despite the lower Lehnert number $Le$, suggesting the plausible existence of a low-intensity azimuthal magnetic field in the Earth's core.</description>
