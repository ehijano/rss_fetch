      <title>Regular Lagrangians are smooth Lagrangians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that for any element in the $\gamma$-completion of the space of smooth compact exact Lagrangian submanifolds of a cotangent bundle, if its $\gamma$-support is a smooth Lagrangian submanifold, then the element itself is a smooth Lagrangian. We also prove that if the $\gamma$-support of an element in the completion is compact, then it is connected.</description>

      <title>Non-density results in high dimensional stable Hamiltonian topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We push forward the study of higher dimensional stable Hamiltonian topology by establishing two non-density results. First, we prove that stable hypersurfaces are not $C^2$-dense in any isotopy class of embedded hypersurfaces on any ambient symplectic manifold of dimension $2n\geq 8$. Our second result is that on any manifold of dimension $2m+1\geq 5$, the set of non-degenerate stable Hamiltonian structures is not $C^2$-dense among stable Hamiltonian structures in any given stable homotopy class that satisfies a mild assumption. The latter generalizes a result by Cieliebak and Volkov to arbitrary dimensions.</description>

      <title>Symplectic double groupoids and the generalized K\"ahler potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A description of the fundamental degrees of freedom underlying a generalized K\"ahler manifold, which separates its holomorphic moduli from the space of compatible metrics in a similar way to the K\"ahler case, has been sought since its discovery in 1984. In this paper, we describe a full solution to this problem for arbitrary generalized K\"ahler manifolds, which involves the new concept of a holomorphic symplectic Morita 2-equivalence between double symplectic groupoids, equipped with a Lagrangian bisection of its real symplectic core. Essentially, any generalized K\"ahler manifold has an associated holomorphic symplectic manifold of quadruple dimension and equipped with an anti-holomorphic involution; the metric is determined by a Lagrangian submanifold of its fixed point locus. This finally resolves affirmatively a long-standing conjecture by physicists concerning the existence of a generalized K\"ahler potential.
  We demonstrate the theory by constructing explicitly the above Morita 2-equivalence and Lagrangian bisection for the well-known generalized K\"ahler structures on compact even-dimensional semisimple Lie groups, which have until now escaped such analysis. We construct the required holomorphic symplectic manifolds by expressing them as moduli spaces of flat connections on surfaces with decorated boundary, through a quasi-Hamiltonian reduction.</description>

      <title>Mapping Cone Connections and their Yang-Mills Functional</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a given closed two-form, we introduce the cone Yang-Mills functional which is a Yang-Mills-type functional for a pair $(A,B)$, a connection one-form $A$ and a scalar $B$ taking value in the adjoint representation of a Lie group. The functional arises naturally from dimensionally reducing the Yang-Mills functional over the fiber of a circle bundle with the two-form being the Euler class. We write down the Euler-Lagrange equations of the functional and present some of the properties of its critical solutions, especially in comparison with Yang-Mills solutions. We show that a special class of three-dimensional solutions satisfy a duality condition which generalizes the Bogomolny monopole equations. Moreover, we analyze the zero solutions of the cone Yang-Mills functional and give an algebraic classification characterizing principal bundles that carry such cone-flat solutions when the two-form is non-degenerate.</description>

      <title>Stability is not open or generic in symplectic four-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.13158v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given an embedded stable hypersurface in a four-dimensional symplectic manifold, we prove that it is stable isotopic to a $C^0$-close stable hypersurface with the following property: $C^\infty$-nearby hypersurfaces are generically unstable. This shows that the stability property is neither open nor generic, independently of the isotopy class of hypersurfaces and ambient symplectic manifold. The proof combines tools from stable Hamiltonian topology with techniques in three-dimensional dynamics such as partial sections, integrability and KAM theory. On our way, we establish non-density properties of Reeb-like flows and a generic non-integrability theorem for cohomologous Hamiltonian structures and volume-preserving fields in dimension three.</description>

      <title>Low-action holomorphic curves and invariant sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14445v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a compactness theorem for sequences of low-action punctured holomorphic curves of controlled topology, in any dimension, without imposing the typical assumption of uniformly bounded Hofer energy. In the limit, we extract a family of closed Reeb-invariant subsets. Then, we prove new structural results for the U-map in ECH and PFH, implying that such sequences exist in abundance in low-dimensional symplectic dynamics. We obtain applications to symplectic dynamics and the geometry of surfaces. First, we prove generalizations to higher genus surfaces and three-manifolds of the celebrated Le Calvez-Yoccoz theorem. Second, we show that for any closed Riemannian or Finsler surface a dense set of points have geodesics passing through them that visit different sections of the surface. Third, we prove a version of Ginzburg-G\"urel's "crossing energy bound" for punctured holomorphic curves, of arbitrary topology, in symplectizations of any dimension.</description>

      <title>A Mathematical Definition of Path Integrals on Symplectic Manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14547v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a mathematical definition of some path integrals, emphasizing those relevant to the quantization of symplectic manifolds (and more generally, Poisson manifolds) $\unicode{x2013}$ in particular, the coherent state path integral. We show that K\"{a}hler manifolds provide many computable examples and we emphasize those whose Bergman kernel is constant along the diagonal.</description>

      <title>Shifted Contact Structures on Differentiable Stacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.17661v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define \emph{$0$-shifted} and \emph{$+1$-shifted contact structures} on differentiable stacks, thus laying the foundations of \emph{shifted Contact Geometry}. As a side result we show that the kernel of a multiplicative $1$-form on a Lie groupoid (might not exist as a Lie groupoid but it) always exists as a differentiable stack, and it is naturally equipped with a stacky version of the curvature of a distribution. Contact structures on orbifolds provide examples of $0$-shifted contact structures, while prequantum bundles over $+1$-shifted symplectic groupoids provide examples of $+1$-shifted contact structures. Our shifted contact structures are related to shifted symplectic structures via a Symplectic-to-Contact Dictionary.</description>
