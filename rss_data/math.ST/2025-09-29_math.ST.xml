      <title>Sliced Space-filling Design with Mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we proposes the construction methods of sliced space-filling design when the quantitative factors are mixture components. Leveraging the representative points framework for distribution and energy distance decomposition theory, this paper proposes three methods for constructing sliced representative points and establishes their distributional convergence. Furthermore, one-shot and sequential algorithms for generating sliced space-filling mixture design for experiments with process variables are presented with convergence proofs. Compared to existing methods, the proposed sliced space-filling mixture design exhibits greater flexibility in subdesign run sizes and broader applicability to constrained experimental regions. Moreover, numerical results confirm its marked advantages in both space-filling performance and predictive accuracy.</description>

      <title>Error Analysis of Discrete Flow with Generator Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discrete flow models offer a powerful framework for learning distributions over discrete state spaces and have demonstrated superior performance compared to the discrete diffusion model. However, their convergence properties and error analysis remain largely unexplored. In this work, we develop a unified framework grounded in stochastic calculus theory to systematically investigate the theoretical properties of discrete flow. Specifically, we derive the KL divergence of two path measures regarding two continuous-time Markov chains (CTMCs) with different transition rates by developing a novel Girsanov-type theorem, and provide a comprehensive analysis that encompasses the error arising from transition rate estimation and early stopping, where the first type of error has rarely been analyzed by existing works. Unlike discrete diffusion models, discrete flow incurs no truncation error caused by truncating the time horizon in the noising process. Building on generator matching and uniformization, we establish non-asymptotic error bounds for distribution estimation. Our results provide the first error analysis for discrete flow models.</description>

      <title>A note on the relation between one-step, outcome regression and IPW-type estimators of parameters with the mixed bias property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22452v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bruns-Smith et al. (2025) established an algebraic identity between the one-step estimator and a specific outcome regression-type estimator for a class of parameters that forms a strict subset of the class introduced in Chernozhukov et al. (2022), assuming both nuisance functions are estimated as linear combinations of given features. They conjectured that this identity extends to the broader mixed bias class introduced in Rotnitzky et al. (2021). In this note, we prove their conjecture and further extend the result to allow one of the nuisance estimators to be non-linear. We also relate these findings to the work of Robins et al. (2007), who established other identities linking one-step estimators to outcome regression-type and IPW-type estimators.</description>

      <title>Differentiable Structure Learning for General Binary Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing methods for differentiable structure learning in discrete data typically assume that the data are generated from specific structural equation models. However, these assumptions may not align with the true data-generating process, which limits the general applicability of such methods. Furthermore, current approaches often ignore the complex dependence structure inherent in discrete data and consider only linear effects. We propose a differentiable structure learning framework that is capable of capturing arbitrary dependencies among discrete variables. We show that although general discrete models are unidentifiable from purely observational data, it is possible to characterize the complete set of compatible parameters and structures. Additionally, we establish identifiability up to Markov equivalence under mild assumptions. We formulate the learning problem as a single differentiable optimization task in the most general form, thereby avoiding the unrealistic simplifications adopted by previous methods. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach effectively captures complex relationships in discrete data.</description>

      <title>Earthquake modelling via Brownian motions on networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a general model for Brownian motions on metric graphs with interactions. In a general setting, for (sticky) Brownian propagations on edges, our model provides a characterization of lifetimes and holding times on vertices in terms of (jumping) Brownian accumulation of energy associated with that vertices. Propagation and accumulation are given by drifted Brownian motions subjected to non-local (also dynamic) boundary conditions. As the continuous (sticky) process approaches a vertex, then the right-continuous process has a restart (resetting), it jumps randomly away from the zero-level of energy. According with this new energy, the continuous process can start (or not) as a new process in a randomly chosen edge. We provide a self-contained presentation with a detailed construction of the model. The model well extends to a higher order of interactions, here we provide a simple case and focus on the analysis of earthquakes. Earthquakes are notoriously difficult to study. They build up over long periods and release energy in seconds. Our goal is to introduce a new model, useful in many contexts and in particular in the difficult attempt to manage seismic risks.</description>

      <title>Sequential 1-bit Mean Estimation with Near-Optimal Sample Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of distributed mean estimation with 1-bit communication constraints. We propose a mean estimator that is based on (randomized and sequentially-chosen) interval queries, whose 1-bit outcome indicates whether the given sample lies in the specified interval. Our estimator is $(\epsilon, \delta)$-PAC for all distributions with bounded mean ($-\lambda \le \mathbb{E}(X) \le \lambda $) and variance ($\mathrm{Var}(X) \le \sigma^2$) for some known parameters $\lambda$ and $\sigma$. We derive a sample complexity bound $\widetilde{O}\big( \frac{\sigma^2}{\epsilon^2}\log\frac{1}{\delta} + \log\frac{\lambda}{\sigma}\big)$, which matches the minimax lower bound for the unquantized setting up to logarithmic factors and the additional $\log\frac{\lambda}{\sigma}$ term that we show to be unavoidable. We also establish an adaptivity gap for interval-query based estimators: the best non-adaptive mean estimator is considerably worse than our adaptive mean estimator for large $\frac{\lambda}{\sigma}$. Finally, we give tightened sample complexity bounds for distributions with stronger tail decay, and present additional variants that (i) handle an unknown sampling budget (ii) adapt to the unknown true variance given (possibly loose) upper and lower bounds on the variance, and (iii) use only two stages of adaptivity at the expense of more complicated (non-interval) queries.</description>

      <title>Learnable Conformal Prediction with Context-Aware Nonconformity Functions for Robotic Planning and Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning models in robotics often output point estimates with poorly calibrated confidences, offering no native mechanism to quantify predictive reliability under novel, noisy, or out-of-distribution inputs. Conformal prediction (CP) addresses this gap by providing distribution-free coverage guarantees, yet its reliance on fixed nonconformity scores ignores context and can yield intervals that are overly conservative or unsafe. We address this with Learnable Conformal Prediction (LCP), which replaces fixed scores with a lightweight neural function that leverages geometric, semantic, and task-specific features to produce context-aware uncertainty sets.
  LCP maintains CP's theoretical guarantees while reducing prediction set sizes by 18% in classification, tightening detection intervals by 52%, and improving path planning safety from 72% to 91% success with minimal overhead. Across three robotic tasks on seven benchmarks, LCP consistently outperforms Standard CP and ensemble baselines. In classification on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet, it achieves smaller set sizes (4.7-9.9% reduction) at target coverage. For object detection on COCO, BDD100K, and Cityscapes, it produces 46-54% tighter bounding boxes. In path planning through cluttered environments, it improves success to 91.5% with only 4.5% path inflation, compared to 12.2% for Standard CP.
  The method is lightweight (approximately 4.8% runtime overhead, 42 KB memory) and supports online adaptation, making it well suited to resource-constrained autonomous systems. Hardware evaluation shows LCP adds less than 1% memory and 15.9% inference overhead, yet sustains 39 FPS on detection tasks while being 7.4 times more energy-efficient than ensembles.</description>

      <title>A Random Matrix Perspective of Echo State Networks: From Precise Bias--Variance Characterization to Optimal Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a rigorous asymptotic analysis of Echo State Networks (ESNs) in a teacher student setting with a linear teacher with oracle weights. Leveraging random matrix theory, we derive closed form expressions for the asymptotic bias, variance, and mean-squared error (MSE) as functions of the input statistics, the oracle vector, and the ridge regularization parameter. The analysis reveals two key departures from classical ridge regression: (i) ESNs do not exhibit double descent, and (ii) ESNs attain lower MSE when both the number of training samples and the teacher memory length are limited. We further provide an explicit formula for the optimal regularization in the identity input covariance case, and propose an efficient numerical scheme to compute the optimum in the general case. Together, these results offer interpretable theory and practical guidelines for tuning ESNs, helping reconcile recent empirical observations with provable performance guarantees</description>

      <title>Direct Bias-Correction Term Estimation for Propensity Scores and Average Treatment Effect Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study considers the estimation of the average treatment effect (ATE). For ATE estimation, we estimate the propensity score through direct bias-correction term estimation. Let $\{(X_i, D_i, Y_i)\}_{i=1}^{n}$ be the observations, where $X_i \in \mathbb{R}^p$ denotes $p$-dimensional covariates, $D_i \in \{0, 1\}$ denotes a binary treatment assignment indicator, and $Y_i \in \mathbb{R}$ is an outcome. In ATE estimation, the bias-correction term $h_0(X_i, D_i) = \frac{1[D_i = 1]}{e_0(X_i)} - \frac{1[D_i = 0]}{1 - e_0(X_i)}$ plays an important role, where $e_0(X_i)$ is the propensity score, the probability of being assigned treatment $1$. In this study, we propose estimating $h_0$ (or equivalently the propensity score $e_0$) by directly minimizing the prediction error of $h_0$. Since the bias-correction term $h_0$ is essential for ATE estimation, this direct approach is expected to improve estimation accuracy for the ATE. For example, existing studies often employ maximum likelihood or covariate balancing to estimate $e_0$, but these approaches may not be optimal for accurately estimating $h_0$ or the ATE. We present a general framework for this direct bias-correction term estimation approach from the perspective of Bregman divergence minimization and conduct simulation studies to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Transfer Learning under Group-Label Shift: A Semiparametric Exponential Tilting Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new framework for binary classification in transfer learning settings where both covariate and label distributions may shift between source and target domains. Unlike traditional covariate shift or label shift assumptions, we introduce a group-label shift assumption that accommodates subpopulation imbalance and mitigates spurious correlations, thereby improving robustness to real-world distributional changes. To model the joint distribution difference, we adopt a flexible exponential tilting formulation and establish mild, verifiable identification conditions via an instrumental variable strategy. We develop a computationally efficient two-step likelihood-based estimation procedure that combines logistic regression for the source outcome model with conditional likelihood estimation using both source and target covariates. We derive consistency and asymptotic normality for the resulting estimators, and extend the theory to receiver operating characteristic curves, the area under the curve, and other target functionals, addressing the nonstandard challenges posed by plug-in classifiers. Simulation studies demonstrate that our method outperforms existing alternatives under subpopulation shift scenarios. A semi-synthetic application using the waterbirds dataset further confirms the proposed method's ability to transfer information effectively and improve target-domain classification accuracy.</description>

      <title>Preventing Model Collapse Under Overparametrization: Optimal Mixing Ratios for Interpolation Learning and Ridge Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Model collapse occurs when generative models degrade after repeatedly training on their own synthetic outputs. We study this effect in overparameterized linear regression in a setting where each iteration mixes fresh real labels with synthetic labels drawn from the model fitted in the previous iteration. We derive precise generalization error formulae for minimum-$\ell_2$-norm interpolation and ridge regression under this iterative scheme. Our analysis reveals intriguing properties of the optimal mixing weight that minimizes long-term prediction error and provably prevents model collapse. For instance, in the case of min-$\ell_2$-norm interpolation, we establish that the optimal real-data proportion converges to the reciprocal of the golden ratio for fairly general classes of covariate distributions. Previously, this property was known only for ordinary least squares, and additionally in low dimensions. For ridge regression, we further analyze two popular model classes -- the random-effects model and the spiked covariance model -- demonstrating how spectral geometry governs optimal weighting. In both cases, as well as for isotropic features, we uncover that the optimal mixing ratio should be at least one-half, reflecting the necessity of favoring real-data over synthetic. We validate our theoretical results with extensive simulations.</description>

      <title>Rescuing double robustness: safe estimation under complete misspecification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Double robustness is a major selling point of semiparametric and missing data methodology. Its virtues lie in protection against partial nuisance misspecification and asymptotic semiparametric efficiency under correct nuisance specification. However, in many applications, complete nuisance misspecification should be regarded as the norm (or at the very least the expected default), and thus doubly robust estimators may behave fragilely. In fact, it has been amply verified empirically that these estimators can perform poorly when all nuisance functions are misspecified. Here, we first characterize this phenomenon of double fragility, and then propose a solution based on adaptive correction clipping (ACC). We argue that our ACC proposal is safe, in that it inherits the favorable properties of doubly robust estimators under correct nuisance specification, but its error is guaranteed to be bounded by a convex combination of the individual nuisance model errors, which prevents the instability caused by the compounding product of errors of doubly robust estimators. We also show that our proposal provides valid inference through the parametric bootstrap when nuisances are well-specified. We showcase the efficacy of our ACC estimator both through extensive simulations and by applying it to the analysis of Alzheimer's disease proteomics data.</description>

      <title>Towards Efficient Online Exploration for Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF), which learns a reward model from human preference data and then optimizes a policy to favor preferred responses, has emerged as a central paradigm for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. In this paper, we investigate exploration principles for online RLHF, where one seeks to adaptively collect new preference data to refine both the reward model and the policy in a data-efficient manner. By examining existing optimism-based exploration algorithms, we identify a drawback in their sampling protocol: they tend to gather comparisons that fail to reduce the most informative uncertainties in reward differences, and we prove lower bounds showing that such methods can incur linear regret over exponentially long horizons. Motivated by this insight, we propose a new exploration scheme that directs preference queries toward reducing uncertainty in reward differences most relevant to policy improvement. Under a multi-armed bandit model of RLHF, we establish regret bounds of order $T^{(\beta+1)/(\beta+2)}$, where $\beta&gt;0$ is a hyperparameter that balances reward maximization against mitigating distribution shift. To our knowledge, this is the first online RLHF algorithm with regret scaling polynomially in all model parameters.</description>

      <title>Interpretation of local false discovery rates under the zero assumption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08792</link>

Abstract: In large-scale studies with parallel signal-plus-noise observations, the local false discovery rate is a summary statistic that is often presumed to be equal to the posterior probability that the signal is null. We prefer to call the latter quantity the local null-signal rate to emphasize our view that a null signal and a false discovery are not identical events. The local null-signal rate is commonly estimated through empirical Bayes procedures that build on the `zero density assumption,' which attributes the density of observations near zero entirely to null signals. In this paper, we argue that this strategy does not furnish estimates of the local null-signal rate, but instead of a quantity we call the complementary local activity rate (clar). Although it is likely to be small, an inactive signal is not necessarily zero. The clar dominates both the local null-signal rate and the local false sign rate and is a weakly continuous functional of the signal distribution. As a consequence, it takes on sensible values when the signal is sparse but not exactly zero. Our findings clarify the interpretation of local false discovery rates estimated under the zero density assumption.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo on a single sample</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17025v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a Monte Carlo simulation method (MinMC) that approximates prices and risk measures for a range $\Gamma$ of model parameters at once. The simulation method that we study has recently gained popularity [HS20, FPP22, BDG24], and we provide a theoretical framework and convergence rates for it. In particular, we show that sample-based approximations to $\mathbb{E}_{\theta}[X]$, where $\theta$ denotes the model and $\mathbb{E}_{\theta}$ the expectation with respect to the distribution $P_\theta$ of the model $\theta$, can be obtained across all $\theta \in \Gamma$ by minimizing a map $V:H\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ with $H$ a suitable function space. The minimization can be achieved easily by fitting a standard feedforward neural network with stochastic gradient descent. We show that MinMC, which uses only one sample for each model, significantly outperforms a traditional Monte Carlo method performed for multiple values of $\theta$, which are subsequently interpolated. Our case study suggests that MinMC might serve as a new benchmark for parameter-dependent Monte Carlo simulations, which appear not only in quantitative finance but also in many other areas of scientific computing.</description>

      <title>The space of positive transition measures on a Markov chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11871v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Information geometry of Markov chains has been studied using the dually flat structure of the space of transition probabilities. Although applications of this structure have been investigated, few attempts have examined its statistical meaning. In this paper, we construct a foundation for investigating the statistical meaning based on Amari's theory of positive measures. For the space of discrete distributions, Amari has introduced the space of positive measures by removing the constraint condition and investigated the extended space by finding the Bregman and $F$-divergence suitably. According to this, we introduce an extension of the space of transition probabilities equipped with suitable $F$-divergence for a given Markov chain. We regard it as the space of positive transition measures on a Markov chain, and study its dually flat structure. This provides new insight into the geometry of Markov chains and may lead to the development of the theory of Markov embeddings.</description>

      <title>A Notion of Uniqueness for the Adversarial Bayes Classifier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16956v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new notion of uniqueness for the adversarial Bayes classifier in the setting of binary classification. Analyzing this concept produces a simple procedure for computing all adversarial Bayes classifiers for a well-motivated family of one dimensional data distributions. This characterization is then leveraged to show that as the perturbation radius increases, certain notions of regularity for the adversarial Bayes classifiers improve. Furthermore, these results provide tools for understanding relationships between the Bayes and adversarial Bayes classifiers in one dimension.</description>

      <title>Partially Functional Dynamic Backdoor Diffusion-based Causal Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00472v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Causal inference in settings involving complex spatio-temporal dependencies, such as environmental epidemiology, is challenging due to the presence of unmeasured confounding. However, a significant gap persists in existing methods: current diffusion-based causal models rely on restrictive assumptions of causal sufficiency or static confounding. To address this limitation, we introduce the Partially Functional Dynamic Backdoor Diffusion-based Causal Model (PFD-BDCM), a generative framework designed to bridge this gap. Our approach uniquely incorporates valid backdoor adjustments into the diffusion sampling mechanism to mitigate bias from unmeasured confounders. Specifically, it captures their intricate dynamics through region-specific structural equations and conditional autoregressive processes, and accommodates multi-resolution variables via functional data techniques. Furthermore, we provide theoretical guarantees by establishing error bounds for counterfactual estimates. Extensive experiments on synthetic data and a real-world air pollution case study confirm that PFD-BDCM outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.</description>
