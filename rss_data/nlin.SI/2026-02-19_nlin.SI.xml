      <title>On the Lie noncommutative integrability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Lie theory of non-commutative integrability is used to reconstruct some integrable systems of ordinary differential equations in three dimensional Eucledian space. The Darboux-Brioschi-Halphen system is an example of the Lie integrable system associated with the simple Lie algebra sl(2,R). Other examples are related with solvable three dimensional real Lie algebras of Bianchi B class.</description>

      <title>Piecewise integrability of the discrete Hasimoto map for analytic prediction and design of helical peptides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The representation of protein backbone geometry through the discrete nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation provides a theoretical connection between biological structure and integrable systems. Although the global application of this framework is constrained by chiral degeneracies and non-local interactions we propose that helical peptides can be effectively modeled as piecewise integrable systems in which the discrete Hasimoto map remains applicable within specific geometric boundaries. We delineate these boundaries through an analytic characterization of the mapping between biochemical dihedral angles and Frenet frame parameters for a dataset of 50 helical peptide chains. We demonstrate that the transformation is information-preserving globally but ill-conditioned within the helical basin characterized by a median Jacobian condition number of 31 which suggests that the loss of chiral information arises primarily from local coordinate compression rather than topological singularities. We define a local integrability error $E[n]$ derived from the discrete dispersion relation to show that deviations from integrability are driven predominantly by torsion non-uniformity while curvature remains structurally rigid. This metric identifies integrable islands where the analytic dispersion relation predicts backbone coordinates with sub-angstrom accuracy yielding a median root-mean-square deviation of 0.77\,\AA\ and enables a segmentation strategy that isolates structural defects. We further indicate that the inverse design of peptide backbones is feasible within a quantitatively defined integrability zone where the design constraint reduces essentially to the control of torsion uniformity. These findings advance the Hasimoto formalism from a qualitative descriptor toward a precise quantitative framework for analyzing and designing local protein geometry within the limits of piecewise integrability.</description>

      <title>A Modified Center-of-Mass Conservation Law in Finite-Domain Simulations of the Zakharov--Kuznetsov Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15573v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate conservation laws of the two-dimensional Zakharov--Kuznetsov (ZK) equation, a natural higher-dimensional and non-integrable extension of the Korteweg--de Vries equation. The ZK equation admits three scalar conserved quantities -- mass, momentum, and energy -- represented as $I_1$, $I_2$, and $I_3$, as well as a vector-valued quantity $\bm{I}_4$. In high-accuracy numerical simulations on a finite double-periodic domain, most of these quantities are well preserved, while a systematic temporal drift is observed only in the $x$-component $I_{4x}$. We show that the nontrivial evolution of $I_{4x}$ originates from an explicit boundary-flux contribution, which is induced by fluctuations of the solution and its spatial derivatives at the domain boundaries. We successfully identify the source of the inaccuracy in the numerical solutions. Motivated by this analysis, we define a modified center-of-mass quantity $I_{4x}^{\mathrm{mod}}$ and demonstrate its conservation numerically for single-pulse configurations. The modified quantity thus provides a consistent conservation law for the ZK equation and yields an appropriate description of center-of-mass motion in finite-domain numerical simulations.</description>
