      <title>Routing functions for parameter space decomposition to describe stability landscapes of ecological models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Changes in environmental or system parameters often drive major biological transitions, including ecosystem collapse, disease outbreaks, and tumor development. Analyzing the stability of steady states in dynamical systems provides critical insight into these transitions. This paper introduces an algebraic framework for analyzing the stability landscapes of ecological models defined by systems of first-order autonomous ordinary differential equations with polynomial or rational rate functions. Using tools from real algebraic geometry, we characterize parameter regions associated with steady-state feasibility and stability via three key boundaries: singular, stability (Routh-Hurwitz), and coordinate boundaries. With these boundaries in mind, we employ routing functions to compute the connected components of parameter space in which the number and type of stable steady states remain constant, revealing the stability landscape of these ecological models. As case studies, we revisit the classical Levins-Culver competition-colonization model and a recent model of coral-bacteria symbioses. In the latter, our method uncovers complex stability regimes, including regions supporting limit cycles, that are inaccessible via traditional techniques. These results demonstrate the potential of our approach to inform ecological theory and intervention strategies in systems with nonlinear interactions and multiple stable states.</description>

      <title>Predatory dynamics in susceptible and resistant $\textit{Eriopis connexa}$ populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ladybird $\textit{Eriopis connexa}$ (Germar, 1824), a voracious aphid predator, faces challenges from insecticide applications, compromising biological control. As a result, there has been an increase in the number of studies analysing the resistance and susceptibility of ladybirds. Some studies have found that resistant populations exhibit distinct predation and foraging behaviour compared to susceptible ones. This study models the population dynamics of resistant and susceptible $\textit{E. connexa}$ preying on $\textit{Aphis gossypii}$ Glover, 1877 and $\textit{Myzus persicae}$ (Sulzer, 1776). We constructed a logistic model with density dependence and type-II functional response to analyse predation dynamics, incorporating bifurcation analysis on predation parameters (attack rate and handling time) and the mortality rate of susceptible ladybirds. We simulated scenarios with/without insecticide application and with/without aphid resistance. To simulate the effects of insecticide applications, the parameters related to aphids' intrinsic growth rate ($r_1$ and $r_2$) change to reflect the responses of susceptible and resistant populations. The same approach is used concerning the mortality rate of ladybirds ($d_2$ and $d_3$). Our results demonstrate that mortality, attack rate, and handling time are critical in shaping predator-prey interactions. Temporal simulations revealed fluctuating abundances, highlighting the fragility of these interactions under insecticide stress. Therefore, this study contributes to understanding the ecological implications of insecticides, which disrupt natural predation dynamics, and shows how variations in behavioural rates can impact prey control. This research demonstrated the importance of integrated strategies that balance insecticide applications with preserving natural enemies and promoting sustainable agricultural practices.</description>

      <title>A stochastic epidemic model with memory of the last infection and waning immunity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We adapt the article of Forien, Pang, Pardoux and Zotsa: Arxiv preprint Arxiv2210.04667(2022), on epidemic models with varying infectivity and waning immunity, to incorporate the memory of the last infection. To this end, we introduce a parametric approach and consider a piecewise deterministic Markov process modeling both the evolution of the parameter, also called the trait, and the age of infection of individuals over time. At each new infection, a new trait is randomly chosen for the infected individual according to a Markov kernel, and their age is reset to zero. In the large population limit, we derive a partial differential equation (PDE) that describes the density of traits and ages. The main goal is to study the conditions under which endemic equilibria exist for the deterministic PDE model and to establish an endemicity threshold that depends on the model parameters. The local stability of these equilibria is also analyzed. The endemicity threshold is computed for several examples, including models that incorporate a vaccination policy, and a local stability result is obtained for a memory-free SIS-type model.</description>
