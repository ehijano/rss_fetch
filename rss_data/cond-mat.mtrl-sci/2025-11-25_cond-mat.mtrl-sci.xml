      <title>When Active Learning Fails, Uncalibrated Out of Distribution Uncertainty Quantification Might Be the Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficiently and meaningfully estimating prediction uncertainty is important for exploration in active learning campaigns in materials discovery, where samples with high uncertainty are interpreted as containing information missing from the model. In this work, the effect of different uncertainty estimation and calibration methods are evaluated for active learning when using ensembles of ALIGNN, eXtreme Gradient Boost, Random Forest, and Neural Network model architectures. We compare uncertainty estimates from ALIGNN deep ensembles to loss landscape uncertainty estimates obtained for solubility, bandgap, and formation energy prediction tasks. We then evaluate how the quality of the uncertainty estimate impacts an active learning campaign that seeks model generalization to out-of-distribution data. Uncertainty calibration methods were found to variably generalize from in-domain data to out-of-domain data. Furthermore, calibrated uncertainties were generally unsuccessful in reducing the amount of data required by a model to improve during an active learning campaign on out-of-distribution data when compared to random sampling and uncalibrated uncertainties. The impact of poor-quality uncertainty persists for random forest and eXtreme Gradient Boosting models trained on the same data for the same tasks, indicating that this is at least partially intrinsic to the data and not due to model capacity alone. Analysis of the target, in-distribution uncertainty, out-of-distribution uncertainty, and training residual distributions suggest that future work focus on understanding empirical uncertainties in the feature input space for cases where ensemble prediction variances do not accurately capture the missing information required for the model to generalize.</description>

      <title>Appraising the absolute limits of nanotubes and nanospheres to preserve high-pressure materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Matter under high pressure often exhibits attractive properties, which, unfortunately, are typically irretrievable when released to ambient conditions. Intuitively, nanostructure engineering might provide a promising route to contain high-pressure phase of materials because of the exceptional mechanical strength at nanoscale. However, there is no available theoretical model that can analyze this possibility, not to mention to quantitatively evaluate the pressure-bearing capability of nano-cavities. Here, a physical model is proposed to appraise the absolute theoretical limit of various nanotubes/nanospheres to preserve high-pressure materials to ambient conditions. By incorporating with first-principles calculations, we screen and select four types of representative nanomaterials: graphene, hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), biphenylene, and {\gamma}-graphyne, and perform systematic investigations. The results indicate that nanotube/nanosphere of graphene exhibits the best pressure-bearing capability, followed by h-BN, biphenylene and {\gamma}-graphyne. Our model reveals that the structure with the largest average binding energy per bond and the highest density of bonds will have the highest absolute limit to contain pressure materials, while electron/hole doping and interlayer interactions have minor effects. Our finding suggests that one can utilize nanotube/nanosphere with multiple layers to retrieve compressed material with higher pressures. For example, a single layer graphene sphere can retrieve compressed LaH10 with a volume size of 26 nm3 that corresponding to a pressure of 170 GPa and with a near room temperature superconductor transition of Tc=250 K. Similarly, in order to retrieve the metastable atomic hydrogen or molecular metallic hydrogen at about 250 GPa, it requires only three layers of a nanosphere to contain a volume size of 173 nm^3.</description>

      <title>Hexagonal polymorphism induced structural disorder and dielectric anomalies of Ca/Mn modified BaTiO3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work involves the local structural investigation of the samples using Extended X-ray Absorption Spectra (EXAFS) analysis to investigate structural changes due to the Ca and Mn-modified BaTiO3. TEM investigation of the crystal structure reveals the coexistence of the tetragonal and hexagonal phases of BaTiO3. Band gap modification and Urbach tail variation in UV-DRS measurements reveal a reduction of band gap from UV to Visible range (3.2 eV to 2 eV). This band gap change is correlated with the valence band modification observed in PES measurements due to localised defects in the material, and supported by theoretical Density of States calculations. The electron localisation function calculation is used to analyse the changes in the localised electron density near the dopant atoms. It reveals the local expansion and contraction of the lattice surrounding the dopant atom. All these structural modifications lead to variations in the dielectric properties and diffusive nature of the phase transition. The defect-induced structural modifications, multiple phase coexistence, band gap variations and dielectric properties are explored and correlated.</description>

      <title>2D-RIXS: Resonant inelastic x-ray scattering microscopy with high energy and spatial resolutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A two-dimensional resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (2D-RIXS) microscopy system has been developed at the beamline BL02U of NanoTerasu. The instrument combines a Wolter type-I mirror for spatial imaging with a varied-line-spacing grating spectrometer, simultaneously achieving micrometer-scale spatial resolution and ultrahigh energy resolution in the soft x-ray regime. Test chart measurements confirm a vertical spatial resolution of 1.0 um near the field-of-view center, and the horizontal resolution determined by the incident beam footprint is 0.8 um. RIXS imaging capabilities have been demonstrated by the measurements of a patterned NanoTerasu logo and exfoliated NiPS${}_3$ nanoflakes, highlighting its efficiency in locating specific microscale regions within inhomogeneous samples. These results establish 2D-RIXS microscopy as a position-sensitive probe of elementary excitations in quantum materials and functional devices.</description>

      <title>Density functional theory for core-level X-ray absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a rigorous density functional theory (DFT) framework for core-level X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) by formulating a constrained search for core-excited states based on the Gunnarsson-Lundqvist theorem. Within this framework, the explicit-core Delta SCF scheme enables shift-free absolute edge alignment and a consistent treatment of L/M edges with spin-orbit-resolved projectors. In addition, by exploiting dipole selection rules, we recast the evaluation of the dipole matrix elements, which otherwise requires many independent Slater determinant calculations, into a compact single determinant form. This reduces the computational scaling from $\mathcal{O}(N^4)$ to $\mathcal{O}(N^3)$, where $N$ is the number of electrons, without introducing additional approximations. Across representative C, B, O, and Li K-edge benchmarks in molecules and solids, the method reproduces line shapes, polarization anisotropies, and absolute onsets without empirical shifts, providing a robust and scalable route to quantitatively reliable XAS simulations within DFT.</description>

      <title>PyAPX: Python toolkit for atomic configuration pattern exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In materials discovery, the integration of first-principles calculations with machine learning techniques has been actively studied for two key tasks: crystal structure prediction, which searches for stable structures given a chemical composition, and elemental substitution, which explores chemical compositions that yield desirable properties in a given crystal structure. However, even when both the crystal structure and chemical composition are fixed, material properties can still vary depending on the atomic arrangements (configurations) at crystallographic sites. To support detailed material design, we present PyAPX, a Python toolkit that performs Bayesian searches of stable atomic configurations. A distinctive feature of this initial release is the introduction of encoding methods suitable for configuration search, and we evaluate their performance using the h-BCN system. As a result, they were confirmed to yield superior convergence compared to commonly used one-hot encoding. PyAPX is broadly applicable to crystalline materials and is expected to further advance materials discovery.</description>

      <title>Hydrogen diffusion in TiCr$_2$H$_x$ Laves phases: A combined ab initio and machine-learning-potential study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The kinetics of hydrogen diffusion in C15 cubic and C14 hexagonal TiCr$_2$H$_x$ (0 &lt; $x$ &lt;= 4) Laves-phase hydrogen storage alloys is investigated with density functional theory (DFT) and machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs). Generalized solid-state nudged elastic band calculations are conducted based on DFT for all symmetrically inequivalent paths between the first-nearest-neighbor face-sharing interstitial sites. The hydrogen migration barriers are substantially higher for the paths that require breaking a Ti-H bond than for those that require breaking a Cr-H bond. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with the MLIPs also demonstrate that hydrogen migration occurs more frequently within the hexagonal rings made of the A$_2$B$_2$ interstitial paths, each requiring the breaking of Cr-H bonds, than along the inter-ring paths. The diffusion coefficients of hydrogen obtained from the MD simulations reveal a non-monotonic dependence on hydrogen concentration, which is more pronounced at lower temperatures. Time-averaged radial distribution functions of hydrogen further show that hydrogen avoids face-sharing positions during diffusion and that the hydrogen occupancy at the second-nearest-neighbor edge-sharing positions increases with increasing hydrogen concentration. The diffusion coefficients of hydrogen within 400-1000 K follow an Arrhenius relationship, with activation barriers consistent with most experimental values. One-order of magnitude overestimation of diffusion coefficients compared with some experiments suggests a substantial impact of hydrogen trapping by defects such as Cr vacancies and Ti anti-sites in non-stoichiometric TiCr$_2$ in experiments.</description>

      <title>Tuning Breakdown-to-Coercive Field Ratio in Ultra-Thin Al1-xScxN Films via Reactive Nitrogen Atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Al1-xScxN has attracted significant interest due to its large remnant polarization and low processing temperature when compared to other ferroelectric material systems. However, device dielectric failure before ferroelectric switching remains a critical limitation for AlScN-based memory devices. With the continuing trend toward device miniaturization, expanding the operating window is essential for next-generation memory development. In this work, we optimized the breakdown field (EBD) and coercive field (EC) in ultra-thin Al1-xScxN films by controlling defect density via adjustment of nitrogen gas flow during sputter deposition. The characteristic breakdown field, EBD, was evaluated using Weibull statistics, yielding optimal characteristic breakdown fields of 12.47 MV/cm (EBD+) and -12.63 MV/cm (EBD-) for samples deposited under 27.5 sccm N2 flow. The minimum EC was achieved at a nitrogen flow of 25 sccm and increased for higher gas flows, a trend that is opposite to previous reports in much thicker films. The highest EBD over EC ratio of 2.25 occurred at 27.5 sccm, effectively expanding the operational window. Using a combination of X-ray diffraction and photoluminescence spectroscopy to study changes in crystal orientation and defects, device performance can be tuned by controlling the point defect concentration in the ultra-thin film via adjusting the sputtering N2 process gas flow rate.</description>

      <title>Comparison of the Electronic Structures of V$X_3$ ($X$ = Br, and I) using High-resolution X-ray Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transition-metal halides V$X_3$ ($X$ = Br and I) have emerged as promising candidates for two dimensional spintronic and quantum applications due to their layer-dependent magnetism and tunable electronic states. However, experimental insights into their ground state electronic structures remain limited. Here, we present a comprehensive investigation of V$X_3$ using high resolution resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) combined with ligand field multiplet calculations. The RIXS spectra reveal distinct $dd$ and charge-transfer excitations, allowing precise determination of electronic structure parameters, including the crystal field splitting, trigonal distortion, and Racah parameters. The determined parameters showed clear variation, indicating an increase in covalency from Br to I. The trigonal distortion parameters $\Delta_{D_{3d}}$ were determined to be -0.096 eV in VBr$_3$ and 0.07 eV in VI$_3$, indicating a sign opposition between the two compounds, reflecting good agreement with experimental RIXS data. Cluster model calculations yield a high-spin V$^{3+}$ $(S = 1)$ configuration, with an $e'^2_g$ ground state in VBr$_3$ and an $e'^1_ga^1_{1g}$ ground state in VI$_3$, consistent with trigonal elongation and compression, respectively. Our findings provide the most complete experimental determination of the low energy electronic structure in V$X_3$, offering valuable insights for designing 2D magnetic and spintronic materials based on vanadium halides.</description>

      <title>Engineering the Magnetocaloric Effect in Nd$T_4$B</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of the magnetocaloric effect (MCE) in the Nd$T_4$B system where $T$ = Fe, Co, and Ni. These compounds are ferromagnetic kagome materials with tunable ordering temperatures, transition width, and magnetic moments depending on the choice of transition metal. Thus, they are good candidates for investigating the MCE. We characterize the MCE using standard metrics and construct ternary phase diagrams as functions of Fe, Co, and Ni concentrations. Using these phase diagrams, we engineer the composition NdFe$_{1.15}$Co$_{0.46}$Ni$_{2.39}$B to maximize the MCE. Interestingly, the Nd$T_4$B system shows a notable entropy change over a wide temperature range ($\sim$10 to 650 K), and particular compositions have notable MCEs spanning hundreds of Kelvin, making this a suitable system to study for technologies used in a wide range of temperatures. In a few cases, we observe a two-peak MCE. These two transitions, releasing comparable entropy, provide an interesting platform to study for applications in multi-stage cooling.</description>

      <title>Terahertz oscillation of $180^{\circ}$ domain walls in ferroelectric membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fundamentally intriguing yet not well understood topic in the field of ferroelectrics is the collective excitation of domain walls (DWs), with potential applications to DW-based nanoelectronic and optoelectronic devices. Here we use dynamical phase-field simulations to identify the collective modes of an Ising-type $180^{\circ}$ DW in a uniaxially strained BaTiO3 membrane. The membrane concurrently functions as a cavity for polarization and acoustic waves and permits cavity-enhanced resonant excitation of polarization waves. The simulation reveals an unconventional DW sliding mode that exhibits a depolarization-field-driven nonzero resonant frequency and a dynamically changing internal structure during sliding. These features differ from the previously reported DW sliding modes that have a zero resonant frequency or a rigid internal structure. An analytical model is developed to quantitatively understand the origin of this new DW mode and predict the effect of strain on the mode frequency. The analytically predicted strain dependence of the frequencies of the unconventional DW sliding mode and the DW breathing mode, both in the terahertz regime, is further validated by dynamical phase-field simulations. These results provide new insights into the high-frequency dynamics of ferroelectric DWs and suggest opportunities for realizing on-demand control of phonon-DW resonance by strain, and more broadly, discovering and controlling unconventional DW modes in conventional domain patterns, with applications to reconfigurable THz and optical devices.</description>

      <title>Possibilities of the X-ray Diffraction Data Processing Method for Detecting Reflections with Intensity Below the Background Noise Component</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The values of the signal-to-noise ratio are determined, at which the method of processing X-ray diffraction data reveals reflections with intensity less than the noise component of the background. The possibilities of the method are demonstrated on weak reflections of $\alpha$-quartz. The method of processing X-ray diffraction data makes it possible to increase the possibilities of X-ray phase analysis in determining the qualitative phase composition of multiphase materials with a small (down to $0.1$ wt. \%) content of several (up to eight) phases.</description>

      <title>Predicting the Thermal Behavior of Semiconductor Defects with Equivariant Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The presence of defects strongly influences semiconductor behavior. However, predicting the electronic properties of defective materials at finite temperatures remains computationally expensive even with density functional theory due to the large number of atoms in the simulation cell and the multitude of thermally accessible configurations. Here, we present a neural network-based framework to investigate the electronic properties of defective semiconductors at finite temperatures efficiently. We develop an active learning approach that integrates two advanced equivariant graph neural networks: MACE for atomic energies and forces and DeepH-E3 for the electronic Hamiltonian. Focusing on representative point defects in GaAs, we demonstrate computational accuracy comparable to density functional theory at a fraction of the computational cost, predicting the temperature-dependent band gap of defective GaAs directly from larger scale molecular dynamics trajectories with an accuracy of few tens of meV. Our results highlight the potential of equivariant neural networks for accurate atomic-scale predictions in complex, dynamically evolving materials.</description>

Abstract: Charge to spin (orbital) momentum conversion phenomena enclose great potential for advancing applications in spin/orbitronics. Although current-induced magnetic moment accumulation is crucial both for fundamental understanding and practical applications, direct quantifications are scarce. Optical polarization measurements, namely magneto-optical Kerr rotation (MOKE) ($\theta_K$), have been used to get direct evidence of magnetic accumulation perpendicular to a current flow density ($J$) in late transition metals (Pt) as well as in light transition elements (Ti, Cr), and used to conclude evidence of spin or orbital momentum accumulation. However, discrepancies of the reported $\theta_K/J$ values, exceeding one order of magnitude, together with early claims that conventional MOKE experiments were not a suitable tool, is prompting revisions of methods and results. Here, we report on a new methodology for MOKE measurements that solves known bottlenecks. We obtain a sensitivity of $(354 \pm 27)$ nV/nrad and use the designed protocol to measure $|\theta_K^S/J| = (7.92 \pm 1.94)$ nrad/$(10^7$ A/cm$^2)$ and $|\theta_K^P/J| = (6.89 \pm 1.74)$ nrad/$(10^7$ A/cm$^2)$ in a 50 nm thick Pt bar for S and P polarized incident light, respectively.The extracted value of $|\theta_K^S/J|$ is significantly smaller, about a 7-fold reduction, than previous results on a nominally identical device. Given that differences in the microstructure of Pt films cannot account for such large discrepancy, this implies that experimental procedures and models should be revised accordingly.</description>

      <title>High-throughput computation of electric polarization in solids via Berry flux diagonalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electric polarization in the absence of an externally applied electric field is a key property of polar materials, but the standard interpolation-based ab initio approach to compute polarization differences within the modern theory of polarization presents challenges for automated high-throughput calculations. Berry flux diagonalization [J. Bonini et. al, Phys. Rev. B 102, 045141 (2020)] has been proposed as an efficient and reliable alternative, though it has yet to be widely deployed. Here, we assess Berry flux diagonalization using ab initio calculations of a large set of materials, introducing and validating heuristics that ensure branch alignment with a minimal number of intermediate interpolated structures. Our automated implementation of Berry flux diagonalization succeeds in cases where prior interpolation-based workflows fail due to band-gap closures or branch ambiguities. Benchmarking with ab initio calculations of 176 candidate ferroelectrics, we demonstrate the efficacy of the approach on a broad range of insulating materials and obtain accurate effective polarization values with fewer interpolated structures than prior automated interpolation-based workflows. Our real-space heuristics that can predict gauge stability a priori from ionic displacements enable a general automated framework for reliable polarization calculations and efficient high-throughput screening of chemically and structurally diverse polar insulators. These results establish Berry flux diagonalization as a robust and efficient method to compute the effective polarization of solids and to accelerate the data-driven discovery of functional polar materials.</description>

      <title>Quantized Polarization Redefines Polar Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In crystalline solids, the electronic polarization follows the \emph{generalized Neumann's principle}, under which all crystallographic point groups can, in principle, support ferroelectric polarization. However, in high-symmetry structures, polarization is constrained by symmetry operations and becomes quantized into discrete values. We demonstrate that this quantized polarization (QP) is not a mathematical artifact but a \emph{symmetry-protected invariant} that encodes intrinsic information about a material's symmetry and electronic structure. Because of its discrete and non-continuous nature, when two materials with different QPs form an interface, their bulk polarization states cannot be connected adiabatically, compelling the system to develop pronounced interfacial responses: such as metallic states, bound charges, or strong lattice distortions. This theoretical framework provides a unified reinterpretation of classical systems such as the LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ interface, revealing it as a prototypical case of QP mismatch. By establishing QP as a fundamental bulk invariant, our work uncovers a universal mechanism governing interfacial electronic phenomena and opens new pathways for the design of functional quantum materials through engineered polarization mismatch.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: WSe2 p-MOSFETs with Nb-doped WS2 contacts formed using atomic layer deposition are demonstrated. The devices are fabricated using a technique that aligns the contact metallization with the Nb-doped WS2 contacts using a selective oxidation process. Devices with source/drain spacing of 0.15 um have on-state current of 103 uA/um at VDS = -1 V at a channel carrier concentration of ~ 7.5 x 1012 cm-2. The results provide a promising CMOS-compatible pathway to create low-resistance contacts to 2D-channel transistors.</description>

      <title>Detecting Linear Dichroism with Atomic Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray linear dichroism has been pivotal for probing electronic anisotropies, but its inherent limited spatial resolution precludes atomic-scale investigations of orbital polarization. Here we introduce a versatile electron linear dichroism methodology in scanning transmission electron microscopy that overcomes these constraints. By exploiting momentum-transfer-dependent electron energy-loss spectroscopy with an atomic-sized probe, we directly visualize orbital occupation at individual atomic columns in real space. Using strained La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 thin films as a model system, we resolve the Mn-3d eg orbital polarization with sub-angstrom precision. We show that compressive strain stabilizes 3z2-r2 occupation while tensile strain favors x2-y2. These results validate our approach against established X-ray measurements while achieving the ultimate single atomic-column sensitivity. We further demonstrate two optimized signal extraction protocols that adapt to experimental constraints without compromising sensitivity. This generalizable platform opens unprecedented opportunities to study symmetry-breaking phenomena at individual defects, interfaces, and in quantum materials where atomic-scale electronic anisotropy governs emergent functionality.</description>

      <title>Observation of Dicke cooperativity between strongly coupled phonons and crystal-field excitations in a rare-earth orthoferrite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collective interactions between localized electronic excitations and the crystal lattice are central to many emergent phenomena in materials, including ferroelectricity and quantum magnetism. Despite its importance, the scaling behavior of such cooperativity remains largely unexplored. Here, we report the direct observation of Dicke-type cooperativity arising from the coupled phonons and non-degenerate crystal-field transitions (CFE), namely a pseudo-Jahn-Teller effect1, in the rare-earth orthoferrite, ErFeO3. Using magneto-Raman spectroscopy, we uncover strongly coupled spin, lattice, and orbital excitations. By varying the temperature, we identify the phonon-CFE coupling strength scales as sqrt(N), where N represents the effective ground-state population, which is a hallmark of Dicke cooperativity. Our findings verified the cooperative nature of the interaction between local Jahn-Teller ions and long-range phonons, offering a pathway for tailoring electronic and vibrational properties of materials through population control.</description>

      <title>Device-Scale Atomistic Simulations of Heat Transport in Advanced Field-Effect Transistors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18915v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-heating in next-generation, high-power-density field-effect transistor limits performance and complicates fabrication. Here, we introduce NEP-FET, a machine-learned framework for device-scale heat transport simulations of field-effect transistors. Built upon the neuroevolution potential, the model extends a subset of the OMat24 dataset through an active-learning workflow to generate a chemically diverse, interface-rich reference set. Coupled with the FETMOD structure generator module, NEP-FET can simulate realistic field-effect transistor geometries at sub-micrometer scales containing millions of atoms, and delivers atomistic predictions of temperature fields, per-atom heat flux, and thermal stress in device structures with high fidelity. This framework enables rapid estimation of device-level metrics, including heat-flux density and effective thermal conductivity. Our results reveal pronounced differences in temperature distribution between fin-type and gate-all-around transistor architectures. The framework closes a key gap in multiscale device modeling by combining near-quantum-mechanical accuracy with device-scale throughput, providing a systematic route to explore heat transport and thermo-mechanical coupling in advanced transistors.</description>

      <title>Al$_{1-x}$Hf$_{x}$N Thin Films with Enhanced Piezoelectric Responses for GHz Surface Acoustic Wave Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ternary compounds obtained by alloying wurtzite AlN with transition metals have emerged as promising materials with significantly enhanced piezoelectric characteristics relative to binary AlN. The increased electromechanical coupling in these compounds boosts the performance of high-frequency acoustic devices. So far, progress has largely focused on Al$_{1-x}$Sc$_x$N, which is costly and poorly compatible with complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technologies. Here, we investigate aluminum hafnium nitride (Al$_{1-x}$Hf$_{x}$N) as a scalable and potentially CMOS-compatible alternative to Al$_{1-x}$Sc$_x$N. Using reactive co-sputtering on both Si and sapphire substrates, we demonstrate wurtzite Al$_{1-x}$Hf$_{x}$N thin films ($x \leq 0.17$) with strong $c$-axis texture and nearly isotropic lattice expansion upon Hf incorporation. X-ray absorption spectroscopy indicates cross-gap hybridization between N 2$p$ and Hf 5$d$ states, which can enhance the Born effective charge and, thereby, the piezoelectric response. Correspondingly, we observe a nearly two-fold enhancement in the piezoelectric coefficient, $d_{33}$, relative to AlN, despite increasing structural disorder in Al$_{1-x}$Hf$_{x}$N. Building on this finding, we demonstrate Al$_{1-x}$Hf$_{x}$N GHz surface acoustic wave (SAW) resonators that exhibit enhanced performance, as well as efficient excitation of bulk acoustic waves with low propagation losses. These results establish Al$_{1-x}$Hf$_{x}$N as a promising platform for next-generation high-frequency electromechanical devices, with prospects for further piezoelectric enhancements through improved epitaxy.</description>

      <title>Growth driven phase transitions in Zinc Oxide nanoparticles through machine-learning assisted simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the formation of zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles, a material of significant technological interest with complex structural properties, through atom-by-atom deposition modeling a process common in bottom-up synthesis. Our findings demonstrate that, although the body-centered tetragonal (BCT) structure is thermodynamically stable at equilibrium for small particle sizes, the deposition process induces a crystal-to-crystal phase transition into the more stable wurtzite (WRZ) phase. This transformation is facilitated by a specific redistribution of the nanoparticle ions, which effectively compensates the emerging polar facets at the moment of transition. These insights offer a deeper understanding of oxide nanoparticle formation, which should ultimately help the design of materials with targeted structural features.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tunable control of polar landscape in ferroelectrics is crucial for exploring new functionalities in nanoelectronics and materials science. While ferroelectric epitaxial thin films have been studied as transferred membranes on flexible substrates, the degree of control over membrane curvature and local polarization remains limited, being tied to spontaneous fold patterns or uniaxial mechanical deformations. To address this challenge, we introduce a versatile, high-precision optical method for engineering the bending and associated polarization landscapes in ferroelectric membranes. Our approach, based on a photosensitive polymer-assisted patterning technique, enables the creation of on-demand bending strain patterns at the micrometer scale. We demonstrate deterministic 90{\deg} and 180{\deg} polarization rotations in a ferroelectric BaTiO3 membrane, driven by in-plane strain and flexoelectric effects associated with strain gradients respectively. Such a patterning method is compatible with any oxide membrane, providing a versatile platform for studying strain dependent domain architectures, designing custom ferroelectric landscapes, and investigating flexoelectric behavior with unprecedented control capabilities.</description>

      <title>Fostering Innovation: Streamlining Magnetocaloric Materials Research by Digitalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Refrigeration based on the magnetocaloric effect (MCE) can contribute to energysaving, environmentally friendly cooling in private households, or industrial application. The cooling is based on the reversible heat release or uptake during a phase-transformation of the materials that can be controlled by a magnetic field. This process could replace conventional compression-based refrigeration, which often relies on environmentally harmful refrigerants. Here we show, how to digitalize the process chain for the synthesis, theoretical and experimental characterization, and prototypical application of magnetocaloric alloy. Different Heusler alloys are examined experimentally as model systems for potential application in magnetic cooling. OTTR templates are used for the acquisition and semantic representation of knowledge in the development of an ontology. The ontology, when combined with unstructured data, can be exploited to train a model that can then be used to predict missing facts, which can help to gain new insights and to generate new hypotheses. Furthermore, tools are developed that automate data acquisition into ontological structures and workflows are implemented that provide an easy-to-use theoretical and experimental evaluation of the MCE from first principles and raw data.</description>

      <title>A Combined Theoretical and Experimental Study of Oxygen Vacancies in Co$_3$O$_4$ for Liquid-Phase Oxidation Catalysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work, we investigate oxygen vacancies (V$_\mathrm{O}$) in Co$_3$O$_4$, both in the bulk phase and under liquid-phase ethylene glycol oxidation, by combining theoretical and experimental techniques. Density functional theory calculations for bulk Co$_3$O$_4$ show that introducing an oxygen vacancy reduces two adjacent Co$^{3+}$ ions to Co$^{2+}$ and narrows the band gap. The newly formed Co$^{2+}$ ions adopt high-spin configurations in distorted octahedral sites and remain stable in this state in ab initio molecular dynamics simulations at $300$ K. Computed O and Co K-edge X-ray absorption spectra for ideal and vacancy-containing Co$_3$O$_4$ show excellent agreement with the experimental data and serve as references to analyze the liquid-phase ethylene glycol oxidation. The comparison with experimental O K-edge spectra of fresh and post-reaction catalysts shows that fresh samples resemble the vacancy-containing reference, whereas post-reaction spectra shift toward the ideal reference. These results suggest that under liquid-phase ethylene glycol oxidation conditions, Co$_3$O$_4$ becomes more oxidized rather than reduced, by refilling preexisting oxygen vacancies. This is further supported by the observation that higher O$_2$ pressures increase the conversion and that the catalyst remains stable and active over several cycles.</description>

      <title>Atomistic Origin of Photoluminescence Quenching in Colloidal MoS2 and WS2 Nanoplatelets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large chemical tunability and strong light-matter interactions make colloidal transi- tion metal dichalcogenide (TMD) nanostructures particularly suitable for light-emitting applications. However, ultrafast exciton decay and quenched photoluminescence (PL) limit their potential. Combining femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy with first-principles calculations on MoS2 and WS2 nanoplatelets, we reveal that the observed sub-picosecond exciton decay originates from edge-located optically bright hole traps. These intrinsic trap states stem from the metal d-orbitals and persist even when the sulfur-terminated edges are hydrogen-passivated. Notably, WS2 nanostructures show more localized and optically active edge states than their MoS2 counterparts, and zigzag edges exhibit a higher trap density than armchair edges. The nanoplatelet size dictates the competition between ultrafast edge-trapping and slower core-exciton recombina- tion, and the states responsible for exciton quenching enhance catalytic activity. Our work represents an important step forward in understanding exciton quenching in TMD nanoplatelets and stimulates additional research to refine physicochemical protocols for enhanced PL.</description>

      <title>Observation of a phonon bottleneck effect on the thermal depopulation from a photoexcited shallow defect in silicon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the observation of a phonon bottleneck effect impacting the thermal depopulation of photoexcited shallow defects in high-resistivity silicon. Using time-resolved terahertz (THz) spectroscopy, near-band-gap excitation produces a pronounced temporal delay in photoconductivity, indicating that a fraction of photogenerated charge carriers is temporarily trapped immediately after excitation. By analyzing the frequency-resolved complex photoconductivity as a function of pump-probe delay and photon energy, we attribute this delay to the presence of a localized shallow state situated approximately 40 meV from the band edge, which competes with silicon's indirect band-to-band absorption. The zero-order kinetic profile of the temporal delay, its invariance with respect to photon flux, and its temperature dependence collectively support the existence of a phonon bottleneck that hinders the thermal release of electrons from this shallow trap. this represents experimental evidence of a phonon bottleneck effect associated with the thermal activation of shallow traps in photoexcited silicon. These findings provide microscopic insight into carrier relaxation dynamics in silicon and highlight the significance of electron-phonon interactions in the ultrafast processes governing materials used in optoelectronic applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work advances the frontier of low-damping magnetic materials, directly addressing the demand for ultra-low-loss components in quantum computing and cryogenic electronics. Here we demonstrate a new approach to get single crystal micrometer-thick yttrium iron garnet (YIG) films with low damping through isolating and mitigating interfacial paramagnetic contributions of a paramagnetic substrate by a buffer-layer. The YIG films with the diamagnetic yttrium scandium gallium garnet buffer layer grown by liquid phase epitaxy on a gadolinium gallium substrate demonstrate homogeneity unprecedented for the thin planar YIG structures, yielding ferromagnetic resonance linewidths of 4.9 MHz at 4 K and 5.9 MHz at 16 mK, the lowest values reported to date. These results underscore the critical role of interfacial engineering in overcoming intrinsic material limitations, opening avenues for further optimization in spin-based technologies.</description>

      <title>Effect of FABr Over-Stoichiometry on the Morphology and Optoelectronic Properties of Wide-Bandgap FAPbBr_3 Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the impact of formamidinium bromide (FABr) over-stoichiometry in the precursor solution on the optoelectronic properties and morphology of the resulting films of formamidinium lead bromide (FAPbBr_3). Optical characterization, including steady-state absorption, photoluminescence (PL), and femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy, reveals a systematic blueshift in emission energy with increasing FABr content, attributed to the passivation of bromine vacancies and to the reduction of defect-assisted recombination. Power-dependent PL confirms this interpretation: the stoichiometric film exhibits a PL band due to donor-acceptor pair (DAP) recombination as identified by the typical excitation-dependent blueshift, whereas FABr-enriched samples show no evidence of DAP emission, indicating effective defect passivation. Additionally, morphological characterization shows a reduction in grain size with increasing FABr excess, indicating a trade-off between improved electronic quality and enhanced structural disorder. The film synthesized with a 5% excess of FABr provides the optimal balance, yielding the highest power conversion efficiency (6.26%), average visible transmittance (61.6%), and light utilization efficiency (3.85%). These results demonstrate that fine-tuning the precursor stoichiometry through controlled FABr addition represents a simple yet effective strategy to enhance the optoelectronic quality and performance of semitransparent perovskite solar cells.</description>

      <title>Velocity dependence of kinetic friction by multi-scale Quantum Mechanics/Green's Function molecular dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomistic simulations are powerful tools for investigating tribological phenomena at a fundamental level; however, simulating a tribological system remains challenging due to the multiscale nature of frictional processes. Recently, we introduced a hybrid method, QM-GF, that enables an accurate description of both interfacial chemistry and phononic dissipation in semi-infinite bulks. In this work, we apply this simulation scheme to study the dependence of kinetic friction on sliding velocity. Using a prototypical diamond interface with varying hydrogen coverages, we find that the friction force decreases with increasing sliding velocity, revealing two distinct sliding regimes at low and high speeds. We provide a physical interpretation of this velocity dependence based on the modulation of the frictional force by the sliding motion over the periodic potential energy surface of the interface. High velocities lead to force cancellation, while low velocities result in a net frictional force characterized by a distinctive sawtooth profile.</description>

      <title>Communication: Modeling layered mosaic perovskite alloy microstructures across length scales via a packing algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Layered "mosaic" metal-halide perovskite materials display a wide-variety of microstructures that span the order-disorder spectrum and can be tuned via the composition of their constituent B-site octahedral species. Such materials are typically modeled using computationally expensive ab initio methods, but these approaches are greatly limited to small sample sizes. Here, we develop a highly efficient hard-particle packing algorithm to model large samples of these layered complex alloys that enables an accurate determination of the geometrical and topological properties of the B-site arrangements within the plane of the inorganic layers across length scales. Our results are in good agreement with various experiments, and therefore our algorithm bypasses the need for full-blown ab initio calculations. The accurate predictive power of our algorithm demonstrates how our minimalist hard-particle model effectively captures complex interactions and dynamics like incoherent thermal motion, out of plane octahedral tilting, and bond compression/stretching. We specifically show that the composition-dependent miscibility predicted by our algorithm for certain silver-iron and copper-indium layered alloys are consistent with previous experimental observations. We further quantify the degree of mixing in the simulated structures across length scales using our recently developed sensitive "mixing" metric. The large structural snapshots provided by our algorithm also shed light on previous experimentally measured magnetic properties of a copper-indium system. The generalization of our algorithm to model 3D perovskite alloys is also discussed. In summary, our packing model and mixing metric enable one to accurately explore the enormous space of hypothetical layered mosaic alloy compositions and identify materials with potentially desirable optoelectronic and magnetic properties.</description>

      <title>What is the signature of a trion in photoemission?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (tr-ARPES) allow for the probing of multiparticle excited-states in reciprocal space. While neutral two-particle excitations (excitons) have been observed in tr-ARPES, signatures of trions -- three-quasiparticle bound states -- have only been probed via optical spectroscopy. Here, we develop a generic theory for the ARPES signature of trions in the model system of a monolayer transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD). We simulate the ARPES signals of both positively and negatively charged trions and show that the interaction of the residual holes, or electron and hole, lead to large energy shifts, on the order of the exciton binding energy, compared to the exciton signal. For positive trions, the additional momentum degree of freedom of the residual particles removes any strict lower bound on the photoemission energy, leading to distinctive asymmetric spectral features. For negative trions, the photoemission process causes the tr-ARPES spectrum to reproduce inverted images of the exciton band structure for multiple exciton states, encompassing both spin-allowed and spin-forbidden states, providing a direct momentum-resolved probe of both trion and exciton physics.</description>

      <title>E-coherent crystalline interfaces: coherency enhanced by discohesion arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coherent crystalline interfaces form when a pair of joined crystals share lattice sites. Such interfaces are ubiquitous in materials, minerals, and compounds, with examples including grain boundaries in polycrystals and phase boundaries in multi-phase systems. Existing methodologies such as the topological model provide a framework for understanding the nature of coherency between two crystals and the line defect content within an interface. However, these methods only consider states of coherency achieved via affine transformations. Here we show that in some interfaces, local relaxations in the form of non-affine transformations lead to the introduction of additional coincidence sites within the interface; we term this class of interfaces as e-coherent. These non-affine relaxations are topologically equivalent to inserting disconnection (or disclination) dipoles or loops into the interface. Unlike traditional interfacial line defects, the defects associated with e-coherency cannot have long-range stress fields and their motion alters the state of coherency between the crystals. Given these unique properties, we differentiate them from other defects by referring to them as discohesions. Through atomistic simulations and transmission electron microscopy, we show that the energetics and kinetics of e-coherent interfaces are strongly affected by the discohesion content in the interface, leading to fundamentally different behaviors compared to non-e-coherent interfaces. We demonstrate e-coherency in grain, twin, and phase boundaries, and that a given interface can have multiple possible e-coherent states. These results suggest that e-coherency is likely to be pervasive in crystalline solids.</description>

      <title>High-throughput validation of phase formability and simulation accuracy of Cantor alloys</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-throughput methods enable accelerated discovery of novel materials in complex systems such as high-entropy alloys, which exhibit intricate phase stability across vast compositional spaces. Computational approaches, including Density Functional Theory (DFT) and calculation of phase diagrams (CALPHAD), facilitate screening of phase formability as a function of composition and temperature. However, the integration of computational predictions with experimental validation remains challenging in high-throughput studies. In this work, we introduce a quantitative confidence metric to assess the agreement between predictions and experimental observations, providing a quantitative measure of the confidence of machine learning models trained on either DFT or CALPHAD input in accounting for experimental evidence. The experimental dataset was generated via high-throughput in-situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction on compositionally varied FeNiMnCr alloy libraries, heated from room temperature to ~1000 {\deg}C. Agreement between the observed and predicted phases was evaluated using either temperature-independent phase classification or a model that incorporates a temperature-dependent probability of phase formation. This integrated approach demonstrates where strong overall agreement between computation and experiment exists, while also identifying key discrepancies, particularly in FCC/BCC predictions at Mn-rich regions to inform future model refinement.</description>

      <title>Artificial Intelligence Driven Workflow for Accelerating Design of Novel Photosensitizers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of high-performance photosensitizers has long been hindered by the time-consuming and resource-intensive nature of traditional trial-and-error approaches. Here, we present \textbf{A}I-\textbf{A}ccelerated \textbf{P}hoto\textbf{S}ensitizer \textbf{I}nnovation (AAPSI), a closed-loop workflow that integrates expert knowledge, scaffold-based molecule generation, and Bayesian optimization to accelerate the design of novel photosensitizers. The scaffold-driven generation in AAPSI ensures structural novelty and synthetic feasibility, while the iterative AI-experiment loop accelerates the discovery of novel photosensitizers. AAPSI leverages a curated database of 102,534 photosensitizer-solvent pairs and generate 6,148 synthetically accessible candidates. These candidates are screened via graph transformers trained to predict singlet oxygen quantum yield ($\phi_\Delta$) and absorption maxima ($\lambda_{max}$), following experimental validation. This work generates several novel candidates for photodynamic therapy (PDT), among which the hypocrellin-based candidate HB4Ph exhibits exceptional performance at the Pareto frontier of high quantum yield of singlet oxygen and long absorption maxima among current photosensitizers ($\phi_\Delta$=0.85, $\lambda_{max}$=650nm).</description>

      <title>Floquet-engineered Valley Topology with Anisotropic Response in 1T'-WSe2 and Janus WSeTe monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Valley topology has emerged as a key concept for realizing new classes of quantum states. Here, we investigate Floquet-engineered topological phase transitions in anisotropic 1T'-WSe2 and its Janus derivative WSeTe monolayers, which exhibit valley-degenerate and valley-polarized characteristics, respectively. In 1T'-WSe2, a single topological-phase-transition (TPT) occurs from the quantum-spin-Hall state (QSH) to the quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) state, involving one spin channel at both valleys simultaneously. In contrast, Janus WSeTe undergoes a two-stage Floquet-driven TPT that occurs within a single valley and sequentially involves two spin components. The intermediate phase manifests as a valley-polarized QAH (vp-QAH) state with a finite valley Chern number, while the final phase evolves into a high-Chern-number QAH state with distinct valley gaps. Furthermore, an in-plane anisotropic response of the TPTs is predicted under oblique light incidence, reflecting the intrinsic low-symmetry nature of the lattice. These findings provide a comprehensive understanding of Floquet-engineered valley-based topological properties and offer guidance for designing light-controllable valleytronic and topological devices.</description>

      <title>Scaling Kinetic Monte-Carlo Simulations of Grain Growth with Combined Convolutional and Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNN) have emerged as a promising machine learning method for microstructure simulations such as grain growth. However, accurate modeling of realistic grain boundary networks requires large simulation cells, which GNN has difficulty scaling up to. To alleviate the computational costs and memory footprint of GNN, we propose a hybrid architecture combining a convolutional neural network (CNN) based bijective autoencoder to compress the spatial dimensions, and a GNN that evolves the microstructure in the latent space of reduced spatial sizes. Our results demonstrate that the new design significantly reduces computational costs with using fewer message passing layer (from 12 down to 3) compared with GNN alone. The reduction in computational cost becomes more pronounced as the spatial size increases, indicating strong computational scalability. For the largest mesh evaluated (160^3), our method reduces memory usage and runtime in inference by 117x and 115x, respectively, compared with GNN-only baseline. More importantly, it shows higher accuracy and stronger spatiotemporal capability than the GNN-only baseline, especially in long-term testing. Such combination of scalability and accuracy is essential for simulating realistic material microstructures over extended time scales. The improvements can be attributed to the bijective autoencoder's ability to compress information losslessly from spatial domain into a high dimensional feature space, thereby producing more expressive latent features for the GNN to learn from, while also contributing its own spatiotemporal modeling capability. The training was optimized to learn from the stochastic Potts Monte Carlo method. Our findings provide a highly scalable approach for simulating grain growth.</description>

      <title>Structural Relaxation and Anisotropic Elasticity of Ordered Block Copolymer Melts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.17857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Block copolymer (BCP) melts play a critical role in the design of thermoplastics, owing in large part to the creation of alternating nano-scale domains of soft and stiff components. Much of thermoplastic design has been focused on the short-time response associated with the dynamical rigidity of rubbery or glassy chains. However, less attention has been paid to the long-time relaxation and rigidity of microphase separated BCP melts or the role that domain morphology plays in modulating near-equilibrium response. We take advantage of the ability of self-consistent field theory (SCFT) to calculate equilibrium properties of BCP melts to explore the anisotropic elastic response of ordered ABA and AB copolymer melts as quasistatic deformation processes. This allows us to determine the anisotropic stiffness of the liquid crystal-like lamellar and columnar phases due to modulations in domain spacing, as well as the full stiffness tensor of the cubic BCC sphere and double gyroid phases. We explore elastic modulus landscapes for both single grain materials and random polycrystals over architectural parameters and segregation strengths, using AB diblock and ABA triblock melts as key examples. Finally, we re-examine basic assumptions of BCP melts as simple composites, dependence of melt stiffness on domain spacing, and the role of bridging chain conformations in altering melt relaxation, providing evidence for an interplay between mass transport and domain topology that remains to be understood.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.17859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Natural hyperbolic materials have attracted significant interest in the field of photonics due to their unique optical properties. Based on the initial successful explorations on layered crystalline materials, hyperbolic dispersion was associated with extreme structural anisotropy, despite the rarity of natural materials exhibiting this property. Here we show that non cubic electrides are generally promising natural hyperbolic materials owing to charge localization in interstitial sites. This includes elemental and binary electrides, as well as some two-dimensional materials that show prominent in-plane hyperbolic dispersion. They exhibit low plasma frequencies and a broad hyperbolic window spanning the infrared to the ultraviolet. In semiconductor electrides, anisotropic interband transitions provide an additional mechanism for hyperbolic behaviour. These findings remove the previously held prerequisite of structural anisotropy for natural hyperbolic materials, and open up new opportunities, which might change the current strategy for searching and design photonic materials.</description>

      <title>Validation of the copper equation of state via shock loading experiments of loosely associated powders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-fidelity shock experiments were performed on copper powders with controlled porosity via improved target fabrication and assembly. Optical velocimetry and multi-channel pyrometry were used to obtain Hugoniot data, isentropic release paths, and interface temperature histories. The results validate a modified two-phase equation of state (EOS) for copper based on the framework of Greeff et al. The measured Hugoniot shows good agreement with the present model but exhibits significant softening above ~156 GPa relative to the original Greeff EOS, indicating that reduction in lattice specific heat becomes essential when shock temperatures exceed three times the melting point (T &gt; 3Tm). Unloading behavior matches hydrodynamic simulations incorporating the recalibrated EOS, confirming its accuracy for off-Hugoniot states. Theoretical analysis of temperature release profiles suggests that the thermal conductivity of shocked copper powders may be considerably higher than first-principles predictions. Crucially, despite heterogeneity in shock heating, the macroscopic dynamic response of copper powders with a porosity of ~1.7 is well captured by an average-density EOS model, supporting the use of porous material experiments for EOS validation under extreme conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electric-field control of spin states offers a promising route to ultra-low-power, ultra-fast magnetization switching in spintronic devices such as magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs). Recent progress in modulating spin-orbit interactions at the interfaces between 3d transition-metal ferromagnets and dielectric layers has underscored the role of atomic-scale heavy-metal doping in optimizing device performance. Here, we experimentally demonstrate highly energy-efficient, voltage-driven magnetization switching in MTJs exhibiting large tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR), enabled by a remote doping technique that precisely controls the iridium (Ir) concentration near the MgO-CoFeB interface in the free layer. Our devices achieve a switching energy of only 3.5 fJ per bit for nanoscale MTJs operating in the sub-nanosecond regime, while maintaining a TMR ratio up to 160 percent after 400 C post-annealing. These findings establish a viable pathway toward scalable, ultra-low-power nonvolatile memory, positioning voltage-driven MTJs as strong contenders for next-generation magnetoresistive random-access memory (MRAM) and other emerging spintronic applications.</description>

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) and data science are transforming chemical research, yet few formal courses are tailored to synthetic and experimental chemists, who often face steep entry barriers due to limited coding experience and lack of chemistry-specific examples. We present the design and implementation of AI4CHEM, an introductory data-driven chem-istry course created for students on the synthetic chemistry track with no prior programming background. The curricu-lum emphasizes chemical context over abstract algorithms, using an accessible web-based platform to ensure zero-install machine learning (ML) workflow development practice and in-class active learning. Assessment combines code-guided homework, literature-based mini-reviews, and collaborative projects in which students build AI-assisted workflows for real experimental problems. Learning gains include increased confidence with Python, molecular property prediction, reaction optimization, and data mining, and improved skills in evaluating AI tools in chemistry. All course materials are openly available, offering a discipline-specific, beginner-accessible framework for integrating AI into synthetic chemistry training.</description>

      <title>Atomistic Framework for Glassy Polymer Viscoelasticity Across 20 Frequency Decades</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Glassy polymers are central to engineering applications, yet their viscoelastic response over broad frequency and temperature ranges remains difficult to characterize. We extend non-affine deformation theory by incorporating a time-dependent memory kernel within the Generalized Langevin Equation for atomistic non-affine motions, yielding frequency-dependent mechanical response. Applied to poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), the method captures the shear modulus and relaxation spectrum across more than twenty decades in frequency, from hundreds of terahertz down to the millihertz regime, thus bridging polymer mechanics from ordinary to extreme scales. Our predictions show quantitative consistency with independent estimates from oscillatory-shear molecular dynamics, Brillouin scattering, ultrasonic spectroscopy, Split-Hopkinson testing, and dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), demonstrating a unified theoretical-computational route for multiscale characterization of polymer glasses.</description>

      <title>Light-engineered Multichannel Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect in High-order Topological Plumbene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Floquet engineering severs as a forceful technique for uncovering high Chern numbers of quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) states with feasible tunability in high-order topologically insulating plumbene, which is readily accessible for experimental investigations. Under the irradiation of righthanded circularly polarized light, we predict a three-stage topological phase transition in plumbene, whether it is in a free-standing form or grown on h-BN. Initially, a metallic state evolves into a K(K')-valley-based QAH state with a Chern number of -8, which then decreases to -6 after the valley gap closes. Finally, a band inversion occurs at the $\Gamma$ point, resulting in a multichannel QAH state with C = -3. The trigonal warping model accounts for both K(K')-valley-based and $\Gamma$-pointbased QAH states. Additionally, growing plumbene on a non-van-der-Waals substrate eliminates the K(K')-valley-based topology, leaving only the $\Gamma$-point-based QAH state with C = +3. Our findings propose the tunability of various high Chern numbers derived from high-order topological insulators, aiming to advance the next-generation dissipationless electronic devices.</description>

      <title>Curvature-Dependent Polarity of Interfacial Energy Flow in Functionalized CNT Polymer Nanocomposites: A Reactive Molecular Dynamics Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Carbon nanotube (CNT)-polymer composites are widely engineered using surface coatings and chemical treatments to improve interfacial bonding and load transfer. It has been suggested in the nanocomposite literature that nanotube curvature, in conjunction with surface functionalization such as polydopamine (PDA) coating, could serve as an additional control knob for tuning interfacial bonding and energy dissipation in polymer-CNT systems. While experimental and simulation studies have demonstrated the benefits of PDA functionalization, the fundamental mechanism by which nanotube curvature modulates interfacial energy flow and mechanical polarity remains unresolved. This gap is sharpened by a persistent paradox: identical PDA functionalization strengthens some CNT-polymer systems while weakening others, a curvature-dependent inconsistency that has remained unexplained. Here, we employ reactive molecular dynamics (ReaxFF) simulations to resolve how curvature and PDA functionalization jointly govern interfacial energy evolution in CNT-polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) nanocomposites. Our investigation reveals that curvature and PDA functionalization jointly produce opposite regimes of interfacial energy flow: high-curvature CNTs generate dissipative, frictional interphases, whereas low-curvature CNTs confine energy in rigid, cohesive shells. This polarity inversion originates from a curvature-induced transition in PDA adsorption geometry that transforms the interphase from an energy-releasing to an energy-storing configuration. These results establish curvature as a fundamental design parameter for engineering polymer-nanotube interfaces, offering a predictive route to tune interfacial energy flow, mechanical resilience, and transport properties beyond the limits of conventional chemical functionalization.</description>

      <title>Giant Domain Walls and Intrinsic Heterogeneity in 214 Cuprate Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The intricate interplay of structural, charge and spin orders in layered cuprates leads to emergent phenomena, most notably high-temperature superconductivity. However, there is growing awareness that both the structure and electronic ordering that underpin them are not fully homogeneous. Here, we employ scanning three-dimensional X-ray diffraction to spatially resolve structural distortions in La$_{1.675}$Eu$_{0.2}$Sr$_{0.125}$CuO$_{4}$, a prototypical system that exhibits a strong competition between superconductivity and charge density wave order, across its low-temperature orthorhombic to tetragonal phase transition. We uncover two forms of intrinsic microstructural heterogeneity: at 300 K, we reveal remarkably wide tetragonal-like domain wall regions within the nominally orthorhombic crystal structure, and, upon cooling to 100 K, a fine microstructure of orthorhombic-like stripes embedded within the tetragonal matrix emerges. This spatially resolved view directly defines the microstructural architecture of phase coexistence in this system, demonstrating how structural distortions generate intrinsic heterogeneity that shapes the balance between superconductivity and charge density wave order as constrained by the restrictive orthorhombic and tetragonal structures, offering a pathway to control correlated phenomena.</description>

      <title>Clustering-Enhanced Time- and Angle-Resolved Photoemission Study of LaTe$_3$: Absence of a Photoinduced Secondary CDW in the Electronic Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical control offers a compelling route for tailoring material properties on an ultrafast time scale. Ordered states such as charge density waves (CDWs) can be transiently melted by an ultrafast light excitation. This is also the case for the rare-earth tritelluride LaTe$_3$, a prototypical CDW compound. For this material it has recently been reported that the suppression of the primary CDW allows the transient formation of a second CDW, whose wave vector is orthogonal to the primary one. This creates the intriguing scenario where light enables switching between two distinct ordered phases of the material. While the second CDW has so far been observed by structural techniques, it remains an open question how the interplay of the two CDW phases is reflected in the material's electronic structure. We investigate this via time- and angle-resolved photoemission measurements of LaTe$_3$. The complex Fermi contour is probed using a FeSuMa analyzer, which records the photoemission intensity of the entire Fermi contour at once. The dynamics revealed by the FeSuMa analyzer are complemented by measurements using a conventional hemispherical electron analyzer. We combine conventional data analysis with $k$-means clustering, an unsupervised machine learning technique, demonstrating its strong potential for disentangling large datasets. While we do not find any features that cannot be explained by the melting and re-establishment of the primary CDW, distinct dynamics and coherent oscillations are observed in the different branches of the Fermi contour.</description>

      <title>Electrochemical Interfaces at Constant Potential: Data-Efficient Transfer Learning for Machine-Learning-Based Molecular Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulating electrified metal/water interfaces with explicit solvent under constant potential is essential for understanding electrochemical processes, yet remains prohibitively expensive with ab initio methods. We present TRECI, a data-efficient workflow for constructing machine learning force-fields (ML-FFs) that achieve ab initio-level accuracy in electronically grand-canonical molecular dynamics. By leveraging transfer learning from general-purpose and domain-specific models, TRECI enables stable and accurate simulations across a wide potential range using a reduced number of reference configurations. This efficiency allows the use of high-level meta-GGA functionals and rigorous surface-electrification schemes. Applied to Cu(111)/water, models trained on just one thousand configurations yield accurate molecular dynamics simulations, capturing bias-dependent solvent restructuring effects not previously reported. TRECI offers a general strategy for characterising diverse materials and interfacial chemistries, significantly lowering the cost of realistic constant-potential simulations and expanding access to quantitative electrochemical modelling.</description>

      <title>Calculating the Stability of Different Surfaces of GaAsxP1-x Mixed-Crystals using the Virtual Crystal Approximation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.06881v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The theoretical treatment of mixed-crystals is very demanding. A straight-forward approach to attack this problem is using a super cell method (SCM). Another one is the Virtual Crystal Approximation (VCA), which is a feature of the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP). For comparison we use both methods to calculate the total energy (Etot) and the density of states (DOS) of bulk GaAsxP1-x. We then apply VCA to compute the stability of different surfaces using an extended version of the surface formation energy Omega. Our calculations show, on one hand, a working VCA implementation with its flaws (overestimation of Etot) and strengths (well modelling of DOS). On other hand, a further result is that bulk of the slab of a mixed-crystal has a minor influence on the configuration of the surface.</description>

      <title>PDDFormer: Pairwise Distance Distribution Graph Transformer for Crystal Material Property Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12984v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Crystal structures can be simplified as a periodic point set that repeats across three-dimensional space along an underlying lattice. Traditionally, crystal representation methods characterize the structure using descriptors such as lattice parameters, symmetry, and space groups. However, in reality, atoms in materials always vibrate above absolute zero, causing their positions to fluctuate continuously. This dynamic behavior disrupts the fundamental periodicity of the lattice, making crystal graphs based on static lattice parameters and conventional descriptors discontinuous under slight perturbations. Chemists proposed the pairwise distance distribution (PDD) method to address this problem. However, the completeness of PDD requires defining a large number of neighboring atoms, leading to high computational costs. Additionally, PDD does not account for atomic information, making it challenging to apply it directly to crystal material property prediction tasks. To tackle these challenges, we introduce the atom-Weighted Pairwise Distance Distribution (WPDD) and Unit cell Pairwise Distance Distribution (UPDD) and apply them to the construction of multi-edge crystal graphs. We demonstrate the continuity and general completeness of crystal graphs under slight atomic position perturbations. Moreover, by modeling PDD as global information and integrating it into matrix-based message passing, we significantly reduce computational costs. Comprehensive evaluation results show that WPDDFormer achieves state-of-the-art predictive accuracy across tasks on benchmark datasets such as the Materials Project and JARVIS-DFT.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Potentials for Hydrogen Absorption in TiCr$_2$ Laves Phases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22824v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The energetics of hydrogen absorption in C15 cubic and C14 hexagonal TiCr$_2$H$_x$ Laves phases is investigated for $0 &lt; x \le 6$ with density functional theory (DFT) and machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs). The MLIPs are trained with configurations generated through a series of active-learning schemes. Basin-hopping Monte Carlo (BHMC) simulations based on the MLIPs predict minimum-energy hydrogen configurations, along with enthalpies of formation and hydrogen orderings. The obtained phase transformations at 0 K agree well with the experiments at low temperatures. The hydrogen solubility limits in the low-concentration $\alpha$ phases at 0 K are predicted to be $x = 1.0$ and $x = 1.5$ for the C15 and the C14 phases, respectively. At these concentrations, C15 TiCr$_2$H shows the $Cc$ monoclinic symmetry, while C14 TiCr$_2$H$_{1.5}$ shows the $Ama2$ orthorhombic symmetry, both of which have not been reported for this system. The first and the second hydride phases, i.e., $\beta$ and $\beta'$, at 0 K are found around $x = 3$ and $x = 4$, respectively, for both the C15 and the C14 phases. In the second-hydride $\beta'$ phases, C15 TiCr$_2$H$_4$ shows the $I4_1/a$ tetragonal symmetry, while C14 TiCr$_2$H$_4$ shows the $R\bar3c$ rhombohedral symmetry. Hydrogen repulsion are found to extend to edge-sharing interstices, affecting the hydrogen ordering. Furthermore, the $6h_2$ A$_2$B$_2$ interstices are found to be energetically substantially more preferable for C14 TiCr$_2$H$_x$ than the other A$_2$B$_2$ interstices at low hydrogen concentrations, influencing the hydrogen-occupation trend.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23116v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, a first successful synthesis of the unknown bulk manganese monocarbide (MnC) has been reported. Suggested as a potential superhard material, the compound is found to crystallize in the zincblende (B3) structure. In the present work, we report an exhaustive density functional investigation on structural, electronic and magnetic properties of MnC, using different levels of exchange-correlation approximations. We show that SCAN meta-GGA and PBE0r hybrid functional outperform GGA-PBEsol, HSE06 hybrid functional and the mean field DFT+$U$+$V$; in predicting correctly the experimental zincblende structure as the groundstate one. It is demonstrated that the bond exchange plays a crucial role in this stabilization. At theoretical equilibrium, hybrid functionals (PBE0r and HSE06) lead to a metallic behavior of MnC. Semilocal ones (PBEsol and SCAN) and mean field DFT+$U$+$V$, however, predict two opposite kinds of half-metallic ferromagnetism; opening a debate on the origin and the nature this behavior. If the latter is confirmed experimentally, MnC could be for importance as a spintronic material.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00413v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the detection of zero-bias photocurrents induced by interband excitation using oblique near-infrared light ({\lambda}=0.780 {\mu}m) along the directions parallel and perpendicular to the helical axis in a millimeter-sized Te crystal. The photocurrent parallel to the helical axis exhibits a circular-polarization-dependent component, namely circular photogalvanic effect. We create a framework for estimating the gyrotropic photoconductivity tensor \b{eta}, the ratio between the circular-polarization-dependent photocurrent density and intensity of light, through which extrinsic \b{eta} values ranging from a few to a few tens of nA/W are obtained. Searching the \b{eta} values through existing literatures reveals that these values vary significantly with sample conditions, excitation wavelengths, and forms of crystallite samples. A particular interesting point found in our study is that the \b{eta} values for the interband excitation may be greater than those for intraband excitation as far as bulk Te is concerned.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Hydrogen Embrittlement for the Controllable Synthesis of Functional Hydrides</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05481v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Metal hydrides are promising solid-state carriers for the integrated hydrogen economy, which is essential for achieving carbon neutrality. However, their conventional synthesis relies on external sources of high-purity H2, thereby linking storage directly to energy-intensive production processes. Here, we transform this paradigm by introducing an acid-mediated "controllable hydrogen embrittlement" strategy for the direct and efficient synthesis and functionalization of metal hydrides under mild conditions. This approach leverages in situ hydrogen generation and defect engineering during the reaction of bulk metals with acid, enabling the preparation of over 20 high-purity hydrides. Using diamond anvil cell experiments, we establish a quantitative criterion, |Delta Peq| &gt; Delta Pph, which reveals the key mechanism governing hydride formation and stability, and guides the synthesis of challenging targets such as LiH. This method not only significantly lowers the energy footprint and economic cost of hydride synthesis by eliminating the need for high-pressure H2 and enabling the use of renewable feedstocks but also creates defect-rich, active hydrides. As a demonstration, an engineered titanium hydride achieves an outstanding current density of 1.07 A cm-2 for NH3 in the nitrate electroreduction reaction, while maintaining consistently high performance across a wide operating window, showcasing the stability conferred by enhanced H- transport. This work redefines hydrogen embrittlement as a powerful tool for synthesis and functionalization, establishing a material platform that integrates hydrogen capture, storage, and conversion, and thereby opening a novel pathway to unify the fragmented hydrogen energy chain.</description>

      <title>Characterization of WSe$_2$ films using reflection Kikuchi diffraction in the scanning electron microscope and multivariate statistical analyses</title>

Abstract: The study of thin films and 2D materials, including transition metal dichalcogenides such as WSe$_2$ offers opportunities to leverage their properties in advanced sensors, quantum technologies, and device to optimize functional performance. In this work, we characterize thin WSe$_2$ samples with variable thicknesses using scanning electron microscope (SEM)-based techniques focused on analysis of backscattered electron signal and Kikuchi diffraction patterns. These data were collected via a pixelated electron-counting direct electron detector positioned below the pole piece primarily configured for reflection Kikuchi diffraction (RKD), and a similar detector placed in the more conventional electron backscatter diffraction geometry. In addition to conventional pattern analysis for orientation microscopy, multivariate statistical methods (MSA) based on principal component analysis were applied to analyze diffraction patterns and differentiate thickness variations and crystal orientations within the thin films through data clustering. These results were compared with atomic force microscopy to validate thickness measurements. Our findings indicate that RKD combined with MSA is highly effective for characterizing 2D materials, enabling simultaneous assessment of thickness and crystallographic orientation. Systematic acceleration voltage variations in RKD experiments and comparisons with EBSD data suggest that the thickness dependency arises from inelastic scattering of diffracted electrons, which affects pattern contrast in the thin film regime. Collection and analysis of patterns obtained from monolayer, bilayer and tri-layer of WSe$_2$ are also demonstrated. This work reinforces the utility of SEM-based techniques, such as RKD, as valuable tools for the materials characterization toolkit, particularly for thin films and 2D materials.</description>

      <title>Efficient $GW$ band structure calculations using Gaussian basis functions and application to atomically thin transition-metal dichalcogenides</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18411v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a $GW$ space-time algorithm for periodic systems in a Gaussian basis including spin-orbit coupling. We employ lattice summation to compute the irreducible density response and the self-energy, while we employ $k$-point sampling for computing the screened Coulomb interaction. Our algorithm enables accurate and computationally efficient quasiparticle band structure calculations for atomically thin transition-metal dichalcogenides. For monolayer MoS$_\text{2}$, MoSe$_\text{2}$, WS$_\text{2}$, and WSe$_\text{2}$, computed $GW$ band gaps agree on average within 50 meV with plane-wave-based reference calculations. $G_0W_0$ band structures are obtained in less than two days on a laptop (Intel i5, 192 GB RAM) or in less than 30 minutes using 1024 cores. Overall, our work provides an efficient and scalable framework for $GW$ calculations on atomically thin materials.</description>

      <title>General ab initio framework for chiral phonons induced by electronic order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09253v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conventional ab initio methods fail to describe the emergence of chiral phonons driven by electronic ordering. Here, we develop an ab initio framework, grounded in molecular Berry curvature (MBC), that captures electronic-order-driven symmetry breaking in lattice dynamics and is applicable to both insulating and metallic magnets. Using Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$ as a model system, we show that the MBC term simultaneously breaks time-reversal and mirror symmetries, enabling a quantitative reproduction of the experimentally observed phonon splittings. The analysis uncovers distinct microscopic origins for the $E_g$ and $E_u$ modes: the $E_g$ splitting is governed by MBC and is accurately described by our first-principles scheme, whereas the $E_u$ splitting is enhanced by the Fano resonance, consistent with its asymmetric spectral profile. Leveraging this framework, we further predict several candidates with chiral-phonon splitting. Our results establish a predictive route for identifying and understanding phonon magnetism, chiral phonons, and related Hall-type lattice responses from first principles.</description>

      <title>Orbital Hybridization-Driven Stabilization and Reactivity on an Asymmetrically Reconstructed Polar CeO2(100) Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11568v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding and controlling the atomic structure of polar oxide surfaces is essential for unraveling surface reactivilty and designing advanced catalytic materials. Among these, the polar CeO2(100) surface is a prototypical and industrially important system in heterogeneous catalysis. However, due to the vast complexity of the surface configurations, its reconstruction behavior remains an open question. Here, we report a previously unidentified asymmetric (1x2) reconstructed structure on the CeO2(100) surface, discovered through an integrated approach that combines global structure search algorithms, machine learning-based atomic potential models, density functional theory (DFT) calculations, and in situ scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). The reconstructed surface is both thermodynamically and kinetically stable, characterized by an alternating arrangement of Ce3+ and Ce4+ ions, increased interlayer spacing, and reconfigured surface oxygen atoms. Importantly, the formation of localized Ce3+ polarons introduces occupied 4f states that strongly hybridize with surface O 2p orbitals, resulting in new occupied electronic states below the Fermi level. This orbital hybridization activates the O 2p states, enhances their electron-donating capacity, and facilitates the dissociation of adsorbed molecules such as H2O. These findings reveal a fundamental orbital-mediated mechanism by which surface reconstruction governs electronic structure and reactivity, offering critical insights and a new design strategy for tuning catalytic performance on polar oxide surfaces.</description>

      <title>High-Throughput Quantification of Altermagnetic Band Splitting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14729v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Altermagnetism represents a recently established class of collinear magnetism that combines zero net magnetization with momentum-dependent spin polarization, enabled by symmetry constraints rather than spin-orbit coupling. This distinctive behavior gives rise to sizable spin splitting even in materials composed of light, earth-abundant elements, offering promising prospects for next-generation spintronics applications. Despite growing theoretical and experimental interest, the discovery of altermagnetic materials remains limited due to the complexity of magnetic symmetry and the inefficiency of conventional approaches. Here, we present a comprehensive high-throughput screening of the entire MAGNDATA database, integrating symmetry analysis with spin-polarized density functional theory (DFT) calculations to identify and characterize altermagnetic candidates. Our workflow uncovers 173 materials exhibiting significant spin splitting ($\geq 50$ meV within $\pm 3$ eV of the Fermi level), spanning both metallic and semiconducting systems. Crucially, our momentum-resolved analysis reveals that the spin splitting varies strongly across the Brillouin zone, and that the maximal splitting tends to occur away from the high-symmetry paths, a result that directly informs and guides future photoemission experiments. By expanding the catalog of known altermagnets and elucidating the symmetry-protected origins of spin splitting, this work lays a robust foundation for future experimental and theoretical advances in spintronics and quantum materials discovery.</description>

      <title>Towards a deeper fundamental understanding of (Al,Sc)N ferroelectric nitrides</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15050v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, within the virtual crystal alloy approximation, are performed, along with the development of a Landau-type model employing a symmetry-allowed analytical expression of the internal energy and having parameters being determined from first principles, to investigate properties and energetics of Al1-xScxN ferroelectric nitrides in their hexagonal forms. These DFT computations and this model predict the existence of two different types of minima, namely the 4-fold-coordinated wurtzite (WZ) polar structure and a 5-times paraelectric hexagonal phase (to be denoted as H5), for any Sc composition up to 40%. The H5 minimum progressively becomes the lowest energy state within hexagonal symmetry as the Sc concentration increases from 0 to 40%. Furthermore, the model points out to several key findings. Examples include the crucial role of the coupling between polarization and strains to create the WZ minimum, in addition to polar and elastic energies, and that the origin of the H5 state overcoming the WZ phase as the global minimum within hexagonal symmetry when increasing the Sc composition mostly lies in the compositional dependency of only two parameters, one linked to the polarization and another one being purely elastic in nature. Other examples are that forcing Al1-xScxN systems to have no or a weak change in lattice parameters when heating them allows to reproduce well their finite-temperature polar properties, and that a value of the axial ratio close to that of the ideal WZ structure does imply a large polarization at low temperatures but not necessarily at high temperatures because of the ordered-disordered character of the temperature-induced formation of the WZ state. Such findings should allow for a better fundamental understanding of (Al,Sc)N ferroelectric nitrides, which may be used to design efficient devices operating at low voltages.</description>

      <title>Posterior corrections for systematic distortions in atomic-resolution images from hexagonal crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01940v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Digital images from crystals, as projected from the third spatial dimension and recorded in atomic resolution with any kind of real-world microscope, feature necessarily broken symmetries of the translation-periodicity-restricted Euclidean plane. The symmetry breakings are due to both the imaging process and the real structure of the imaged crystal, with the former cause typically dominating. A posterior algorithmic reduction of the symmetry breaking in such images constitutes, thus, often a correction for many of the distortions that were introduced by the imaging processes. Numerically quantified restorations of such symmetries can, therefore, be used to demonstrate the efficacy of a newly implemented posterior correction method for atomic-resolution images from hexagonal crystals. Recently developed information theory based methods are here shown to be suitable for this purpose. Thirteen experimental atomic-resolution images from graphite and monolayer molybdenite (MoS2), as respectively obtained by scanning tunneling microscopy, atomic force microscopy in the torsional resonance mode, and aberration-corrected parallel illumination transmission electron microscopy served as test cases in our larger (in its totality so far unpublished) study, from which we quote here. The source code of the software that was used for our distortion corrections and the whole report on that study are freely available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Synthesis and optical characterization of Mn-doped ZnS nanocrystalline thin films prepared via chemical bath deposition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.16167v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Manganese-doped zinc sulfide nanocrystalline thin films were synthesized using a low-temperature chemical bath deposition and deposited on glass substrates for controlled durations using triethanolamine (TEA) as a complexing and capping agent. After deposition, the films were annealed at 200 degrees Celsius and characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), SEM, and UV-Vis spectroscopy. XRD patterns confirmed the formation of nanocrystalline cubic zinc blende ZnS with an average crystallite size of approximately 37 nm. Optical measurements revealed strong transparency in the visible region, blue-shifted absorption edges due to quantum confinement, and a band gap value of approximately 3.70 eV. Mn incorporation resulted in a slight red shift of the absorption edge, attributed to particle growth and sp-d exchange interactions. These results demonstrate that Mn doping modifies the optical response of ZnS while preserving its crystalline structure, suggesting its suitability for optoelectronic and photovoltaic applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02733v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show how dynamic heterogeneities (DH), a hallmark of glass-forming materials, depend on chain flexibility and chain length in polymers. For highly flexible polymers, a relatively large number of monomers ($N_c\sim500$) undergo correlated motion at the glass transition temperature $T_g$, independent of molecular weight ($M$). In contrast, less flexible polymers show a complex $N_c(M)$ behaviour divided into three regimes, consistent with observation in both $T_g(M)$ and chain conformational structure. For short oligomers ($\lesssim$ 2 Kuhn steps), a transition from mainly $\it{inter}$molecular correlations and $N_c\sim 200$, to strongly $\it{intra}$molecular correlations and $N_c&lt; 50$ (roughly the molecular size) is observed; for longer chains, $N_c$ increases weakly, before saturating. For poly(methyl methacrylate), a remarkable similarity is found between $N_c(M)$ and the $M$-dependent ratio of the activation barriers of the structural ($\alpha$) and secondary ($\beta$) relaxations. Our results suggest a link between the DH length-scale and the number of $\beta$ relaxation events jointly-activated to facilitate the $\alpha$ relaxation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09806v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transition metal dichalcogenides possess valley pseudospin, enabling coupling between photon spin and electron spin for classical and quantum information processing. However, rapid valley-dephasing processes have impeded the development of scalable, high-performance valleytronic devices operating at room temperature. Here we demonstrate that a chiral resonant metasurface can enable room-temperature valley-selective emission in MoSe2 monolayers independent of excitation polarization. This platform provides circular eigen-polarization states with a high quality factor (Q-factor) and strong chiral near-field enhancement. The fabricated Si chiral metasurfaces exhibit chiroptical resonances with Q-factors up to 450 at visible wavelengths. We reveal degrees of circular polarization (DOP) reaching a record high of 0.5 at room temperature. Our measurements show that the high DOP can be attributed to the significantly increased chiroptical local density of states, which enhances valley-specific radiative transition rates by a factor of ~13. Our work could facilitate the development of ultracompact chiral classical and quantum light sources.</description>

      <title>Thermal Analog Computing: Application to Matrix-vector Multiplication with Inverse-designed Metastructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22603v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rising computational demand of modern workloads has renewed interest in energy-efficient paradigms such as neuromorphic and analog computing. A fundamental operation in these systems is matrix-vector multiplication (MVM), ubiquitous in signal processing and machine learning. Here, we demonstrate MVM using inverse-designed metastructures that exploit heat conduction as the signal carrier. The proposed approach is based on a generalization of effective thermal conductivity to systems with multiple input and output ports: The input signal is encoded as a set of applied temperatures, while the output is represented by the power collected at designated terminals. The metastructures are obtained via density-based topology optimization, enabled by a differentiable thermal transport solver and automatic differentiation, achieving an accuracy $&gt; 99\%$ in most cases across pool of matrices with dimensions $2 \times 2$ and $3 \times 3$. We apply this methodology--termed thermal analog computing--to realize matrices relevant to practical tasks, including the discrete Fourier transform and convolutional filters. These results suggest new opportunities for analog information processing in environments where temperature gradients naturally arise, such as device hotspots and thermal controllers</description>

      <title>Spin-Phonon Relaxation of Boron-Vacancy Centers in Two-Dimensional Boron Nitride Polytypes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00154v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials hosting color centers and spin defects are emerging as key platforms for quantum technologies. However, the impact of reduced dimensionality on the spin-lattice relaxation time ($T_1$) of embedded defect spins -- critical for quantum applications -- remains largely unexplored. In this study, we present a systematic first-principles investigation of the negatively charged boron-vacancy (V$_{\text{B}}^-$) defect in monolayer boron nitride (BN), as well as in AA$^\prime$-stacked hexagonal BN (hBN) and ABC-stacked rhombohedral BN (rBN). Our results reveal that the $T_1$ times of V$_{\text{B}}^-$ in monolayer BN and hBN are nearly identical at room temperature. Surprisingly, despite the symmetry reduction in rBN opening additional spin relaxation channels, V$_{\text{B}}^-$ exhibits a longer $T_1$ compared to hBN. We attribute this effect to the stiffer out-of-plane phonon modes in rBN, which activate spin-phonon relaxation at reduced strength. These findings suggest that V$_{\text{B}}^-$ in rBN offers enhanced spin coherence properties, making it a promising candidate for quantum technology applications.</description>

      <title>In situ 2D visualization of hydrogen entry into Zn-coated steels in NaCl solutions: Roles of Zn dissolution and potential distribution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18362v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The hydrogen entry behavior of a partially Zn-coated steel sheet in NaCl solutions was investigated employing a polyaniline-based hydrogenochromic sensor, electrochemical hydrogen permeation tests, and potential measurements using a scanning Kelvin probe. While the Zn coating mitigated corrosion of the steel substrate, it simultaneously accelerated the hydrogen entry. The hydrogen entry occurred at the bare steel surface regions exposed to the NaCl solution, with the hydrogen flux exhibiting non-uniform distribution: higher near the dissolving Zn coating. While no significant differences in Zn dissolution behavior or galvanic current were observed between 0.1 and 0.01 M NaCl solutions, the total hydrogen flux decreased with decreasing Cl ion concentration. This reduction was attributed to a potential gradient induced by differences in electrolyte conductivity. The results demonstrate that potential distribution, rather than galvanic current, is a dominant factor influencing hydrogen entry under the investigated conditions.</description>

      <title>General-Purpose Models for the Chemical Sciences: LLMs and Beyond</title>

Abstract: Data-driven techniques have a large potential to transform and accelerate the chemical sciences. However, chemical sciences also pose the unique challenge of very diverse, small, fuzzy datasets that are difficult to leverage in conventional machine learning approaches. A new class of models, which can be summarized under the term general-purpose models (GPMs) such as large language models, has shown the ability to solve tasks they have not been directly trained on, and to flexibly operate with low amounts of data in different formats. In this review, we discuss fundamental building principles of GPMs and review recent and emerging applications of those models in the chemical sciences across the entire scientific process. While many of these applications are still in the prototype phase, we expect that the increasing interest in GPMs will make many of them mature in the coming years.</description>

      <title>Field-free Superconducting Diode Effect and Topological Fulde-Ferrell Superconductivity in Altermagnetic Shiba Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21446v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The superconducting diode effect (SDE), characterized by a directional asymmetry in the critical supercurrents, typically requires external magnetic fields to break time-reversal symmetry -- posing challenges for scalability and device integration. Here, we demonstrate a field-free realization of the SDE in a helical Shiba chain proximitized by a $d$-wave altermagnet. Using a self-consistent Bogoliubov-de Gennes approach, we uncover a topological Fulde-Ferrell (FF) superconducting state that hosts tunable Majorana zero modes at the chain ends. The Cooper pair momentum is directly controlled by an externally injected supercurrent providing an experimentally accessible tuning parameter for driving and manipulating the topological FF phase. This state is stabilized by the interplay between the exchange coupling of magnetic adatoms and the induced altermagnetic spin splitting. Crucially, the same topological FF phase supports strong nonreciprocal supercurrents, achieving diode efficiencies exceeding $45\%$ without applied magnetic fields. The $d$-wave altermagnet plays a dual role: it intrinsically breaks time-reversal symmetry, enabling topological superconductivity, and introduces inversion symmetry breaking via momentum-dependent spin-splitting, driving the field-free SDE in a junction-free architecture. Our results establish the Shiba chain-altermagnet heterostructure as a promising platform for realizing topological superconducting devices with efficient, intrinsic superconducting diode functionality -- offering a scalable pathway towards dissipationless quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Learning Potential Energy Surfaces of Hydrogen Atom Transfer Reactions in Peptides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00578v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) reactions are essential in many biological processes, such as radical migration in damaged proteins, but their mechanistic pathways remain incompletely understood. Simulating HAT is challenging due to the need for quantum chemical accuracy at biologically relevant scales; thus, neither classical force fields nor DFT-based molecular dynamics are applicable. Machine-learned potentials offer an alternative, able to learn potential energy surfaces (PESs) with near-quantum accuracy. However, training these models to generalize across diverse HAT configurations, especially at radical positions in proteins, requires tailored data generation and careful model selection. Here, we systematically generate HAT configurations in peptides to build large datasets using semiempirical methods and DFT. We benchmark three graph neural network architectures (SchNet, Allegro, and MACE) on their ability to learn HAT PESs and indirectly predict reaction barriers from energy predictions. MACE consistently outperforms the others in energy, force, and barrier prediction, achieving a mean absolute error of 1.13 kcal/mol on out-of-distribution DFT barrier predictions. Using molecular dynamics, we show our MACE potential is stable, reactive, and generalizes beyond training data to model HAT barriers in collagen I. This accuracy enables integration of ML potentials into large-scale collagen simulations to compute reaction rates from predicted barriers, advancing mechanistic understanding of HAT and radical migration in peptides. We analyze scaling laws, model transferability, and cost-performance trade-offs, and outline strategies for improvement by combining ML potentials with transition state search algorithms and active learning. Our approach is generalizable to other biomolecular systems, enabling quantum-accurate simulations of chemical reactivity in complex environments.</description>

      <title>Spin structures and phase diagrams of the spin-$\frac{5}{2}$ triangular-lattice antiferromagnet Na$_2$BaMn(PO$_4$)$_2$ under magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21021v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We combine single-crystal neutron diffraction studies and Monte Carlo simulations to determine the spin structures and finite-temperature phase diagram of the spin-5/2 triangular-lattice antiferromagnet Na$_2$BaMn(PO$_4$)$_2$ in magnetic field. With the application of a magnetic field in two different directions, namely along the $c$-axis and in the $ab$-plane of the trigonal symmetry, we track the evolution of the spin structure through changes of the magnetic propagation vector. We account for these results with a minimal Heisenberg Hamiltonian that includes easy-axis anisotropy and weak, frustrated interlayer couplings in addition to intralayer exchange. Guided by representation analysis, we refine symmetry-allowed modes to the measured intensities and obtain the spin structures for all field-induced phases, which we compare quantitatively with simulated configurations. Taken together, our measurements and simulations show that frustrated interlayer exchange -- rather than purely 2D physics -- organizes the unexpectedly rich field-induced phases of Na$_2$BaMn(PO$_4$)$_2$.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-enforced Moir\'e Topology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06906v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological flat bands in two-dimensional (2D) moir\'e materials have emerged as promising platforms for exploring the interplay between topology and correlation effects. However, realistic calculations of moir\'e band topology using density functional theory (DFT) are computationally inefficient due to the large number of atoms in a single moir\'e unit cell. In this work, we propose a systematic scheme to predict the topology of moir\'e bands from atomic symmetry data and moir\'e symmetry group, both of which can be efficiently extracted from DFT. Specifically, for $\Gamma$-valley electron gases, we find that certain combinations of atomic symmetry data and moir\'e symmetry groups can enforce nontrivial band topology in the low-energy moir\'e bands, as long as the moir\'e band gap is smaller than the atomic band splitting at the moir\'e Brillouin zone boundary. This symmetry-enforced nontrivial moir\'e topology, including both topological insulators and topological semimetals, is robust against various material-specific details such as the precise form and strength of the moir\'e potential or the exact twist angle. By exhaustively scanning all 2D atomic symmetry data and moir\'e symmetry groups, we identify 197 combinations that can yield symmetry-enforced nontrivial moir\'e topology, and we verify one such combination using a moir\'e model with cubic Rashba spin-orbit coupling. By screening the existing 2D material database, we currently identify 92 monolayer materials with (i) the low-energy bands near $\Gamma$ and (ii) the atomic symmetry data that belong to those combinations. Our approach is generalizable to other valleys and provides a useful guideline for experimental efforts to discover and design new topologically nontrivial moir\'e materials.</description>
