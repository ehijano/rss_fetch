      <title>Mathematical Modeling of Protein Structures: A Cohomology-Based Approach to the Flagellar Motor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a novel mathematical model derived from cohomology, leveraging the KEEL-proven theorem that establishes cohomology as tautological, generated by boundary classes of curves with fixed dual graphs. Simplicial complexes are constructed using skew-commutative graded algebra, and the structure theorem is applied to connect distinct homologies, enabling precise interpretations of the resulting geometric forms. The proposed model is utilized for protein structure analysis and prediction, with a specific application to the Flagellar Motor structure. This approach offers new insights into the geometric and algebraic foundations of biological macromolecular modeling, highlighting its potential for advancement in structural biology.</description>

      <title>Deciphering the unique dynamic activation pathway in a G protein-coupled receptor enables unveiling biased signaling and identifying cryptic allosteric sites in conformational intermediates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neurotensin receptor 1 (NTSR1), a member of the Class A G protein-coupled receptor superfamily, plays an important role in modulating dopaminergic neuronal activity and eliciting opioid-independent analgesia. Recent studies suggest that promoting \{beta}-arrestin-biased signaling in NTSR1 may diminish drugs of abuse, such as psychostimulants, thereby offering a potential avenue for treating human addiction-related disorders. In this study, we utilized a novel computational and experimental approach that combined nudged elastic band-based molecular dynamics simulations, Markov state models, temporal communication network analysis, site-directed mutagenesis, and conformational biosensors, to explore the intricate mechanisms underlying NTSR1 activation and biased signaling. Our study reveals a dynamic stepwise transition mechanism and activated transmission network associated with NTSR1 activation. It also yields valuable insights into the complex interplay between the unique polar network, non-conserved ion locks, and aromatic clusters in NTSR1 signaling. Moreover, we identified a cryptic allosteric site located in the intracellular region of the receptor that exists in an intermediate state within the activation pathway. Collectively, these findings contribute to a more profound understanding of NTSR1 activation and biased signaling at the atomic level, thereby providing a potential strategy for the development of NTSR1 allosteric modulators in the realm of G protein-coupled receptor biology, biophysics, and medicine.</description>

      <title>In-Context Learning can distort the relationship between sequence likelihoods and biological fitness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Language models have emerged as powerful predictors of the viability of biological sequences. During training these models learn the rules of the grammar obeyed by sequences of amino acids or nucleotides. Once trained, these models can take a sequence as input and produce a likelihood score as an output; a higher likelihood implies adherence to the learned grammar and correlates with experimental fitness measurements. Here we show that in-context learning can distort the relationship between fitness and likelihood scores of sequences. This phenomenon most prominently manifests as anomalously high likelihood scores for sequences that contain repeated motifs. We use protein language models with different architectures trained on the masked language modeling objective for our experiments, and find transformer-based models to be particularly vulnerable to this effect. This behavior is mediated by a look-up operation where the model seeks the identity of the masked position by using the other copy of the repeated motif as a reference. This retrieval behavior can override the model's learned priors. This phenomenon persists for imperfectly repeated sequences, and extends to other kinds of biologically relevant features such as reversed complement motifs in RNA sequences that fold into hairpin structures.</description>

      <title>Targeted AMP generation through controlled diffusion with efficient embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning-based antimicrobial peptide (AMP) discovery faces critical challenges such as low experimental hit rates as well as the need for nuanced controllability and efficient modeling of peptide properties. To address these challenges, we introduce OmegAMP, a framework that leverages a diffusion-based generative model with efficient low-dimensional embeddings, precise controllability mechanisms, and novel classifiers with drastically reduced false positive rates for candidate filtering. OmegAMP enables the targeted generation of AMPs with specific physicochemical properties, activity profiles, and species-specific effectiveness. Moreover, it maximizes sample diversity while ensuring faithfulness to the underlying data distribution during generation. We demonstrate that OmegAMP achieves state-of-the-art performance across all stages of the AMP discovery pipeline, significantly advancing the potential of computational frameworks in combating antimicrobial resistance.</description>
