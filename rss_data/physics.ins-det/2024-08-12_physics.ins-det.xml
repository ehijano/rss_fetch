      <title>CANISIUS The Austrian Neutron Spin Echo Interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The broad band resonant spin echo interferometer, CANISIUS, is presented. CANISIUS is built in a versatile way, such that it can be operated in both a continuous broad band beam or a pulsed Time of Flight beam. This versatility also extends to the modes available to the instrument, such as Neutron Resonant Spin Echo, Spin Echo (Modulated) Small Angle Neutron Scattering and coherent averaging to produce structured wavefunctions for scattering. The instrument may also be used as an interferometer, to probe fundamental questions in quantum mechanics. In this paper we detail both the continuous and Time of Flight options of the instruments. In addition we demonstrate the applicability of our interferometer to ultra small angle scattering in a white beam. Finally we demonstrate a new spin echo interferometry tool, which uses incomplete recombination of the two path states to generate composite wavefunctions with special structure. In particular we show that this method produces neutron wavefunctions that exist in a superposition of two quantum mechanical OAM modes, l =+1 or -1 We illustrate that just as this method can be used to generate certain structured waves, it may also be used to characterize the structure of the input wavefunction.</description>

      <title>Pulse excitation mode selection via AI Pipeline to Fully Automate the WUCT System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The parametric optimization for the ultrasound computed tomography system is introduced. It is hypothesized that the pulse characteristic directly affects the information present in the reconstructed profile. The ultrasound excitation modes based on pulse-width modifications are studied to estimate the effect on reconstruction quality. Studies show that the pulse width affects the response of the transducer and, thus, the reconstruction. The ultrasound scanning parameters, mainly pulse width, are assessed and optimally set by an Artificial Intelligence driven process, according to the object without the requirement of a-priori information. The optimization study uses a novel intelligent object placement procedure to ensure repeatability of the same region of interest, a key requirement to minimize the error. Further, Kanpur Theorem 1 is implemented to evaluate the quality of the acquired projection data and discard inferior quality data. Scanning results corresponding to homogeneous and heterogeneous phantoms are presented. The image processing step involves deep learning model evaluating the dice coefficient for estimating the reconstruction quality if prior information about the inner profile is known or a classical error estimate otherwise. The models segmentation accuracy is 95.72 percentage and intersection over union score is 0.8842 on the validation dataset. The article also provides valuable insights about the development and low-level control of the system.</description>

      <title>ACCELERATION: Sequentially-scanning DECT Imaging Using High Temporal Resolution Image Reconstruction And Temporal Extrapolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) has been widely used to obtain quantitative elemental composition of imaged subjects for personalized and precise medical diagnosis. Compared with existing high-end DECT leveraging advanced X-ray source and/or detector technologies, the use of the sequentially-scanning data acquisition scheme to implement DECT may make broader impact on clinical practice because this scheme requires no specialized hardware designs. However, since the concentration of iodinated contrast agent in the imaged subject varies over time, sequentially-scanned data sets acquired at two tube potentials are temporally inconsistent. As existing material decomposition approaches for DECT assume that the data sets acquired at two tube potentials are temporally consistent, the violation of this assumption results in inaccurate quantification accuracy of iodine concentration. In this work, we developed a technique to achieve sequentially-scanning DECT imaging using high temporal resolution image reconstruction and temporal extrapolation, ACCELERATION in short, to address the technical challenge induced by temporal inconsistency of sequentially-scanned data sets and improve iodine quantification accuracy in sequentially-scanning DECT. ACCELERATION has been validated and evaluated using numerical simulation data sets generated from clinical human subject exams. Results demonstrated the improvement of iodine quantification accuracy using ACCELERATION.</description>

      <title>Nuclear Recoil Identification in a Scientific Charge-Coupled Device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.07869v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Charge-coupled devices (CCDs) are a leading technology in direct dark matter searches because of their eV-scale energy threshold and high spatial resolution. The sensitivity of future CCD experiments could be enhanced by distinguishing nuclear recoil signals from electronic recoil backgrounds in the CCD silicon target. We present a technique for event-by-event identification of nuclear recoils based on the spatial correlation between the primary ionization event and the lattice defect left behind by the recoiling atom, later identified as a localized excess of leakage current under thermal stimulation. By irradiating a CCD with an $^{241}$Am$^{9}$Be neutron source, we demonstrate $&gt;93\%$ identification efficiency for nuclear recoils with energies $&gt;150$ keV, where the ionization events were confirmed to be nuclear recoils from topology. The technique remains fully efficient down to 90 keV, decreasing to 50$\%$ at 8 keV, and reaching ($6\pm2$)$\%$ at 1.5--3.5 keV. Irradiation with a $^{24}$Na $\gamma$-ray source shows no evidence of defect generation by electronic recoils, with the fraction of electronic recoils with energies $&lt;85$ keV that are spatially correlated with defects $&lt;0.1$$\%$.</description>

      <title>cDVGAN: One Flexible Model for Multi-class Gravitational Wave Signal and Glitch Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16356v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simulating realistic time-domain observations of gravitational waves (GWs) and GW detector glitches can help in advancing GW data analysis. Simulated data can be used in downstream tasks by augmenting datasets for signal searches, balancing data sets for machine learning, and validating detection schemes. In this work, we present Conditional Derivative GAN (cDVGAN), a novel conditional model in the Generative Adversarial Network framework for simulating multiple classes of time-domain observations that represent gravitational waves (GWs) and detector glitches. cDVGAN can also generate generalized hybrid samples that span the variation between classes through interpolation in the conditioned class vector. cDVGAN introduces an additional player into the typical 2-player adversarial game of GANs, where an auxiliary discriminator analyzes the first-order derivative time-series. Our results show that this provides synthetic data that better captures the features of the original data. cDVGAN conditions on three classes, two denoised from LIGO blip and tomte glitch events from its 3rd observing run (O3), and the third representing binary black hole (BBH) mergers. Our proposed cDVGAN outperforms 4 different baseline GAN models in replicating the features of the three classes. Specifically, our experiments show that training convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with our cDVGAN-generated data improves the detection of samples embedded in detector noise beyond the synthetic data from other state-of-the-art GAN models. Our best synthetic dataset yields as much as a 4.2% increase in area-under-the-curve (AUC) performance compared to synthetic datasets from baseline GANs. Moreover, training the CNN with hybrid samples from our cDVGAN outperforms CNNs trained only on the standard classes, when identifying real samples embedded in LIGO detector background (4% AUC improvement for cDVGAN).</description>

      <title>Measurement of the fractional radiation length of a pixel module for the CMS Phase-2 upgrade via the multiple scattering of positrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13721v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-luminosity particle collider experiments such as the ones planned at the High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider require ever-greater vertexing precision of the tracking detectors, necessitating also reductions in the material budget of the detectors. Traditionally, the fractional radiation length ($x/X_0$) of detectors is either estimated using known properties of the constituent materials, or measured in dedicated runs of the final detector. In this paper, we present a method of direct measurement of the material budget of a CMS prototype module designed for the Phase-2 upgrade of the CMS detector using a 40-65 MeV positron beam. A total of 630 million events were collected at the Paul Scherrer Institut PiE1 experimental area using a three-plane telescope consisting of the prototype module as the central plane, surrounded by two MALTA monolithic pixel detectors. Fractional radiation lengths were extracted from scattering angle distributions using the Highland approximation for multiple scattering. A statistical technique recovered runs suffering from trigger desynchronisation, and several corrections were introduced to compensate for local inefficiencies related to geometric and beam shape constraints. An overall average $x/X_0$ of (0.84 $\pm$ 0.04)% across the surveyed regions was measured, which is compatible with an empirical estimate of 0.825% computed from known material properties. Higher-granularity maps of the fractional radiation length were produced for both rectangular regions and regions of uniform material composition. The results bode well for the CMS Phase-2 upgrade modules, which will play a key role in the minimisation of the material budget of the upgraded detector.</description>

      <title>Broad Instantaneous Bandwidth Microwave Spectrum Analyzer with a Microfabricated Atomic Vapor Cell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15155v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report on broad instantaneous bandwidth microwave spectrum analysis with hot $^{87}\mathrm{Rb}$ atoms in a microfabricated vapor cell in a large magnetic field gradient. The sensor is a MEMS atomic vapor cell filled with isotopically pure $^{87}\mathrm{Rb}$ and $\mathrm{N}_2$ buffer gas to localize the motion of the atoms. The microwave signals of interest are coupled through a coplanar waveguide to the cell, inducing spin flip transitions between optically pumped ground states of the atoms. A static magnetic field with large gradient maps the $\textit{frequency spectrum}$ of the input microwave signals to a position-dependent $\textit{spin-flip pattern}$ on absorption images of the cell recorded with a laser beam onto a camera. In our proof-of-principle experiment, we demonstrate a microwave spectrum analyzer that has $\approx$ 1 GHz instantaneous bandwidth centered around 13 GHz, 3 MHz frequency resolution, 2 kHz refresh rate, and a -23 dBm single-tone microwave power detection limit in 1 s measurement time. A theoretical model is constructed to simulate the image signals by considering the processes of optical pumping, microwave interaction, diffusion of $^{87}\mathrm{Rb}$ atoms, and laser absorption. We expect to reach more than 25 GHz instantaneous bandwidth in an optimized setup, limited by the applied magnetic field gradient. Our demonstration offers a practical alternative to conventional microwave spectrum analyzers based on electronic heterodyne detection.</description>
