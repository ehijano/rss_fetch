      <title>Little Red Dots and their Progenitors from Direct Collapse Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has discovered a new population of objects, the Little Red Dots (LRDs), characterized by V-shaped spectra indicative of strong breaks around the Balmer limit and compact morphology that gave them their name. A popular explanation is that they are a sub-population of active galactic nuclei/supermassive black holes (AGN/SMBHs) predominantly found in the high-redshift Universe ($z\gtrsim3$). Similarly, direct collapse black holes (DCBHs), theorized to form from collapsing massive, extremely metal-poor gas clouds, have been invoked to explain high-redshift quasars, the most massive AGN sub-population. Here, we employ the semi-analytical code A-SLOTH to produce a population of DCBHs and compare them against observed LRD demographics and properties. Specifically, we compare the DCBH-seeded SMBH population against the standard stellar-remnant seeds and find that DCBH models agree better with observed LRD population statistics and host halo properties. Furthermore, for the most extreme and earliest LRD detections, interpreted to be systems with an AGN but little stellar component, DCBHs are able to reproduce the observed spectral shape and properties under multiple scenarios - high dust attenuation or AGN surrounded by dense gas - that have been proposed to explain the unique shape of LRD spectra. Even when super-Eddington accretion, invoked previously to explain the nature of LRDs, is enforced on stellar remnant seeds, the spectral characteristics of extreme LRDs cannot be reproduced. We emphasize the importance of gas-metallicity observations as an additional dimension besides the widely used SMBH-stellar mass ratios to further constrain the progenitors of LRDs.</description>

      <title>The implications of overmassive black holes at $z &gt; 5$ for quasar and black hole growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent JWST surveys of high-redshift galaxies have found surprisingly large black holes, with many being measured to be $\sim100$ times more massive than local galaxies with the same stellar mass. Here, we find that a population of these black holes would have dramatic implications for our understanding of their growth across cosmic time. We first show that the global black hole mass density at $z \sim 5$ would be comparable to local values. This would not occur if these black holes occupy a small fraction of galaxies, though it would be expected if these black holes radiate at high efficiencies (requiring that the central engines of AGN spin rapidly). We then show that the individual detected $z \sim 5$ black holes would remain overmassive compared to the local relation if they grow according to the average rates of state-of-the-art models. These systems must instead grow at least an order of magnitude more slowly than expected if they are to fall within the observed scatter of the local black hole mass-stellar mass relation. Such slow growth is surprising in comparison to other estimates of the radiative efficiency of AGN, especially because growth must be rapid at $z &gt; 5$ in order to build up such massive black holes quickly. Finally, we highlight the challenges that overmassive black holes have on our understanding of the impact of quasar feedback on galaxies.</description>

      <title>Ly$\alpha$ visibility from z = 4.5 to 11 in the UDS field: evidence for a high neutral hydrogen fraction and small ionized bubbles at z $\sim$ 7</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The resonant scattering nature of Ly$\alpha$ photons interacting with neutral hydrogen makes Ly$\alpha$-emitting galaxies (LAEs) robust tracers of the intergalactic neutral hydrogen fraction, and thus sensitive probes of cosmic reionization. We present an extensive study of the Ly$\alpha$ evolution from galaxies at 4.5 $\leq$ z $\leq$ 11 in the UDS field, observed as part of the CAPERS survey, and complemented with spectra from the DAWN JWST Archive. The combined sample includes 651 spectroscopically confirmed Ly$\alpha$-break galaxies, among which we find 73 S/N&gt;3 LAEs in JWST-NIRSpec PRISM spectra. We trace the redshift evolution of the Ly$\alpha$ emitter fraction with EW$_0$ &gt;25 A (X$_{\mathrm{Ly\alpha}}$) between z = 5 and z = 9, presenting the first such analysis in the UDS field. At z = 5 and 6, the UDS results agree with the average JWST X$_{\mathrm{Ly\alpha}}$ values from multiple fields. However, JWST measurements are consistently lower than ground-based results. To investigate this, we compare JWST observations to a population of star-forming galaxies at z$\sim$6 observed with VLT-FORS2. We find that a Ly$\alpha$ slit-loss of 35 $\pm$ 10% in JWST spectra accounts for the offset, as the resonant Ly$\alpha$ emission is more spatially extended than the stellar continuum. From z = 6 to 7, the UDS field shows a significant drop in Ly$\alpha$ visibility, from which we infer a neutral hydrogen fraction of X$_{\mathrm{HI}}$ = 0.7--0.9. Finally, we identify two robust ionized bubbles at z = 7.29 and 7.77, with radii of $R_{\mathrm{ion}}$ = 0.6 and 0.5 physical Mpc and photometric overdensities of N/$\langle$N$\rangle$ = 3 and 4, based on candidate counts down to the photometric completeness limit. Compared to the large ionized region at z$\sim$7 in the EGS field, these results indicate significant field-to-field variation, supporting a patchy, inhomogeneous reionization process.</description>

      <title>CO Adsorption Sites on Interstellar Water Ices Explored with Machine Learning Potentials. Binding energy distributions and snowline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Carbon monoxide (CO) is arguably the most important molecule for interstellar organic chemistry. Its binding to amorphous solid water (ASW) ice regulates both diffusion and desorption processes. Accurately characterizing the CO binding energy (BE) is essential for realistic astrochemical modeling.
  Aims. We aim to derive a statistically robust and physically accurate distribution of CO BEs on ASW surfaces, and to evaluate its implications for laboratory temperature-programmed desorption experiments and interstellar chemistry, with a focus on protoplanetary disks.
  Methods. We trained a machine-learned potential (MLP) on 8321 density functional theory (DFT) energies and gradients of CO interacting with differently-sized water clusters (22-60 water molecules). The DFT method was selected after extensive benchmark. With this potential we built realistic non-porous and porous ASW surfaces, and computed a BE distribution. We used symmetry-adapted perturbation theory to rationalize the interaction of CO on the different binding sites.
  Results. We find that both ASW morphologies yield similar Gaussian-like BE distributions with mean values near 900 K. However, the nature of the binding interactions is rather different and critically depends on surface roughness and dangling-OH bonds. Simulated TPD curves reproduce experimental trends across several coverage regimes. From an astrochemical point of view, the application of the full BE distribution has a dramatic influence on the CO distribution in protoplanetary disks, leading to a broader CO snowline region, improving predictions of CO gas-ice partitioning, and suggesting an equally broader distribution of organics in these objects.</description>

      <title>Massive Extremely High-Velocity Outflow in the Quasar J164653.72+243942.2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the analysis of one of the most extreme quasar outflows found to date in our survey of extremely high velocity outflows (EHVO). J164653.72+243942.2 (z ~ 3.04) shows variable CIV1548,1551 absorption at speeds larger than 0.1c, accompanied by SiIV, NV and Lya, and disappearing absorption at lower speeds. We perform absorption measurements using the Apparent Optical Depth method and SimBAL. We find the absorption to be very broad ({\Delta}v ~35,100 km/s in the first epoch and ~13,000 km/s in the second one) and fast (vmax ~ -50,200 km/s and -49,000 km/s, respectively). We measure large column densities ($\rm \log N_{H} &gt;$ 21.6 $\rm\ [cm^{-2}]$) and are able to place distance estimates for the EHVO ($5\lesssim R\lesssim28$ pc) and the lower-velocity outflow ($7\lesssim R\lesssim540$ pc). We estimate a mass outflow rate for the EHVO to be $\dot M_{out}\sim50-290\rm \ M_\odot\ yr^{-1}$ and a kinetic luminosity of $\log\ L_{KE}\sim46.5-47.2\ \rm [erg\ s^{-1}$] in both epochs. The lower-velocity component has a mass outflow rate $\dot M_{out}\sim10-790\rm \ M_\odot\ yr^{-1}$ and a kinetic luminosity of $\log\ L_{KE}\sim45.3-47.2\ \rm [erg\ s^{-1]}$. We find that J164653.72+243942.2 is not an outlier among EHVO quasars in regard to its physical properties. While its column density is lower than typical BAL values, its higher outflow velocities drive most of the mass outflow rate and kinetic luminosity. These results emphasize the crucial role of EHVOs in powering quasar feedback, and failing to account for these outflows likely leads to underestimating the feedback impact on galaxies.</description>

      <title>Handy Relation Between Binary Black Hole Merger Times and Host Galaxy Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past 15 years, the evidence has clearly demonstrated that massive black hole (MBH) binary merger timescales depend strongly on the structural and kinematic properties of their host galaxy. Stellar density, gas content, shape and kinematics all play a role, combining in non-linear ways to effect the evolution of the binary. The binary properties themselves, such as eccentricity, mass ratio, and orbital plane, all matter as well. This makes it nontrivial to estimate accurate cosmological MBH binary merger rates, or to generate merger rate ranges that reflect the distribution of galaxy hosts and orbits. Using an extensive set of high-resolution direct N-body simulations in which the shape, structure, and kinematics of each galaxy host are directly informed by observations, we map out MBH binary merger timescales over a range of galaxy hosts and MBH binary orbits. This yields a convenient set of scaling relations to determine MBH binary merger timescales -- and the range of merger timescales -- as functions of basic observables. Such scaling relations can be readily employed as a subgrid model in cosmological or semi-analytic studies, for example, to model event rates for LISA or pulsar timing.</description>

      <title>Efficient black hole seed formation in low metallicity and dense stellar clusters with implications for JWST sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) reveal young massive clusters (YMCs) as key building blocks of early galaxies. They are not only important constituents of galaxies, but also potential birthplaces of very massive stars (VMSs) and black hole (BH) seeds. We explore stellar dynamics in extremely dense clusters with initial half-mass densities of $\rho_h \gtrsim 10^8M_\odot{\rm pc}^{-3}$ at very low metallicity, comparable to some of the densest clusters seen by JWST. Using direct N-body and Monte Carlo simulations with stellar evolution, we show that VMS formation through collisions is unavoidable, with final masses reaching $5\times10^3$ to $4\times10^4M_\odot$. These results support the existence of a critical mass scale above which collisions become highly efficient, enabling the formation of VMSs and intermediate-mass BHs (IMBHs). Our models, using nbody6++gpu and MOCCA with updated SSE/BSE routines, show that dense clusters rapidly form VMSs via stellar bombardment. The VMSs then collapse into BH seeds of a few $10^3$ to $10^4M_\odot$ in less than 4 Myr. We identify a critical mass-density threshold beyond which clusters undergo runaway collisions that yield massive BH seeds. For typical YMCs detected by JWST, efficiencies up to 10% are expected, implying BH masses up to $10^5M_\odot$ if formed via collisions. We predict a scaling relation for BH mass, $\log(M_{\rm BH}/M_\odot)=-0.76+0.76\log(M/M_\odot)$. Frequent VMS formation may also explain the high nitrogen abundance observed in galaxies at high redshift.</description>

      <title>Spatially Resolved [O III] Emission Line Kinematics of Reverberation-Mapped AGNs with the Keck Cosmic Web Imager</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present optical integral-field spectroscopic data of ten nearby ($0.02\leq z \leq 0.05$) Seyfert 1 galaxies taken with the Keck Cosmic Web Imager (KCWI). We map the spatially resolved kinematics of the [O III] gas and stars, and investigate the alignments between their global kinematic position angles (PA). Large-scale gas motions are primarily dominated by rotation, and are kinematically aligned with the stars ($\Delta\text{PA}\leq 30$ deg). However, eight galaxies exhibit non-rotational kinematic signatures (e.g., kinematic twists, possible outflows) in their ionized gas velocity fields near the nucleus. We compare aperture-wide measurements of the gas and stellar velocity dispersions ($\sigma_{\text{gas}}$ and $\sigma_\star$) to test the use of the width of the [O III] line core as a surrogate for $\sigma_\star$. Direct comparisons between $\sigma_{\text{gas}}$ and $\sigma_\star$ show that $\sigma_{\text{gas}}$ tends to underestimate $\sigma_\star$, and thus is not a reliable tracer of $\sigma_\star$ for our selected galaxies. We measure the extent of the narrow-line region (NLR) using several definitions, resulting in sizes of $\sim0.1$-$10$ kpc. For a given [O III] luminosity, our NLR sizes derived from the [O III]/H$\beta$ flux ratio or an [O III] isophotal radius are an order of magnitude larger than those measured from past imaging data.</description>

      <title>New Insight from the James Webb Space Telescope on Variable Active Galactic Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variability detected in galaxies is usually attributed to their active galactic nuclei (AGNs). While all AGNs are intrinsically variable, the classic AGN unification model predicts that type~2 AGNs rarely vary because their engines are obstructed by dust tori. Previous UV-to-near-IR variability studies largely support this expectation. Here, we present a variability study by James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) that reveals a more subtle picture. Using NIRCam imaging data from three surveys over $\sim$140~arcmin$^2$ in the COSMOS field, we found 117 galaxies with $\geq 4$$\sigma$ variability in the F356W band across a $\sim$2-year baseline. Cross-matching with existing JWST spectroscopic data in this area, we identified five of them at $z=0.19$--3.69, which were all coincidentally observed by a NIRSpec program almost contemporaneously with the last imaging epoch. One additional variable was identified at $z=0.90$ using the archival Keck telescope data. These six objects form our spectroscopic subsample. Interestingly, two reside in close-pair environments, while two others form a close pair themselves. Most of their light curves can hardly be explained by nuclear transients, and AGN variability is a more plausible cause. However, among these six objects, (1) only one shows broad permitted lines ($\Delta v &gt; 1000$~km~s$^{-1}$) indicative of a type~1 AGN; (2) two show narrow permitted lines consistent with type~2 AGNs, with another one likely type~2 based on the host galaxy properties; and (3) two others, which form a pair, show no emission lines. Our results add more challenges to the unification model.</description>

      <title>Notes on the formaldehyde masers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The questions of the rarity of the 4.8 GHz formaldehyde masers and the non-detection of 14.5 GHz formaldehyde masers are addressed from a theoretical point of view. The pumping free-free radiation fields were obtained using the photo-ionization code Cloudy to simulate hyper-compact HII regions. Implementation of these free-free radiation fields in solving the rate equations shows that the free-free radiation fields of some hyper-compact HII regions are ineffective to invert the 4.8 GHz transition. Investigation of the variation of the inversion of the 4.8 GHz and 14.5 GHz transitions with radial distance revealed that there are regions where only the 4.8 GHz transition is inverted. It is also shown that the projection of the masing region toward the edge of a hyper-compact may explain the non-detection of 14.5 GHz masers. The attenuation of the 4.8 GHz and 14.5 GHz masers in the molecular envelope is investigated. It is found that attenuation can be significant. Comparison of the velocities of the 4.8 GHz masers with the centre velocities of associated 4.8 GHz absorption features shows that the maser emission lies at the edge of the absorption features. This suggests that the masers may be associated with kinematic structures such as rotating toroids.</description>

      <title>A search for the favored hyperfine transition of a 6.7 GHz methanol maser line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The polarized emission of astrophysical masers, especially OH and methanol lines, is an effective tool to study the magnetic field in high-mass star-forming regions. The magnetic field strength measurement via the Zeeman effect of OH maser emission is well established, but that of the methanol maser emission is still under debate because of its complex hyperfine structure. We aim to identify the dominating hyperfine transition of the Class II methanol maser emission by comparing the magnetic field strength measured with the excited OH maser emission and the Zeeman splitting of the methanol maser emission. We used quasi-simultaneous EVN observations of the two maser emissions at 6.035 GHz ex-OH and 6.668 GHz methanol toward two well-known high-mass young stellar objects: ON 1 and W75N. The observations were performed in full polarimetric mode and in phase-referencing mode to couple the maser features of the two maser emissions in each source. We detected linearly and circularly polarized emission in both maser transitions and HMYSOs. Specifically, we measured the magnetic field strength in twelve and five ex-OH maser features toward ON1 and W75N, respectively, and the Zeeman splitting of the methanol maser spectra in one and three maser features toward ON 1 and W75N, respectively. We determined that the two maser emissions likely probe the same magnetic field but at different densities. Indeed, a direct comparison of the magnetic field strength and the Zeeman splitting as measured with the ex-OH and methanol maser spots, respectively, provided values of the Zeeman splitting coefficient for the 6.7 GHz maser that do not match any of the table values present in the literature. We are not able to uniquely identify the dominating hyperfine transition; however, through density considerations, we can narrow the choice down to three hyperfine transitions: 3-&gt;4, 6-&gt;7A, and 7-&gt;8.</description>

      <title>Molecular Gas Distribution toward the Inner and Outer Galaxy Revealed by MWISP -- the Galactic Longitude 45\deg--60\deg and 120\deg--130\deg</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular clouds (MCs) are cradles of star and planet formation, thereby playing an important role in the evolution of galaxies. Based on the unbiased Milky Way Imaging Scroll Painting (MWISP) survey data of $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, and C$^{18}$O (J=1--0) line emission in two regions toward the inner and outer Galaxy, i.e. the G50 ($44.75\deg \le l \le 60.25\deg$) and G120 ($119.75\deg \le l \le 130.25\deg$) regions, the distribution of molecular gas is studied. Both regions have Galactic latitudes of $|b| \le 5.25\deg$. A catalog containing 24724 MCs is constructed from the data. In our proximity, several molecular structures with large angular scales and small velocity dispersions are discovered, resembling curtains of mist. Beyond the nearby molecular gas, a clear aggregation of MCs along coherent structures in the Galactic plane is visible, sketching spiral arm structures. Nevertheless, the aggregation of MCs is also detected in the inter-arm region between the Perseus and Outer arms in the G50 region. The Galactic molecular disk in this inter-arm region is found to be thinner than that in the adjacent spiral arm region. In addition, the thickness of the Galactic molecular disk examined here is found to be correlated with the warp of it, indicating their homologous origins. The molecular disk has a typical thickness of ~220 pc in the inner Galaxy. Moreover, the dispersion of the MC systemic velocity decreases with increasing galactocentric radius, resulting in lower kinematic distance uncertainties at larger radii. However, the Perseus arm segment in the G120 region exhibits a relatively large cloud-to-cloud velocity dispersion and split components in its MC velocity distribution.</description>

      <title>The oldest tidally induced bar-like galaxy in the IllustrisTNG cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: New JWST observations have revealed the presence of a significant number of high-redshift barred galaxies. The origin of these bars remains unclear, and their properties appear difficult to reconcile with the results of cosmological simulations of galaxy formation. I present an example of a tidally induced bar-like galaxy formed at z = 2.9 in the TNG100 suite of the IllustrisTNG simulations. The galaxy was identified among the sample of bar-like galaxies studied before and has the earliest bar formation time among the tidally induced subsample of those objects. Its disk transformed into a bar as a result of a close interaction with a massive progenitor of a brightest cluster galaxy (BCG). It remained on a tight orbit around the host and survived until the present, losing most of its initial mass and becoming red but preserving its prolate shape. Even before the interaction, at z = 3.5, the galaxy experienced a few mergers, which elongated its shape. This temporary distortion also made it look like a bar with spiral extensions of up to 6 kpc. The long-lived bar formed later was about 3 kpc long and grew over the next few gigayears. This example demonstrates that high-z bars should not be sought among the progenitors of present-day simulated barred galaxies but rather among the tidally interacting early population of galaxies in forming groups and clusters. Some of these galaxies may have survived as ellipticals, and some may have merged with their BCGs.</description>

      <title>Lithium evolution in the Galactic thin disc from Main-Sequence and early Red-Giant-Branch stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The role of novae as producers of galactic lithium has been suggested since the 1970s, and it has been reconsidered recently with the detection of $^7$Be in their outbursts. At the same time, stellar models are moving forward to comprehend the discrepancy between the primordial lithium abundance predicted by the standard Big Bang Nucleosynthesis theory and the measured value of old dwarf stars. In this work, we follow the evolution of $^7$Li in the galactic thin disc starting from a primordial value of A(Li)=2.69 dex and applying $^7$Li depletion corrections of the stellar model with overshooting to our chemical evolution models. We use the upper envelope of the observational data to constrain the models. In addition to the dwarf main sequence (MS) stars, our analysis includes, for the first time, the early red-giant-branch (RGB) stars. Besides the renowned Spite plateau of the MS stars at low metallicities, we also confirm the existence of a second A(Li) plateau of the early RGB stars, which can be explained by our model with the corrections from stellar models. Our best-fit model is obtained with an effective averaged $^7$Li yield $^{Li}Y_\mathrm{Nova}=2.34\times 10^{-5} M_\odot$ during the whole lifetime of a nova. This reinforces the possibility that novae are the main galactic $^7$Li source, together with the stellar models' ability to comprehend the "cosmological lithium problem" in this context.</description>

      <title>The revolution in strong lensing discoveries from Euclid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong gravitational lensing offers a powerful and direct probe of dark matter, galaxy evolution and cosmology, yet strong lenses are rare: only 1 in roughly 10,000 massive galaxies can lens a background source into multiple images. The European Space Agency's Euclid telescope, with its unique combination of high-resolution imaging and wide-area sky coverage, is set to transform this field. In its first quick data release, covering just 0.45% of the full survey area, around 500 high-quality strong lens candidates have been identified using a synergy of machine learning, citizen science and expert visual inspection. This dataset includes exotic systems such as compound lenses and edge-on disk lenses, demonstrating Euclid's capacity to probe the lens parameter space. The machine learning models developed to discover strong lenses in Euclid data are able to find lenses with high purity rates, confirming that the mission's forecast of discovering over 100,000 strong lenses is achievable during its 6-year mission. This will increase the number of known strong lenses by two orders of magnitude, transforming the science that can be done with strong lensing.</description>

      <title>Origins and lifetimes of secular and tidal bars in simulated disc galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the formation of stellar bars in 307 Milky Way-mass disc galaxies in the TNG50 cosmological simulation. Most bars form rapidly in dynamically cold discs shortly after the central stellar mass exceeds that of dark matter. In these cases, bar formation is consistent with secular instabilities driven by the disc's self-gravity, which organises stellar orbits into a coherent bar structure. However, around 25 per cent of barred galaxies are dark matter dominated at the time of bar formation, $t_{bar}$, and remain so thereafter. We trace the origin of these bars to tidal perturbations induced by passing satellites or mergers using a new metric, $S_{bar}$, quantifying the tidal field acting on the galaxy. At the time of bar formation, we find a negative correlation between $S_{bar}$ and the central stellar-to-dark matter mass fraction, indicating that more dark matter-dominated discs require stronger tides to trigger bar formation. These tidally induced bars are more likely to be transient than those that form secularly, although bar properties are otherwise similar. However, the host galaxies differ: secular bars arise in relatively compact discs, while tidal bars appear in extended discs whose properties resemble those of unbarred galaxies. Tidal perturbations can therefore induce bars in galaxies otherwise stable to secular formation, highlighting the dual role of the internal galactic structure and the external environment in bar formation.</description>

      <title>The differences in the Narrow Line Region of nearby QSOs 1 and 2 -- I: higher excitation and contribution of shocks in type 1's</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compare the excitation of the Narrow-Line Region (NLR) of type 1 and type 2 QSOs for redshifts $0.4 \le z \le 0.5$ via the analysis of their emission line properties in Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) near-UV/optical spectra. We fit the continuum and emission lines, using two kinematic components for \oiii$\lambda$5007 and \hb\ (narrow and broad) and a single component for the weaker lines. We find two main differences in the NLR excitation of type 1 and 2 QSOs: (i) QSOs 2 have higher \oiii/\hb\ than QSOs 1 in both narrow and broad components; (ii) QSOs 1 present higher \nev, \neiii\ and \oiii$\lambda4363$ luminosities, higher \nev/\neiii\ and \neiii/\oii\ ratios and higher temperatures than QSOs 2. These differences support more highly excited regions, higher temperature gas and prevalence of shocks in type 1 relative to type 2 QSOs. We suggest two possible scenarios: (i) type 1 QSOs are seen more pole-on, allowing the observation of more highly excited gas closer to the nucleus, supporting the Unified Model scenario; (ii) evolution from type 2 to type 1 QSOs, with highest excitation regions obscured in type 2's and cleared up in a ``blow-out phase". Support for the evolutionary scenario is given by the usually higher L\oiii\ in QSOs 2, in the sense that these sources host a more powerful AGN that, in its evolution, clears up the excess dust and gas to reveal a lower-luminosity but more highly excited type 1 AGN.</description>

      <title>Probing the farthest star clusters to the Small Magellanic Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) has been tidally shaped by the interaction with the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). The scope of such an interaction has recently been studied from different astrophysical properties of its star cluster population, which point to star clusters placed remarkably outside the known extension of the galaxy. In this work we report results for three of the recently identified most external SMC star clusters, OGLE-CL-SMC0133, OGLE-CL-SMC0237, and Lindsay~116, using deep GEMINI GMOS imaging. Once we confidently cleaned their color-magnitude diagrams from field star contamination, we estimated their fundamental parameters applying likelihood techniques. We also derived their structural parameters from normalized star number density radial profiles. Based on {\it Gaia} astrometric data, complemented with kinematics information available in the literature, we computed the 3D components of their space velocities. With similar ages (~ 2.2 Gyr) and moderately metal-poor overall abundances ([Fe/H] = -1.0 - -0.7 dex), OGLE-CL-SMC0237 is placed at 2.6 kpc from the SMC center and shares its disk rotation; OGLE-CL-SMC0133 is located at 7.6 kpc from the galaxy center and exhibits a kinematics marginally similar to the SMC rotation disk, while Lindsay~116 placed at 15.7 kpc from the center of the SMC is facing strong perturbations of its orbital motion with respect to an ordered rotational trajectory. Furthermore, its internal dynamical evolution would seem to be accelerated -- it seems kinematically older -- in comparison with star clusters in the outskirts of relatively isolated galaxies. These outcomes lead to conclude that Lindsay~116 is subject to LMC tides.</description>

      <title>Targeted search for an individual SMBHB in NANOGrav 15-year and EPTA DR2 data sets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While pulsar timing array (PTA) collaborations have reported evidence for a stochastic gravitational wave background (GWB), the detection of continuous gravitational waves (GWs) from a confirmed supermassive black hole binary (SMBHB) would provide strong support for the SMBHB origin of GWB. In this study, we analyze continuous GWs from the SMBHB candidate 3C 66B, modeling the GWB as a common uncorrelated red noise. Using Bayesian methods, we perform targeted searches across two PTA data sets: Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves 15 years data set and the European Pulsar Timing Array DR2 full data set. We find no evidence of such signal in both data sets and then place upper limits on the amplitude of the signal and the chirp mass of the source. Additionally, we evaluate the case of a GWB characterized by Hellings-Downs correlations using a likelihood reweighting method, which consistently reconfirms the conclusion of non-detection.</description>

      <title>Hidden (absorbed) Cooling Flows V: Groups and Galaxies including Spirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cooling flows are observed in X-ray studies of the centres of cool core clusters, galaxy groups and individual elliptical galaxies. They are partly hidden from direct view by embedded cold gas so have been called Hidden Cooling Flows. X-ray spectra from the XMM RGS reveal emission from hot gas modified by photoelectric absorption by cold gas intrinsic to the flow. Here we present the spectral analysis of 6 more low redshift galaxy groups ranging from the nearest fossil group to 2 groups hosting bright radio sources. All reveal absorbed cooling flows. AGN feedback is ineffective in heating the inner cooling gas in groups and elliptical galaxies. We have extended the analysis to include 3 nearby spiral galaxies (the Sombrero, Whirlpool and Sculptor galaxies). They have similar absorbed soft X-ray spectra to elliptical galaxies and may also host cooling flows of 0.3 to 1.1\Msun/yr in their CircumGalactic Medium.</description>

      <title>Estimating Initial Mass of Gaia-Enceladus Dwarf Galaxy with Chemical Evolution Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the initial mass and chemical evolution history of the Gaia-Enceladus dwarf galaxy. We combine spectroscopic data from APOGEE with astrometric data from Gaia DR3 to identify Gaia-Enceladus candidate stars via a machine-learning pipeline using t-SNE and HDBSCAN. By focusing on kinematic and chemical parameters, especially $\mathrm{[Fe/H]}$, $\mathrm{[Mg/Fe]}$, $\mathrm{[Al/Fe]}$, and $\mathrm{[Mn/Fe]}$, we uncover a population of metal-poor, high-eccentricity stars that align with literature criteria for Gaia-Enceladus debris. We then apply the \textit{OMEGA+} chemical evolution model, incorporating MCMC fitting of the observed abundance trends in the $\mathrm{[Mg/Fe]\times[Fe/H]}$ plane. Our best-fitting model indicates a gas mass of $4.93_{-0.72}^{+0.32}\times10^9\,{M_{\odot}}$ for Gaia-Enceladus, placing it at the higher end of previously suggested mass ranges. The model scenario suggests a short star formation timescale, substantial outflows, and a rapid build-up of metals mainly driven by core-collapse supernovae, with a lesser contribution from Type~Ia supernovae. Comparison with observational data in other chemical planes (e.g., $\mathrm{[Mg/Mn]\times[Al/Fe]}$) supports this scenario, emphasizing a distinct evolution path relative to the Milky Way. Additionally, our results provide indirect evidence that star formation in Gaia-Enceladus likely ceased within the first 4 Gyr, consistent with earlier inferences of an early merger event. These findings highlight the power of chemical evolution modeling in reconstructing the origin and mass of ancient accreted systems. Overall, we show that Gaia-Enceladus, through a rapid star formation and strong outflows, contributed a significant fraction of the metal-poor stellar halo of the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>Little Red Dots as Direct-collapse Black Hole Nurseries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope recently uncovered a population of massive black holes (BHs) in the first billion years after the Big Bang. Among these high-redshift BH candidates, observations have identified a class of active galactic nuclei candidates, dubbed Little Red Dots (LRDs), with extraordinarily compact gas reservoirs and peculiar spectral features. LRDs clearly emerge at redshift z&lt;8 and their abundance declines by z&lt;5. Recent theoretical studies have explored the link between LRDs and the formation of heavy BH seeds in the early Universe, such as direct-collapse BHs (DCBHs). Here we present results from preliminary runs for the MELIORA cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, where we implement an accurate model for DCBH formation, accounting for the Lyman-Werner radiation field and mass-inflow rates in the target host haloes. We aim to test whether or not DCBH formation could lead to systems resembling those hypothesized for LRDs. We find that the population of newly formed DCBHs in the simulations exhibits a steep decline at z&lt;6, akin to the emergence of LRDs, primarily driven by reduced inflows. The birth of DCBHs is associated with a significant gas compaction event, followed by a phase of intense luminosity in the 200 Myr after their birth, and subsequently by the formation of the first PopIII stars in these very haloes. If these DCBHs nurseries are associated with LRDs, then it could explain their weak emission from X-rays and hot dust.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There are millions of undetected black holes wandering through our galaxy. Observatories like {\it Chandra}, LIGO, and more recently, {\it Gaia}, have provided valuable insights into the configurations of these elusive objects when residing in binary systems. Motivated by these advances, we study, for the first time, the enhanced accretion of metals from the interstellar medium (ISM) onto low-mass companions in binary systems with highly unequal mass ratios, utilizing a series of hydrodynamical simulations. Our study demonstrates that a stellar companion's metal accretion history from the ISM alone, from its formation to the present, can significantly influence its surface abundances, especially when enhanced by a massive black hole companion. However, this effect is likely only measurable in stars that are still in the main sequence. Once a stellar companion evolves off the main sequence, similar to what has been observed with the {\it Gaia} BH3 companion, the initial dredge-up process are likely to erase any excess surface abundance resulting from the metals that were accreted. As we discover more unequal mass ratio binary systems, it is crucial to understand how the observed metallicity of sun-like companions may differ from their birth metallicity, especially if they are not yet evolved.</description>

Abstract: The blazar AO 0235+164 is a key source for studying the interplay between multi-wavelength variability in its light curves and changes in the position angles and apparent velocities of its parsec-scale jet components. In this work, we analyse public interferometric radio maps of AO 0235+164 at 15 and 43 GHz, using the Cross Entropy global optimisation technique to determine the structural parameters of its jet components. We identified 36 kinematically distinct jet components across all sky quadrants, indicating a highly relativistic parsec-scale jet with a minimum Lorentz factor of 34 +/- 7 and a maximum viewing angle of 37 +/- 8 degree. The temporal evolution of these jet components was modelled as a relativistic jet under a constant precession rate. The optimal clockwise precession model has a precession period of 8.4 +\- 0.2 years, consistent with the 8.13-year periodicity previously detected in optical light curves, besides providing a time-variable Doppler boosting factor correlated with the most intense flares at gamma-ray energies. For the counter-clockwise precession, a period of 6.0 +\- 0.1 years is found, compatible with the 5-6 year periodicities detected at radio and optical wavelengths. It is plausible that a supermassive black hole binary system in the nucleus of AO 0235+164 drives the parsec-scale jet precession and induces nodding motions consistent with short-term continuum periodicities. Nonetheless, alternative scenarios (e.g., intrinsic curved jet, warped accretion disc instabilities, Lense-Thirring/Bardeen-Petterson effects, dual jets) cannot be ruled out as causes or optional explanations for the precession.</description>

Abstract: We review participatory science programs that have contributed to the understanding of star formation. The Milky Way Project (MWP), one of the earliest participatory science projects launched on the Zooniverse platform, produced the largest catalog of ``bubbles'' associated with feedback from hot young stars to date, and enabled the identification of a new class of compact star-forming regions (SFRs) known as ``yellowballs'' (YBs). The analysis of YBs through their infrared colors and catalog cross-matching led to discovering that YBs are compact photodissociation regions generated by intermediate- and high-mass young stellar objects embedded in clumps that range in mass from 10 - 10,000 solar masses and luminosity from 10 - 1,000,000 solar luminosities. The MIRION catalog, assembled from 6176 YBs identified by citizen scientists, increases the number of candidate intermediate-mass SFRs by nearly two orders of magnitude. Ongoing work utilizing data from the Spitzer, Herschel and WISE missions involves analyzing infrared color trends to predict physical properties and ages of YB environments. Methods include applying summary statistics to histograms and color-color plots as well as SED fitting. Students in introductory astronomy classes contribute toward continued efforts refining photometric measurements of YBs while learning fundamental concepts in astronomy through a classroom-based participatory science experience, the PERYSCOPE project. We also describe an initiative that engaged seminaries, family groups, and interfaith communities in a wide variety of science projects on the Zooniverse platform. This initiative produced important guidance on attracting audiences that are underserved, underrepresented, or apprehensive about science.</description>

      <title>Barium isotopic ratios in metal-poor stars: calibrating the method with globular clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifying the nucleosynthesis processes behind heavy-element enrichment in stellar atmospheres is challenging. It typically relies on comparing observed abundance-to-iron ratios with theoretical predictions relative to the Sun, but this method is prone to uncertainty due to limitations of classical 1D hydrostatic models. One promising but still underexplored approach is to measure the isotopic composition of stellar atmospheres by focusing on elements that have both slow (s)-process and rapid (r)-process contributions. While the study of total elemental abundances offers a simplified view, isotopic ratios are directly linked to the underlying nucleosynthesis processes. Our aim is to provide a reliable method for quantifying the contributions of the s- and r-processes to barium in stellar atmospheres. This is achieved by determining barium isotopic ratios using 1D atmospheric models in combination with a carefully calibrated microturbulence, based on the comparison between subordinate and resonance Ba lines. In this initial study, we use member stars of the globular cluster NGC 6752 to calibrate the microturbulence ($v_{mic}$) value for both subordinate and resonance barium lines across different stellar evolutionary stages. This allows us to provide a reliable estimate of $v_{mic}$ that can be applied to accurately determine barium abundances and isotopic ratios in stars ranging from the main sequence to the upper red giant branch. The $v_{mic}$ scale adapted for barium subordinate lines is consistent with that derived from 3D model atmospheres, and thus the $T_{\mathrm{eff}}$-log $g$ dependent relations of the later can be used safely. The $v_{mic}$ for the resonance line at $\lambda$4934 Angstrom -- for the determination of the isotopic ratio -- is higher, and depends on the equivalent width (EW). We provide calibrated relations between $v_{mic}$ and EW for measuring isotopic ratios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is now widely established that globular clusters host robust populations of white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes throughout their lifetimes. Within clusters, dynamical processes enabled by stellar densities thousands to millions of times larger than typical galactic environments facilitate interactions involving these stellar remnants that give rise to an array of astrophysical phenomena. In particular, stellar clusters have emerged as an important formation site for X-ray sources, radio pulsars, and merging black hole binaries similar to those recently detected as gravitational wave sources by the LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA detectors. This article reviews our current understanding of compact objects in globular clusters, discussing current observational evidence, ways these objects influence the dynamical evolution of their hosts, and future prospects.</description>

      <title>Peculiar Disk Substructures Associated with the Young Eruptive Star EX Lupi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Young eruptive stars such as EXors undergo dramatic accretion outbursts characterized by sudden optical brightenings, yet the underlying physical mechanism remains uncertain. We present high-resolution ALMA Band 3 and 4 continuum observations of EX Lupi, the prototypical EXor-type variable, reconstructed using super-resolution imaging with sparse modeling. Our images reveal, for the first time, two distinct substructures: a compact, crescent-shaped inner arc within 10 au of the star, and a narrow outer ring at 30 au. The inner arc is strongly elongated and casts a shadow observed in the VLT/SPHERE near-infrared scattered light. The outer ring exhibits a radial width comparable to the local pressure scale height, consistent with moderately efficient dust trapping. Geometric and thermal analysis of the disk surface, based on combined ALMA and SPHERE data, indicates that the disk is moderately flared with an average disk temperature consistent with that of classical T Tauri disks. The observed substructures suggest dynamical perturbations-plausibly induced by a massive companion-that may modulate accretion rates through gravitational interaction with the inner arc. These findings provide morphological evidence linking disk substructure to episodic accretion in the structurally mature disk.</description>

      <title>The Prime Focus Infrared Microlensing Experiment (PRIME): First Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the description of the instruments and the first results of the PRime-focus Infrared Microlensing Experiment (PRIME). PRIME is the first dedicated near-infrared (NIR) microlensing survey telescope located at the South African Astronomical Observatory (SAAO) in Sutherland, South Africa. Among its class, it offers one of the widest fields of view in the NIR regime. PRIME's main goals are (1) To study planetary formation by measuring the frequency and mass function of planets. In particular, we compare results from the central Galactic bulge (GB), accessible only in the NIR by PRIME, with those from the outer GB by optical surveys. (2) To conduct concurrent observations with NASA's Nancy Grace Roman Space telescope. Due to the different lines of sight between the ground and space, we detect slight variations in light curves, known as ``Space-based parallax." This effect allows us to measure the mass of lens systems and their distance from the Earth. It is the only method to measure the mass of the free-floating planets down to Earth-mass. We begin the GB survey in February 2024 and analyzed images through June 1, 2025, identifying 486 microlensing candidates and over a thousand variable stars, including Mira variables, which are useful to study the Galactic structure. We issue real-time alerts for follow-up observations, supporting exoplanet searches, and the chemical evolution studies in the GB. During the off-bulge season, we conduct an all-sky grid survey and Target of Opportunity (ToO) observations of transients, including gravitational wave events, gamma-ray bursts, and other science.</description>

      <title>MUSE Observations Reveal Optical Coronal Iron Lines from Shock Emission in Supernova Remnant 0540-69.3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the optical shock emission from the Large Magellanic Cloud supernova remnant 0540-69.3 (SNR 0540) using MUSE integral-field-unit data from the VLT. The observations cover the spectral range 4650-9300 $\r{A}$ and provide a $1\times1$ arcmin$^{2}$ field of view, encompassing nearly the entire remnant. We analyse the spatial and spectral properties of shock-related emission lines, and identify clumpy optical shock emission e.g. from [S II] $\lambda\lambda$6716,6731 doublet and the coronal [Fe XIV] $\lambda$5303 line (typically at radial velocities $\lesssim|100|$ km s$^{-1}$ and $\lesssim|170|$ km s$^{-1}$, respectively). These features trace the blast-wave shell seen in previous X-ray studies. Post-shock electron density estimates, based on the [S II]-line ratio, reveal spatial variation, with the highest densities ($\sim10^4$ cm$^{-3}$) in the bright knots in the west, and lower densities ($\sim3\times10^3$ cm$^{-3}$) in the east. The density in the north (southwest) appears significantly lower (higher) but remains unconstrained due to limited signal. We also estimate blast-wave shock velocities using the [Fe XIV] $\lambda$5303/[Fe XI] $\lambda$7892 ratio, finding low velocities ($\sim400$ km s$^{-1}$), consistent with previous studies. All these results support the scenario that the blast wave is interacting with the surrounding interstellar medium, particularly in the western regions. Additionally, we detect four unidentified emission lines, $\sim$2000-3000 km s$^{-1}$ south from the pulsar in transverse velocity, but their origin remains unclear. Possible explanations, including Fe lines from a high-velocity ejecta clump, all present challenges. Our findings highlight the complex nature of the circum- and interstellar medium surrounding SNR 0540.</description>

      <title>The secular evolution of planetary nebula IC 418 and its implications for carbon star formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rate of stellar evolution can rarely be measured in real time. The fastest evolution (excluding event-driven evolution), where stars may evolve measurably over decades, is during the post-AGB phase. In this paper we provide direct evidence for such a case. A secular, linear, factor of ~2.5 increase is found in the strength of the [O III] lines relative to H-beta over an 130 year period in the young, well-known, low excitation planetary nebula IC 418. The increase is caused by the rising temperature of the central star. We use photo-ionization models to derive a model dependent heating rate for the central star in the range 15-42 K\/yr. These derived heating rates are very sensitive to the stellar mass, and yield a central-star mass of 0.560-0.583 solar masses. Initial-final mass relations based on the Miller-Bertolami models give a progenitor main-sequence mass of 1.25-1.55 solar masses. IC 418 is a carbon rich planetary nebula and its central star, HD 35914, has evolved from an AGB carbon star. This result shows that carbon star formation at solar metallicity extends to these low masses. This is lower than commonly assumed and suggests that post-AGB evolution may be slower than recent post-AGB models predict.</description>

      <title>The Alma catalogue of OB stars. III. A cross-match with Gaia DR3 and an extension based on new spectral classifications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the third installment of the Alma Luminous Star (ALS) catalogue, aimed at creating the most comprehensive and clean sample of Galactic massive stars. This update extends the sample by adding approximately 2000 OB stars, incorporating astrometric and photometric data from the Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3) alongside spectroscopic information from the Galactic O-Star Catalog based on recent ground-based spectroscopic surveys. Rigorous astrometric corrections are applied to Gaia DR3 parallaxes, proper motions, and photometry, ensuring accurate distance estimates through a Bayesian method suited to this stellar population's spatial distribution in the Milky Way. We perform some comparative analyses highlighting the improved distance accuracy over previous versions, underscore the importance of precise spectral classifications with competing catalogues, and identify areas for improvement in Gaia DR3 effective temperature and extinction estimates for massive stars. We also address the challenges of having robust definitions for these objects. In addition, we explore the catalogue's ability to trace Galactic features such as spiral arms, spurs and OB associations (with some insights on the nature of Gould's Belt). Finally, we discuss the potential for further expanding the sample with upcoming surveys. This effort marks a significant advancement in the creation of a reliable census of Galactic massive stars, contributing to our understanding of the Milky Way's structure and star formation history. This catalogue should serve as a valuable reference for the massive star community, supporting research on stellar interiors, winds, stellar feedback, and other processes that make OB stars key to the evolution of galaxies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15453v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The relative contribution of emission from stellar sources and accretion onto supermassive black holes to reionization has been brought into focus again by the apparent high abundance of faint Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) at $4\lesssim z\lesssim11$ uncovered by JWST. We investigate here the contribution of these faint AGN to hydrogen and the early stages of helium reionization using the GPU-based radiative transfer code ATON-HE by post-processing a cosmological hydrodynamical simulation from the sherwood-relics suite of simulations. We study four models: two galaxy-only late-end reionization models, a QSO-assisted and a QSO-only model. In the QSO-assisted model, 1% of the haloes host AGN, with AGN luminosities scaled to contribute 17% of the total hydrogen-ionizing emissivity. In the QSO-only model, quasars account for all the hydrogen-ionizing emissivity, with 10% of the haloes hosting AGN. The SED of AGN is assumed to be a power-law with $\alpha=-1.7$ each with a 10 Myr lifetime. All models are calibrated to the observed mean Lyman-$\alpha$ forest transmission at $5\lesssim z\lesssim6.2$. The QSO-assisted model requires an emissivity similar to the galaxy-only models and fits the observed distribution of the Lyman-$\alpha$ optical depths well. The QSO-only model is inconsistent with the observed Lyman-$\alpha$ optical depths distribution, and produces excessively high IGM temperatures at $z\lesssim 5$ due to an early onset of HeII reionization, unless the escape fraction of HeII-ionizing photons is assumed to be low. Our results suggest that a modest AGN contribution to reionization aligns with the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest data, whereas an AGN dominated scenario is difficult to reconcile.</description>

      <title>A Deep, High-Angular Resolution 3D Dust Map of the Southern Galactic Plane</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02657v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a deep, high-angular resolution 3D dust map of the southern Galactic plane over $239^\circ &lt; \ell &lt; 6^\circ$ and $|b| &lt; 10^\circ$ built on photometry from the DECaPS2 survey, in combination with photometry from VVV, 2MASS, and unWISE and parallaxes from Gaia DR3 where available. To construct the map, we first infer the distance, extinction, and stellar types of over 700 million stars using the brutus stellar inference framework with a set of theoretical MIST stellar models. Our resultant 3D dust map has an angular resolution of $1'$, roughly an order of magnitude finer than existing 3D dust maps and comparable to the angular resolution of the Herschel 2D dust emission maps. We detect complexes at the range of distances associated with the Sagittarius-Carina and Scutum-Centaurus arms in the fourth quadrant, as well as more distant structures out to a maximum reliable distance of $d \approx$ 10 kpc from the Sun. The map is sensitive up to a maximum extinction of roughly $A_V \approx 12$ mag. We publicly release both the stellar catalog and the 3D dust map, the latter of which can easily be queried via the Python package dustmaps. When combined with the existing Bayestar19 3D dust map of the northern sky, the DECaPS 3D dust map fills in the missing piece of the Galactic plane, enabling extinction corrections over the entire disk $|b| &lt; 10^\circ$. Our map serves as a pathfinder for the future of 3D dust mapping in the era of LSST and Roman, targeting regimes accessible with deep optical and near-infrared photometry but often inaccessible with Gaia.</description>

      <title>Stellar-mass black holes in young massive and open stellar clusters -- VI. Role of external galactic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17780v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Young massive clusters (YMC) and open clusters (OC) are widely considered as potential environments for assembling merging binary stellar-remnant black holes (BBH) via dynamical interactions. However, such moderate mass systems are susceptible to being disrupted by the external tidal field of their host galaxies, potentially limiting their effectiveness as GW sources. In this study, I investigate the formation of BBH mergers in tidally dissolving star clusters. This is achieved with a newly computed grid consisting of 95 evolutionary model star clusters, where the clusters are subjected to a varying extent of tidal stripping. The cluster evolutions are computed with the direct N-body integrator NBODY7 that includes, among others, treatments for post-Newtonian (PN) effects in compact-binary members, mass loss due to stellar evolution, formation of stellar remnants, and tidal stripping. It is found that even strong tidal stripping does not quench the formation of a black hole (BH) core inside a cluster or the formation of dynamical BBH mergers in the system. The overall properties of BBH mergers, e.g., the form of the distribution of merger delay time, primary mass, and mass ratio, and the redshift evolution of merger rate are not significantly altered by the extent of tidal stripping of the parent cluster population. Furthermore, even strongly tidally stripped clusters are capable of dynamically forming Gaia-BH-like detached BH--main-sequence-star binaries that escape into the galactic field. Limitations of the present study and potential future improvements are discussed.</description>

      <title>Lonely Little Red Dots: Challenges to the AGN-nature of little red dots through their clustering and spectral energy distributions</title>

Abstract: Observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) reveal a previously unseen population of compact red objects, known as ``little red dots`` (LRDs). We study a new photometrically selected sample of 124 LRDs in the redshift range $z$ $\sim$ 3 - 10 selected from NIRCam coverage of the CEERS, NEP-TDF, JADES and JEMS surveys. For JADES, the NEP-TDF and CEERS, we compare SED models with and without AGN components and analyse the impact of an AGN component on the goodness of fit using the Bayesian information criterion (BIC). We find that whilst the $\chi^{2}$ of the majority of models containing AGN components is improved compared to models without AGN components, we show that the BIC suggests models without AGN are a more appropriate fit to LRD SEDs, especially when MIRI data is available. We also measure LRD clustering in the CEERS field, JADES field, and NEP-TDF, where we compare the spatial distribution of LRDs and galaxies with Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests of equality of distribution. We find that the neighbourhood of LRDs tends to be less dense compared to galaxies at all selections and masses and at similar redshifts. We further measure upper limit estimates for the halo masses of LRDs using abundance matching. Whilst the population of LRDs could be a mixture of several different inherent populations, as a whole it does appear that these systems are mostly hosting compact galaxies or star clusters in formation.</description>

      <title>Bar-driven dispersal of Galactic substructure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09117v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Galactic archaeologists often assume that integrals of motion (IoMs) such as $L_z$ and $E$ are conserved, so substructure remains frozen in IoM space over many Gyr. However, this is not true in the Milky Way due in part to its rotating bar. In this study we quantify the effects of the bar on the dynamics of substructure. We employ three different theoretical models: an analytical toy model; a set of test particle simulations with steady and slowing bars; and a cosmological zoom-in simulation of a Milky Way-like galaxy. Each model predicts that the bar increases the angular momentum and energy spread of low-energy substructures by a factor of $\sim10-100$, so they cannot remain tightly clustered. We derive a criterion for determining when this effect is important. The most affected orbits are low energy ($E\lesssim E_\odot$, $r_\mathrm{apo}&lt;40$ kpc), prograde, eccentric, or low inclination. This includes $\sim3/4$ of Galactic globular clusters and $\sim1/4$ of known stellar streams. We predict the presence of abundant bar-dispersed substructure. The structures remain much more tightly clustered in the space of metallicity and Jacobi integral $H_\mathrm{J}=E-\Omega_\mathrm{b}L_z$. We therefore propose using $H_\mathrm{J}$ and chemistry instead of traditional IoMs when searching for inner halo substructure. In $(L_z,E)$ space the dispersal of the structures is along a principal direction with gradient $\mathrm{d}E/\mathrm{d}L_z$ equal to the bar's pattern speed $\Omega_\mathrm{b}$. Bar-dispersed substructure should therefore allow the past evolution of $\Omega_\mathrm{b}$ to be constrained.</description>

      <title>KRIOS: A new basis-expansion $N$-body code for collisional stellar dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13636v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The gravitational $N$-body problem is a nearly universal problem in astrophysics which, despite its deceptive simplicity, still presents a significant computational challenge. For collisional systems such as dense star clusters, the need to resolve individual encounters between $N$ stars makes the direct summation of forces - with quadratic complexity - almost infeasible for systems with $N\gtrsim 10^6$ particles over many relaxation times. At the same time, the most common Monte Carlo $N$-body algorithm - that of H\'enon - assumes the cluster to be spherically symmetric. This greatly limits the study of many important features of star clusters, including triaxiality, rotation, and the production of tidal debris. In this paper, we present a new hybrid code, KRIOS, that combines 3D collisionless relaxation using an adaptive self-consistent field method with collisional dynamics handled via H\'enon's method. We demonstrate that KRIOS can accurately model the long-term evolution of clusters and provide its complete phase-space information over many relaxation times. As a test of our new code, we present detailed comparisons to well-known results from stellar dynamics: (i) the collisional evolution of a family of Plummer spheres with varying anisotropy and rotation to core collapse, and (ii) the emergence of the radial-orbit instability in radially anisotropic star clusters, including its non-spherical effects.</description>

      <title>Galactic seismology: can the Gaia 'phase spiral' co-exist with a clumpy, turbulent interstellar medium?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15059v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Gaia satellite revealed a remarkable spiral pattern ('phase spiral', PS) in the z-Vz phase-plane throughout the solar neighbourhood, where z and Vz are the displacement and velocity of a star perpendicular to the Galactic plane. As demonstrated by many groups, the kinematic signature reflects the Galactic stellar disc's response to a dynamical disturbance some 0.3-3 Gyr ago. However, previous controlled simulations did not consider the impact of the multi-phase interstellar medium (ISM) on the existence of the PS. This is crucial because it has been suggested that this weak signal is highly susceptible to scattering by small-scale density fluctuations typical of the ISM. This has motivated us to explore the formation and fate of the PS in a suite of high-resolution, N-body/hydrodynamical simulations of an idealised Galaxy analogue bearing a realistic ISM that interacts impulsively with a massive perturber. In our models, high gas surface densities within the disc encourage vigorous star formation, which in turn couples with the gas via feedback to drive turbulence. We find that the PS is almost non-existent if the disc potential is too strong or the ISM is highly structured on sub-kiloparsec scales. This can happen in the absence of stellar feedback when the gas is allowed to cool. In the presence of turbulent gas maintained by stellar feedback, the PS has a patchy spatial distribution and a high degree of intermittency on kiloparsec scales. We anticipate that future studies of the phase-spiral behaviour on all scales will provide crucial information on star-gas dynamics.</description>

      <title>A catalog to unite them all: REGALADE, a revised galaxy compilation for the advanced detector era</title>

Abstract: Many applications in transient science, gravitational wave follow-up, and galaxy population studies require all-sky galaxy catalogs with reliable distances, extents, and stellar masses. However, existing catalogs often lack completeness beyond $\sim 100$ Mpc, suffer from stellar contamination, or do not provide homogeneous stellar mass estimates and size information. Our goal is to build a high-purity, high-completeness, all-sky galaxy catalog out to 2,000 Mpc, specifically designed to support time-domain and multi-messenger astrophysics. We combined major galaxy catalogs and deep imaging surveys -- including the Legacy Surveys, Pan-STARRS, DELVE, and SDSS -- and added spectroscopic, photometric, and redshift-independent distances. We cleaned the sample using the Gaia catalog to remove stars, and visually inspected all ambiguous cases below 100 Mpc through a classification platform that gathered 20,000 expert votes. Stellar masses were estimated using optical and mid-infrared profile-fit photometry, and we improved the accuracy of photometric distances by combining multiple independent estimates. The resulting catalog, REGALADE, includes nearly 80 million galaxies with distances under 2,000 Mpc. It provides stellar masses for 88\% of the sample and ellipse fits for 80\%. REGALADE is more than 90\% complete for massive galaxies out to 360 Mpc. In science tests, it recovers 60\% more known supernova hosts, doubles the number of low-luminosity transient hosts, and identifies more reliable hosts for ultraluminous and hyperluminous X-ray sources. REGALADE is the most complete and reliable all-sky galaxy catalog to date for the nearby Universe, built for real-world applications in transient and multi-messenger astrophysics. The full dataset, visual classifications, and code will be released to support broad community use.</description>

      <title>A $\tau-$DM relation for FRB hosts?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13317v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been proposed that measurements of scattering times ($\tau$) from fast radio bursts (FRB) may be used to infer the FRB host dispersion measure (DM) and its redshift. This approach relies on the existence of a correlation between $\tau$ and DM within FRB hosts such as that observed for Galactic pulsars. We assess the measurability of a $\tau - $DM$_{\rm host}$ relation through simulated observations of FRBs within the ASKAP/CRAFT survey, taking into account instrumental effects. We show that even when the FRB hosts intrinsically follow the $\tau - $DM relation measured for pulsars, this correlation cannot be inferred from FRB observations; this limitation arises mostly from the large variance around the average cosmic DM value given by the Macquart relation, the variance within the $\tau - $DM relation itself, and observational biases against large $\tau$ values. We argue that theoretical relations have little utility as priors on redshift, e.g., for purposes of galaxy identification, and that the recent lack of an observed correlation between scattering and DM in the ASKAP/CRAFT survey is not unexpected, even if our understanding of a $\tau - $DM$_{\rm host}$ relation is correct.</description>

      <title>Hubble Space Telescope Observations of the Interstellar Interloper 3I/ATLAS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02934v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present high angular resolution observations of the third known interstellar interloper, 3I/ATLAS, from the Hubble Space Telescope. The object is clearly active at 3.8 au pre-perihelion, showing dust emitted from the hot Sun-facing side of the nucleus and a weak, radiation pressure swept tail away from the Sun. We apply a simple model to estimate the mass loss rate in dust as dM/dt = 12 sqrt(a) kg/s, where a is the mean particle size in microns. With 1 &lt; a &lt; 100, we infer dM/dt = 12 to 120 kg/s. A fit to the surface brightness distribution of the inner coma limits the effective radius of the nucleus to be r &lt; 2.8 km, assuming red geometric albedo 0.04. Conversely, the nucleus cannot be smaller than 0.22 km in radius if its coma is supplied by sublimation of carbon monoxide, and must be larger if a less volatile molecule drives the mass loss.</description>

      <title>Modeling of non-rotating neutron stars in 5D Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09696v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the modeling of anisotropic magnetized static neutron stars within the framework of five-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (5D EGB) gravity. While Einstein's gravity has traditionally been employed to examine neutron stars, recent observational advancements have revealed its limitations in accurately describing high-mass astronomical objects-particularly in predicting or explaining certain observed neutron star masses. In response, this research seeks to address the limitations of Einstein's gravity in characterizing high-mass neutron stars by modifying the gravitational action and incorporating the Gauss-Bonnet term. This term holds significant dynamical relevance in higher dimensions, particularly within the context of five-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (EGB) gravity explored in this study, thereby providing a more realistic description of gravitational phenomena under extreme conditions. By deriving the generalized Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations for five-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity and utilizing the AV18 potential, we analyze the profiles of metric functions, density and pressure, gradients of density and pressure, the anisotropic function and its trace, mass-function and compactness, the mass-radius curve, surface redshift function, equation of state parameters, and radial and tangential sound speeds. Additionally, stability factors, adiabatic indices, and energy conditions are examined. The results indicate that all conditions are satisfied for specific values of the coupling constant, confirming the physical stability of the model. Furthermore, higher dimensions enhance resistance to gravitational collapse, resulting in an increase in the maximum mass predicted by the proposed model. Ultimately, calculations show that the modified Buchdahl inequality is satisfied as well.</description>
