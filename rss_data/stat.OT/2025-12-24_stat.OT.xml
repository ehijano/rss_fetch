      <title>Change Point Detection and Mean-Field Dynamics of Variable Productivity Hawkes Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many self-exciting systems change because endogenous amplification, as opposed to exogenous forcing, varies. We study a Hawkes process with fixed background rate and kernel, but piecewise time-varying productivity. For exponential kernels we derive closed-form mean-field relaxation after a change and a deterministic surrogate for post-change Fisher information, revealing a boundary layer in which change time information localises and saturates, while post-change level information grows linearly beyond a short transient. These results motivate a Bayesian change point procedure that stabilizes inference on finite windows. We illustrate the method on invasive pneumococcal disease incidence in The Gambia, identifying a decline in productivity aligned with pneumococcal conjugate vaccine rollout.</description>

      <title>Asia Cup 2025: A Structured T20 Match-Level Dataset and Exploratory Analysis for Cricket Analytics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a structured and comprehensive dataset corresponding to the 2025 Asia Cup T20 cricket tournament, designed to facilitate data-driven research in sports analytics. The dataset comprises records from all 19 matches of the tournament and includes 61 variables covering team scores, wickets, powerplay statistics, boundary counts, toss decisions, venues, and player-specific highlights. To demonstrate its analytical value, we conduct an exploratory data analysis focusing on team performance indicators, boundary distributions, and scoring patterns. The dataset is publicly released through Zenodo under a CC-BY 4.0 license to support reproducibility and further research in cricket analytics, predictive modeling, and strategic decision-making. This work contributes an open, machine-readable benchmark dataset for advancing cricket analytics research.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Question Framing on the Performance of Automatic Occupation Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05584v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Occupational data play a vital role in research, official statistics, and policymaking, yet their collection and accurate classification remain a challenge. This study investigates the effects of occupational question wording on data variability and the performance of automatic coding tools. We conducted and replicated a split-ballot survey experiment in Germany using two common occupational question formats: one focusing on "job title" (Berufsbezeichnung) and another on "berufliche T\"atigkeit" (loosely translated as occupation or occupational task). Our analysis reveals that automatic coding tools, such as CASCOT and OccuCoDe, exhibit sensitivity to the form and origin of the data. Specifically, these tools were more efficient when coding responses to the job title question format than the occupational task format, suggesting a potential way to improve the respective questions for many German surveys. In a subsequent "detailed tasks and duties" question, providing a guiding example prompted respondents to give longer answers without broadening the range of unique words they used. These findings highlight the importance of harmonising survey questions and and ensuring that automatic coding tools are robust to differences in question wording. Further research is needed to optimise question design and coding tools for greater accuracy and applicability in occupational data collection.</description>
