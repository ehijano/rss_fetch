      <title>Nongray EWB and WSGG Radiation Modeling in Oxy-Fuel Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: According to a recent U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventory (1), about 42% of 2008 CO$_2$ (a greenhouse gas) emissions in the US were from burning fossil fuels (especially coal) to generate electricity. The 2010 U.S. International Energy Outlook (2) predicts that the world energy generation using coal and natural gas will continue to increase steadily in the future. This results in increased concentrations of atmospheric CO$_2$, and calls for serious efforts to control its emissions from power plants through carbon capture technologies. Oxy-fuel combustion is a carbon capture technology in which the fossil fuel is burned in an atmosphere free from nitrogen, thereby significantly reducing the relative amount of N$_2$ in the flue-gas and increasing the mole fractions of H$_2$O and CO$_2$. This low concentration of N$_2$ facilitates the capture of CO$_2$. The dramatic change in the flue composition results in changes in its thermal, chemical, and radiative properties. From the modeling point of view, existing transport, combustion, and radiation models that have parameters tuned for air-fuel combustion (where N$_2$ is the dominant gaseous species in the flue) may need revision to improve the predictions of numerical simulations of oxy-fuel combustion. In this chapter, we consider recent efforts done to revise radiation modeling for oxy-fuel combustion, where five new radiative-property models were proposed to be used in oxy-fuel environments. All these models use the weighted-sum-of-gray-gases model (WSGGM). We apply and compare their performance in two oxy-fuel environments. Both environments consist of only H$_2$O and CO$_2$ as mixture species, and thus there is no N$_2$ dilution, but the environments vary in the mole fractions of these two species.</description>

      <title>Equivalence between the zero distributions of the Riemann zeta function and a two-dimensional Ising model with randomly distributed competing interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we prove the equivalence between the zero distributions of the Riemann zeta function {\zeta}(s) and a two-dimensional (2D) Ising model with a mixture of ferromagnetic and randomly distributed competing interactions. At first, we review briefly the characteristics of the Riemann hypothesis and its connections to physics, in particular, to statistical physics. Second, we build a 2D Ising model, M_(FI+SGI)^2D, in which interactions between the nearest neighboring spins are ferromagnetic along one crystallographic direction while competing ferromagnetic/antiferromagnetic interactions are randomly distributed along another direction. Third, we prove that all energy eigenvalues of this 2D Ising model M_(FI+SGI)^2D are real and randomly distributed as the M\"obius function {\mu}(n), the Dirichlet L(s,\c{hi}_k ) function as well as the Riemann zeta function {\zeta}(s). Fourth, we prove that the eigenvectors of the 2D Ising model M_(FI+SGI)^2D are constructed by the eigenvectors of the 1D Ising model with phases related to the Riemann zeta function {\zeta}(s), via the relation {\omega}({\gamma}_2j) between the angle {\omega} and the energy eigenvalues {\gamma}_2j, which form the Hilbert-P\'olya space. Fifth, we prove that all the zeros of the partition function of the 2D Ising model M_(FI+SGI)^2D lie on an unit circle in a complex temperature plane (i.e. Fisher zeros), which can be mapped to the zero distribution of the Dirichlet L(s,\c{hi}_k ) function and also the Riemann zeta function {\zeta}(s) in the critical line. In a conclusion, we have proven the closure of the nontrivial zero distribution of the L(s,\c{hi}_k ) function (including the Riemann zeta function {\zeta}(s)).</description>

      <title>Statistical Gravity through Affine Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I propose a possible way to introduce the effect of temperature (defined through the virial theorem) into Einstein's theory of general relativity. This requires the computation of a path integral on a 10-dimensional flat space in a four dimensional spacetime lattice. Standard path integral Monte Carlo methods can be used to compute it.</description>
