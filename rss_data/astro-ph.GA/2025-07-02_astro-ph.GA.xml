      <title>LIGHTS. A robust technique to identify galaxy edges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The LIGHTS survey is imaging galaxies at a depth and spatial resolution comparable to what the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will produce in 10 years (i.e., $\sim$31 mag/arcsec$^2$; 3$\sigma$ in areas equivalent to 10$^{\prime\prime}$$\times$ 10$^{\prime\prime}$). This opens up the possibility of probing the edge of galaxies, as the farthest location of in-situ star formation, with a precision that we have been unable to achieve in the past. Traditionally, galaxy edges have been analyzed in one-dimension through ellipse averaging or visual inspection. Our approach allows for a two-dimensional exploration of galaxy edges, which is crucial for understanding deviations from disc symmetry and the environmental effects on galaxy growth. In this paper, we propose a novel method using the second derivative of the surface mass density map of a galaxy to determine its edges. This offers a robust quantitative alternative to traditional edge-detection methods when deep imaging is available. Our technique incorporates Wiener-Hunt deconvolution to remove the effect of the Point Spread Function (PSF) by the galaxy itself. By applying our methodology to the LIGHTS galaxy NGC 3486, we identify the edge at 205$^{\prime\prime}$ $\pm$ 5$^{\prime\prime}$. At this radius, the stellar surface mass density is $\sim$1 M$_\odot$/pc$^2$, supporting a potential connection between galaxy edges and a threshold for in-situ star formation. Our two-dimensional analysis on NGC 3486 reveals an edge asymmetry of $\sim$5$\%$. These techniques will be of paramount importance for a physically motivated determination of the sizes of galaxies in ultra-deep surveys such as LSST, Euclid and Roman.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Star Formation and Black Hole Accretion Rates in Galaxy Mergers in IllustrisTNG50</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many theoretical and observational studies have suggested that galaxy mergers may trigger enhanced star formation or active galactic nuclei (AGN) activity. We present an analysis of merging and nonmerging galaxies from $0.2 \leq z \leq 3$ in the IllustrisTNG50 simulation. These galaxies encompass a range of masses ($M_\star &gt; 10^{8}M_\odot$), multiple merger stages, and mass ratios ($\geq1:10$). We examine the effect that galaxy mergers have on star formation and black hole accretion rates in the TNG50 universe. We additionally investigate how galaxy and black hole mass, merger stage, merger mass ratio, and redshift affect these quantities. Mergers in our sample show excess specific star formation rates (sSFR) at $z \leq 3$ and enhanced specific black hole accretion rates (sBHAR) at $z \lesssim 2$. The difference between sSFRs and sBHARs in the merging sample compared to the non-merging sample increases as redshift decreases. Additionally, we show that these enhancements persist for at least $\sim1$ Gyr after the merger event. Investigating how mergers behave in the TNG50 simulation throughout cosmic time enables both a better appreciation of the importance of spatial resolution in cosmological simulations and a better basis to understand our high-$z$ universe with observations from \textit{JWST}.</description>

      <title>Breaking Through the Cosmic Fog: JWST/NIRSpec Constraints on Ionizing Photon Escape in Reionization-Era Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The escape fraction of Lyman continuum photons (fesc(LyC)) is the last key unknown in our understanding of cosmic reionization. Directly estimating the escape fraction (fesc) of ionizing photons in the epoch of reionization (EoR) is impossible, due to the opacity of the intergalactic medium (IGM). However, a high fesc leaves clear imprints in the spectrum of a galaxy, due to reduced nebular line and continuum emission, which also leads to bluer UV continuum slopes (betaUV). Here, we exploit the large archive of deep JWST/NIRSpec spectra from the DAWN JWST Archive to analyze over 1'400 galaxies at 5 &lt; zspec &lt; 10 and constrain their fesc based on SED fitting enhanced with a picket fence model. We identify 71 high-confidence sources with significant fesc based on Bayes factor analysis strongly favouring fesc &gt; 0 over fesc = 0 solutions. We compare the characteristics of this high-escape subset against both the parent sample and established diagnostics including betaUV slope, O32, and SFR surface density (SigmaSFR). For the overall sample, we find that most sources have a low escape fraction (&lt;1%), however, a small subset of sources seems to emit a large number of their ionizing photons into the IGM, such that the average fesc is found to be ~10%, as needed for galaxies to drive reionization. Although uncertainties remain regarding recent burstiness and the intrinsic stellar ionizing photon output at low metallicities, our results demonstrate the unique capability of JWST/NIRSpec to identify individual LyC leakers, measure average fesc and thus constrain the drivers of cosmic reionization.</description>

      <title>The luminosity history of fading local quasars over 10$^{4-5}$ years as observed by VLT/MUSE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of five nearby active galaxies featuring large (tens of kpc) extended emission-line regions (EELRs). The study is based on large-format integral field spectroscopic observations conducted with the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) at the Very Large Telescope (VLT). The spatially resolved kinematics of the ionized gas and stellar components show signs of rotation, bi-conical outflows, and complex behavior likely associated with past interactions. Analysis of the physical conditions of the EELRs indicates that in these systems, the active galactic nucleus (AGN) is the primary ionization source. Using radiative transfer simulations, we compare the ionization state across the EELRs to estimate the required AGN bolometric luminosities at different radial distances. Then, considering the projected light travel time, we reconstruct the inferred AGN luminosity curves. We find that all sources are consistent with a fading trend in intrinsic AGN luminosity by 0.2--3 dex over timescales of 40,000--80,000 years, with a time dependence consistent with previous studies of fading AGNs. These results support the hypothesis that most AGN undergo significant fluctuations in their accretion rates over multiple timescales ranging from 10,000 to 1,000,000 years, as proposed by existing theoretical models. These results provide new insights into the transient phases of AGN activity at previously unexplored scales and their potential long-term impact on their host galaxies through various feedback mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Star formation drivers across the M33 disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the star formation process across the disk of M33 using a multiwavelength dataset and disk dynamics. We computed numerically equilibrium values of gas densities and scale heights across the disk, taking into account dark matter and testing several analytic approximations that are often used to estimate these variables and the hydrostatic pressure. Orthogonal regressions and hierarchical Bayesian models, as well as random forest (RF) analyses, were used to establish the fundamental relations at physical scales from 160~pc to 1~kpc. The gas pressure, is the main driver of the star formation rate (SFR) surface density throughout the whole star-forming disk of M33. High-pressure regions enhance the atomic-to-molecular gas conversion, with the molecular hydrogen mass surface density being tightly correlated to pressure and a uniform scaling law throughout the M33 disk. The relation between pressure and SFR surface density differs, showing a change in slope from the inner to the outer disk. Scaling laws do not depend on the physical scale and brings out an intrinsic scatter linked to variations in the efficiency and relative age of the molecular gas-to-stars conversion. In the inner disk, where spiral arms are present and the stellar surface density dominates gravity, the pressure and SFR surface densidy establish an almost linear correlation with a smaller dispersion than that of the molecular gas -- SFR surface density relation. In the atomic gas-dominated outer disk, the SFR density has a steeper dependence on pressure, which we propose could be the result of an increasing fraction of diffuse molecular gas that does not form stars.</description>

      <title>A catalog of molecular clouds possibly associated with Galactic infrared bubbles I. The Southern Galactic plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have carried out a morphological search for molecular clouds possibly associated with 48 Galactic infrared bubbles with angular radii of $&gt;1'$ in the southern Galactic plane of $295^\circ \le l\le 350^\circ$ and $|b|\le 1^\circ$ presented by Hanaoka et al. (2019). 116 molecular clouds in the $(l,b,V_{\rm LSR})$ space are identified from the archival $^{12}$CO~$J$~=~1--0 line data obtained by the Mopra Southern Galactic plane survey, where $V_{\rm LSR}$ is the CO-line radial velocity. The kinematic distances are derived from $V_{\rm LSR}$ using the most accurate rotation curve of the Milky Way. We also present measurements of velocity dispersion, size parameter, molecular mass, and virial mass of 116 molecular clouds. This catalog is presented to investigate star formation and the origin of molecular shells and cavities, possibly associated with infrared bubbles. CO line intensity maps and position-velocity diagrams of the molecular clouds are available online as supplementary data.</description>

      <title>Avoiding (photo-$z$) Catastrophe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectral modeling codes that estimate photometric redshifts (photo-$z$) are a powerful and often reliable method for determining redshifts of galaxies. However, there are notable instances where degeneracies in spectral energy distribution (SED) colors lead to `catastrophic' failures. We highlight the case of COSBO-7, a dusty, intermediate-$z$ galaxy that masqueraded as a high-$z$ source, because it demonstrates a unique scenario where photo-$z$ codes run into issues despite extensive multi-wavelength photometry. We advocate that photo-$z$ fitting should aim to: (1) use the entire available SED (UV--radio) whenever possible to help break color degeneracies, (2) allow flexible dust attenuation prescriptions, both in terms of the attenuation curve slope and a varying 2175{\AA} absorption feature, and (3) implement uncertainty floors to account for limitations in spectral models and also on the photometry itself.</description>

      <title>Calibrating $\rm{DM_{IGM}}-z$ relation using host galaxies of FRBs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are extragalactic radio transients that offer valuable insight of intergalactic medium (IGM). However, the dispersion measure (DM) contributed by IGM ($\rm{DM_{IGM}}$) is degenerated with that from the host galaxy ($\rm{DM_{host}}$), necessitating calibration of the $\rm{DM_{IGM}}$$-z$ relation for cosmological applications. As $\rm{DM_{host}}$ is expected to correlate with host galaxy properties, it is feasible to estimate $\rm{DM_{host}}$ from observable host characteristics. In this study, we conduct spectral energy distribution (SED) and S\'ersic model fittings to derive the parameters of FRB host galaxies. Then, we examine the correlations between the excess dispersion measure ($\rm{DM_{exc}}$) and host galaxy parameters, including star formation rate (SFR), stellar mass, specific star formation rate (sSFR), inclination angle, and projected area. A tight correlation between $\rm{DM_{exc}}$ and sSFR is found. This correlation is utilized to estimate the $\rm{DM_{host}}$ of FRBs, providing a method to calibrate the DM$_{\rm IGM}-z$ relation. This approach leads to a notable improvement in calibration performance.</description>

      <title>The Evolutionary Pathway of Low-mass Supermassive Black Holes at Intermediate Redshift: Insights from the JADES Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the relationship between supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and their host galaxies at different redshifts is crucial for unraveling the processes of SMBH-galaxy co-evolution. We present the properties of nine type 1 Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) at intermediate redshift ($2&lt;z&lt;4$) using the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES). All of them show the significant $\mathrm{H\alpha}$ broad line and the AGN contribution in spectral energy distribution. Our sample covers SMBH masses of $10^{6.1-8.2}\ M_\odot$ and stellar masses of $10^{9.3-11.0}\ M_\odot$, comparable to those of the AGNs observed in the local universe. In the low-mass SMBH regime ($&lt;10^{8}\ M_\odot$), the BH-to-stellar mass ratios in our sample ($0.01-0.1\%$) differ from those of the AGNs at $z&gt;4$ ($1-10\%$), suggesting that black holes and galaxies may trace different evolutionary pathways at intermediate and high redshift. We also perform 2D image decomposition using GALFIT to constrain the bulge mass by evaluating the bulge contribution in the rest-frame near-infrared flux. We identify the AGNs with low BH-to-bulge mass ratios compared to those observed in the nearby bulge-dominant galaxies. This finding suggests the existence of a galaxy-first evolutionary path, in which bulge formation occurs before substantial gas is efficiently accreted onto the central engine.</description>

      <title>Spatially Resolving the Fundamental Elements of Reionization in Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic reionization marks a critical epoch when the first galaxies ionized the intergalactic medium through the escape of Lyman continuum (LyC) radiation. Young, massive star clusters are believed to be the primary LyC sources, yet the physical mechanisms enabling LyC escape remain poorly understood. Most existing studies rely on spatially integrated observations, which lack the resolution to resolve internal galaxy structure and pinpoint where and how LyC photons escape. To address this, we propose a science case for the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) that enables spatially resolved spectroscopy of LyC-emitting star clusters and their environments in low-redshift galaxies. This requires a UV integral field unit (IFU) with coverage down to ~ 900 Angstrom and a spatial resolution of 10-100 pc-capabilities essential for directly detecting LyC escape and mapping the surrounding interstellar medium. With such instrumentation, we will map cluster-scale LyC escape fractions, characterize the physical conditions of the surrounding interstellar medium, and directly observe feedback-driven outflows that facilitate LyC leakage. These observations will enable novel calibrations of indirect LyC indicators at unprecedented spatial resolution and establish direct connections between local LyC processes and those in high-redshift, clumpy star-forming galaxies. In the long run, this program will build the physical framework needed to understand how galaxies reionized the early universe and shaped its subsequent evolution.</description>

      <title>The birth of young radio jets in changing-look AGN: a population study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Changing-Look Active Galactic Nuclei (CLAGN) are a rare subset of AGN that show significant changes to the flux of broad Balmer emission lines. Recent studies of CLAGN, such as 1ES 1927+654 and Mrk 590, have revealed that changes in the optically observed accretion rate are accompanied by changes in radio activity. We present a time-domain population study of 474 spectroscopically confirmed CLAGN at radio wavelengths using the Australia SKA Pathfinder Variable and Slow Transients Survey and the Very Large Array Sky Survey. We compare the radio properties of this CLAGN sample to a control sample of AGN that have not had recent changing-look events, and to AGN that were found to have transitioned from radio-quiet to radio-loud over 10-year timescales in VLASS. For 20 newly studied CLAGN detected in ASKAP VAST, we do not detect Mrk 590 or 1ES 1927+654-like fading of the radio flux in the 10 years following changing-look events. For 6 CLAGN with a sufficiently low redshift and high enough mass, we rule out a Mrk 590-like flare. We find that at the population level, CLAGN have higher VAST/VLASS detection rates, lower fractions of radio loudness, and higher variability rates in the 1 GHz frequency compared to the control AGN. Through VLA observations of radio SEDs and Magellan spectroscopic observations, we do not find evidence of a link between CLAGN and AGN that transitioned from radio-loud to radio-quiet in VLASS. We discuss the implications of this study for the physical mechanisms that drive enhanced accretion episodes.</description>

      <title>Radial velocities and stellar populations for a sample of MATLAS survey dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectroscopic observations are essential for confirming associations, measuring kinematics, and determining stellar populations in dwarf galaxies. Here, we present Keck Cosmic Web Imager (KCWI) spectra for 12 MATLAS survey dwarfs. For 9, we confirm recession velocities consistent with their literature-assumed host galaxies. We propose revisions of the host galaxy associations for MATLAS-631, 1494, and 1938. For MATLAS-1494, our measured redshift reclassifies it from an ultra-diffuse galaxy candidate to a dwarf galaxy that is of smaller physical size and places it in the field. It also appears old and passive, providing a challenge to models that invoke quenching by tidal effects. Additionally, we measure stellar population estimates for 7 of the 12 galaxies, finding a 'mixed bag' of old quenched galaxies and those that are currently forming stars. Compared to the literature we find generally younger ages and higher metallicities. This result may help reconcile the observed offset of MATLAS survey dwarf galaxies from the universal stellar mass-metallicity relationship reported by Heesters et al. (2023).</description>

Abstract: Light reprocessed by dust grains emitting in the infrared allows the study of the physics at play in dusty, embedded regions, where ultraviolet and optical wavelengths are attenuated. Infrared telescopes such as JWST have made it possible to study the earliest feedback phases, when stars are shielded by cocoons of gas and dust. This phase is crucial for unravelling the effects of feedback from young stars, leading to their emergence and the dispersal of their host molecular clouds. Here we show that the transition from the embedded to the exposed phase of star formation is short (&lt; 4 Myr) and sometimes almost absent (&lt; 1 Myr), across a sample of 37 nearby star-forming galaxies, covering a wide range of morphologies from massive barred spirals to irregular dwarfs. The short duration of the dust-clearing timescales suggests a predominant role of pre-supernova feedback mechanisms in revealing newborn stars, confirming previous results on smaller samples and allowing, for the first time, a statistical analysis of their dependencies. We find that the timescales associated with mid-infrared emission at 21 {\mu}m, tracing a dust-embedded feedback phase, are controlled by a complex interplay between giant molecular cloud properties (masses and velocity dispersions) and galaxy morphology. We report relatively longer durations of the embedded phase of star formation in barred spiral galaxies, while this phase is significantly reduced in low-mass irregular dwarf galaxies. We discuss tentative trends with gas-phase metallicity, which may favor faster cloud dispersal at low metallicities.</description>

      <title>Impact of a granular mass distribution on the orbit of S2 in the Galactic center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The orbit of the S2 star around Sagittarius A* provides a unique opportunity to test general relativity and study dynamical processes near a supermassive black hole. Observations have shown that the orbit of S2 is consistent with a Schwarzschild orbit at a 10$\sigma$ confidence level, constraining the amount of extended mass within its orbit to less than 1200 M$_\odot$, under the assumption of a smooth, spherically symmetric mass distribution. In this work we investigate the effects on the S2 orbit of granularity in the mass distribution, assuming it consists of a cluster of equal-mass objects surrounding Sagittarius A*. Using a fast dynamical approach validated by full N-body simulations, we perform a large set of simulations of the motion of S2 with different realizations of the cluster objects distribution. We find that granularity can induce significant deviations from the orbit in case of a smooth potential, causing precession of the orbital plane and a variation of the in-plane precession. Interactions with the cluster objects also induce a sort of "Brownian motion" of Sagittarius A*. Mock data analysis reveals that these effects could produce observable deviations in the trajectory of S2 from a Schwarzschild orbit, especially near apocenter. During the next apocenter passage of S2 in 2026, astrometric residuals in Declination may exceed the astrometric accuracy threshold of GRAVITY of about 30 $\mu as$, as it happens in 35 to 60% of simulations for black holes of 20 to 100 M$_\odot$. This presents a unique opportunity to detect, for the first time, scattering effects on the orbit of S2 caused by stellar-mass black holes, thanks to the remarkable precision achievable with GRAVITY. We also demonstrate that any attempt to constrain the extended mass enclosed within the orbit of S2 must explicitly account for granularity in the stellar-mass black hole population.</description>

      <title>CHemical Evolution in MassIve star-forming COres (CHEMICO). I. Evolution of the temperature structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Increasing evidence shows that most stars in the Milky Way, including the Sun, are born in star-forming regions containing also high-mass stars, but due to both observational and theoretical challenges, our comprehension of their chemical evolution is far less clear than that of their low-mass counterparts. We present the project "CHemical Evolution of MassIve star-froming COres" (CHEMICO). The project aims at investigating any aspect of the chemical evolution of high-mass star-forming cores by observing representatives of the three main evolutionary categories: high-mass starless cores, high-mass protostellar objects, and ultra-compact HII regions. We carried out an unbiased spectral line survey of the entire bandwidth at 3, 2, and 1.2 mm with the 30m telescope of the Insitut de Radioastronomie millimetrique towards three targets that represent the three evolutionary stages. The number of lines and species detected increases with evolution. In this first work, we derive the temperature structure of the targets through the analysis of the carbon-bearing species C2H, c-C3H, c-C3H2, C4H, CH3CCH, HC3N, CH3CN, and HC5N. The excitation temperature, Tex, increases with evolution in each species, although not in the same way. Hydrocarbons tend to be associated with the smallest Tex values and enhancements with evolution, while cyanides are associated with the highest Tex values and enhancements. In each target, the higher the number of atoms in the molecule, the higher Tex tends to be. The temperature structure evolves from a cold, uniform envelope traced by simple hydrocarbons in the high-mass starless core stage, to a more stratified envelope in the protostellar stage (made by a hot core, a shell with intermediate Tex, and a larger cold envelope), to finally a hot core surrounded only by a cold envelope in the Ultracompact HII stage.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Quiescent Black Hole Population of Nearby Dwarf Galaxies with the Habitable World Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation and growth of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) remain a significant unsolved problem in astrophysics, particularly in the low-mass regime, where observations are sparse. The Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO), with its diffraction-limited imaging and high-resolution UV-optical spectroscopy, presents a unique opportunity to explore the demographics of massive black holes (MBHs) in nearby dwarf galaxies. We propose a program to dynamically detect quiescent MBHs with masses as low as $10^{4.5} \, \rm M_\odot$ in galaxies within $10-30$ Mpc, by resolving stellar velocity dispersions down to 30 $\rm km \, s^{-1}$. This effort will dramatically extend current black hole-host galaxy scaling relations into the dwarf regime, probing the fundamental connection between black hole seeds and their environments. Using a volume-limited sample of $\sim 100$ dwarf galaxies drawn from existing catalogs, HWO will resolve the gravitational sphere of influence of MBHs and enable precision measurements of stellar kinematics via Ca II triplet absorption lines. These observations will test predictions from competing seed formation scenarios -- light seeds from Population III remnants versus heavy seeds from direct collapse -- and clarify whether dwarf galaxies retain imprints of their initial black hole population. The results will offer critical insight into SMBH formation channel and the co-evolution of black holes and galaxies across cosmic time.</description>

      <title>The Close AGN Reference Survey (CARS): A comparison between sub-mm and optical AGN diagnostic diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $L_{\rm IR}-L_{\rm HCN}$ relation suggests that there is a tight connection between dense gas and star formation. We use data from the Close AGN Reference Survey (CARS) to investigate the dense gas - star formation relation in AGN hosting galaxies, and the use of dense gas as an active galactic nuclei (AGN) diagnostic. Our sample contains five Type-1 (unobscured) AGN that were observed with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) with the aim to detect HCN(4-3), HCO$^+$(4-3) and CS(7-6). We detect the dense gas emission required for this analysis in 3 of the 5 targets. We find that despite the potential impact from the AGN on the line fluxes of these sources, they still follow the $L_{\rm IR}-L_{\rm HCN}$ relation. We then go on to test claims that the HCN/HCO+ and HCN/CS line ratios can be used as a tool to classify AGN in the sub-mm HCN diagram. We produce the classic ionised emission-line ratio diagnostics (the so-called BPT diagrams), using available CARS data from the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE). We then compare the BPT classification with the sub-mm classification made using the dense gas tracers. Where it was possible to complete the analysis we find general agreement between optical and sub-mm classified gas excitation mechanisms. This suggests that AGN can contribute to the excitation of both the low density gas in the warm ionised medium and the high density gas in molecular clouds simultaneously, perhaps through X-ray, cosmic ray or shock heating mechanisms.</description>

      <title>DESI DR2 reference mocks: clustering results from Uchuu-BGS and LRG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this work is to construct mock galaxy catalogues that accurately reproduce the redshift evolution of galaxy number density, clustering statistics, and baryonic properties, such as stellar mass for luminous red galaxies (LRGs) and absolute magnitude in the $r$-band for the bright galaxy sample (BGS), based on the first three years of observations from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). To achieve this, we applied the subhalo abundance matching (SHAM) technique to the Uchuu $N$-body simulation, which follows the evolution of 2.1 trillion particles within a volume of $8\,h^{-3}\,\mathrm{Gpc}^{3}$, assuming a Planck base-$\Lambda$CDM cosmology. Using SHAM, we populated Uchuu subhalos with LRGs and BGS-BRIGHT ($r&lt;19.5$) galaxies up to redshift $z=1.1$, assigning stellar masses to LRGs and luminosities to BGS galaxies (up to $M_{\rm r}\leq 20$). Furthermore, we analyzed the clustering dependence on stellar mass and luminosity for each tracer. Our results show that the Uchuu BGS-BRIGHT and LRG mocks accurately reproduce the observed redshift evolution of clustering, with better than 5\% agreement for separations of $1&lt;r&lt;20\,h^{-1}\,\mathrm{Mpc}$ and below 10\% for $0.1&lt;r&lt;1\,h^{-1}\,\mathrm{Mpc}$. For the Uchuu-LRG mock, we successfully captured the stellar mass dependence of clustering, while for the Uchuu-BGS mock, we replicated the clustering for various volume-limited subsamples. We also find good agreement between the data and mocks in the dependence of large-scale bias on luminosity for BGS-BRIGHT galaxies and on stellar mass for LRGs. Altogether, these results equip DESI with robust tools for generating high-fidelity lightcones for the remainder of the survey, thereby enhancing our understanding of the galaxy--halo connection.</description>

      <title>The Effect of Weak Cosmic Ray Heating Events on the Desorption of $\rm H_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The typical amount of molecular hydrogen (${\rm H_2}$) in interstellar ices is not known, but significant freeze-out of ${\rm H_2}$ on dust grains is not expected. However, chemical models ubiquitously predict large amounts of $\rm H_2$ freeze-out in dense cloud conditions, and specialized treatments are needed to control the $\rm H_2$ population on grains. Here we present a numerical desorption model where the effect of weak heating events induced by cosmic rays (CRs) that heat grains to temperatures of a few tens of Kelvin at high frequencies is included, improving upon earlier desorption models that only consider strong heating events (maximum grain temperature close to 100 K) that occur at a low frequency. A temperature of a few tens of Kelvin is high enough to induce efficient desorption of $\rm H_2$, but we find that even the weak heating events do not occur often enough to lead to significant $\rm H_2$ desorption. Taking the weak heating events into account does affect the predicted abundances of other lightly-bound species, but the effect is restricted to low column densities. We make here the canonical assumption that the grains are spherical with a radius of 0.1 $\mu$m. It is conceivable that in the case of a grain size distribution, weak heating events could provide a boost to $\rm H_2$ desorption coming off small grains, which are the most numerous. Further studies are still required to better quantify the role of CRs in the desorption of $\rm H_2$ and other weakly bound species.</description>

      <title>New clues on the extended HeII ionization in IZw18 from GTC/MEGARA and JWST/MIRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: IZw18 is one of the lowest-metallicity star-forming galaxies known at z$\sim$0, considered a unique local analogue of the first galaxies. The origin of its hard ionizing continuum, expected to be a common feature in the early Universe and traced by He\textsc{ii} emission lines, remains intensely debated and challenging to explain. Here we combine optical (GTC/MEGARA) and mid-infrared (JWST/MIRI) integral field spectroscopic observations for IZw18 to shed new light on the high-ionization phenomenon. This letter reports the first detection of the high-ionization [Ne\textsc{v}]14.32 $\mu$m line in IZw18. Its emission is spatially extended and coincident with the He\textsc{ii} peak, revealing the presence of highly energetic ionizing sources that surpass mechanisms previously proposed on the basis of He\textsc{ii} alone. Our kinematic studies highlight that the He\textsc{ii}$\lambda$4686-emitting gas displays higher velocity dispersions and a different velocity pattern compared to the H$\beta$ emission, suggesting the presence of energetic processes such as shocks or stellar-driven feedback. Additionally, integrated spectra show asymmetric blueshifted profiles in the He\textsc{ii}$\lambda$4686 line, possibly indicating \textbf{early-stage} stellar-driven outflows potentially facilitating future ionizing photon leakage. Our spatial analysis also reveals differences in structure between the emission of H$\beta$ and He\textsc{ii}$\lambda$4686, with the He\textsc{ii}$\lambda$4686 peak offset by a projected distance of 140 pc from the peak H$\beta$ emission. This indicates distinct locations for the most extreme ionizing sources compared to moderate ionizing sources. Our findings underscore the complex interplay of physical processes in extremely metal-poor environments with \textbf{high-ionized} gas, offering new insights into the conditions prevailing in the early galaxies.</description>

      <title>Kinematic Distortions of the High-Redshift Universe as Seen from Quasar Proper Motions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advances in optical astrometry allow us to infer the non-radial kinematic structure of the Universe directly from observations. Here I use a supervised machine learning neural network method to predict 1.57 million redshifts based on several photometric and metadata classifier parameters from the unWISE mid-infrared database and from Gaia. These estimates are used to divide the sample into three redshift bins: 1-2, 2-3, and $&gt;3$. For each subset, all available Gaia proper motions are used in a global vector spherical harmonic solution to degree 3 (30 fitting vector functions). I find significant differences in a few fitted proper motion patterns at different redshifts. The largest signals are seen in the comparison of the vector spherical harmonic fits for the 1-2 and 2-3 redshift bins. The significant harmonics include a rigid spin, a dipole glide from the north Galactic pole to the south and an additional quadrupole distortion. Validation tests with filtered subsamples indicate that the detected effect can be caused by hidden systematic errors in astrometry. The results are verified by using an independent source of redshifts and computing the observer's Galactocentric acceleration. This study offers a new observational test of alternative cosmological models.</description>

      <title>Stellar-gas kinematic misalignments in EAGLE: enhanced SMBH growth in misaligned galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar-gas kinematic misalignments are a transient phenomenon observed in $\sim11\%$ of the local galaxy population. According to current models, misaligned gas is expected to lose angular momentum and relax into the galactic plane on timescales of $\sim0.1$ Gyr, driving gas toward the central regions of the galaxy. Recent observational studies have found a higher incidence of active galactic nuclei in misaligned galaxies. We use the EAGLE simulation to explore the connection between stellar-gas misalignments and enhanced central black hole (BH) activity between $0&lt;z&lt;1$. We use a sample of $\sim5600$ galaxies with a stellar mass of $M_{*}\geqslant \mathrm{10^{9.5}}$ M$_\odot$ that feature long-lived stellar-gas alignment, counter-rotation, and unstable misalignments (non-coplanarity). Over time windows of $0.5$ Gyr, we find that galaxies experiencing an unstable misalignment have systematically enhanced BH growth during relaxation. Galaxies with long-term counter-rotation show little difference in BH growth compared to aligned galaxies. We suggest that this enhanced BH growth is driven by loss of angular momentum in unstable misaligned gas discs which is able to drive gas inward toward the vicinity of the BH. At $z\approx0.1$, we find a greater incidence of overmassive BHs in galaxies that have spent a greater fraction of time with unstable stellar-gas kinematic misalignments over the preceding $\approx2$ Gyr compared to control samples of aligned galaxies. In agreement with observations, we conclude that BH activity is enhanced in misaligned systems in EAGLE and suggest that the presence of overmassive BHs may be indicative of a past stellar-gas kinematic misalignment.</description>

      <title>Morphology and stellar populations of a candidate ultra-diffuse galaxy in early Euclid and Rubin imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present multi-wavelength imaging and analysis of a low surface brightness (LSB) dwarf galaxy in the Extended Chandra Deep Field South (ECDFS), SMDG0333094-280938, with particular emphasis on data from the Euclid space telescope and from the Vera C.\ Rubin Observatory. The galaxy is clumpy and blue, and appears to host globular clusters (GCs), suggesting a distance of ~50-60 Mpc which would make the dwarf an ultra-diffuse galaxy (UDG). We carry out spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting from the far-ultraviolet to the near-infrared, in order to estimate the galaxy age and metallicity. We infer a recent peak of star formation that may have led to the formation of the UDG through feedback-driven expansion. This early analysis illustrates how Euclid and Rubin are poised to identify and characterize many thousands of UDGs and other LSB galaxies in the near future, including their GCs and stellar populations.</description>

      <title>The Lockman-SpReSO project. Spectroscopic analysis of Type 1 AGN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first optical-UV spectral systematic analysis of 30 Type 1 AGN selected in the FIR and X-ray in the Lockman-SpReSO Survey. The sample of faint objects (m_B = 19.6-21.8) covers a large redshift range of 0.33 &gt; z &gt; 4.97 with high S/N (~21 on average). A detailed spectral analysis based on the Quasar Main Sequence phenomenology prescription was applied to deblend the principal optical-UV emitting regions. Our sample spans a bolometric luminosity range of 44.85 &lt; log Lbol &lt; 47.87, absolute B-magnitude -20.46 &gt; M_B &gt; -26.14, BH mass of 7.59 &lt; log MBH &lt; 9.80, and Eddington ratio -1.70 &lt; log REdd &lt; 0.56. The analysis shows that 18 high-z objects correspond to Population B, whereas three low-z fall in Populations A2, B1, and B1+. The remaining eight are candidates to be Pop. B and one Pop. A object. None of them are extreme accretors. We looked for tendencies in our sample and compared them with other samples with different selection criteria. Evidence for winds was explored using CIV1549 line half-height centroid cmed finding wind velocities between 941 and -1587 kms-1. This result is consistent with samples with similar ranges of z and M_B. The Baldwin effect showed a slope of -0.23 pm 0.03 dex consistent with previous studies. Spectra from twelve objects in our sample were found in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 17 database. We applied the same methodology to compare them to our spectra, finding no evidence of variability.</description>

      <title>Resolving Individual Stars in Nearby Large Galaxies with the Habitable Worlds Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The varied and dynamic evolutionary histories of galaxies give rise to the stunning diversity in their properties that we observe in the present-day universe. HST, and now JWST, have pioneered the study of resolved individual stars in the Milky Way and other members of the Local Group, uncovering the drivers of their morphological, star formation, and chemical evolution. HWO will constitute a paradigm shift: introducing the ability to panchromatically resolve the main bodies of every galaxy in the Local Volume into their constituent stars. In this science case, we summarize the breakthrough progress that HWO will advance in the field of galaxy evolution through resolved stellar populations. HWO will transform our understanding of galaxies in three distance regimes: (1) in the nearest galaxies ($\sim$5 Mpc), where it will resolve stars below the oldest Main Sequence Turnoff, enabling precision stellar astrophysics and star formation history (SFH) inferences to the earliest cosmic times; (2) in the greater Local Volume ($\sim$20 Mpc), where it will resolve stars below the Red Clump, providing access to accurate SFHs for hundreds of galaxies, spanning the entire Hubble Sequence; and (3) out to cosmological volumes ($\sim$50+ Mpc), providing access to the luminous stellar populations in thousands of galaxies, enabling unprecedented views of their morphology, stellar abundances, and dust content. The principal technological requirement advanced by this science case is a camera with a resolution of $\leqslant$0.015'' that is diffraction-limited, and Nyquist-sampled (0.01'' per pixel), to at least 550 nm $-$ comparable to the High Definition Imager from the LUVOIR concept.</description>

      <title>Precise Asteroseismic Ages for the Helmi Streams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Helmi streams are remnants of a dwarf galaxy that was accreted by the Milky Way and whose stars now form a distinct kinematic and chemical substructure in the Galactic halo. Precisely age-dating these typically faint stars of extragalactic origin has been notoriously difficult due to the limitations of using only spectroscopic data, interferometry, or coarse asteroseismic measurements. Using observations from NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, we report the detailed asteroseismic modeling of two of the brightest red giants within the Helmi streams, HD 175305 and HD 128279. By modeling the individual oscillation mode frequencies and the spectroscopic properties of both stars, we determine their fundamental properties including mass, radius, and age ($\tau$). We report $\tau = 11.16 \pm 0.91$ Gyr for HD 175305 and $\tau = 12.52 \pm 1.05$ Gyr for HD 128279, consistent with previously inferred star-formation histories for the Helmi streams and the differential chemical abundances between the two stars. With precise ages for individual stream members, our results reinforce the hypothesis that the Helmi streams' progenitor must have existed at least 12 Gyr ago. Our results also highlight that the ages of metal-poor, $\alpha$-enhanced red giants can be severely underestimated when inferred using global asteroseismic parameters instead of individual mode frequencies.</description>

      <title>HST pre-imaging of a free-floating planet candidate microlensing event</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-cadence microlensing observations uncovered a population of very short-timescale microlensing events, which are believed to be caused by the population of free-floating planets (FFP) roaming the Milky Way. Unfortunately, the light curves of such events are indistinguishable from those caused by wide-orbit planets. To properly differentiate both cases, one needs high-resolution observations that would allow resolving a putative luminous companion to the lens long before or after the event. Usually, the baseline between the event and high-resolution observations needs to be quite long ($\sim 10$ yr), hindering potential follow-up efforts. However, there is a chance to use archival data if they exist. Here, we present an analysis of the microlensing event OGLE-2023-BLG-0524, the site of which was captured in 1997 with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). Hence, we achieve a record-breaking baseline length of 25 years. A very short duration of the event ($t_E = 0.346 \pm 0.008$ d) indicates an FFP as the explanation. We have not detected any potential companion to the lens with the HST data, which is consistent with the FFP origin of the event. Thanks to the available HST data, we are able to reject from 25% to 48% of potential stellar companions depending on the assumed population model. Based on the finite-source effects in the light curve we measure the angular Einstein radius value $\theta_E = 4.78 \pm 0.23 \mu as$, suggesting a super-Earth in the Galactic disk or a sub-Saturn-mass planet in the Galactic bulge. We show that the archival high-resolution images should be available for several microlensing events, providing us with the unprecedented possibility of seeing the lensing system as it was many years before the event.</description>

      <title>Time-Dependent Leptohadronic Modeling of Markarian 421</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to its proximity, Markarian 421 is one of the most extensively studied jetted active galactic nuclei. Its spectral energy distribution and light curve are widely studied, serving as primary means for understanding jet radiation mechanisms. Numerous intriguing observational results have been discovered, some of which, such as the hard X-ray excess, and the associated variability between X-ray and very-high-energy (VHE) emissions, challenge the commonly adopted one-zone leptonic model. In this work, by establishing a time-dependent leptohadronic model, we explore whether the hard X-ray excess and the associated variability between X-ray and VHE emissions could be interpreted by emission from hadronic interactions. Our modeling finds that for the hard X-ray excess found in 2013, both of the secondary emissions from photohadronic and hadronuclear interactions could be a possible explanation for the hard X-ray excess without introducing a super-Eddington jet power. The emission from the photohadronic interactions contributes only to the hard X-ray band, while the hadronuclear interactions also predict VHE emissions associated with the hard X-rays. While for the hard X-ray excess found in 2016, only the secondary emissions from photohadronic interactions provide an interpretation at the cost of introducing a super-Eddington jet power. For the associated variability between X-ray and VHE emissions in 2017, we find that hadronic interactions fail to provide a possible interpretation.</description>

      <title>47 Tuc in Rubin Data Preview 1: Exploring Early LSST Data and Science Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present analyses of the early data from Rubin Observatory's Data Preview 1 (DP1) for the globular cluster 47 Tuc field. The DP1 dataset for 47 Tuc includes four nights of observations from the Rubin Commissioning Camera (LSSTComCam), covering multiple bands (ugriy). We address challenges of crowding near the cluster core and toward the SMC in DP1, and demonstrate improved star-galaxy separation by fitting fifth-degree polynomials to the stellar loci in color-color diagrams and applying multi-dimensional sigma clipping. We compile a catalog of 3,576 probable 47 Tuc member stars selected via a combination of isochrone, Gaia proper-motion, and color-color space matched filtering. We explore the sources of photometric scatter in the 47 Tuc color-color sequence, evaluating contributions from various potential sources, including differential extinction within the cluster. Finally, we recover five known variable stars, including three RR Lyrae and two eclipsing binaries. Although the DP1 lightcurves have sparse temporal sampling, they appear to follow the patterns of densely-sampled literature lightcurves well. Despite some data limitations for crowded-field stellar analysis, DP1 demonstrates the promising scientific potential for future LSST data releases.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes as Coma Cluster Dark Matter and the Unresolved {\gamma}-Ray Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: If 0.1% of the dark matter in the Coma cluster is constituted by primordial black holes (PBHs) with masses ranging from 10^-19 to 10^-17 solar masses, then the observed GeV {\gamma}-ray emission from the cluster could potentially be attributed to Hawking radiation. The emitted spectrum is inversely proportional to the black hole's mass, meaning lighter PBHs radiate at higher energies, potentially falling within the GeV range. If 0.1% of the Coma cluster's dark matter is PBH in this mass range, a fit to the cluster's GeV emission is obtained. We then investigate the potential for constraining evaporating PBHs through cross-correlations between the Unresolved Gamma-Ray Background and weak gravitational lensing. Utilizing 12 years of Fermi-LAT observations and weak lensing measurements from the Dark Energy Survey Year 3, we assess whether such correlations can reveal a PBH {\gamma}-ray component. While a statistically significant correlation between the UGRB and large-scale structure has been observed, this signal is consistent with emission from clustered astrophysical sources such as blazars. Attributing a measurable fraction of the UGRB to PBH evaporation would require unrealistically large PBH abundances. We also draw attention to a cluster of Coma-like X-ray clusters, designated Draco X, observed at a redshift of z = 0.12. These systems, characterized by their significant X-ray emission from hot, diffuse intracluster gas, represent massive gravitationally bound structures. The existence and properties of such clusters at these redshifts provide crucial cosmological probes, offering insights into the formation and evolution of large-scale structure and the underlying cosmological parameters. Further investigation of Draco X and similar high-redshift clusters would yield additional constraints on large scale structure.</description>

      <title>Tidal Suppression of Fuzzy Dark Matter Heating in Milky Way Satellite Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many previous studies have imposed stringent constraints on the particle mass of fuzzy dark matter (FDM) by analyzing observations of Galactic satellite galaxies, which show no significant evidence of the heating effect predicted by FDM. However, these analyses have generally neglected the tidal influence of the Milky Way, which can substantially suppress the FDM-induced heating in satellites. This oversight arises from computational challenges of accurately capturing the tidal effects in FDM simulations. In this study, we present a novel simulation framework that, for the first time, enables the simulation of an FDM-stellar system within an observationally motivated gravitational potential of the Milky Way. This framework incorporates the diverse Galactic components, including the gravitational influence of the Large Magellanic Cloud. Using the Fornax dwarf galaxy as a case study, we demonstrate that tidal effects significantly alleviate the tension between observational data and the predicted heating effect for an FDM particle mass of $m_a\sim 10^{-22}$ eV.</description>

      <title>Where are all the dark galaxies? Predicting galaxy/halo locations from their bright neighbors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Astronomical objects in our universe that are too faint to be directly detectable exist and are important - an obvious example being dark matter. The same can also apply to very faint baryonic objects, such as low luminosity dwarf galaxies and gravitationally compact objects (e.g., rogue planets, white dwarfs, neutron stars, black holes, dark sirens). While they are very difficult to observe directly, they have locations that are highly important when studying astrophysical phenomena. Here, we use a machine learning algorithm known as symbolic regression to model the probability of a dark object's existence as a function of their separation distances to their closest two ``bright" (directly observable) neighbors, and the distances of these bright objects to each other. An advantage of this algorithm is that it is interpretable by humans and can be used to make reproducible predictions. Galaxies with masses above $10^9 M_{\odot}$ and halos above $10^{12} M_{\odot} $ are the objects that we separate into ``bright" and ``dark" to be used in our analysis. We find that it is possible to predict the density of dark objects using an analytic expression that depends on their distances to their closest bright neighbors in Illustris-TNG galaxy formation simulations, which is significantly better than the (linear) scale-dependent biasing prediction for $k \sim 1.0~ h$Mpc$^{-1}$ (and potentially beyond, if allowed by the resolution). This could potentially open the avenue for finding dark objects based on their vicinity to directly observable bright sources and make future surveys more targeted and efficient.</description>

      <title>ML-Driven Strong Lens Discoveries: Down to $\theta_E \sim 0.03''$ and $M_\mathrm{halo}&lt; 10^{11} M_\odot$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present results on extending the strong lens discovery space down to much smaller Einstein radii ($\theta_E\lesssim0.03''$) and much lower halo mass ($M_\mathrm{halo}&lt;10^{11}M_\odot$) through the combination of JWST observations and machine learning (ML) techniques. First, we forecast detectable strong lenses with JWST using CosmoDC2 as the lens catalog, and a source catalog down to 29th magnitude. By further incorporating the VELA hydrodynamical simulations of high-redshift galaxies, we simulate strong lenses. We train a ResNet on these images, achieving near-100\% completeness and purity for ``conventional" strong lenses ($\theta_E\gtrsim 0.5''$), applicable to JWST, HST, the Roman Space Telescope and Euclid VIS. For the first time, we also search for very low halo mass strong lenses ($M_{halo}&lt;10^{11}M_\odot$) in simulations, with $\theta_E\ll 0.5''$, down to the best resolution ($0.03''$) and depth (10,000~sec) limits of JWST using ResNet. A U-Net model is employed to pinpoint these small lenses in images, which are otherwise virtually impossible for human detection. Our results indicate that JWST can find $\sim 17$/deg$^2$ such low-halo-mass lenses, with the locations of $\sim 1.1$/deg$^2$ of these detectable by the U-Net at $\sim100$\% precision (and $\sim 7.0$/deg$^2$ at a 99.0\% precision). To validate our model for finding ``conventional" strong lenses, we apply it to HST images, discovering two new strong lens candidates previously missed by human classifiers in a crowdsourcing project (Garvin et al. 2022). This study demonstrates the (potentially ``superhuman") advantages of ML combined with current and future space telescopes for detecting conventional, and especially, low-halo-mass strong lenses, which are critical for testing CDM models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the ionization of dense molecular clouds can be used to set strong constraints on dark matter models producing UV/X-ray photons in their annihilation or decay. We place robust and competitive constraints on various dark matter models, such as axion-like particles, scalars and sterile neutrinos, for masses between $\sim30$~eV and $10$~keV, and project forecasts to illustrate the potential of this target. We discuss how these constraints can be significantly improved by considering a more refined sample of molecular clouds near the Galactic Center and above the Galactic plane, a detailed modeling of the cosmic-ray ionization contribution and, potentially, a more refined analysis of the gas density in clouds through dust extinction maps. Thus, ionization of molecular clouds emerges as one of the most powerful tools for probing sub-keV dark matter.</description>

      <title>JADES -- The small blue bump in GN-z11: insights into the nuclear region of a galaxy at z=10.6</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05772v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the detection of continuum excess in the rest-frame UV between 3000 {\AA} and 3550 {\AA} in the JWST/NIRSpec spectrum of GN-z11, a luminous galaxy $z=10.603$. The shape of the continuum excess resembles a Balmer continuum but has a break around 3546 {\AA}. The fitting result of this excess depends on the assumed origin of the continuum. If the continuum of GN-z11 is dominated by a stellar population with a small Balmer break, the apparent blueshift of the Balmer continuum is not significant and the best-fit Balmer continuum model indicates a temperature of $T_e = 1.78^{+0.25}_{-0.21}\times 10^4$ K. In contrast, if the continuum is dominated by AGN emission, a nebular continuum model cannot fit the spectrum properly. The absence of the Balmer jump indicates an electron temperature of $\sim 3\times 10^4$ K, significantly higher than the temperature of $T_{e}({\rm O^{2+}}) = 1.36\pm 0.13\times 10^{4}$ K inferred from [OIII]$\lambda 4363$ and [OIII]$\lambda 5007$. The temperature difference can result from mixing of different ionized regions: the Balmer emission mainly arises from dense and hot clouds in the Broad Line Region, whereas the forbidden lines originate from less dense and colder gas. An alternative explanation for the observed continuum excess is the FeII emission, which shows a characteristic jump blueward of the Balmer limit as previously seen in the spectra of many lower-redshift quasars. Through comparisons with Cloudy models, we show an Fe abundance above $\sim 1/3$ solar is likely needed, which could be achieved via enrichment from Type-Ia supernovae, hypernovae, or pair-instability supernovae.</description>

      <title>Black Holes as Condensation Points of Fuzzy Dark Matter Cores</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15465v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We simulate the formation of Fuzzy Dark Matter (FDM) cores in the presence of a Black Hole (BH) to explore whether BHs can serve as seeds for FDM core condensation. Our analysis is based on the core-condensation via the kinetic relaxation process for random initial conditions of the FDM. In a generic scenario the BH merges with a pre-collapsed mini-cluster formed in a random location, once they share location the core-condensation starts withe the FDM density centered at the black hole that during the process acquires a profile consistent with that of the stationary solution of the FDM+BH eigenvalue problem. These results indicate that BHs can indeed act as focal points for FDM core condensation. Furthermore, we find that the central density of the resulting FDM core depends on the mass of the BH, which due to its permanent motion relative to the FDM core during the evolution, produces a smaller core density for bigger BH masses; in this way the BH mass is a parameter leading to a new diversity of central FDM core densities. As a collateral result, for our analysis we revised the construction of stationary solutions of FDM+BH and found a phenomenological formula for the FDM density that can be used to fit FDM cores around BHs.</description>

      <title>Fermionic Dark Matter spikes: origin and growth of Black Hole seeds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17919v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We characterize the overdensity (spike) of fermionic dark matter (DM) particles around a supermassive black hole (SMBH) within a general relativistic analysis. The initial DM halo distribution is obtained by solving the equilibrium equations of a self-gravitating system of massive fermions at a finite temperature, according to the Ruffini-Arg\"uelles-Rueda (RAR) model. The final fermionic DM spike is calculated around a Schwarzschild SMBH. We explore two possible interpretations for the origin and evolution of the SMBH seed. One corresponds to the traditional scenario proposed by Gondolo &amp; Silk (1999), where a small BH mass of baryonic origin sits at the halo's center and grows adiabatically. The other one, from DM origin, where the dense and degenerate fermion core predicted by the RAR model grows adiabatically by capturing baryons until its gravitational collapse, providing a heavy SMBH seed, whose specific value depends on the fermion mass. We study different initial fermionic DM profiles that the theory allows. We show that overall dilute (i.e., Boltzmannian) fermionic DM develops the well-known spike with density profile $\rho \sim r^{-3/2}$. Instead, for semi-degenerate fermions with a dense and compact core surrounded by a diluted halo, we find novel spike profiles that depend on the particle mass and nature. In the more general case, fermionic spikes do not develop a simple power-law profile. Furthermore, the SMBH does not always imply an enhancement of the surrounding DM density; it might also deplete it. Thus, the self-consistent inclusion of the DM candidate nature and mass in determining the structure and distribution of DM in galaxies, including the DM spikes around SMBHs, is essential for the specification of DM astrophysical probes such as BH mergers, gravitational waves, or stellar orbits.</description>

      <title>No [CII] or dust detection in two Little Red Dots at z$_{\rm spec}$ &gt; 7</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01945v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Little Red Dots (LRDs) are compact, point-like sources characterized by their red color and broad Balmer lines, which have been debated to be either dominated by active galactic nuclei (AGN) or dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs). Here we report two LRDs (ID9094 and ID2756) at z$_{\rm spec}$&gt;7, recently discovered in the JWST FRESCO GOODS-North field. Both satisfy the "v-shape" colors and compactness criteria for LRDs and are identified as Type-I AGN candidates based on their broad H$\beta$ emission lines (full width at half maximum: 2280$\pm$490 km/s for ID9094 and 1070$\pm$240 km/s for ID2756) and narrow [OI] lines ($\sim$ 300-400 km/s). To investigate their nature, we conduct deep NOEMA follow-up observations targeting the [CII] 158${\rm \mu m}$ emission line and the 1.3 mm dust continuum. We do not detect [CII] or 1.3 mm continuum emission for either source. Notably, in the scenario that the two LRDs were DSFGs, we would expect significant detections: $&gt;16\sigma$ for [CII] and $&gt;3\sigma$ for the 1.3 mm continuum of ID9094, and $&gt;5\sigma$ for [CII] of ID2756. Using the 3$\sigma$ upper limits of [CII] and 1.3 mm, we perform two analyses: (1) UV-to-FIR spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting with and without AGN components, and (2) comparison of their properties with the L$_{[CII]}$-SFR$_{tot}$ empirical relation. Both analyses are consistent with a scenario where AGN activity may contribute to the observed properties, though a dusty star-forming origin cannot be fully ruled out. Our results highlight the importance of far-infrared observations for studying LRDs, a regime that remains largely unexplored.</description>

      <title>Evolution of star clusters with initial bulk rotation via N-body simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20432v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Young star clusters can inherit bulk rotation from the molecular clouds from which they have formed. This rotation can affect the long-term evolution of a star cluster and its constituent stellar populations. In this study, we aim to characterize the effects of different degrees of initial rotation on star clusters with primordial binaries. The simulations are performed using NBODY6++GPU. We find that initial rotation strongly affects the early evolution of star clusters. Rapidly rotating clusters show angular momentum transport from the inner parts to the outskirts, resulting in a core collapse. Angular momentum transport is accompanied by a highly elongated bar-like structure morphology. The effects of bulk rotation are reduced on the timescale of two-body relaxation. Rotating and non-rotating clusters experience changes in the direction of angular momentum near the dissolution and early evolution due to the tidal field, respectively. We present synthetic observations of simulated clusters for comparison with future observations in filters of Gaia, CSST, and HST. This work shows the effects of bulk rotation on systems with primordial binaries and could be used for the identification of rotation signatures in observed open clusters.</description>

      <title>Dark-matter-induced transients over cosmic time: The role of star formation history profiles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21260v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dark matter (DM) conundrum is one of the most intriguing due to its resistance in direct detection experiments. In recent years, attempts to identify non-gravitational signatures as the result of DM traversing or accumulating within stars have attracted a lot of attention. These calculations are usually evaluated at the order-of-magnitude level for stellar populations where the DM density is highest, such as galactic centers. However, if the signature implies the destruction of the host star, their population could have been diminished over a Hubble time in the most DM-dense regions, unless replenished by star formation. This circumstance exemplifies the need for galactic star formation history profiles when deriving DM-induced transient rates, in particular for predicting the host-offset distribution. Here, we combine theoretical and empirical scaling relations of galaxy structure, star formation, and stellar initial mass function to construct a simple and efficient framework that permits us to estimate the target population formation rate and mass function within galactocentric radial zones across galaxy stellar masses and cosmic time. In a companion paper, we apply the framework to the hypothesis that DM in the form of primordial black holes accounts for the ignition of normal type Ia supernovae when colliding with white dwarf stars.</description>

      <title>Formation of the Two-Armed Phase Spiral from Multiple External Perturbations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04705v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies using the Gaia DR3 data have revealed a two-armed phase spiral in the $Z-V_Z$ phase space in the inner disk. In this study, we present new features of the two-armed phase spiral revealed by the Gaia Data and a new mechanism to explain such features with multiple external perturbations. By segmenting the Gaia DR3 RVS catalog based on $J_{\phi}$ (or $R_{g}$) and $\theta_\phi$, we confirm the existence of the clear two-armed phase spiral in the inner disk. Moreover, we identify a different two-armed phase spiral pattern at slightly larger radii, resembling a weak secondary branch along with the prominent major branch. At a given radius, with the azimuthal angle increasing, we observe a systematic transition of the two-armed phase spiral, with the significance of one branch weakened and another branch enhanced. This two-armed phase spiral may be due to the overlapping of distinct one-armed phase spirals. At different radii, the perturbation times estimated from each branch of the two-armed phase spiral are $\sim 320$ Myr and $\sim 500$ Myr, respectively, suggesting that the Galactic disk could be impacted by double external perturbers separated by $\sim 180$ Myr. We also performed test particle simulations of the disk perturbed by two satellite galaxies, which successfully generated a two-armed phase spiral similar to the observation. Both the observation and simulation results suggest that the signature in the $Z-V_Z$ phase space of earlier perturbations may not be completely erased by the more recent one.</description>

      <title>Even redder than we knew: color and $A_{\mathrm{V}}$ evolution up to $z=2.5$ from JWST/NIRCam photometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23669v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: JWST/NIRCam provides rest-frame near-IR photometry of galaxies up to $z=2.5$ with exquisite depth and accuracy. This affords an unprecedented view of the evolution of the UV-optical-near-IR color distribution and its interpretation in terms of the evolving dust attenuation, $A_{\mathrm{V}}$. We use the value-added data products (photometric redshift, stellar mass, rest-frame $U-V$ and $V-J$ colors, and $A_{\rm V}$) provided by the public DAWN JWST Archive. This data product derives from fitting the spectral energy distributions obtained from multiple NIRCam imaging surveys, augmented with pre-existing HST imaging data. Our sample consists of a stellar mass complete sample of $\approx 28,000$ $M_\star&gt; 10^{9}~M_\odot$ galaxies in the redshift range $0.5&lt;z&lt;2.5$. The $V-J$ color distribution of star-forming galaxies evolves strongly, in particular for high-mass galaxies ($M_\star&gt;3\times 10^{10}~M_\odot$), which have a pronounced tail of very red galaxies reaching $V-J&gt; 2.5$ at $z&gt;1.5$ that does not exist at $z&lt;1$. Such red $V-J$ can only be explained by dust attenuation, with typical values for $M_\star \approx 10^{11}~M_\odot$ galaxies in the range $A_{\mathrm{V}}\approx 1.5-3.5$ at $z\approx 2$. This redshift evolution went largely unnoticed before because the photometric redshift estimates for the reddest ($V-J&gt;2.5$), most attenuated galaxies has markedly improved thanks to the new, precise photometry. Despite the increased attenuation, $U-V$ colors across the entire mass range are slightly bluer at higher $z$. In conclusion, whereas the rest-frame UV-optical color distribution evolves remarkably little from $z=0.5$ to $z=2.5$, the rest-frame optical-near-IR color distribution evolves strongly, primarily due to a very substantial increase with redshift in dust attenuation for massive galaxies.

      <title>Intrinsic galaxy alignments in the KiDS-1000 bright sample: dependence on colour, luminosity, morphology, and galaxy scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09452v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The intrinsic alignment (IA) of galaxies is a major astrophysical contaminant to weak gravitational lensing measurements, and the study of its dependence on galaxy properties helps provide meaningful physical priors that aid cosmological analyses. This work studied for the first time the dependence of IA on galaxy structural parameters. We measured the IA of bright galaxies, selected on apparent r-band magnitude r&lt;20, in the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS). Machine-learning-based photometric redshift estimates are available for this galaxy sample that helped us obtain a clean measurement of its IA signal. We supplemented this sample with a catalogue of structural parameters from Sersic profile fits to the surface-brightness profiles of the galaxies. We split the sample on galaxy intrinsic colour, luminosity, and Sersic index, and we fitted the non-linear linear alignment model to galaxy position-shape projected correlation function measurements on large scales. We observe a power-law luminosity dependence of the large-scale IA amplitude, $A_{IA}$, for both the red and high-Sersic-index ($n_s&gt;2.5$) samples, and find no significant difference between the two. We measure an $\sim1.5\sigma$ lower $A_{IA}$ for red galaxies that also have a Sersic index of $n_s&lt;4$ compared to the expected amplitude predicted using the sample's luminosity. We also probe the IA of red galaxies as a function of galaxy scale by varying the radial weight employed in the shape measurement. On large scales (above 6 Mpc/$h$), we do not detect a significant difference in the alignment. On smaller scales, we observe that IA increase with galaxy scale, with outer galaxy regions showing stronger alignments than inner regions. Finally, for intrinsically blue galaxies, we find $A_{IA}=-0.67\pm1.00$, which is consistent with previous works, and we find IA to be consistent with zero for the low-Sersic-index ($n_s&lt;2.5$) sample.</description>

      <title>Modeling Asteroseismic Yields for the Roman Galactic Bulge Time-Domain Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04999v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Galactic Bulge Time Domain Survey (GBTDS) of the Roman Space Telescope will take high cadence data of the Galactic bulge. We investigate the asteroseismic potential of this survey for red giants. We simulate the detectability of global asteroseismic frequencies, $\nu_{\mathrm{max}}$ and $\Delta\nu$, by modify ing Kepler data to match nominal GBTDS observing strategies, considering different noise models, observing cadences, and detection algorithms. Our baseline case, using conservative assumptions, consistently leads to asteroseismic $\nu_{\mathrm{max}}$ detection probabilities above 80% for red clump and red giant branch stars brighter than 16th magnitude in Roman's F146 filter. We then inject these detection probabilities into a Galaxia model of the bulge to estimate asteroseismic yields. For our nominal case, we detect 290,000 stars in total, with 185,000 detections in the bulge. Different assumptions give bulge yields from 135,000 to 349,000 stars. For stars with measured $\nu_{\mathrm{max}}$, we find that we can recover $\Delta\nu$ in 21% to 42% of red clump stars, and 69% to 92% of RGB stars. Implications for survey strategy and asteroseismic population studies are discussed more.</description>
