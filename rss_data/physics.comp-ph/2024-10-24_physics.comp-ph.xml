      <title>Multi-Group Maximum Entropy Method: Modeling Translational Non-Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The most rigorous physical description of non-equilibrium gas dynamics is rooted in the numerical solution of the Boltzmann equation. Yet, the large number of degrees of freedom and the wide range of both spatial and temporal scales render these equations intractable for many relevant problems. This study constructs a reduced-order model for the Boltzmann equation, by combining coarse-graining modeling framework with the maximum entropy principle. This is accomplished by projecting the high-dimensional Boltzmann equation onto a carefully chosen lower-dimensional subspace, resulting from the discretization of the velocity space into sub-volumes. Within each sub-volume, the distribution function is reconstructed through the maximum entropy principle, ensuring compliance with the detailed balance. The resulting set of conservation equations comprises mass, momentum, and energy for each sub-volume, allowing for flexibility in the description of the velocity distribution function. This new set of governing equations, while retaining many of the mathematical characteristics of the conventional Navier-Stokes equations far outperforms them in terms of applicability. The proposed methodology is applied to the Bhatnagar, Gross, and Krook (BGK) formulation of the Boltzmann equation. To validate the model's accuracy, we simulate the non-equilibrium relaxation of a gas under spatially uniform conditions. Additionally, the model is used to analyze the shock structure of a 1-D standing shockwave across an extensive range of Mach numbers. Notably, both the non-equilibrium velocity distribution functions and macroscopic metrics derived from our model align remarkably with the direct solutions of the Boltzmann equation.</description>

      <title>Deep Autoencoder with SVD-Like Convergence and Flat Minima</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Representation learning for high-dimensional, complex physical systems aims to identify a low-dimensional intrinsic latent space, which is crucial for reduced-order modeling and modal analysis. To overcome the well-known Kolmogorov barrier, deep autoencoders (AEs) have been introduced in recent years, but they often suffer from poor convergence behavior as the rank of the latent space increases. To address this issue, we propose the learnable weighted hybrid autoencoder, a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of singular value decomposition (SVD) with deep autoencoders through a learnable weighted framework. We find that the introduction of learnable weighting parameters is essential - without them, the resulting model would either collapse into a standard POD or fail to exhibit the desired convergence behavior. Additionally, we empirically find that our trained model has a sharpness thousands of times smaller compared to other models. Our experiments on classical chaotic PDE systems, including the 1D Kuramoto-Sivashinsky and forced isotropic turbulence datasets, demonstrate that our approach significantly improves generalization performance compared to several competing methods, paving the way for robust representation learning of high-dimensional, complex physical systems.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian Matching for Symplectic Neural Integrators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hamilton's equations of motion form a fundamental framework in various branches of physics, including astronomy, quantum mechanics, particle physics, and climate science. Classical numerical solvers are typically employed to compute the time evolution of these systems. However, when the system spans multiple spatial and temporal scales numerical errors can accumulate, leading to reduced accuracy. To address the challenges of evolving such systems over long timescales, we propose SympFlow, a novel neural network-based symplectic integrator, which is the composition of a sequence of exact flow maps of parametrised time-dependent Hamiltonian functions. This architecture allows for a backward error analysis: we can identify an underlying Hamiltonian function of the architecture and use it to define a Hamiltonian matching objective function, which we use for training. In numerical experiments, we show that SympFlow exhibits promising results, with qualitative energy conservation behaviour similar to that of time-stepping symplectic integrators.</description>

      <title>Semiconductive and Ferromagnetic Lanthanide MXenes Derived from Carbon Intercalated Two-dimensional Halides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) magnetic semiconductors are a key focus in developing next-generation information storage technologies. MXenes, as emerging 2D early transition metal carbides and nitrides, offer versatile compositions and tunable chemical structures. Incorporating lanthanide metals, with their unique role of 4f-electrons in engineering physical properties, into MXenes holds potential for advancing technological applications. However, the scarcity of lanthanide-containing ternary MAX phase precursors and the propensity of lanthanides to oxidize pose significant challenges to obtain lanthanide MXenes (Ln2CT2) via the top-down etching method. Here, we propose a general bottom-up methodology for lanthanide MXenes, that derive from carbon intercalated van der Waals building blocks of 2D halides. Compared to conventional MXenes conductors, the synthesized Ln2CT2 exhibit tunable band gaps spanning 0.32 eV to 1.22 eV that cover typical semiconductors such as Si (1.12 eV) and Ge (0.67 eV). Additionally, the presence of unpaired f-electrons endows Ln2CT2 with intrinsic ferromagnetism, with Curie temperatures ranging between 36 K and 60 K. Theoretical calculations reveal that, in contrast to traditional MXenes, the number of d-electrons states around the Fermi level are largely diminishes in bare Ln2C MXenes, and the halogen terminals can further exhaust these electrons to open band gaps. Meanwhile, the Ln-4f electrons in Ln2CT2 are highly localized and stay away from the Fermi level, contributing to the spin splitting for the observed ferromagnetic behavior. Lanthanide MXenes hold immense promise for revolutionizing future applications in spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>PRCpy: A Python Package for Processing of Physical Reservoir Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physical reservoir computing (PRC) is a computing framework that harnesses the intrinsic dynamics of physical systems for computation. It offers a promising energy-efficient alternative to traditional von Neumann computing for certain tasks, particularly those demanding both memory and nonlinearity. As PRC is implemented across a broad variety of physical systems, the need increases for standardised tools for data processing and model training. In this manuscript, we introduce PRCpy, an open-source Python library designed to simplify the implementation and assessment of PRC for researchers. The package provides a high-level interface for data handling, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. Key concepts are described and accompanied by experimental data on two benchmark problems: nonlinear transformation and future forecasting of chaotic signals. Throughout this manuscript, which will be updated as a rolling release, we aim to facilitate researchers from diverse disciplines to prioritise evaluating the computational benefits of the physical properties of their systems by simplifying data processing, model training and evaluation.</description>

      <title>Characterizing conical intersections of nucleobases on quantum computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hybrid quantum-classical computing algorithms offer significant potential for accelerating the calculation of the electronic structure of strongly correlated molecules. In this work, we present the first quantum simulation of conical intersections (CIs) in a biomolecule, cytosine, using a superconducting quantum computer. We apply the Contracted Quantum Eigensolver (CQE) -- with comparisons to conventional Variational Quantum Deflation (VQD) -- to compute the near-degenerate ground and excited states associated with the conical intersection, a key feature governing the photostability of DNA and RNA. The CQE is based on an exact ansatz for many-electron molecules in the absence of noise -- a critically important property for resolving strongly correlated states at CIs. Both methods demonstrate promising accuracy when compared with exact diagonalization, even on noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers, highlighting their potential for advancing the understanding of photochemical and photobiological processes. The ability to simulate these intersections is critical for advancing our knowledge of biological processes like DNA repair and mutation, with potential implications for molecular biology and medical research.</description>

      <title>Everything everywhere all at once, a probability-based enhanced sampling approach to rare events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17029v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The problem of studying rare events is central to many areas of computer simulations. In a recent paper [Kang, P., et al., Nat. Comput. Sci. 4, 451-460, 2024], we have shown that a powerful way of solving this problem passes through the computation of the committor function, and we have demonstrated how the committor can be iteratively computed in a variational way and the transition state ensemble efficiently sampled. Here, we greatly ameliorate this procedure by combining it with a metadynamics-like enhanced sampling approach in which a logarithmic function of the committor is used as a collective variable. This integrated procedure leads to an accurate and balanced sampling of the free energy surface in which transition states and metastable basins are studied with the same thoroughness. We also show that our approach can be used in cases in which competing reactive paths are possible and intermediate metastable are encountered. In addition, we demonstrate how physical insights can be obtained from the optimized committor model and the sampled data, thus providing a full characterization of the rare event under study. We ascribe the success of this approach to the use of a probability-based description of rare events.</description>

      <title>Interpretable A-posteriori Error Indication for Graph Neural Network Surrogate Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07548v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data-driven surrogate modeling has surged in capability in recent years with the emergence of graph neural networks (GNNs), which can operate directly on mesh-based representations of data. The goal of this work is to introduce an interpretability enhancement procedure for GNNs, with application to unstructured mesh-based fluid dynamics modeling. Given a black-box baseline GNN model, the end result is an interpretable GNN model that isolates regions in physical space, corresponding to sub-graphs, that are intrinsically linked to the forecasting task while retaining the predictive capability of the baseline. These structures identified by the interpretable GNNs are adaptively produced in the forward pass and serve as explainable links between the baseline model architecture, the optimization goal, and known problem-specific physics. Additionally, through a regularization procedure, the interpretable GNNs can also be used to identify, during inference, graph nodes that correspond to a majority of the anticipated forecasting error, adding a novel interpretable error-tagging capability to baseline models. Demonstrations are performed using unstructured flow field data sourced from flow over a backward-facing step at high Reynolds numbers, with geometry extrapolations demonstrated for ramp and wall-mounted cube configurations.</description>

      <title>Self-Adaptive Physics-Informed Quantum Machine Learning for Solving Differential Equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09215v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chebyshev polynomials have shown significant promise as an efficient tool for both classical and quantum neural networks to solve linear and nonlinear differential equations. In this work, we adapt and generalize this framework in a quantum machine learning setting for a variety of problems, including the 2D Poisson's equation, second-order differential equation, system of differential equations, and nonlinear Riccati equation. In particular, we propose in the quantum setting a modified Self-Adaptive Physics-Informed Neural Network (SAPINN) approach, where self-adaptive weights are applied to problems with multi-objective loss functions. We further explore capturing correlations in our loss function using a quantum-correlated measurement, resulting in improved accuracy for initial value problems. We analyse also the use of entangling layers and their impact on the solution accuracy for second-order differential equations. The results indicate a promising approach to the near-term evaluation of differential equations on quantum devices.</description>

      <title>On the Definition of Velocity in Discrete-Time, Stochastic Langevin Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16321v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We systematically develop beneficial and practical velocity measures for accurate and efficient statistical simulations of the Langevin equation with direct applications to computational statistical mechanics and molecular dynamics sampling. Recognizing that the existing velocity measures for the most statistically accurate discrete-time Verlet-type algorithms are inconsistent with the simulated configurational coordinate, we seek to create and analyze new velocity companions that both improve existing methods as well as offer practical options for implementation in existing computer codes. The work is based on the set of GJ methods that, of all methods, for any time step within the stability criteria correctly reproduces the most basic statistical features of a Langevin system; namely correct Boltzmann distribution for harmonic potentials and correct transport in the form of drift and diffusion for linear potentials. Several new and improved velocities exhibiting correct drift are identified, and we expand on an earlier conclusion that, generally, only half-step velocities can exhibit correct, time-step independent Maxwell-Boltzmann distributions. Specific practical and efficient algorithms are given in familiar forms, and these are used to numerically validate the analytically derived expectations. One especially simple algorithm is highlighted, and the ability of one of the new on-site velocities to produce statistically correct averages for a particular damping value is specified.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12453v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stable states in complex systems correspond to local minima on the associated potential energy surface. Transitions between these local minima govern the dynamics of such systems. Precisely determining the transition pathways in complex and high-dimensional systems is challenging because these transitions are rare events, and isolating the relevant species in experiments is difficult. Most of the time, the system remains near a local minimum, with rare, large fluctuations leading to transitions between minima. The probability of such transitions decreases exponentially with the height of the energy barrier, making the system's dynamics highly sensitive to the calculated energy barriers. This work aims to formulate the problem of finding the minimum energy barrier between two stable states in the system's state space as a cost-minimization problem. We propose solving this problem using reinforcement learning algorithms. The exploratory nature of reinforcement learning agents enables efficient sampling and determination of the minimum energy barrier for transitions.</description>

      <title>Exergetic Port-Hamiltonian Systems: Compositional fluid and electro-magneto hydrodynamics models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00009v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fluid dynamics plays a crucial role in various multiphysics applications, including energy systems, electronics cooling, and biomedical engineering. Developing computational models for complex coupled systems can be challenging and time-consuming. In particular, ensuring the consistent integration of models from diverse physical domains requires meticulous attention. Considering the example of (electro-)magneto hydrodynamics (on a fixed spatial domain and with linear polarization and magnetization), this article demonstrates how relatively complex models can be composed from simpler parts by means of a formal language for multiphysics modeling. The Exergetic Port-Hamiltonian Systems (EPHS) modeling language features a simple graphical syntax for expressing the energy-based interconnection of subsystems. This reduces cognitive load and facilitates communication, especially in multidisciplinary environments. As the example demonstrates, existing models can be easily integrated as subsystems of new models. Specifically, the ideal fluid model is used as a subsystem of the Navier-Stokes-Fourier fluid model, which in turn is reused as a subsystem of the electro-magneto hydrodynamics model. The compositional approach makes it nearly trivial to encapsulate, reuse, and swap out (parts of) models. Moreover, structural properties of EPHS models guarantee fundamental properties of thermodynamic systems, such as conservation of energy, non-negative entropy production, and Onsager reciprocal relations.</description>
