      <title>Constituent Quark-model for BaryonsTh. Harmonic confinement and Two-body Meson-exchange Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soft Two-body potentials between the constituent quarks of the nucleon are derived using harmonic oscillator, i.e. gaussian, quark wave-functions. The gaussian wave-functions are very suited for applications with the ESC soft-core interactions, which employ gaussian form factors. In these notes using the Fourier transformation to momentum space the local and non-local contributions of the potentials based on the ESC meson-quark-quark vertices are evaluated. Using the ESC16 parameters translated to the quark-level leads to parameter free two-body and three-body diquark and triquark meson-exchange interactions. Applications to the SU(3) baryon-octet states and the $\Delta_{33}$ resonance are performed., within the CQM using a harmonic confinement potential, leading to a satisfactory picture with relativistic constituent quarks. We present two versioins for the $N-\Delta$ splitting: (i) model A with the instanton interaction, and (ii) model B with a large color-magnetic interaction from an almost point like OGE. The size of the baryons $\approx$ 1 fm.</description>

      <title>Unnuclear matter at large-charge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The utility of the non-relativistic large-charge EFT for physical systems, and neutron matter in particular, relies on controlled Schr\"odinger-symmetry breaking deformations due to scattering length and effective-range effects in the two-body system. A recently-found exact solution of the large-charge system is used to compute these effects for two-point correlation functions of large-charge operators in perturbation theory around the large-charge ground state. Notably, the leading effective-range effects are found to enter at second order in the effective range, in agreement with analogous calculations in the three-body system. The Schr\"odinger-symmetry breaking deformations are used -- together with input from Quantum Monte Carlo simulations -- to address the range of validity of the EFT with deformations both in general and in the special case of neutron matter. In particular, it is found that nuclear reactions with up to six low-energy neutrons in the final state can be described by the large-charge EFT with Schr\"odinger-symmetry breaking.</description>

      <title>The 3$\alpha$ correlations of ground and excited $0^+$ states of $^{12}\mathrm{C}$ within the microscopic cluster model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cluster structures of the $0^+$ states in $^{12}\mathrm{C}$, including the ground state, the Hoyle state, and the recently identified $0_3^+$ and $0_4^+$ states, are analyzed to explore the cluster configurations and $3\alpha$ correlations without assuming the existence of $^8\mathrm{Be}$. In particular, the key quantity -- two-cluster overlap amplitudes -- is calculated for the $3\alpha$ clustering channels to reveal the essential features of these $0^+$ states. The results clearly show the distinction between the compact structure of the ground state and the gas-like structures of the excited $0^+$ states. The Hoyle state exhibits the expected gas-like dominant ($0S$) configuration, while the $0_3^+$ state shows a more extended $3\alpha$ clustering structure, which can be viewed as a breathing-like excitation of the Hoyle state, with an additional nodal structure. The $0_4^+$ state is found to have a mixed configuration, featuring a bent-arm-like structure in the $S\otimes S$ channel and an enhanced $2\alpha$ correlation in the $D\otimes D$ channel.</description>

      <title>$^{106}$Pd: a typical spherical-like nucleus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10925v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To solve the Cd puzzle (spherical nucleus puzzle), I proposed the concept of a sphere-like nucleus. Since shape coexistence often occurs in such nuclei, explicit spherical-like spectra are not easily identified. In this letter, I finally find the direct evidence for the existence of the spherical-like nucleus. $^{106}$Pd is a typical spherical-like nucleus. The low-lying parts, up to the $10_{1}^{+}$ state, under 4000 keV, of the spherical-like spectra are verified. By comparison, new theory outperforms the IBM-2. This result completely disproves the possibility of the phonon excitations of the spherical nucleus in the Cd-Pd nuclei region.</description>

      <title>Some insights on the partonic collectivity in heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Elliptic flow and Number of Constituent Quarks scaling provide crucial insights into the underlying dynamics and degrees of freedom in heavy-ion collisions. This article provides some insights on the transition from hadronic to partonic collectivity, revealing possible key signatures of medium evolution. At low energies around ($\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} \leq 4.0$ GeV), $v_2$ may be negative and NCQ scaling might break down. We expect that as the collision energy rises beyond 4.0 GeV, $v_2$ may become positive and NCQ scaling gradually restores. The transition in $v_2$ behavior, coupled with the breakdown and restoration of NCQ scaling, highlights the increasing significance of partonic interactions at higher energies, marking the onset of partonic collectivity and the emergence of quark-gluon plasma (QGP)-like properties.</description>

      <title>Complex-scaled no-core shell model calculations of bound and unbound light nuclear states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The complex scaling method is commonly used to describe decaying states, but its applications are limited because the Hamiltonian operator must contain only relative coordinates. This has hindered the use of complex scaling in shell model, defined with laboratory single-particle coordinates. In particular, one of the most important model in low-energy nuclear physics, the no-core shell model, had never been considered in the frame of complex scaling. We will then present a straightforward procedure for introducing complex scaling in the no-core shell model in order to calculate nuclear resonance states. For that matter, the complex scaled two-body matrix elements must firstly be determined, and the resulting many-body Hamiltonian complex symmetric matrix must be diagonalized afterwards. Applications pertain to the bound ground states of the lightest nuclei $^2{\rm H}$, $^3{\rm H}$, $^3{\rm He}$, and $^4{\rm He}$, as well as the resonance ground states of $^5{\rm He}$ and $^5{\rm Li}$, whereby the realistic interaction Daejeon16 is utilized.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Electromagnetic fields and Dynamical Electromagnetic Anomaly in heavy ion collisions at intermediate energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electromagnetic field produced in non-central heavy ion collisions play a crucial role in phenomena such as chiral anomalous effects, directed flow of mesons and splitting of spin polarization of $\Lambda/\bar{\Lambda}$. A precise description of these fields is essential for quantitatively studying these effects. We investigate the space-time evolution of the electromagnetic fields by numerically solving Maxwell's equations using the results from the UrQMD model, rather than relying on an ansatz. We present the space-averaged dynamic electromagnetic fields, weighted by energy density, in the central region of heavy-ion collisions. These measurements can serve as a barometer for assessing the effects induced by magnetic fields. Comparing the fields at geometric center of the collisions, the space-averaged dynamical fields weighted by the energy density are smaller at the early stage but damp much slower at the later stage. We discuss the impact of these space averaged dynamical magnetic fields on the spin polarization and spin alignment in heavy ion collisions. Additionally, we explore the opportunity to study non-perturbative regime of Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) by presenting the simulation results for space averaged dynamical electric field at intermediate collision energies. Finally, the space-averaged dynamical electromagnetic anomaly $\boldsymbol{\textbf{E}}$$\cdot\boldsymbol{\textbf{B}}$ weighted by energy density is also calculated and compared with experimentally measured slope parameter $r$.</description>

      <title>Beta-delayed particle emission and collective rotations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beta-delayed proton emission in the lower half of the sd-shell will involve deformed nuclei. We derive the normalized matrix element connecting emission of one particle from an initial rotational nuclear state to another final rotating state, and we extract selection rules involving the $K$ quantum number. The initial state is approximated as having a core identical to the final nuclear state. The formalism is then directly applicable to $\beta^+$-delayed proton decays of even-$Z$, odd-$N$ nuclei or $\beta^-$-delayed neutron decays of odd-$Z$, even $N$ nuclei. These beta-decay results are compared to the outcomes of possible transfer reactions. As an example the beta-delayed proton emission of $^{21}$Mg is considered, where new quantum numbers can be assigned to several states in $^{21}$Na.</description>

      <title>Light clusters as a possible source of crustal impurities: a quasi-particle approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The presence of impurities in the neutron star crust is known to affect in an important way the thermal and electrical conductivity of the star. In this work, we explore the possibility that such impurities might arise from the simultaneous presence of heavy ions together with Hydrogen and Helium isotopes formed during the cooling process of the star. We consider an equilibrium population of such light particles at temperatures close to the crystallization of the crust within an effective quasi-particle approach including in-medium binding energy shifts, and using different versions of the relativistic mean field approach for the crustal modeling. Thermal effects are consistently included also in the dominant ion species present in each crustal layer described in the compressible liquid drop approximation. We find that the impurity factor associated to light clusters is comparatively very small and can be neglected in transport calculations, even if a strong model dependence is observed.</description>

      <title>Excited s-wave $1^{--}$ vector mesons, their leptonic decays and (in-)complete absence of abnormal states as seen from the constituent quark BSE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Within a lattice inspired interaction between quark and antiquark, we obtain hierarchy of Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) solutions for vector quarkonia excited states in the constituent quark mass approximation. As a toy model, we apply the similar to calculate ground and excited states of $\phi$ and $\omega/\rho$ meson. Performing detailed numerical search, our study provides the evidence that the quark propagator with single valued constant mass does not provide known meson spectra without the presence of abnormal (unphysical) solutions simultaneously. We classify normal and abnormal solutions and discuss necessary changes in calculation scheme preventing the spectrum from inconsistent solutions. While all experimentaly narrow vector mesons are identified with a normal state of the BSE, the intriguing appearance of mutualy canceled normal-abnormal states is reported. They appearance discriminate between heavy and the light mesons. In both cases they seems to be remainder of inconsitent use of the hmogeneous BSE for the description of broad resonances.</description>

      <title>The role of the chiral anomaly in polarized deeply inelastic scattering III: Wess-Zumino-Witten contributions and chiral Ward identities for finite quark mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10519v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend our prior results on the worldline computation of the axial vector-vector-vector (AVV) triangle anomaly in polarized deeply inelastic scattering (DIS) to the finite mass case by computing in addition the pseudoscalar-vector-vector (PVV) triangle graph. For the well-studied QED case, we show explicitly how the off-forward AVV pole exactly cancels an identical PVV pole. We then demonstrate the dramatic difference in QCD due to the chiral condensate, which qualitatively modifies anomalous Ward identities. As in the massless case, the anomaly pole in QCD is canceled by the dynamics of a primordial isosinglet pseudoscalar $\bar \eta$-meson, whose Wess-Zumino-Witten coupling to the topological charge density shifts the pole to the physical $\eta^\prime$ mass, with the finite quark mass contribution differing by $O(10\%)$ from the Witten-Veneziano formula. We obtain a compact analytic expression for the finite mass corrections to Shore and Veneziano's result that the proton's net quark helicity $\Delta \Sigma\propto \sqrt{\chi_{\rm QCD}' |_{m=0}(0)}$, the forward slope of the topological susceptibility in the chiral limit, and show they are of the order of a few percent. Our prior prediction that the polarized DIS structure function $g_1$ is quenched by sphaleron-like topological transitions at small $x$ is unaffected by quark mass effects. Our results illustrate how worldline computations of anomalous processes, in synergy with lattice computations and nonet chiral perturbation theory, can uncover novel nonperturbative features of QCD at the Electron-Ion collider.</description>

Abstract: With Bayesian inference, we investigate the impact of recent near-threshold $J/\psi$ production measurements by the $J/\psi$ 007 experiment and GlueX collaboration on the extraction of proton's gravitational form factors. We apply the generalized parton distribution framework at the next-to-leading order and demonstrate a stable expansion for the near-threshold kinematics. We find that the experimental constraints are in good agreement with the state-of-the-art lattice simulations, where negative $C_q(t)$ and $C_g(t)$ are strongly preferred. This highlights a great potential to extract them from future high-precision experiments.</description>

      <title>Direct Evidence for the $\bar{D}D^*/D\bar{D}^*$ Molecular Nature of $G(3900)$ Through Triangular Singularity Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The exotic hadron $G(3900)$, initially observed in the process $e^+ e^- \to D\bar{D}$, has been further supported by analyses from the BESIII Collaboration, which classify it as a $P$-wave molecular state of $D^{+}D^{*-}/D^{-}D^{*+}$. However, theoretical discussions raise concerns about its status as a true particle, emphasizing the need for additional studies. In this Letter, we employ the triangular singularity mechanism to investigate $G(3900)$ across various reaction channels, allowing us to produce significant peaks without relying on the existence of a real particle. We identify $X(4020)$, $Y(4320)$, and the tentative $X(4014)$ as potential sources of these peaks via decay processes to $\gamma G(3900)$ or $\pi G(3900)$. We stress the importance of experimental explorations of $e^+ e^- \to X/Y \to \gamma(\pi) G(3900)$, which are essential for confirming the molecular composition of $D^{+}D^{*-}/D^{-}D^{*+}$ and refining the mass measurement of $G(3900)$.</description>

      <title>The Proton Radius Puzzle and Discrepancies in Proton Structure Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The proton radius puzzle remains a key challenge in modern physics, highlighting both the precision and limitations of current experimental and theoretical approaches. Recent studies, such as those by Xiong et al. and Bezginov et al., have consistently found a smaller proton radius of about 0.84 femtometers, in line with muonic hydrogen measurements, but discrepancies with earlier electron-proton scattering and atomic hydrogen spectroscopy persist. These unresolved differences reveal systematic errors or limitations in existing theoretical frameworks, as pointed out by Arrington and Sick. The divergence between results from muonic and electronic hydrogen measurements remains unexplained, with contributions from both experimental uncertainties and theoretical gaps. To address these challenges, a coordinated approach is needed-focused on reducing systematic uncertainties through advanced experimental setups, like improved scattering experiments at Jefferson Lab, and developing new theoretical models, such as those proposed by Alar\'{c}on et al. and Lin et al. Integrating experimental precision with theoretical rigor offers the best path toward resolving this enduring puzzle and providing deeper insights into the fundamental forces of nature.</description>

      <title>In-medium bottomonium properties from lattice NRQCD calculations with extended meson operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate the temperature dependence of bottomonium correlators in (2+1)-flavor lattice QCD with the aim to constrain in-medium properties of bottomonia at high temperature. The lattice calculations are performed using HISQ action with physical strange quark mass and light quark masses twenty times smaller than the strange quark mass at two lattice spacings $a=0.0493$ fm and $0.0602$ fm, and temporal extents $N_{\tau}=16-30$, corresponding to the temperatures $T=133-250$ MeV. We use a tadpole-improved NRQCD action including spin-dependent $v^6$ corrections for the heavy quarks and extended meson operators in order to be sensitive to in-medium properties of the bottomonium states of interest. We find that within estimated errors the bottomonium masses do not change compared to their vacuum values for all temperatures under our consideration; however, we find different nonzero widths for the various bottomonium states.</description>

      <title>Chiral condensates and screening masses of neutral pseudoscalar mesons from lattice QCD at physical quark masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of temperature $T$ and external magnetic fields $eB$ on the chiral condensates and screening masses of neutral pseudoscalar mesons, including $\pi^0$, $K^0$, and $\eta_{s\bar{s}}^0$, in (2+1)-flavor lattice QCD with physical quark masses. The chiral condensates are intrinsically connected to the screening masses via Ward-Takahashi identities, with the latter characterizing the inverse of the spatial correlation length in the pseudoscalar channel. Using highly improved staggered quarks, we perform simulations on lattices with temporal extents $N_\tau = 8, 12, 16$ and an aspect ratio of 4, covering five temperatures from 145 MeV to 166 MeV. For each temperature, eight magnetic field strengths are simulated, reaching up to $eB \sim 0.8$ GeV$^2$. These simulations allow us to provide continuum estimates for the chiral condensates and screening masses. We observe intricate behavior in the light ($ud$), strange-light ($ds$) and strange ($s$) quark condensates as functions of the magnetic field and temperature, reflecting the competition between magnetic catalysis and inverse magnetic catalysis effects. This complex behavior is also mirrored in the screening masses of the neutral pseudoscalar mesons. Notably, the screening masses of $\pi^0$ and $K^0$ exhibit a non-monotonic dependence on $eB$, closely following the variations in their corresponding chiral condensates. Meanwhile, the screening mass of $\eta_{s\bar{s}}^0$ decreases monotonically with increasing $eB$. These findings provide valuable insights for understanding the behavior of QCD in a thermomagnetic medium and can serve as benchmarks for low-energy QCD models and effective theories.</description>

      <title>Center vortices and the $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ conformal window</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A novel approach for estimating the lower end of the $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ conformal window is presented through the study of center vortex geometry and its dependence on the number of fermion flavors $N_f$. Values ranging from $N_f = 2$--$8$ are utilized to infer an upper limit for vortex behavior in the low $N_f$ phase, which may inform the transition to the conformal window. The simulations are performed at a single lattice spacing and pion mass, both fixed for all $N_f$. Visualizations of the center vortex structure in three-dimensional slices of the lattice reveal a growing roughness in the vortex matter as a function of $N_f$, embodied by an increase in the density of vortex matter in the percolating cluster and a simultaneous reduction in secondary clusters disconnected from the percolating cluster in 3D slices. This is quantified by various bulk properties, including the vortex and branching point densities. A correlation of the vortex structure reveals a turning point near $N_f \simeq 5$ past which a randomness in the vortex field becomes the dominant aspect of its evolution with $N_f$. As a byproduct, extrapolations to the vortex content of a uniform-random gauge field provide a critical point at which there must be a drastic shift in vacuum field structure. A precise estimate for the critical value is extracted as $N_f^* = 11.43(16)(17)$, close to various other estimates.</description>

      <title>Description of femtoscopic correlations with realistic pion-kaon interactions: the $\kappa/K^*_0(700)$ case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we show how $\pi^+ K_S$ femtoscopic correlations, recently reported by ALICE collaboration in $ pp $ collisions, can be well described taking into account relativistic corrections and using realistic $ \pi K $ interactions. These are obtained from a dispersive analysis of scattering data, which provides an accurate and model-independent description of the $ \kappa/K^*_0(700) $ resonance pole. The chiral symmetry suppression of the $ \pi K $ interactions at low energies and the non-ordinary features of the $ \kappa/K^*_0(700) $ seem to suggest that the $ \pi^+ K_S $ source radius might be surprisingly smaller than for other hadronic processes when using the standard and simple Lednicky-Lyuboshits factorization approximation.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter Effects on the Curvature of Neutron Stars within the new Quarkyonic Model Coupled with Relativistic Mean Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the first time, we analyze the impact of dark matter (DM) on the curvature properties of quarkyonic neutron stars (NS) using a hybrid model based on quarkyonic-effective field theory within the relativistic mean-field (E-RMF) framework. This study examines the radial variation of curvature components, including the Ricci scalar ($\cal{R}$), Ricci tensor ($\cal{J}$), Kretschmann scalar ($\cal{K}$), and Weyl tensor ($\cal{W}$), under different DM admixtures. These components offer critical insights into the spacetime geometry and gravitational field strength within the star. The analysis spans canonical mass (1.4 $M_{\odot}$) and maximum mass configurations, varying key parameters such as the transition density ($n_t$) and QCD confinement scale ($\Lambda_{\rm cs}$), which influence matter transitions and quark confinement. Our results reveal that DM and quarkyonic matter (QM) significantly affect the star's curvature. Central curvature values, particularly $\cal{R}$, $\cal{J}$, and $\cal{K}$, increase with DM due to higher central densities but decrease with stronger QM effects. Stiffer EOSs yield smoother curvature profiles, while softer EOSs influenced by DM redistribute curvature more dynamically. DM softens the EOS, reducing central pressure and compactness, whereas higher $n_t$ values enhance compactness and central pressures. These findings show that dark matter plays a key role in shaping the curvature of quarkyonic neutron stars, offering new insights into compact objects with exotic matter.</description>

      <title>Evolution of two-neutrons configuration from 11Li to 13Li</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we investigate the two-neutron decay of 13Li and of the excited states of 11Li populated via one-proton removal from 14Be and 12Be, respectively. A phenomenological model is used to describe the decay of 11Li and 13Li. While the first one displays important sequential components, the second one appears dominated by the direct two-neutron decay. A microscopic three-body model is used to extract information on the spatial configuration of the emitted neutrons before the decay and shows that the average distance between the neutrons increases going from 11Li to 13Li.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the QCD instanton vacuum, the C-even and C-odd nucleon Pauli form factors receive a large contribution from the underlying ensemble of pseudoparticles, that is sensitive to a finite QCD vacuum angle $\theta$. This observation is used to derive explicitly the electric dipole form factor for light quark flavors, and estimate the proton and neutron electric dipole moment induced by a small CP violating $\theta$. The results are in the range of some recently reported lattice simulations.</description>

      <title>The role of finite value of strange quark mass $(m_{s}\neq0)$ and baryon number density $(n)$ on the stability and maximum mass of strange stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study describes the impact of non-zero value of strange quark mass $(m_{s})$ and number density of baryons $(n)$ on the structure, stability and maximum mass of strange stars. We derive an exact relativistic solution of the Einstein field equation using the Tolman-IV metric potential and modified MIT bag model EoS, $p_{r}=\frac{1}{3}(\rho-4B')$, where $B'$ is a function of bag constant $B$, $m_{s}$ and baryon number density $(n)$. Following CERN's findings, transition of phase from hadronic matter to Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) may occur at high densities in presence of favourable conditions. The standard MIT bag model, with a constant $B$, fails to explain such transition properly. Introducing a finite $m_{s}$ and Wood-Saxon parametrisation for $B$, dependent on baryon number density $(n)$, provides a more realistic EoS to address such phase transition. Both $m_{s}$ and $n$ constrain the EoS, making it softer as $m_{s}$ increases. Solutions to the TOV equations reveal that for massless strange quarks, maximum mass is 2.01 $M_{\odot}$ and corresponding radius is 10.96 Km when $n=0.66~fm^{-3}$. These values decrease to 1.99 $M_{\odot}$ and 1.96 $M_{\odot}$, with corresponding radii of 10.88 Km and 10.69 Km for $m_{s}=50$ and $100~MeV$ respectively having same $n$ value. It is interesting to note that a corelation exists between $n$ and $m_{s}$. The hadronic to quark matter transition occurs at higher values of $n$, when $m_{s}$ increases such as $n\geq0.484,~0.489$ and $0.51~fm^{-3}$ for $m_{s}=50$ and $100~MeV$ respectively. Beyond these values, the energy per baryon $(\mathcal{E_{B}})$ drops below $930.4~MeV$, indicating a complete transition to quark matter. For physical analysis, we have considered $n~(=0.578~fm^{-3})$ which lies in the stable region with $B(n)=70~MeV/fm^{3}$. The model provides a viable description of strange stars, satisfying all necessary physical requirements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we will briefly review the recent progress on neutron correlations and clustering in neutron-rich nuclei from quasi-free scattering experiments. The quasi-free ($p$, $pn$) reaction was measured for Borromean nuclei $^{11}$Li, $^{14}$Be, and $^{17}$B. A surprisingly small $s$-wave component was found for $^{17}$B, revealing a weak neutron halo in $^{17}$B, and the comparative study of the three nuclei shows the surface localization of dineutron correlation and its universality in Borromean nuclei. The two-neutron emission of $^{16}$Be was also studied, finding strong dineutron correlation in $^{16}$Be(g.s.) but weak correlation in $^{16}$Be($2^+$). Two missing-mass measurements using $^{4}$He($^{8}$He, $^{8}$Be) and $^{8}$He($p$, $p\alpha$) reactions provided evidence for the $^{4}n$ resonance, but the $^{3}n$ resonance was not supported by the recent experiment employing the $t(t,^3$He)$^3n$ charge-exchange reaction. The quasi-free $(p,p \alpha)$ reaction has been extended to unstable nuclei, and the recent experiment unravels the $\alpha$-$2n$-$\alpha$ molecule-like cluster structure of $^{10}$Be(g.s.).</description>

      <title>Impact of the nuclear equation of state on the formation of twin stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07396v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Twin stars-two stable neutron stars (NSs) with the same mass but different radii have long been proposed to appear as a consequence of a possible first-order phase transition in NS matter. Within a meta-model for the EOS of hybrid stars, we revisit the viability of twin stars and its dependence on numerous parameters characterizing the EOS of nuclear matter, quark matter, and the phase transition between them. While essentially no experimental constraint exists for the last two, parameters characterizing the EOS of neutron-rich nucleonic matter have been constrained within various ranges by terrestrial experiments and astrophysical observations. Within these ranges, the impact of nuclear EOS and crust-core transition density on the formation of twin stars is studied. It is found that the symmetry energy of neutron-rich nucleonic matter notably influences the formation of twin stars, particularly through its slope $L$ and curvature $K_{\rm sym}$. Conversely, varying the EOS of symmetric nuclear matter within their currently known uncertainty ranges shows minimal influence on the formation of twin stars.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20168v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A framework for computing the superfluid gap in an effective field theory (EFT) of fermions interacting via momentum-independent contact forces is developed. The leading universal corrections in the EFT are one-loop in-medium effects at the Fermi surface, and reproduce the well-known Gor'kov-Melik-Barkhudarov result. The complete subleading universal corrections are presented here, and include one-loop effects away from the Fermi surface, two-loop in-medium effects, as well as modifications to the fermion propagator. Together, these effects are found to reduce the gap at low densities. Applications to neutron superfluidity in neutron stars are also discussed.</description>

Abstract: New liquid drop model with the isospin-square dependence of the volume and surface energy terms is applied to reproduce experimentally known masses of nuclei with number of protons and neutrons larger or equal to twenty. The ground-state microscopic energy corrections are taken into account. In spite of the fact that the model contains only six adjustable parameters, the quality of mass reproduction is good, and it is comparable with other contemporary mass models. Also, the fission barrier heights of actinide nuclei evaluated using the topographical theorem of Myers and Swiatecki are close to the data.</description>

      <title>The elliptic flow difference between baryons and anti-baryons in heavy collision with SMASH Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20765v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A significant difference in the elliptic flow $v_2$ for particles and their corresponding antiparticles, which is more pronounced for baryons and anti-baryons, was observed in the STAR experiment during the Beam Energy Scan I (BES-I) at RHIC. By employing the SMASH model, we study the $v_2$ difference between protons and anti-protons, as well as between $\Lambda$ and $\bar{\Lambda}$, in Au + Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 7.7$ GeV as a function of evolution time. It finds that as the evolution time increases, the $v_2$ difference between protons and anti-protons becomes more pronounced compared to that between $\Lambda$ and $\bar{\Lambda}$. This phenomenon can be explained by the different constituent quarks of protons and $\Lambda$. Since some of the $u$ quarks and $d$ quarks come from the colliding nuclei and are transported to mid-rapidity, they undergo more interactions than produced quarks, resulting in the proton $\Delta v_2$ being larger than the $\Lambda$ $\Delta v_2$. We compare the SMASH calculations with STAR BES-I data and argue that higher precision data from BES-II will provide constraints on theoretical frameworks to interpret the $v_2$ differences of particles and anti-particles.</description>

Abstract: Cold and dense matter may break rotational symmetry spontaneously and thus form an anisotropic phase in the interior of neutron stars. We consider the concrete example of an anisotropic chiral condensate in the form of a chiral density wave. Employing a nucleon-meson model and taking into account fermionic vacuum fluctuations, we improve and extend previous results by imposing the conditions of electric charge neutrality and electroweak equilibrium, by allowing for a more general form of the vector meson self-interactions, and by including properties of pure neutron matter into the fit of the model parameters. We find that the conditions inside neutron stars postpone the onset of the chiral density wave to larger densities compared to isospin-symmetric nuclear matter. While this still allows for the construction of stars with an anisotropic core, we find that the chiral density wave is energetically preferred only in a corner of the parameter space where matter is too soft to generate stars with realistic masses. Therefore, taking into account constraints from astrophysical data, our calculation predicts an isotropic neutron star core.</description>

      <title>Fermionic equations of motion in strongly-correlated media: applications to the nuclear many-body problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18209v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: These notes summarise the lectures given at the International School of Physics "Enrico Fermi" in Summer 2024 in Varenna (Italy) about the strongly coupled quantum many-body theory and its applications to nuclear structure. The lectures present a rather short overview of the subject with an emphasis on the analytical aspects of the nuclear many-body problem, aiming at a deep understanding of the complexity of strongly coupled nucleonic states and emergent collective phenomena. The major pedagogical focus is recognizing how all the models describing nuclear dynamics follow from a unified model-independent framework formulated in the universal language of quantum field theory. In particular, connections between the classes of ab initio, density functional theory, and beyond mean-field approaches are made accessible. Approximations of varying complexity are discussed in applications to excited states of medium-heavy nuclei.</description>

      <title>Hadron momentum spectra from analytical solutions of relativistic hydrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00624v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present analytical solution of relativistic hydrodynamics for a system having cylindrical symmetry with boost-invariant longitudinal expansion and Hubble-like transverse expansion. We also consider analytical solution for Hubble-like spherically expanding system. For these two cases, we calculate analytical expression for transverse momentum spectra of hadrons, at constant temperature freeze-out hypersurface using Cooper-Frye prescription. We compare our results for transverse momentum spectra with experimental results from Large Hadron Collider and CERN SPS where one expects cylindrical and spherical geometry of the fireball, respectively. In the case of low-energy collisions with spherical geometry, we calculate rapidity spectra and compare with the results from CERN SPS.</description>

      <title>Steps Toward Quantum Simulations of Hadronization and Energy-Loss in Dense Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06620v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A framework for simulating the real-time dynamics of composite particles in a simple model of dense matter that is amenable to quantum computers is developed. As a demonstration, we perform classical simulations of heavy-hadrons propagating through a dense medium in the Schwinger model. Measurements of the time-dependent energy and charge density are used to identify mechanisms responsible for energy loss and hadron production (hadronization). A study of entanglement dynamics highlights the importance of quantum coherence between the particles that make up the dense medium. Throughout this work, care is taken to isolate, and remove, phenomena that arise solely from a finite lattice spacing. It is found that signatures of entanglement are more sensitive to lattice artifacts than other observables. Toward quantum simulations, we present an efficient method and the corresponding quantum circuits for preparing ground states in the presence of heavy mesons. These circuits are used to estimate the resources required to simulate in-medium energy loss and hadronization in the Schwinger model using quantum computers.</description>

      <title>White paper on (${\alpha}$, n) neutron yield calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07952v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the radiogenic neutron production rate through the (${\alpha}$, n) reaction is crucial in many areas of physics, including dark matter searches, neutrino studies, and nuclear astrophysics. In addition to its relevance for fundamental research, the (${\alpha}$, n) reaction also plays a significant role in nuclear energy technologies and in applications such as medical physics. This white paper reviews the current state of (${\alpha}$, n) yield calculations, neutron spectra, and describes the computational tools used for their estimation and the available cross-sections. The uncertainties affecting the estimation of (${\alpha}$, n) yields are addressed, and a program to enhance the accuracy of these estimates is proposed. Furthermore, the need for new measurements of (${\alpha}$, n) cross-sections for a variety of relevant materials is emphasized. Such improvements in neutron flux predictions are crucial for reducing uncertainties in sensitivity estimates for next-generation physics experiments operating in the keV--MeV range.</description>

      <title>Gamma decay of the $^{154}$Sm Isovector Giant Dipole Resonance: Smekal-Raman Scattering as a Novel Probe of Nuclear Ground-State Deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19695v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gamma decays of the isovector giant dipole resonance (GDR) of the deformed nucleus $^{154}$Sm from $2^+_1$-Smekal-Raman and elastic scattering were measured using linearly polarized, quasimonochromatic photon beams. The two scattering processes were disentangled through their distinct angular distributions. Their branching ratio and cross sections were determined at six excitation energies covering the $^{154}$Sm GDR. Both agree with the predictions of the geometrical model for the GDR and establish $\gamma$ decay as an observable sensitive to the structure of the resonance. Consequently, the data place strong constraints on the nuclear shape, including the degree of triaxiality. The derived $^{154}$Sm shape parameters $\beta=0.2926(26)$ and $\gamma=5.0(14)$ agree well with other measurements and recent Monte Carlo Shell-Model calculations.</description>

      <title>Spin polarization of fermions at local equilibrium: Second-order gradient expansion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12130v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a calculation of the spin polarization of spin-1/2 fermions in a relativistic fluid at local thermodynamic equilibrium at the second order in the gradient expansion, including second-order derivatives. The second-order derivative terms vanish if the local equilibrium hypersurface is the hyperplane $t=const$ in the collision center-of-mass frame. However, since the freeze-out hypersurface has a non-trivial space-time structure, these terms may result in a non-vanishing contribution to the spin polarization, whose magnitude needs to be assessed with numerical computations.</description>

      <title>Simple high-accuracy method for solving bound-state equations with the Cornell potential in momentum space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21789v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The well-known Cornell quark-antiquark potential in momentum space contains singularities both in its one-gluon-exchange (OGE) and linear confining parts, which prevents a direct use of the convenient Nystr\"om method to solve the corresponding bound-state integral equation for the meson masses. While it has been known for a long time how the Coulomb-type singularity in the OGE potential can be treated with a subtraction technique, only very complicated methods have been developed to deal with the stronger singularity in the linear potential. In this work, we present a simple subtraction method to remove this singularity from the kernel, such that the Nystr\"om method becomes applicable. Derivatives of the wave function, that appear as a result of the subtraction, are represented by means of interpolating functions, for which we found Lagrange polynomials to be very efficient. Test calculations show excellent agreement with exactly known energy eigenvalues. By increasing the number of integration points and the order of the Lagrange interpolation polynomials, extremely high accuracy can be achieved. This method can also be extended to relativistic Bethe-Salpeter type equations with singular kernels.</description>

      <title>Interacting quark matter and $f(Q)$ gravity: A new paradigm in exploring the properties of quark stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00693v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics corrections and the colour superconductivity indicate that strongly interacting matter can manifest unique physical behaviours under extreme conditions. Motivated by this notion, we investigate the interior structure and properties of quark stars composed of interacting quark matter, which provides a comprehensive avenue to explore the strong interaction effects, within the framework of $f(Q)$ gravity. A unified equation of state is formulated to describe various phases of quark matter, including up-down quark matter $(2SC)$, strange quark matter $(2SC+s)$, and the Colour-Flavor Locked $(CFL)$ phase. By employing a systematic reparametrisation and rescaling, the number of degrees of freedom in the equation of state is significantly reduced. Utilising the Buchdahl-I metric ansatz and a linear $f(Q)$ functional form, $f(Q)=\alpha_{0}+\alpha_{1}Q$, we derive the exact solutions of the Einstein field equations in presence of the unified interacting quark matter equation of state. For the $2SC$ phase, we examine the properties of quark stars composed of up-down quark matter. For the $(2SC+s)$and $CFL$ phases, we incorporate the effects of a finite strange quark mass $(m_{s}\neq0)$. The Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations are numerically solved to determine the maximum mass-radius relations for each phase. Our results indicate that the model satisfies key physical criteria, including causality, energy conditions, and stability requirements, ensuring the viability of the configurations. Furthermore, the predicted radii for certain compact star candidates align well with observational data. The study highlights that quark stars composed of interacting quark matter within the $f(Q)$ gravity framework provide a robust and physically consistent stellar model across all considered phases.</description>
