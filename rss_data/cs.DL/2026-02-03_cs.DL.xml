      <title>Smarter AI Through Prompt Engineering: Insights and Case Studies from Data Science Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The field of prompt engineering is becoming an essential phenomenon in artificial intelligence. It is altering how data scientists interact with large language models (LLMs) for analytics applications. This research paper shares empirical results from different studies on prompt engineering with regards to its methodology, effectiveness, and applications. Through case studies in healthcare, materials science, financial services, and business intelligence, we demonstrate how the use of structured prompting techniques can improve performance on a range of tasks by between 6% and more than 30%. The effectiveness of prompts relies on their complexity, according to our findings. Further, model architecture and optimisation strategy also depend on these factors as well. We also found promise in advanced frameworks such as chain-of-thought reasoning and automatic optimisers. The proof indicates that prompt engineering allows access to strong AI localisation. Nonetheless, there is plenty of information regarding standardisation, interpretability and the ethical use of AI.</description>

      <title>Assessing and Comparing the Coverage of Publications of Italian Universities in OpenCitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent initiatives advocating responsible, transparent research assessment have intensified the call to use open research information rather than proprietary databases. This study evaluates the coverage and citation representation of publications recorded in the Current Research Information Systems (CRIS), all instances of the IRIS software platform, of six Italian universities within OpenCitations, a community-owned open infrastructure. Using persistent identifiers (DOIs, PMIDs, and ISBNs) specified in the IRIS installations involved, we matched the publications recorded in OpenCitations Meta and extracted the related citation links from the OpenCitations Index. Results show that OpenCitations covers, on average, over 40% of IRIS publications, which is quantitatively comparable to those reported by Scopus and Web of Science in another study. However, gaps persist, particularly for publication types prevalent in the Social Sciences and Humanities, such as monographs and critical editions. Overall, the findings demonstrate the growing maturity of OpenCitations and, more broadly, of Open Science infrastructures as viable alternatives as sources of research information, while highlighting areas where further metadata enrichment and interoperability efforts are needed.</description>

      <title>Unmediated AI-Assisted Scholarly Citations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional bibliography databases require users to navigate search forms and manually copy citation data. Language models offer an alternative: a natural-language interface where researchers write text with informal citation fragments, which are automatically resolved to proper references. However, language models are not reliable for scholarly work as they generate fabricated (hallucinated) citations at substantial rates.
  We present an architectural approach that combines the natural-language interface of LLM chatbots with the accuracy of direct database access, implemented through the Model Context Protocol. Our system enables language models to search bibliographic databases, perform fuzzy matching, and export verified entries, all through conversational interaction.
  A key architectural principle bypasses the language model during final data export: entries are fetched directly from authoritative sources, with timeout protection, to guarantee accuracy. We demonstrate this approach with MCP-DBLP, a server providing access to the DBLP computer science bibliography. The system transforms form-based bibliographic services into conversational assistants that maintain scholarly integrity. This architecture is adaptable to other bibliographic databases and academic data sources.</description>

      <title>Mapping a Decade of Avian Influenza Research (2014-2023): A Scientometric Analysis from Web of Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This scientometric study analyzes Avian Influenza research from 2014 to 2023 using bibliographic data from the Web of Science database. We examined publication trends, sources, authorship, collaborative networks, document types, and geographical distribution to gain insights into the global research landscape. Results reveal a steady increase in publications, with high contributions from Chinese and American institutions. Journals such as PLoS One and the Journal of Virology published the highest number of studies, indicating their influence in this field. The most prolific institutions include the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the University of Hong Kong, while the College of Veterinary Medicine at South China Agricultural University emerged as the most productive department. China and the USA lead in publication volume, though developed nations like the United Kingdom and Germany exhibit a higher rate of international collaboration. "Articles" are the most common document type, constituting 84.6% of the total, while "Reviews" account for 7.6%. This study provides a comprehensive view of global trends in Avian Influenza research, emphasizing the need for collaborative efforts across borders.</description>

      <title>C$^2$-Cite: Contextual-Aware Citation Generation for Attributed Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The attribution technique enhances the credibility of LLMs by adding citations to the generated sentences, enabling users to trace back to the original sources and verify the reliability of the output. However, existing instruction-tuned attributed LLMs often fail to properly interpret the contextual semantics of citation symbols (e.g., [i]) during text generation. This shortcoming arises from their insufficient awareness of the context information surrounding citation markers, which in turn leads to disjointed references and poor integration of retrieved knowledge into the generated content. To address this issue, we propose a novel \textbf{C}ontextual-aware \textbf{C}itation generation framework (\textbf{C$^2$}-\textbf{Cite}) that explicitly integrates the semantic relationships between citation markers and their referenced content. Specifically, a contextual citation alignment mechanism is adopted: it first encodes the retrieved document contexts into the symbol representation of citations, then aligns the marker numbers by decoding information from a citation router function. This mechanism enables the transformation of citation markers from generic placeholders into active knowledge pointers that link to the referenced source information. Experimental results on the ALCE benchmark across three datasets validate our framework C$^2$-Cite++: it outperforms the SOTA baseline by an average of 5.8\% in citation quality and 17.4\% in response correctness. The implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/BAI-LAB/c2cite</description>

      <title>Examining The CoVCues Dataset: Supporting COVID Infodemic Research Through A Novel User Assessment Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The public confidence and trust in online healthcare information have been greatly dented following the COVID-19 pandemic, which triggered a significant rise in online health misinformation. Existing literature shows that different datasets have been created to aid with detecting false information associated with this COVID infodemic. However, most of these datasets contain mostly unimodal data, which comprise primarily textual cues, and not visual cues, like images, infographics, and other graphic data components. Prior works point to the fact that there are only a handful of multimodal datasets that support COVID misinformation identification, and they lack an organized, processed and analyzed repository of visual cues. The novel CoVCues dataset, which represents a varied set of image artifacts, addresses this gap and advocates for the use of visual cues towards detecting online health misinformation. As part of validating the contents and utility of our CoVCues dataset, we have conducted a preliminary user assessment study, where different participants have been surveyed through a set of questionnaires to determine how effectively these dataset images contribute to the user perceived information reliability. These survey responses helped provide early insights into how different stakeholder groups interpret visual cues in the context of online health information and communication. The findings from this novel user assessment study offer valuable feedback for refining our CoVCues dataset and for supporting our claim that visual cues are underutilized but useful in combating the COVID infodemic. To our knowledge, this user assessment research study, as described in this paper, is the first of its kind work, involving COVID visual cues, that demonstrates the important role that our CoVCues dataset can potentially play in aiding COVID infodemic related future research work.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19872v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on the analysis of the data obtainable from the Web of Science publication and citation database, typical signs of possible papermilling behavior are described, quantified, and illustrated by examples. A MATLAB function is provided for the analysis of the outputs from the Web of Science. A new quantitative indicator -- integrity index, or I-index -- is proposed for using it along with standard bibliographic and scientometric indicators. A case study is presented.</description>

      <title>Automated Archival Descriptions with Federated Intelligence of LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05711v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Enforcing archival standards requires specialized expertise, and manually creating metadata descriptions for archival materials is a tedious and error-prone task. This work aims at exploring the potential of agentic AI and large language models (LLMs) in addressing the challenges of implementing a standardized archival description process. To this end, we introduce an agentic AI-driven system for automated generation of high-quality metadata descriptions of archival materials. We develop a federated optimization approach that unites the intelligence of multiple LLMs to construct optimal archival metadata. We also suggest methods to overcome the challenges associated with using LLMs for consistent metadata generation. To evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of our techniques, we conducted extensive experiments using a real-world dataset of archival materials, which covers a variety of document types and formats. The evaluation results demonstrate the feasibility of our techniques and highlight the superior performance of the federated optimization approach compared to single-model solutions in metadata quality and reliability.</description>

      <title>On (Newcomb-)Benford's law: a tale of two papers and of their disproportionate citations. How citation counts can become biased</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02395v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The first digit (FD) phenomenon i.e., the significant digits of numbers in large data are often distributed according to a logarithmically decreasing function was first reported by S. Newcomb and then many decades later independently by F. Benford. After its century long neglect the last three decades have seen huge growth in the number of relevant publications. However, notwithstanding the rising popularity the two independent proponents of the phenomenon are not equally acknowledged an indication of which is disproportionate number of citations accumulated by Newcomb (1881) and Benford (1938). In the present study we use citation analysis to show that the formalization of the eponym Benford's law, a name questionable itself for overlooking Newcomb's contribution, by Raimi (1976) had a strong adverse effect on the future citations of Newcomb (1881). Furthermore, we identify the papers published over various decades of the developmental history of the FD phenomenon, which latter turned out to be amongst the most cited ones in the field. We find that lack of its consideration, intentional or occasionally out of ignorance for referencing by the prominent papers, is responsible for a far lesser number of citations of Newcomb (1881) in comparison to Benford (1938).</description>
