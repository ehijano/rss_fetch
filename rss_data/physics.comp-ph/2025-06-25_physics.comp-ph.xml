      <title>Optimized auxiliary functions for robust mitigation of finite-size errors in periodic hybrid density functional theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When calculating properties of periodic systems at the thermodynamic limit (TDL), the dominant source of finite size error (FSE) arises from the long-range Coulomb interaction, and can manifest as a slowly converging quadrature error when approximating an integral in the reciprocal space by a finite sum. The singularity subtraction (SS) method offers a systematic approach for reducing this quadrature error and thus the FSE. In this work, we first investigate the performance of the SS method in the simplest setting, aiming at reducing the FSE in exact exchange calculations by subtracting the Coulomb contribution with a single, adjustable Gaussian auxiliary function. We demonstrate that a simple fitting method can robustly estimate the optimal Gaussian width and leads to rapid convergence toward the TDL. Furthermore, we suggest new forms of the auxiliary function, whose optimal parameters could also be determined through least-squares fitting. For a range of semiconductors and insulators, the proposed auxiliary functions achieve robust, millihartree-level accuracy in hybrid density functional theory calculations, including cases with sparse k-meshes and large basis sets.</description>

      <title>From Brownian dynamics to Poisson-Nernst-Planck equations: multi-resolution simulations of ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Starting with a microscopic (individual-based) Brownian dynamics model of charged particles (ions), its macroscopic description is derived as a system of partial differential equations that govern the evolution of ion concentrations in space and time. The macroscopic equations are obtained in the form of the Poisson-Nernst-Planck system. A multi-resolution method for simulating charged particles is then developed, combining the detailed Brownian dynamics model in a part of the computational domain with coarser macroscopic equations in the remainder. The strengths, limitations, and applicability of microscopic, macroscopic, and multi-resolution simulation approaches are demonstrated through an illustrative model comprising a system of Na$^+$ and Cl$^-$ ions.</description>

      <title>Efficient calculation of thermodynamic properties of baryon-rich QCD matter from heavy-ion transport models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents the MATRICS framework (Modeling Aggregated Tensors for Relativistic Ion Collision Simulations) that implements modular workflows to enable parallel execution of particle generation, grid construction, and tensor calculations for heavy-ion collisions. It introduces an efficient approach to calculating the space-time distribution of the energy-momentum tensor and charge currents from discrete particles generated by transport models. By dynamically adjusting grid resolution based on particle density and clustering particles into representative super-particles, MATRICS optimizes computational efficiency while maintaining high physical accuracy. The framework can also provide a thermodynamic background for electromagnetic thermal emission calculations or serve as initial conditions for hydrodynamic evolution. It offers a powerful tool for exploring the thermodynamic properties of QCD matter at high baryon densities, making it well-suited for large-scale simulations in heavy-ion collision studies.</description>

      <title>Efficient Berry Phase Calculation via Adaptive Variational Quantum Computing Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a quantum computing approach for efficiently calculating the Berry phase in topological Hamiltonians. Our method leverages cyclic adiabatic evolution of the Hamiltonian and employs adaptive variational quantum algorithms for state preparation and evolution, optimizing circuit efficiency while maintaining high accuracy. We benchmark our approach on dimerized Fermi-Hubbard chains with four sites, demonstrating precise Berry phase simulations in both noninteracting and interacting regimes. Our results show that circuit depths reach up to 106 layers for noninteracting systems and increase to 279 layers for interacting systems due to added complexity. Additionally, we demonstrate the robustness of our scheme across a wide range of parameters governing adiabatic evolution and variational algorithm. These findings highlight the potential of adaptive variational quantum algorithms for advancing quantum simulations of topological materials and computing geometric phases in strongly correlated systems.</description>

      <title>Deep Electromagnetic Structure Design Under Limited Evaluation Budgets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electromagnetic structure (EMS) design plays a critical role in developing advanced antennas and materials, but remains challenging due to high-dimensional design spaces and expensive evaluations. While existing methods commonly employ high-quality predictors or generators to alleviate evaluations, they are often data-intensive and struggle with real-world scale and budget constraints. To address this, we propose a novel method called Progressive Quadtree-based Search (PQS). Rather than exhaustively exploring the high-dimensional space, PQS converts the conventional image-like layout into a quadtree-based hierarchical representation, enabling a progressive search from global patterns to local details. Furthermore, to lessen reliance on highly accurate predictors, we introduce a consistency-driven sample selection mechanism. This mechanism quantifies the reliability of predictions, balancing exploitation and exploration when selecting candidate designs. We evaluate PQS on two real-world engineering tasks, i.e., Dual-layer Frequency Selective Surface and High-gain Antenna. Experimental results show that our method can achieve satisfactory designs under limited computational budgets, outperforming baseline methods. In particular, compared to generative approaches, it cuts evaluation costs by 75-85%, effectively saving 20.27-38.80 days of product designing cycle.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of discrete spacetimes with Quantum-enhanced Markov Chain Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum algorithms offer the potential for significant computational advantages; however, in many cases, it remains unclear how these advantages can be practically realized. Causal Set Theory is a discrete, Lorentz-invariant approach to quantum gravity which may be well positioned to benefit from quantum computing. In this work, we introduce a quantum algorithm that investigates the dynamics of causal sets by sampling the space of causal sets, improving on classical methods. Our approach builds on the quantum-enhanced Markov chain Monte Carlo technique developed by Layden et al. [Nature 619, 282 (2023)], adapting it to sample from the constrained spaces required for application. This is done by adding a constraint term to the Hamiltonian of the system. A qubit Hamiltonian representing the Benincasa-Dowker action (the causal set equivalent of the Einstein-Hilbert action) is also derived and used in the algorithm as the problem Hamiltonian. We achieve a super-quadratic quantum scaling advantage and, under some conditions, demonstrate a greater potential compared to classical approaches than previously observed in unconstrained QeMCMC implementations.</description>

      <title>Numerical solution of quantum Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The classical Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation has long served as a cornerstone for modeling magnetization dynamics in magnetic systems, yet its classical nature limits its applicability to inherently quantum phenomena such as entanglement and nonlocal correlations. Inspired by the need to incorporate quantum effects into spin dynamics, recently a quantum generalization of the LLG equation is proposed [Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 266704 (2024)] which captures essential quantum behavior in many-body systems. In this work, we develop a robust numerical methodology tailored to this quantum LLG framework that not only handles the complexity of quantum many-body systems but also preserves the intrinsic mathematical structures and physical properties dictated by the equation. We apply the proposed method to a class of many-body quantum spin systems, which host topological states of matter, and demonstrate rich quantum behavior, including the emergence of long-time entangled states. This approach opens a pathway toward reliable simulations of quantum magnetism beyond classical approximations, potentially leading to new discoveries.</description>

      <title>Beyond Static Models: Hypernetworks for Adaptive and Generalizable Forecasting in Complex Parametric Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamical systems play a key role in modeling, forecasting, and decision-making across a wide range of scientific domains. However, variations in system parameters, also referred to as parametric variability, can lead to drastically different model behavior and output, posing challenges for constructing models that generalize across parameter regimes. In this work, we introduce the Parametric Hypernetwork for Learning Interpolated Networks (PHLieNet), a framework that simultaneously learns: (a) a global mapping from the parameter space to a nonlinear embedding and (b) a mapping from the inferred embedding to the weights of a dynamics propagation network. The learned embedding serves as a latent representation that modulates a base network, termed the hypernetwork, enabling it to generate the weights of a target network responsible for forecasting the system's state evolution conditioned on the previous time history. By interpolating in the space of models rather than observations, PHLieNet facilitates smooth transitions across parameterized system behaviors, enabling a unified model that captures the dynamic behavior across a broad range of system parameterizations. The performance of the proposed technique is validated in a series of dynamical systems with respect to its ability to extrapolate in time and interpolate and extrapolate in the parameter space, i.e., generalize to dynamics that were unseen during training. In all cases, our approach outperforms or matches state-of-the-art baselines in both short-term forecast accuracy and in capturing long-term dynamical features, such as attractor statistics.</description>

      <title>Operator Forces For Coarse-Grained Molecular Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coarse-grained (CG) molecular dynamics simulations extend the length and time scale of atomistic simulations by replacing groups of correlated atoms with CG beads. Machine-learned coarse-graining (MLCG) has recently emerged as a promising approach to construct highly accurate force fields for CG molecular dynamics. However, the calibration of MLCG force fields typically hinges on force matching, which demands extensive reference atomistic trajectories with corresponding force labels. In practice, atomistic forces are often not recorded, making traditional force matching infeasible on pre-existing datasets. Recently, noise-based kernels have been introduced to adapt force matching to the low-data regime, including situations in which reference atomistic forces are not present. While this approach produces force fields which recapitulate slow collective motion, it introduces significant local distortions due to the corrupting effects of the noise-based kernel. In this work, we introduce more general kernels based on normalizing flows that substantially reduce these local distortions while preserving global conformational accuracy. We demonstrate our method on small proteins, showing that flow-based kernels can generate high-quality CG forces solely from configurational samples.</description>

      <title>Noncontextual Pauli Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contextuality is a key feature of quantum mechanics, and identification of noncontextual subtheories of quantum mechanics is of both fundamental and practical importance. Recently, noncontextual Pauli Hamiltonians have been defined in the setting of variational quantum algorithms. In this work we rigorously establish a number of properties of noncontextual Pauli Hamiltonians. We prove that these Hamiltonians can be composed of more Pauli operators than diagonal Hamiltonians. This establishes that noncontextual Hamiltonians are able to describe a greater number of physical interactions. We then show that the eigenspaces admit an efficient classical description. We analyse the eigenspace of these Hamiltonians and prove that for every eigenvalue there exists an associated eigenvector whose stabilizer rank scales linearly with the number of qubits. We prove that further structure in these Hamiltonians allow us to derive where degeneracies in the eigenspectrum can arise. We thus open the field to a new class of efficiently simulatable states.</description>

      <title>Petrov-Galerkin model reduction for collisional-radiative argon plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05483v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-fidelity simulation of nonequilibrium plasmas -- crucial to applications in electric propulsion, hypersonic re-entry, and astrophysical flows -- requires state-specific collisional-radiative (CR) kinetic models, but these come at a prohibitive computational cost. Traditionally, this cost has been mitigated through empirical or physics-based simplifications of the governing equations. However, such approaches often fail to retain the essential features of the original dynamics, particularly under strong nonequilibrium conditions. To address these limitations, we develop a Petrov-Galerkin reduced-order model (ROM) for CR argon plasma based on oblique projections that optimally balance the covariance of full-order state trajectories with that of the system's output sensitivities. This construction ensures that the ROM captures both the dominant energetic modes and the directions most relevant to input-output behavior. After offline training in a zero-dimensional setting using nonlinear forward and adjoint simulations, the ROM is coupled to a finite-volume solver and applied to one- (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) ionizing shock-tube problems. The ROM achieves a 3$\times$ reduction in state dimension and more than one order of magnitude savings in floating-point operations, while maintaining errors below 1% for macroscopic quantities. In both 1D and 2D, it robustly reproduces complex unsteady plasma features -- such as periodic fluctuations, electron avalanches, triple points, and cellular ionization patterns -- in contrast to standard ROM strategies, which become unstable or inaccurate under these challenging conditions. These results demonstrate that the proposed projection-based ROM enables substantial model compression while preserving key physical mechanisms in nonequilibrium plasma physics, paving the way for fast, reliable simulation of high-speed plasma flows.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-Driven Insights into Excitonic Effects in 2D Materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01092v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding excitonic effects in two-dimensional (2D) materials is critical for advancing their potential in next-generation electronic and photonic devices. In this study, we introduce a machine learning (ML)-based framework to predict exciton binding energies in 2D materials, offering a computationally efficient alternative to traditional methods such as many-body perturbation theory (GW) and the Bethe-Salpeter equation. Leveraging data from the Computational 2D Materials Database (C2DB), our ML models establish connections between cheaply available material descriptors and complex excitonic properties, significantly accelerating the screening process for materials with pronounced excitonic effects. Additionally, Bayesian optimization with Gaussian process regression was employed to efficiently filter materials with largest exciton binding energies, further enhancing the discovery process. Although developed for 2D systems, this approach is versatile and can be extended to three-dimensional materials, broadening its applicability in materials discovery.</description>

      <title>GPU-accelerated Subcycling Time Integration with the Einstein Toolkit</title>

Abstract: Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) with subcycling in time enables different grid levels to advance using their own time steps, ensuring finer grids employ smaller steps for accuracy while coarser grids take larger steps to improve computational efficiency. We present the development, validation, and performance analysis of a subcycling in time algorithm implemented within the CarpetX driver in the Einstein Toolkit framework. This new approach significantly improves upon the previous subcycling implementation in the Carpet driver by achieving higher-order convergence -- fourth order in time instead of second order -- and enhanced scaling performance. The key innovation lies in optimizing the exchange of ghost points at refinement boundaries, limiting it to the same number as those at inter-process boundaries using dense output from coarser levels, thereby reducing computational and communication overhead compared to the implementation in Carpet, which required a larger number of buffer zones.
  To validate the algorithm, we first demonstrate its fourth-order convergence using a scalar wave test. We then apply the algorithm to binary black hole (BBH) simulations, confirming its robustness and accuracy in a realistic astrophysical scenario. The results show excellent agreement with the well-established LazEv code. Scaling tests on CPU (Frontera) and GPU (Vista) clusters reveal significant performance gains, with the new implementation achieving improved speed and scalability compared to the Carpet-based version.</description>

      <title>Efficient Crystal Structure Prediction Using Genetic Algorithm and Universal Neural Network Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21201v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Crystal structure prediction (CSP) is crucial for identifying stable crystal structures in given systems and is a prerequisite for computational atomistic simulations. Recent advances in neural network potentials (NNPs) have reduced the computational cost of CSP. However, searching for stable crystal structures across the entire composition space in multicomponent systems remains a significant challenge. Here, we propose a novel genetic algorithm (GA) -based CSP method using a universal NNP. Our GA-based methods are designed to efficiently expand convex hull volumes while preserving the diversity of crystal structures. This approach draws inspiration from the similarity between convex hull updates and Pareto front evolution in multi-objective optimization. Our evaluation shows that the present method outperforms the symmetry-aware random structure generation, achieving a larger convex hull with fewer trials. We demonstrated that our approach, combined with the developed universal NNP (PFP), can accurately reproduce and explore phase diagrams obtained through DFT calculations; this indicates the validity of PFP across a wide range of crystal structures and element combinations. This study, which integrates a universal NNP with a GA-based CSP method, highlights the promise of these methods in materials discovery.</description>

Abstract: We introduce an extension of the time-dependent variational Monte Carlo (tVMC) method that adaptively controls the expressivity of the variational quantum state during the simulation. This adaptive tVMC approach addresses numerical instabilities that arise when the variational ansatz is overparameterized or contains redundant degrees of freedom. Building on the concept of the local-in-time error (LITE), a measure of the deviation between variational and exact evolution, we introduce a procedure to quantify each parameter's contribution to reducing the LITE, using only quantities already computed in standard tVMC simulations. These relevance estimates guide the selective evolution of only the most significant parameters at each time step, while maintaining a prescribed level of accuracy. We benchmark the algorithm on quantum quenches in the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model using both spin-Jastrow and restricted Boltzmann machine wave functions, with an emphasis on overparameterized regimes. The adaptive scheme significantly improves numerical stability and reduces the need for strong regularization, enabling reliable simulations with highly expressive variational ans\"atze.</description>
