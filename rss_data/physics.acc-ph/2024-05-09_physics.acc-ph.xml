      <title>Synchronization and Phase Locking of Resonant Magnet Power Supplies For Mu2e Experiment at Fermilab</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Muon-to-Electron Conversion (Mu2e) Experiment demands a highly precise magnet and collimator system to achieve a stringent extinction level of $1\times 10^{-10}$ for out-of-time beam particles. Extinction is ensured by an AC Dipole system consisting of two magnet components: a 295 kHz system to allow for the passage of a 590 kHz beam at the nodes, and a 4.42 MHz system to minimize in-time beam slewing. Both components must be accurately phase-locked to the Delivery Ring's bunch rate as well as be synchronized with beam transfers from the Recycler.
  In this paper, we present the design, implementation, and results of a control system for the Mu2e magnet system based on an Intel Arria 10 FPGA. This system handles the phase-locking of the magnets to the Delivery Ring, as well as the phase jumps required for synchronization with transfers from the Recycler.</description>

      <title>Beam-induced backgrounds measured in the ATLAS detector during local gas injection into the LHC beam vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inelastic beam-gas collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), within a few hundred metres of the ATLAS experiment, are known to give the dominant contribution to beam backgrounds. These are monitored by ATLAS with a dedicated Beam Conditions Monitor (BCM) and with the rate of fake jets in the calorimeters. These two methods are complementary since the BCM probes backgrounds just around the beam pipe while fake jets are observed at radii of up to several metres. In order to quantify the correlation between the residual gas density in the LHC beam vacuum and the experimental backgrounds recorded by ATLAS, several dedicated tests were performed during LHC Run 2. Local pressure bumps, with a gas density several orders of magnitude higher than during normal operation, were introduced at different locations. The changes of beam-related backgrounds, seen in ATLAS, are correlated with the local pressure variation. In addition the rates of beam-gas events are estimated from the pressure measurements and pressure bump profiles obtained from calculations. Using these rates, the efficiency of the ATLAS beam background monitors to detect beam-gas events is derived as a function of distance from the interaction point. These efficiencies and characteristic distributions of fake jets from the beam backgrounds are found to be in good agreement with results of beam-gas simulations performed with the FLUKA Monte Carlo programme.</description>
