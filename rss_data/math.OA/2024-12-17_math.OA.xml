      <title>Uniform property $\Gamma$ for Crossed products by group actions with the Rokhlin type properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, let $A$ be a unital separable simple infinite dimensional C*-algebra. Let $\alpha\colon G\to \mathrm{Aut}(A)$ be an action of a second-countable compact group which has the tracial Rokhlin property with comparison. Then we prove that the fixed point algebra $A^\alpha$ has uniform property $\Gamma$ (and crossed product $A\rtimes_\alpha G$ has stablized property $\Gamma$). Let $\alpha\colon G\to \mathrm{Aut}(A)$ be an action of a finite group which has the weak tracial Rokhlin property. Then we prove that the crossed product $A\rtimes_\alpha G$ and fixed point algebra $A^\alpha$ have uniform property $\Gamma$.</description>

      <title>Products of C*-algebras that do not embed into the Calkin algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Calkin algebra $\mathcal{Q}(\ell_2)$, i.e., the quotient of the algebra $\mathcal B(\ell_2)$ of all bounded linear operators on the separable Hilbert space $\ell_2$ divided by the ideal $\mathcal K(\ell_2)$ of all compact operators on $\ell_2$. We show that in the Cohen model of set theory ZFC there is no embedding of the product $(c_0(2^\omega))^{\mathbb{N}}$ of infinitely many copies of the abelian C*-algebra $c_0(2^\omega)$ into $\mathcal{Q}(\ell_2)$ (while $c_0(2^\omega)$ always embeds into $\mathcal{Q}(\ell_2)$). This enlarges the collection of the known examples due to Vaccaro and to McKenney and Vignati of abelian algebras, asymptotic sequence algebras, reduced products and coronas of stabilizations which consistently do not embed into the Calkin algebra. As in the Cohen model the rigidity of quotient structures fails in general, our methods do not rely on these rigidity phenomena as is the case of most examples mentioned above. The results should be considered in the context of the result of Farah, Hirshberg and Vignati which says that consistently all C*-algebras of density up to $2^\omega$ do embed into $\mathcal{Q}(\ell_2)$. In particular, the algebra $(c_0(2^\omega))^{\mathbb{N}}$ consistently embeds into the Calkin algebra as well.</description>

      <title>The ideal structure of C*-algebras of etale groupoids with isotropy groups of local polynomial growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given an amenable second countable Hausdorff locally compact \'etale groupoid $\mathcal G$ such that each isotropy group $\mathcal G^x_x$ has local polynomial growth, we give a complete description of $\operatorname{Prim} C^*(\mathcal G)$ as a topological space in terms of the topology on $\mathcal G$ and representation theory of the isotropy groups and their subgroups. The description simplifies when either the isotropy groups are FC-hypercentral or $\mathcal G$ is the transformation groupoid $\Gamma\ltimes X$ defined by an action $\Gamma\curvearrowright X$ with locally finite stabilizers. To illustrate the class of C$^*$-algebras for which our results can provide a complete description of the ideal structure, we compute the primitive spectrum of $\mathrm{SL}_3(\mathbb Z)\ltimes C_0(\mathrm{SL}_3(\mathbb R)/U_3(\mathbb R))$, where $U_3(\mathbb R)$ is the group of unipotent upper triangular matrices.</description>

      <title>On the Nielsen-Thomsen sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Nielsen-Thomsen sequence plays a pivotal role in refining invariants for C$^*$-algebras beyond the Elliott classification framework. This paper revisits the sequence, introducing the concepts of Nielsen-Thomsen bases, rotation maps and diagonalisable morphisms, to better understand its unnatural splitting. These insights enable novel comparison methods for *-homomorphisms at the level of the Hausdorffized algebraic K$_1$-groups, and thereafter the Hausdorffized unitary Cuntz group. We apply our methods to classification via the Hausdorffized unitary Cuntz semigroup. In particular, we present a new proof of the non-isomorphism between the two A$\mathbb{T}$-algebras of [19]. We also exhibit several pairs of (non-unitarily equivalent) *-homomorphisms with domain C($\mathbb{T}$).</description>

      <title>Quantum Mechanics of Arc-Sine and Semi-Circle Distributions: A Unified Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper continues the program of applying beyond physics the technique of \textbf{probabilistic quantization} and extending to the quantum mechanics associated with the arc--sine distributions our previous results on the semi--circle distribution. We derive analytical expressions for the momentum and kinetic energy operators using the arc--sine weighted Hilbert transform and express corresponding evolutions as Neumann series of Bessel functions. These series are applicable in various physical problems and in solving certain mixed difference equations and differential equations. Moreover, exploiting the similarity between the Jacobi sequences of the semi-circle and arc-sine measures, we establish a unified formulation of their quantum mechanics. We introduce the semicircle and arc--sine exponential vectors and the corresponding coherent states and prove that, for both measures, the vacuum distributions of the number operator in these states (arc--sine photon statistics) are a \textit{perturbation} of the geometric distribution (Gibbs states in Boson physics: see the Introduction below for a discussion of the physical meaning of this perturbation). The $*$--Lie algebra generated by canonical creation and annihilation operators of both probability measures is isomorphic to the $*$--Lie algebra generated by all rank-one operators in corresponding $L^2$-spaces. The paper concludes with appendices that discuss the integral and Neumann series representations of the $1$--parameter unitary groups generated by momentum in semi-circle and arc-sine cases.</description>

      <title>Universal covering groups of unitary groups of von Neumann algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13710v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a short and simple proof, utilizing the pre-determinant of P. de la Harpe and G. Skandalis, that the universal covering group of the unitary group of a II$_1$ von Neumann algebra $\mathcal{M}$, when equipped with the norm topology, splits algebraically as the direct product of the self-adjoint part of its center and the unitary group $U(\mathcal{M})$. Thus, when $\mathcal{M}$ is a II$_1$ factor, the universal covering group of $U(\mathcal{M})$ is algebraically isomorphic to the direct product $\mathbb{R} \times U(\mathcal{M})$. In particular, the question of P. de la Harpe and D. McDuff of whether the universal cover of $U(\mathcal{M})$ is a perfect group is answered in the negative.</description>

      <title>Deformed single ring theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.11147v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a sequence of deterministic matrices $A = A_N$ and a sequence of deterministic nonnegative matrices $\Sigma=\Sigma_N$ such that $A\to a$ and $\Sigma\to \sigma$ in $\ast$-distribution for some operators $a$ and $\sigma$ in a finite von Neumann algebra $\mathcal{A}$. Let $U =U_N$ and $V=V_N$ be independent Haar-distributed unitary matrices. We use free probability techniques to prove that, under mild assumptions, the empirical eigenvalue distribution of $U\Sigma V^*+A$ converges to the Brown measure of $T+a$, where $T\in\mathcal{A}$ is an $R$-diagonal operator freely independent from $a$ and $\vert T\vert$ has the same distribution as $\sigma$. The assumptions can be removed if $A$ is Hermitian or unitary. By putting $A= 0$, our result removes a regularity assumption in the single ring theorem by Guionnet, Krishnapur and Zeitouni. We also prove a local convergence on optimal scale, extending the local single ring theorem of Bao, Erd\H{o}s and Schnelli.</description>

      <title>$L^p$ coarse Baum-Connes conjecture via $C_{0}$ coarse geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05333v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the $L^{p}$ coarse Baum-Connes conjecture for $p\in [1,\infty)$ via $C_{0}$ coarse structure, which is a refinement of the bounded coarse structure on a metric space. We prove the $C_{0}$ version of the $L^{p}$ coarse Baum-Connes conjecture and thus construct an obstruction group for the conjecture. As an application, we show that the obstructions vanish under the assumption of finite asymptotic dimension, and hence give a new proof of the $L^{p}$ coarse Baum-Connes conjecture in this case.</description>

      <title>Representations induced by positive and completely positive sesquilinear maps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.24113v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The representations that can be defined starting from positive sesquilinear maps {\Phi} with values in an ordered Banach module are essentially of two types: if {\Phi} is positive, a natural generalization follows the path of the GNS construction; if {\Phi} is completely positive, one can move toward a possible generalization of the Stinespring dilation theorem. Both possibilities are explored in this paper providing representations of positive and completely positive ordered Banach bimodule-valued sesquilinear maps on a quasi *-algebra.</description>

      <title>Non-Local Classical Field Theory with Fractional Operators on $\mathbb{S}^3 \times \mathbb{R}^1$ Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16731v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a theoretical framework on non-local classical field theory using fractional integrodifferential operators. Due to the lack of easily manageable symmetries in traditional fractional calculus and the difficulties that arise in the formalism of multi-fractional calculus over $\mathbb{R}^{\text{D}}$ space, we introduce a set of new fractional operators over the $\mathbb{S}^3 \times \mathbb{R}^1$ space. The redefined fractional integral operator results in the non-trivial measure canonically, and they can account for the spacetime symmetries for the underlying space $\mathbb{S}^3 \times \mathbb{R}^1$ with the Lorentzian signature $(+, -, -, -, -)$. We conclude that the field equation for the non-local classical field can be obtained as the consequence of the optimisation of the action by employing the non-local variations in the field after defining the non-local Lagrangian density, namely, $\mathcal{L}(\phi_{a}\left(x\right), \mathbb{\eth}^\alpha \phi_{a}\left(x\right))$, as the function of the symmetric fractional derivative of the field, e.g. in the context of the kinetic term, and the field itself.</description>

      <title>A new approach to strong convergence II. The classical ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00593v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The first paper in this series introduced a new approach to strong convergence of random matrices that is based primarily on soft arguments. This method was applied to achieve a refined qualitative and quantitative understanding of strong convergence of random permutation matrices and of more general representations of the symmetric group. In this paper, we introduce new ideas that make it possible to achieve stronger quantitative results and that facilitate the application of the method to new models.
  When applied to the Gaussian GUE/GOE/GSE ensembles of dimension $N$, these methods achieve strong convergence for noncommutative polynomials with matrix coefficients of dimension $\exp(o(N))$. This provides a sharp form of a result of Pisier on strong convergence with coefficients in a subexponential operator space. Analogous results up to logarithmic factors are obtained for Haar-distributed random matrices in $\mathrm{U}(N)/\mathrm{O}(N)/\mathrm{Sp}(N)$. We further illustrate the methods of this paper in the following applications.
  1. We obtain improved rates for strong convergence of random permutations.
  2. We obtain a quantitative form of strong convergence of the model introduced by Hayes for the solution of the Peterson-Thom conjecture.
  3. We prove strong convergence of tensor GUE models of $\Gamma$-independence.
  4. We prove strong convergence of all nontrivial representations of $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ of dimension up to $\exp(N^{1/3-\delta})$, improving a result of Magee and de la Salle.</description>
