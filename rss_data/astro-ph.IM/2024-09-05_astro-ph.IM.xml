      <title>COmoving Computer Acceleration (COCA): $N$-body simulations in an emulated frame of reference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $N$-body simulations are computationally expensive, so machine-learning (ML)-based emulation techniques have emerged as a way to increase their speed. Although fast, surrogate models have limited trustworthiness due to potentially substantial emulation errors that current approaches cannot correct for. To alleviate this problem, we introduce COmoving Computer Acceleration (COCA), a hybrid framework interfacing ML with an $N$-body simulator. The correct physical equations of motion are solved in an emulated frame of reference, so that any emulation error is corrected by design. This approach corresponds to solving for the perturbation of particle trajectories around the machine-learnt solution, which is computationally cheaper than obtaining the full solution, yet is guaranteed to converge to the truth as one increases the number of force evaluations. Although applicable to any ML algorithm and $N$-body simulator, this approach is assessed in the particular case of particle-mesh cosmological simulations in a frame of reference predicted by a convolutional neural network, where the time dependence is encoded as an additional input parameter to the network. COCA efficiently reduces emulation errors in particle trajectories, requiring far fewer force evaluations than running the corresponding simulation without ML. We obtain accurate final density and velocity fields for a reduced computational budget. We demonstrate that this method shows robustness when applied to examples outside the range of the training data. When compared to the direct emulation of the Lagrangian displacement field using the same training resources, COCA's ability to correct emulation errors results in more accurate predictions. COCA makes $N$-body simulations cheaper by skipping unnecessary force evaluations, while still solving the correct equations of motion and correcting for emulation errors made by ML.</description>

      <title>Recommended receiver papers for ALMA users</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Atacama Large Millimetre/submillimetre Array (ALMA) receivers and technical papers are cited fewer than once in every six publications. This citation shortage is impeding the development of future (sub)millimetre instruments. In an effort to facilitate the correct citations of ALMA receivers and technical papers, this memo provides a comprehensive list of papers for the scientific community. This list was produced in discussion with the scientific and instrumentalist community, based on a June 2024 survey at the European Southern Observatory workshop on the ALMA Wideband Sensitivity Upgrade, as well as with the ALMA technical staff. We now encourage the community to enhance their already-excellent ALMA science with the appropriate references to ensure future (sub)millimetre instrumentation can keep addressing the key questions about our Universe.</description>

      <title>An efficient observational strategy for the detection of the Oort cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Oort cloud is presumably a pristine relic of the Solar System formation. Detection of the Oort cloud may provide information regarding the stellar environment in which the Sun was born and on the planetesimal population during the outer planets' formation phase. The best suggested approach for detecting Oort cloud objects in situ, is by searching for sub-second occultations of distant stars by these objects. Following Brown &amp; Webster, we discuss the possibility of detecting Oort cloud objects by observing near the quadrature direction. Due to the Earth's projected velocity, the occultations are longer near the quadrature direction and are therefore easier to detect, but have lower rate. We show that, for &lt;1-m size telescopes, the increased exposure time will result in about one to three orders of magnitude increase in the number of detectable stars that have an angular size smaller than the Fresnel scale and are therefore suitable for an occultation search. We discuss the ability of this method to detect Oort cloud objects using existing survey telescopes, and we estimate the detection rate as a function of the power-law index of the size distribution of the Oort cloud objects and their distance from the Sun. We show that occultations detected using ~1-s integration by &lt;1-m telescopes at the optimal region near the quadrature points will be marginally dominated by Oort cloud objects rather than Kuiper belt objects.</description>

      <title>CCAT: Nonlinear effects in 280 GHz aluminum kinetic inductance detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prime-Cam, a first-generation science instrument for the Atacama-based Fred Young Submillimeter Telescope, is being built by the CCAT Collaboration to observe at millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths using kinetic inductance detectors (KIDs). Prime-Cam's 280 GHz instrument module will deploy with two aluminum-based KID arrays and one titanium nitride-based KID array, totaling approximately 10,000 detectors at the focal plane, all of which have been fabricated and are currently undergoing testing. One complication of fielding large arrays of KIDs under dynamic loading conditions is tuning the detector tone powers to maximize signal-to-noise while avoiding bifurcation due to the nonlinear kinetic inductance. For aluminum-based KIDs, this is further complicated by additional nonlinear effects which couple tone power to resonator quality factors and resonant frequencies. While both nonequilibrium quasiparticle dynamics and two-level system fluctuations have been shown to give rise to qualitatively similar distortions, modeling these effects alongside nonlinear kinetic inductance is inefficient when fitting thousands of resonators on-sky with existing models. For this reason, it is necessary to have a detailed understanding of the nonlinear effects across relevant detector loading conditions, including how they impact on on-sky noise and how to diagnose the detector's relative performance. We present a study of the competing nonlinearities seen in Prime-Cam's 280 GHz aluminum KIDs, with a particular emphasis on the resulting distortions to the resonator line shape and how these impact detector parameter estimation.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Fortran Codes: A Method for Integrating Coarray Fortran with CUDA Fortran and OpenMP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fortran's prominence in scientific computing requires strategies to ensure both that legacy codes are efficient on high-performance computing systems, and that the language remains attractive for the development of new high-performance codes. Coarray Fortran (CAF), part of the Fortran 2008 standard introduced for parallel programming, facilitates distributed memory parallelism with a syntax familiar to Fortran programmers, simplifying the transition from single-processor to multi-processor coding. This research focuses on innovating and refining a parallel programming methodology that fuses the strengths of Intel Coarray Fortran, Nvidia CUDA Fortran, and OpenMP for distributed memory parallelism, high-speed GPU acceleration and shared memory parallelism respectively. We consider the management of pageable and pinned memory, CPU-GPU affinity in NUMA multiprocessors, and robust compiler interfacing with speed optimisation. We demonstrate our method through its application to a parallelised Poisson solver and compare the methodology, implementation, and scaling performance to that of the Message Passing Interface (MPI), finding CAF offers similar speeds with easier implementation. For new codes, this approach offers a faster route to optimised parallel computing. For legacy codes, it eases the transition to parallel computing, allowing their transformation into scalable, high-performance computing applications without the need for extensive re-design or additional syntax.</description>

      <title>Development of the 220/270 GHz Receiver of BICEP Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measurements of B-mode polarization in the CMB sourced from primordial gravitational waves would provide information on the energy scale of inflation and its potential form. To achieve these goals, one must carefully characterize the Galactic foregrounds, which can be distinguished from the CMB by conducting measurements at multiple frequencies. BICEP Array is the latest-generation multi-frequency instrument of the BICEP/Keck program, which specifically targets degree-scale primordial B-modes in the CMB. In its final configuration, this telescope will consist of four small-aperture receivers, spanning frequency bands from 30 to 270 GHz. The 220/270 GHz receiver designed to characterize Galactic dust is currently undergoing commissioning at Stanford University and is scheduled to deploy to the South Pole during the 2024--2025 austral summer. Here, we will provide an overview of this high-frequency receiver and discuss the integration status and test results as it is being commissioned.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray diffraction gratings play an essential role in high-resolution spectroscopy of astrophysical phenomena. We present some scientific highlights from the X-ray grating spectrometers (XGS) on board of the Chandra and XMM/Newton missions, XGS optical design, and the basic physics of grating diffraction geometry and efficiency. We review design, fabrication, and performance of the currently orbiting transmission and reflection grating elements, followed by descriptions of the state-of-the art of more advanced grating technologies that promise orders-of-magnitude improvements in XGS performance, especially in combination with advanced X-ray telescope mirrors. A few key science questions that require new grating technology are posed, and powerful future mission concepts and recent and approved missions are presented.</description>

      <title>NEW-MUSIC: The Next-generation Extended-Wavelength Multiband Sub/millimeter Inductance Camera</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Next-generation Extended Wavelength-MUltiband Sub/millimeter Inductance Camera (NEW-MUSIC) on the Leighton Chajnantor Telescope (LCT) will be a first-of-its-kind, six-band, transmillimeter-wave ("trans-mm") polarimeter covering 2.4 octaves of spectral bandwidth to open a new window on the trans-mm time-domain frontier, in particular new frontiers in energy, density, time, and magnetic field. NEW-MUSIC's broad spectral coverage will also enable the use of the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effects to study accretion, feedback, and dust content in the hot gaseous haloes of galaxies and galaxy clusters. Six-band spectral energy distributions, with polarization information, will yield new insights into stellar and planetary nurseries. NEW-MUSIC will employ hierarchical, phased arrays of polarization-sensitive superconducting slot-dipole antennas, coupled to photolithographic bandpass filters, to nearly optimally populate LCT's 14' field-of-view with six spectral bands over 80-420 GHz (1:5.25 spectral dynamic range; 2.4 octaves). Light will be routed to Al or AlMn microstripline-coupled, parallel-plate capacitor, lumped-element kinetic inductance detectors (MS-PPC-LEKIDs), an entirely new KID architecture that substantially enhances design flexibility while providing background-limited performance. Innovative, wide-bandwidth, etched silicon structures will be used to antireflection-treat the back-illuminated focal plane. NEW-MUSIC will cost-effectively reuse much of the MUSIC instrument, initially deploying a quarter-scale focal plane capable of the bulk of NEW-MUSIC science followed later by a full-FoV focal plane needed for NEW-MUSIC wide-area survey science.</description>

      <title>Rapid Automatic Multiple Moving Objects Detection Method Based on Feature Extraction from Images with Non-sidereal Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optically observing and monitoring moving objects, both natural and artificial, is important to human space security. Non-sidereal tracking can improve the system's limiting magnitude for moving objects, which benefits the surveillance. However, images with non-sidereal tracking include complex background, as well as objects with different brightness and moving mode, posing a significant challenge for accurate multi-object detection in such images, especially in wide field of view (WFOV) telescope images. To achieve a higher detection precision in a higher speed, we proposed a novel object detection method, which combines the source feature extraction and the neural network. First, our method extracts object features from optical images such as centroid, shape, and flux. Then it conducts a naive labeling based on those features to distinguish moving objects from stars. After balancing the labeled data, we employ it to train a neural network aimed at creating a classification model for point-like and streak-like objects. Ultimately, based on the neural network model's classification outcomes, moving objects whose motion modes consistent with the tracked objects are detected via track association, while objects with different motion modes are detected using morphological statistics. The validation, based on the space objects images captured in target tracking mode with the 1-meter telescope at Nanshan, Xinjiang Astronomical Observatory, demonstrates that our method achieves 94.72% detection accuracy with merely 5.02% false alarm rate, and a processing time of 0.66s per frame. Consequently, our method can rapidly and accurately detect objects with different motion modes from wide-field images with non-sidereal tracking.</description>

      <title>A background-estimation technique for the detection of extended gamma-ray structures with IACTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimation of the amount of cosmic-ray induced background events is a challenging task for Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs). Most approaches rely on a model of the background signal derived from archival observations, which is then normalised to the region of interest (ROI) and respective observation conditions using emission-free regions in the observation.This is, however, disadvantageous for the analysis of large, extended $\gamma$-ray structures, where no sufficient source free region can be found. We aim to address this issue by estimating the normalisation of a 3-dimensional background model template from separate, matched observations of emission-free sky regions. As a result, the need for a emission-free region in the field of view of the observation becomes unnecessary. For this purpose, we implement an algorithm to identify observation pairs with as close as possible observation conditions. The open-source analysis package Gammapy is utilized for estimating the background rate, facilitating seamless adaptation of the framework to many $\gamma$-ray detection facilities. Public data from the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) is employed to validate this methodology. The analysis demonstrates that employing a background rate estimated through this run-matching approach yields results consistent with those obtained using the standard application of the background model template. Furthermore, the compatibility of the source parameters obtained through this approach with previous publications and an analysis employing the background model template approach is confirmed, along with an estimation of the statistical and systematic uncertainties introduced by this method.</description>

      <title>Accurate calibration spectra for precision radial velocities -- Iodine absorption referenced by a laser frequency comb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Astronomical spectrographs require frequency calibration through sources like hollow-cathode lamps or absorption-gas cells. Laser frequency combs (LFCs) provide highest accuracy but are facing operational challenges. We aim to provide a precise and accurate frequency solution for the spectrum of molecular iodine absorption by referencing to an LFC that does not cover the same frequency range. We used a Fourier Transform Spectrometer (FTS) to produce a consistent frequency scale for the combined spectrum from an iodine absorption cell at 5200--6200\AA and an LFC at 8200\AA. We used 17,807 comb lines to determine the FTS frequency offset and compared the calibrated iodine spectrum to a synthetic spectrum computed from a molecular potential model. In a single scan, the frequency offset was determined from the comb spectrum with an uncertainty of $\sim$1 cm s$^{-1}$. The distribution of comb line frequencies is consistent with no deviation from linearity. The iodine observation matches the model with an offset of smaller than the model uncertainties of $\sim$1 m s$^{-1}$, which confirms that the FTS zero point is valid outside the range covered by the LFC, and that the frequencies of the iodine absorption model are accurate. We also report small systematic effects regarding the iodine model's energy scale. We conclude that Fourier Transform Spectrometry can transfer LFC accuracy into frequency ranges not originally covered by the comb. This allows us to assign accurate frequency scales to the spectra of customized wavelength calibrators. The calibrators can be optimized for individual spectrograph designs regarding resolution and spectral bandwidth, and requirements on their long-term stability are relaxed because FTS monitoring can be performed during operation. This provides flexibility for the design and operation of calibration sources for high-precision Doppler experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe the new design and current performance of the Mid-InfraRed Spectrometer and Imager (MIRSI) on the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF). The system has been converted from a liquid nitrogen/liquid helium cryogen system to one that uses a closed-cycle cooler, which allows it to be kept on the telescope at operating temperature and available for observing on short notice, requiring less effort by the telescope operators and day crew to maintain operating temperature. Several other enhancements have been completed, including new detector readout electronics, an IRTF-style standard instrument user interface, new stepper motor driver electronics, and an optical camera that views the same field as the mid-IR instrument using a cold dichroic mirror, allowing for guiding and/or simultaneous optical imaging. The instrument performance is presented, both with an engineering-grade array used from 2021-2023, and a science-grade array installed in the fall of 2023. Some sample astronomical results are also shown. The upgraded MIRSI is a facility instrument at the IRTF available to all users.</description>

      <title>LIGO Detector Characterization in the first half of the fourth Observing run</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Progress in gravitational-wave astronomy depends upon having sensitive detectors with good data quality. Since the end of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA third Observing run in March 2020, detector-characterization efforts have lead to increased sensitivity of the detectors, swifter validation of gravitational-wave candidates and improved tools used for data-quality products. In this article, we discuss these efforts in detail and their impact on our ability to detect and study gravitational-waves. These include the multiple instrumental investigations that led to reduction in transient noise, along with the work to improve software tools used to examine the detectors data-quality. We end with a brief discussion on the role and requirements of detector characterization as the sensitivity of our detectors further improves in the future Observing runs.</description>

      <title>Superfluid-tight cryogenic receiver with continuous sub-Kelvin cooling for EXCLAIM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The EXperiment for Cryogenic Large-Aperture Intensity Mapping (EXCLAIM) is a balloon-borne telescope designed to survey star formation over cosmological time scales using intensity mapping in the 420 - 540 GHz frequency range. EXCLAIM uses a fully cryogenic telescope coupled to six on-chip spectrometers featuring kinetic inductance detectors (KIDs) to achieve high sensitivity, allowing for fast integration in dark atmospheric windows. The telescope receiver is cooled to $\approx$ 1.7 K by immersion in a superfluid helium bath and enclosed in a superfluid-tight shell with a meta-material anti-reflection coated silicon window. In addition to the optics and the spectrometer package, the receiver contains the magnetic shielding, the cryogenic segment of the spectrometer readout, and the sub-Kelvin cooling system. A three-stage continuous adiabatic demagnetization refrigerator (CADR) keeps the detectors at 100 mK while a $^4$He sorption cooler provides a 900 mK thermal intercept for mechanical suspensions and coaxial cables. We present the design of the EXCLAIM receiver and report on the flight-like testing of major receiver components, including the superfluid-tight receiver window and the sub-Kelvin coolers.</description>

      <title>Radio signatures of cosmic-ray showers with deep in-ice antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To detect ultra-high-energy neutrinos, experiments such as ARA and RNO-G target the radio emission these particles induce when cascading in the ice, using deep antennas in South Pole or in Greenland. One of the main backgrounds for such signals is the radio emission generated by cosmic-ray showers, either directly in the ice, or in the air and transmitted to the ice, which can both reach the deep antennas. The first detection of cosmic rays with deep antennas would thus validate this detection principle and allow us to calibrate the detectors. FAERIE, the Framework for the simulation of Air shower Emission of Radio for in-Ice Experiments, is a numerical tool that couples both CoREAS and GEANT4 Monte-Carlo codes to simulate the radio emission from cosmic-ray showers deep in the ice. Using this code, we will investigate cosmic-ray radio signatures and the possible implications on the design of a cosmic-ray veto.</description>

      <title>GRANDProto300: status, science case, and prospects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: GRANDProto300, the mid-scale prototype of the GRAND experiment, is a planned radio array of 300 antennas over $200\, \rm km^{2}$ that will be deployed in the radio-quiet location of Xiao Dushan (China) by $\sim 2026$. The array will act as a test bench for the GRAND experiment and aim to achieve autonomous radio-detection and reconstructions of very inclined air showers in a large-scale array. GRANDProto300 will detect ultra-high-energy cosmic rays in the energy range $10^{16.5}-10^{18}\, \rm eV$ at a rate comparable to Auger. GRANDProto300 could also contain a ground particle array that would validate the performances of the radio detectors. We discuss the current status of the detector commissioning and the rich science case made possible by GRANDProto300, which covers the study of the Galactic-to-extragalactic transition, fast radio bursts and ultra-high-energy gamma-rays.</description>

      <title>Site Selection for the Second Flyeye Telescope: A Simulation Study for Optimizing Near-Earth Object Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The European Space Agency (ESA) is developing a network of wide-field survey telescopes, named Flyeye, to improve the discovery of Near-Earth Objects (NEOs). The first telescope in the network will be located in the Northern Hemisphere on Mount Mufara (Italy), and a second Flyeye telescope, featuring increased detection capabilities, has just started the critical design phase. The potential location for the second Flyeye telescope is investigated by performing simulations of NEOs on impacting trajectories. Approximately 3000 impacting asteroids of two absolute magnitudes (H=25 and H=28) were propagated and tested for detectability by major existing surveys (Catalina, Pan-STARRS, ATLAS), the upcoming Vera Rubin Observatory (LSST), and possible Flyeye locations. Chile, South Africa, and a second facility in the Northern Hemisphere were considered. For each observatory, their past or planned pointing strategies were taken into account in the simulation. Before LSST deployment, a single Flyeye in the Southern Hemisphere performs similarly to a telescope in the Northern Hemisphere. When combined, having one telescope in the north and one in the south maximizes detections and number of unique objects detected. After LSST, southern and northern Flyeye telescopes remain complementary. Overall, simulations show that a second Flyeye in the south complements a Flyeye telescope in the north both before and after LSST. A Flyeye located at La Silla would take advantage of the excellent atmospheric conditions, while allowing a balance of assets across hemispheres.</description>

      <title>An SNSPD-based detector system for NASA's Deep Space Optical Communications project</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on a free-space-coupled superconducting nanowire single-photon detector array developed for NASA's Deep Space Optical Communications project (DSOC). The array serves as the downlink detector for DSOC's primary ground receiver terminal located at Palomar Observatory's 200-inch Hale Telescope. The 64-pixel WSi array comprises four quadrants of 16 co-wound pixels covering a 320 micron diameter active area and embedded in an optical stack. The detector system also includes cryogenic optics for filtering and focusing the downlink signal and electronics for biasing the array and amplifying the output pulses. The detector system exhibits a peak system detection efficiency of 76% at 1550 nm, a background-limited false count rate as low as 3.7 kcps across the array, timing jitter less than 120 ps FWHM, and a maximum count rate of ~ 1 Gcps.</description>

      <title>Modular pipeline for small bodies gravity field modeling: an efficient representation of variable density spherical harmonics coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Proximity operations to small bodies, such as asteroids and comets, demand high levels of autonomy to achieve cost-effective, safe, and reliable Guidance, Navigation and Control (GNC) solutions. Enabling autonomous GNC capabilities in the vicinity of these targets is thus vital for future space applications. However, the highly non-linear and uncertain environment characterizing their vicinity poses unique challenges that need to be assessed to grant robustness against unknown shapes and gravity fields. In this paper, a pipeline designed to generate variable density gravity field models is proposed, allowing the generation of a coherent set of scenarios that can be used for design, validation, and testing of GNC algorithms. The proposed approach consists in processing a polyhedral shape model of the body with a given density distribution to compute the coefficients of the spherical harmonics expansion associated with the gravity field. To validate the approach, several comparison are conducted against analytical solutions, literature results, and higher fidelity models, across a diverse set of targets with varying morphological and physical properties. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the methodology, showing good performances in terms of modeling accuracy and computational efficiency. This research presents a faster and more robust framework for generating environmental models to be used in simulation and hardware-in-the-loop testing of onboard GNC algorithms.</description>

      <title>RISTRETTO: reflected-light exoplanet spectroscopy at the diffraction limit of the VLT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: RISTRETTO is a visible high-resolution spectrograph fed by an extreme adaptive optics (AO) system, to be proposed as a visitor instrument on ESO VLT. The main science goal of RISTRETTO is to pioneer the detection and atmospheric characterisation of exoplanets in reflected light, in particular the temperate rocky planet Proxima b. RISTRETTO will be able to measure albedos and detect atmospheric features in a number of exoplanets orbiting nearby stars for the first time. It will do so by combining a high-contrast AO system working at the diffraction limit of the telescope to a high-resolution spectrograph, via a 7-spaxel integral-field unit (IFU) feeding single-mode fibers. Further science cases for RISTRETTO include the study of accreting protoplanets such as PDS70b/c through spectrally-resolved H-alpha emission, and spatially-resolved studies of Solar System objects such as icy moons and the ice giants Uranus and Neptune. The project is in the manufacturing phase for the spectrograph sub-system, and the preliminary design phase for the AO front-end. Specific developments for RISTRETTO include a novel coronagraphic IFU combining a phase-induced amplitude apodizer (PIAA) to a 3D-printed microlens array feeding a bundle of single-mode fibers. It also features an XAO system with a dual wavefront sensor aiming at high robustness and sensitivity, including to pupil fragmentation. RISTRETTO is a pathfinder instrument in view of similar developments at the ELT, in particular the SCAO-IFU mode of ELT-ANDES and the future ELT-PCS instrument.</description>

      <title>21cm Epoch of Reionisation Power Spectrum with Closure Phase using the Murchison Widefield Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The radio interferometric closure phases can be a valuable tool for studying cosmological {H\scriptsize{I}}~from the early Universe. Closure phases have the advantage of being immune to element-based gains and associated calibration errors. Thus, calibration and errors therein, which are often sources of systematics limiting standard visibility-based approaches, can be avoided altogether in closure phase analysis. In this work, we present the first results of the closure phase power spectrum of {H\scriptsize{I}}~21-cm fluctuations using the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA), with $\sim 12$ hours of MWA-phase II observations centered around redshift, $z\approx 6.79$, during the Epoch of Reionisation. On analysing three redundant classes of baselines -- 14~m, 24~m, and 28~m equilateral triads, our estimates of the $2\sigma$ ($95\%$ confidence interval) 21-cm power spectra are $\lesssim (184)^2 pseudo \rm ~mK^2$ at ${k}_{||} = 0.36 $ $pseudo~h {\rm Mpc^{-1}}$ in the EoR1 field for the 14~m baseline triads, and $\lesssim (188)^2 pseudo \rm ~mK^2$ at $k_{||} = 0.18 $ $pseudo~h {\rm Mpc^{-1}}$ in the EoR0 field for the 24~m baseline triads. The ``$pseudo$'' units denote that the length scale and brightness temperature should be interpreted as close approximations. Our best estimates are still 3-4 orders high compared to the fiducial 21-cm power spectrum; however, our approach provides promising estimates of the power spectra even with a small amount of data. These data-limited estimates can be further improved if more datasets are included into the analysis. The evidence for excess noise has a possible origin in baseline-dependent systematics in the MWA data that will require careful baseline-based strategies to mitigate, even in standard visibility-based approaches.</description>

      <title>Estimate of force noise from electrostatic patch potentials in LISA Pathfinder</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08340v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper discusses force noise in LISA and LISA Pathfinder arising from the interaction of patch potentials on the test mass and surrounding electrode housing surfaces with their own temporal fluctuations. We aim to estimate the contribution of this phenomenon to the force noise detected in LISA Pathfinder in excess of the background from Brownian motion. We introduce a model of that approximates the interacting test mass and housing surfaces as concentric spheres, treating patch potentials as isotropic stochastic Gaussian processes on the surface of these spheres. We find that a scenario of patches due to surface contamination, with diffusion driven density fluctuations, could indeed produce force noise with the observed frequency $f^{-2}$ dependence. However there is not enough experimental evidence, neither from LISA Pathfinder itself, nor from other experiments, to predict the amplitude of such a noise, which could range from completely negligible to explaining the entire noise excess. We briefly discuss several measures to ensure that this noise is sufficiently small in LISA .</description>

      <title>In-depth analysis of LISA Pathfinder performance results: Time evolution, noise projection, physical models, and implications for LISA</title>

Abstract: We present an in-depth analysis of the LISA Pathfinder differential acceleration performance over the entire course of its science operations, spanning approximately 500 days. We find that: 1) the evolution of the Brownian noise that dominates the acceleration amplitude spectral density (ASD), for frequencies $f\gtrsim 1\,\text{mHz}$, is consistent with the decaying pressure due to the outgassing of a single gaseous species. 2) between $f=36\,\mu\text{Hz}$ and $1\,\text{mHz}$, the acceleration ASD shows a $1/f$ tail in excess of the Brownian noise of almost constant amplitude, with $\simeq 20\%$ fluctuations over a period of a few days, with no particular time pattern over the course of the mission; 3) at the lowest considered frequency of $f=18\,\mu\text{Hz}$, the ASD significantly deviates from the $1/f$ behavior, because of temperature fluctuations that appear to modulate a quasi-static pressure gradient, sustained by the asymmetries of the outgassing pattern. We also present the results of a projection of the observed acceleration noise on the potential sources for which we had either a direct correlation measurement, or a quantitative estimate from dedicated experiments. These sources account for approximately $40\%$ of the noise power in the $1/f$ tail. Finally, we analyze the possible sources of the remaining unexplained fraction, and identify the possible measures that may be taken to keep those under control in LISA.</description>

      <title>GausSN: Bayesian Time-Delay Estimation for Strongly Lensed Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17997v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present GausSN, a Bayesian semi-parametric Gaussian Process (GP) model for time-delay estimation with resolved systems of gravitationally lensed supernovae (glSNe). GausSN models the underlying light curve non-parametrically using a GP. Without assuming a template light curve for each SN type, GausSN fits for the time delays of all images using data in any number of wavelength filters simultaneously. We also introduce a novel time-varying magnification model to capture the effects of microlensing alongside time-delay estimation. In this analysis, we model the time-varying relative magnification as a sigmoid function, as well as a constant for comparison to existing time-delay estimation approaches. We demonstrate that GausSN provides robust time-delay estimates for simulations of glSNe from the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope and the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (Rubin-LSST). We find that up to 43.6% of time-delay estimates from Roman and 52.9% from Rubin-LSST have fractional errors of less than 5%. We then apply GausSN to SN Refsdal and find the time delay for the fifth image is consistent with the original analysis, regardless of microlensing treatment. Therefore, GausSN maintains the level of precision and accuracy achieved by existing time-delay extraction methods with fewer assumptions about the underlying shape of the light curve than template-based approaches, while incorporating microlensing into the statistical error budget. GausSN is scalable for time-delay cosmography analyses given current projections of glSNe discovery rates from Rubin-LSST and Roman.</description>

      <title>A Coordinate-Independent Formalism for Detecting High-Frequency Gravitational Waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08572v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In an external electric or magnetic field, a gravitational wave (GW) may be converted into electromagnetic radiation. We present a coordinate-invariant framework to describe the GW signal in a detector that is based on this effect, such as cavities for axion searches. In this framework, we pay special attention to the definition of manifestly coordinate-independent expressions for the electromagnetic fields that an external observer would detect. A careful assessment of the detector's perceived motion allows us to treat both its mechanical and its electromagnetic response to the GW consistently. We further introduce well-defined approximations for which this motion may be neglected, and hence provide suggestions on which coordinate frame is suitable to characterise the GW signal in practice. We illustrate our findings in two examples, an infinitesimally thin rod and a spherical electromagnetic cavity.</description>

      <title>Separating States in Astronomical Sources Using Hidden Markov Models: With a Case Study of Flaring and Quiescence on EV Lac</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06540v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new method to distinguish between different states (e.g., high and low, quiescent and flaring) in astronomical sources with count data. The method models the underlying physical process as latent variables following a continuous-space Markov chain that determines the expected Poisson counts in observed light curves in multiple passbands. For the underlying state process, we consider several autoregressive processes, yielding continuous-space hidden Markov models of varying complexity. Under these models, we can infer the state that the object is in at any given time. The continuous state predictions from these models are then dichotomized with the help of a finite mixture model to produce state classifications. We apply these techniques to X-ray data from the active dMe flare star EV Lac, splitting the data into quiescent and flaring states. We find that a first-order vector autoregressive process efficiently separates flaring from quiescence: flaring occurs over 30-40% of the observation durations, a well-defined persistent quiescent state can be identified, and the flaring state is characterized by higher plasma temperatures and emission measures.</description>

      <title>RIGEL: Simulating dwarf galaxies at solar mass resolution with radiative transfer and feedback from individual massive stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08869v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the RIGEL model, a novel framework to self-consistently model the effects of stellar feedback in the multiphase ISM of dwarf galaxies with radiative transfer (RT) on a star-by-star basis. The RIGEL model integrates detailed implementations of feedback from individual massive stars into the RHD code, AREPO-RT. It forms individual massive stars from the resolved multiphase ISM by sampling the IMF and tracks their evolution individually. The lifetimes, photon production rates, mass-loss rates, and wind velocities of these stars are determined by their initial masses and metallicities based on a library that incorporates a variety of stellar models. The RT equations are solved in seven spectral bins accounting for the IR to HeII ionizing bands, using an M1 RT scheme. The thermochemistry model tracks the non-equilibrium H, He chemistry and the equilibrium abundance of CI, CII, OI, OII, and CO to capture the thermodynamics of all ISM phases. We evaluated the performance of the RIGEL model using $1\,{\rm M}_\odot$ resolution simulations of isolated dwarf galaxies. We found that the SFR and ISRF show strong positive correlations to the metallicity of the galaxy. Photoionization and photoheating can reduce the SFR by an order of magnitude by removing the available cold-dense gas fuel for star formation. The ISRF also changes the thermal structure of the ISM. Radiative feedback occurs immediately after the birth of massive stars and rapidly disperses the molecular clouds within 1 Myr. As a consequence, radiative feedback reduces the age spread of star clusters to less than 2 Myr, prohibits the formation of massive star clusters, and shapes the cluster initial mass function to a steep power-law form with a slope of $\sim-2$. The mass-loading factor of the fiducial galaxy has a median of $\sim50$, while turning off radiative feedback reduces this factor by an order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>The future of cosmological likelihood-based inference: accelerated high-dimensional parameter estimation and model comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12965v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We advocate for a new paradigm of cosmological likelihood-based inference, leveraging recent developments in machine learning and its underlying technology, to accelerate Bayesian inference in high-dimensional settings. Specifically, we combine (i) emulation, where a machine learning model is trained to mimic cosmological observables, e.g. CosmoPower-JAX; (ii) differentiable and probabilistic programming, e.g. JAX and NumPyro, respectively; (iii) scalable Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling techniques that exploit gradients, e.g. Hamiltonian Monte Carlo; and (iv) decoupled and scalable Bayesian model selection techniques that compute the Bayesian evidence purely from posterior samples, e.g. the learned harmonic mean implemented in harmonic. This paradigm allows us to carry out a complete Bayesian analysis, including both parameter estimation and model selection, in a fraction of the time of traditional approaches. First, we demonstrate the application of this paradigm on a simulated cosmic shear analysis for a Stage IV survey in 37- and 39-dimensional parameter spaces, comparing $\Lambda$CDM and a dynamical dark energy model ($w_0w_a$CDM). We recover posterior contours and evidence estimates that are in excellent agreement with those computed by the traditional nested sampling approach while reducing the computational cost from 8 months on 48 CPU cores to 2 days on 12 GPUs. Second, we consider a joint analysis between three simulated next-generation surveys, each performing a 3x2pt analysis, resulting in 157- and 159-dimensional parameter spaces. Standard nested sampling techniques are simply unlikely to be feasible in this high-dimensional setting, requiring a projected 12 years of compute time on 48 CPU cores; on the other hand, the proposed approach only requires 8 days of compute time on 24 GPUs. All packages used in our analyses are publicly available.</description>

      <title>pop-cosmos: Scaleable inference of galaxy properties and redshifts with a data-driven population model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19437v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an efficient Bayesian method for estimating individual photometric redshifts and galaxy properties under a pre-trained population model (pop-cosmos) that was calibrated using purely photometric data. This model specifies a prior distribution over 16 stellar population synthesis (SPS) parameters using a score-based diffusion model, and includes a data model with detailed treatment of nebular emission. We use a GPU-accelerated affine invariant ensemble sampler to achieve fast posterior sampling under this model for 292,300 individual galaxies in the COSMOS2020 catalog, leveraging a neural network emulator (Speculator) to speed up the SPS calculations. We apply both the pop-cosmos population model and a baseline prior inspired by Prospector-$\alpha$, and compare these results to published COSMOS2020 redshift estimates from the widely-used EAZY and LePhare codes. For the $\sim 12,000$ galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts, we find that pop-cosmos yields redshift estimates that have minimal bias ($\sim10^{-4}$), high accuracy ($\sigma_\text{MAD}=7\times10^{-3}$), and a low outlier rate ($1.6\%$). We show that the pop-cosmos population model generalizes well to galaxies fainter than its $r&lt;25$ mag training set. The sample we have analyzed is $\gtrsim3\times$ larger than has previously been possible via posterior sampling with a full SPS model, with average throughput of 15 GPU-sec per galaxy under the pop-cosmos prior, and 0.6 GPU-sec per galaxy under the Prospector prior. This paves the way for principled modeling of the huge catalogs expected from upcoming Stage IV galaxy surveys.</description>
