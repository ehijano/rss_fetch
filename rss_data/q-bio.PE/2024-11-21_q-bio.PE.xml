      <title>Computational and Experimental Exploration of Protein Fitness Landscapes: Navigating Smooth and Rugged Terrains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proteins evolve through complex sequence spaces, with fitness landscapes serving as a conceptual framework that links sequence to function. Fitness landscapes can be smooth, where multiple similarly accessible evolutionary paths are available, or rugged, where the presence of multiple local fitness optima complicate evolution and prediction. Indeed, many proteins, especially those with complex functions or under multiple selection pressures, exist on rugged fitness landscapes. Here we discuss the theoretical framework that underpins our understanding of fitness landscapes, alongside recent work that has advanced our understanding - particularly the biophysical basis for smoothness versus ruggedness. Finally, we address the rapid advances that have been made in computational and experimental exploration and exploitation of fitness landscapes, and how these can identify efficient routes to protein optimization.</description>

      <title>Conditional gene genealogies given the population pedigree for a diploid Moran model with selfing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a stochastic model of a population with overlapping generations and arbitrary levels of self-fertilization versus outcrossing. We study how the global graph of reproductive relationships, or pedigree, influences the genealogical relationships of a sample of two gene copies at a genetic locus. Specifically, we consider a diploid Moran model with constant population size $N$ over time, in which a proportion of offspring are produced by selfing. We show that the conditional distribution of the pairwise coalescence time at a single locus given the random pedigree converges to a limit law as $N$ tends to infinity. This limit law generally differs from the corresponding traditional result obtained by averaging over all possible pedigrees. We describe three different behaviors in the limit depending on the relative strengths, from large to small, of selfing versus outcrossing: partial selfing, limited outcrossing, and negligible outcrossing. In the case of partial selfing, coalescence times are related to the Kingman coalescent, similar to what is found in traditional analyses. In the the case of limited outcrossing, the retained pedigree information forms a random graph coming from a fragmentation-coagulation process, with the limiting coalescence times given by the meeting times of random walks on this graph. In the case of negligible outcrossing, which represents complete or nearly complete selfing, coalescence times are determined entirely by the fixed times to common ancestry of diploid individuals in the pedigree.</description>

      <title>The impact of recovery rate heterogeneity in achieving herd immunity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Herd immunity is a critical concept in epidemiology, describing a threshold at which a sufficient proportion of a population is immune, either through infection or vaccination, thereby preventing sustained transmission of a pathogen. In the classic Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model, which has been widely used to study infectious disease dynamics, the achievement of herd immunity depends on key parameters, including the transmission rate ($\beta$) and the recovery rate ($\gamma$), where $\gamma$ represents the inverse of the mean infectious period. While the transmission rate has received substantial attention, recent studies have underscored the significant role of $\gamma$ in determining the timing and sustainability of herd immunity. Additionally, it is becoming increasingly evident that assuming $\gamma$ as a constant parameter might oversimplify the dynamics, as variations in recovery times can reflect diverse biological, social, and healthcare-related factors.
  In this paper, we investigate how heterogeneity in the recovery rate affects herd immunity. We show empirically that the mean of the recovery rate is not a reliable metric for determining the achievement of herd immunity. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical result demonstrating that it is instead the mean recovery time, which is the mean of the inverse $1/\gamma$ of the recovery rate that is critical in deciding whether herd immunity is achievable within the SIR framework. A similar result is proved for the SEIR model. These insights have significant implications for public health interventions and theoretical modeling of epidemic dynamics.</description>

      <title>A general relationship between population size and extinction risk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the relationship between a population's probability of extinction and its carrying capacity is key in assessing conservation status, and critical to efforts to understand and mitigate the ongoing biodiversity crisis. Despite this, there has been limited research into the form of this relationshop. We conducted around five billion population viability assessments which reveal that the relationship is a modified Gompertz curve. This finding is consistent across around 1700 individual model populations, which between them span different breeding systems and widely varying rates of population growth, levels of environmental stochasticity, adult survival rate, age at first breeding and starting population size. Applying analytical methods to equations describing population dynamics showed that minimal assumptions were required to prove this is a general relationship whichholds for any extant population subject to density dependant growth. Finally, we discuss the implications of these finds and consider the practical use of our results by conservationists.</description>

      <title>Bounds on the Treewidth of Level-k Rooted Phylogenetic Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phylogenetic networks are directed acyclic graphs that depict the genomic evolution of related taxa. Reticulation nodes in such networks (nodes with more than one parent) represent reticulate evolutionary events, such as recombination, reassortment, hybridization, or horizontal gene transfer. Typically, the complexity of a phylogenetic network is expressed in terms of its level, i.e., the maximum number of edges that are required to be removed from each biconnected component of the phylogenetic network to turn it into a tree. Here, we study the relationship between the level of a phylogenetic network and another popular graph complexity parameter - treewidth. We show a $\frac{k+3}{2}$ upper bound on the treewidth of level-$k$ phylogenetic networks and an improved $(1/3 + \delta) k$ upper bound for large $k$. These bounds imply that many computational problems on phylogenetic networks, such as the small parsimony problem or some variants of phylogenetic diversity maximization, are polynomial-time solvable on level-$k$ networks with constant $k$. Our first bound is applicable to any $k$, and it allows us to construct an explicit tree decomposition of width $\frac{k+3}{2}$ that can be used to analyze phylogenetic networks generated by tools like SNAQ that guarantee bounded network level. Finally, we show a $k/13$ lower bound on the maximum treewidth among level-$k$ phylogenetic networks for large enough $k$ based on expander graphs.</description>

      <title>The epidemiological footprint of contact structures in models with two levels of mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.05287v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Models with several levels of mixing (households, workplaces), as well as various corresponding formulations for R0, have been proposed in the literature. However, little attention has been paid to the impact of the distribution of the population size within social structures, effect that can help plan effective interventions. We focus on the influence on the model outcomes of teleworking strategies, consisting in reshaping the distribution of workplace sizes. We consider a stochastic SIR model with two levels of mixing, accounting for a uniformly mixing general population, each individual belonging also to a household and a workplace. The variance of the workplace size distribution appears to be a good proxy for the impact of this distribution on key outcomes of the epidemic, such as epidemic size and peak. In particular, our findings suggest that strategies where the proportion of individuals teleworking depends sublinearly on the size of the workplace outperform the strategy with linear dependence. Besides, one drawback of the model with multiple levels of mixing is its complexity, raising interest in a reduced model. We propose a homogeneously mixing SIR ODE-based model, whose infection rate is chosen as to observe the growth rate of the initial model. This reduced model yields a generally satisfying approximation of the epidemic. These results, robust to various changes in model structure, are very promising from the perspective of implementing effective strategies based on social distancing of specific contacts. Furthermore, they contribute to the effort of building relevant approximations of individual based models at intermediate scales.</description>
