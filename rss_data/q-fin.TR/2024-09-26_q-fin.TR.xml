      <title>The Impact of Designated Market Makers on Market Liquidity and Competition: A Simulation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper conducts an empirical investigation into the effects of Designated Market Makers (DMMs) on key market quality indicators, such as liquidity, bid-ask spreads, and order fulfillment ratios. Through agent-based simulations, this study explores the impact of varying competition levels and incentive structures among DMMs on market dynamics. It aims to demonstrate that DMMs are crucial for enhancing market liquidity and stabilizing price spreads, thereby affirming their essential role in promoting market efficiency. Our findings confirm the impact of the number of Designated Market Makers (DMMs) and asset diversity on market liquidity. The result also suggests that an optimal level of competition among DMMs can maximize liquidity benefits while minimizing negative impacts on price discovery. Additionally, the research indicates that the benefits of increased number of DMMs diminish beyond a certain threshold, implying that excessive incentives may not further improve market quality metrics.</description>

      <title>How does liquidity shape the yield curve?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12282v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The phenomenology of the forward rate curve (FRC) can be accurately understood by the fluctuations of a stiff elastic string (Le Coz and Bouchaud, 2024). By relating the exogenous shocks driving such fluctuations to the surprises in the order flows, we elevate the model from purely describing price variations to a microstructural model that incorporates the joint dynamics of prices and order flows, accounting for both impact and cross-impact effects. Remarkably, this framework allows for at least the same explanatory power as existing cross-impact models, while using significantly fewer parameters. In addition, our model generates liquidity-dependent correlations between the forward rate of one tenor and the order flow of another, consistent with recent empirical findings. We show that the model also account for the non-martingale behavior of prices at short timescales.</description>

      <title>Position-building in competition with real-world constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15459v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper extends the optimal-trading framework developed in arXiv:2409.03586v1 to compute optimal strategies with real-world constraints. The aim of the current paper, as with the previous, is to study trading in the context of multi-player non-cooperative games. While the former paper relies on methods from the calculus of variations and optimal strategies arise as the solution of partial differential equations, the current paper demonstrates that the entire framework may be re-framed as a quadratic programming problem and cast in this light constraints are readily incorporated into the calculation of optimal strategies. An added benefit is that two-trader equilibria may be calculated as the end-points of a dynamic process of traders forming repeated adjustments to each other's strategy.</description>
