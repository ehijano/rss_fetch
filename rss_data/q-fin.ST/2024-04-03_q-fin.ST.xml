      <title>Postprocessing of point predictions for probabilistic forecasting of electricity prices: Diversity matters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Operational decisions relying on predictive distributions of electricity prices can result in significantly higher profits compared to those based solely on point forecasts. However, the majority of models developed in both academic and industrial settings provide only point predictions. To address this, we examine three postprocessing methods for converting point forecasts into probabilistic ones: Quantile Regression Averaging, Conformal Prediction, and the recently introduced Isotonic Distributional Regression. We find that while IDR demonstrates the most varied performance, combining its predictive distributions with those of the other two methods results in an improvement of ca. 7.5% compared to a benchmark model with normally distributed errors, over a 4.5-year test period in the German power market spanning the COVID pandemic and the war in Ukraine. Remarkably, the performance of this combination is at par with state-of-the-art Distributional Deep Neural Networks.</description>

      <title>Empowering Credit Scoring Systems with Quantum-Enhanced Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00015v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum Kernels are projected to provide early-stage usefulness for quantum machine learning. However, highly sophisticated classical models are hard to surpass without losing interpretability, particularly when vast datasets can be exploited. Nonetheless, classical models struggle once data is scarce and skewed. Quantum feature spaces are projected to find better links between data features and the target class to be predicted even in such challenging scenarios and most importantly, enhanced generalization capabilities. In this work, we propose a novel approach called Systemic Quantum Score (SQS) and provide preliminary results indicating potential advantage over purely classical models in a production grade use case for the Finance sector. SQS shows in our specific study an increased capacity to extract patterns out of fewer data points as well as improved performance over data-hungry algorithms such as XGBoost, providing advantage in a competitive market as it is the FinTech and Neobank regime.</description>
