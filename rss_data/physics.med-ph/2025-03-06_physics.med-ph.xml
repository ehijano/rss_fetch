      <title>Fragmentation measurements with the FOOT experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Particle Therapy (PT) has emerged as a powerful tool in cancer treatment, leveraging the unique dose distribution of charged particles to deliver high radiation levels to the tumor while minimizing damage to surrounding healthy tissue. Despite its advantages, further improvements in Treatment Planning Systems (TPS) are needed to address uncertainties related to fragmentation process, which can affect both dose deposition and effectiveness. These fragmentation effects also play a critical role in Radiation Protection in Space, where astronauts are exposed to high level of radiation, necessitating precise models for shielding optimization. The FOOT (FragmentatiOn Of Target) experiment addresses these challenges by measuring fragmentation cross-section with high precision, providing essential data for improving TPS for PT and space radiation protection strategies. This thesis contributes to the FOOT experiment in two key areas. First, it focuses on the performances of the vertex detector, which is responsible for reconstructing particle tracks and fragmentation vertexes with high spatial resolution. The study evaluates the detector's reconstruction algorithm and its efficiency to detect particles. Second the thesis present a preliminary calculation of fragmentation cross section, incorporating the vertex detector for the first time in these measurements.</description>

      <title>Computer-aided shape features extraction and regression models for predicting the ascending aortic aneurysm growth rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Objective: ascending aortic aneurysm growth prediction is still challenging in clinics. In this study, we evaluate and compare the ability of local and global shape features to predict ascending aortic aneurysm growth.
  Material and methods: 70 patients with aneurysm, for which two 3D acquisitions were available, are included. Following segmentation, three local shape features are computed: (1) the ratio between maximum diameter and length of the ascending aorta centerline, (2) the ratio between the length of external and internal lines on the ascending aorta and (3) the tortuosity of the ascending tract. By exploiting longitudinal data, the aneurysm growth rate is derived. Using radial basis function mesh morphing, iso-topological surface meshes are created. Statistical shape analysis is performed through unsupervised principal component analysis (PCA) and supervised partial least squares (PLS). Two types of global shape features are identified: three PCA-derived and three PLS-based shape modes. Three regression models are set for growth prediction: two based on gaussian support vector machine using local and PCA-derived global shape features; the third is a PLS linear regression model based on the related global shape features. The prediction results are assessed and the aortic shapes most prone to growth are identified.
  Results: the prediction root mean square error from leave-one-out cross-validation is: 0.112 mm/month, 0.083 mm/month and 0.066 mm/month for local, PCA-based and PLS-derived shape features, respectively. Aneurysms close to the root with a large initial diameter report faster growth.
  Conclusion: global shape features might provide an important contribution for predicting the aneurysm growth.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-Based Diffusion MRI Tractography: Integrating Spatial and Anatomical Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion MRI tractography technique enables non-invasive visualization of the white matter pathways in the brain. It plays a crucial role in neuroscience and clinical fields by facilitating the study of brain connectivity and neurological disorders. However, the accuracy of reconstructed tractograms has been a longstanding challenge. Recently, deep learning methods have been applied to improve tractograms for better white matter coverage, but often comes at the expense of generating excessive false-positive connections. This is largely due to their reliance on local information to predict long range streamlines. To improve the accuracy of streamline propagation predictions, we introduce a novel deep learning framework that integrates image-domain spatial information and anatomical information along tracts, with the former extracted through convolutional layers and the later modeled via a Transformer-decoder. Additionally, we employ a weighted loss function to address fiber class imbalance encountered during training. We evaluate the proposed method on the simulated ISMRM 2015 Tractography Challenge dataset, achieving a valid streamline rate of 66.2%, white matter coverage of 63.8%, and successfully reconstructing 24 out of 25 bundles. Furthermore, on the multi-site Tractoinferno dataset, the proposed method demonstrates its ability to handle various diffusion MRI acquisition schemes, achieving a 5.7% increase in white matter coverage and a 4.1% decrease in overreach compared to RNN-based methods.</description>
