      <title>Microsheaf composition of Lagrangian correspondences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In exact symplectic manifolds whose Liouville flow is gradientlike for a proper Morse function, one can associate conic microsheaves to eventually conic exact Lagrangians. Here we study how this 'microsheaf quantization' interacts with composition of Lagrangian correspondences. In particular: these operations commute when the composition is embedded. As an illustration, we show that Lie groups of exact symplectomorphisms act on microsheaf categories. The key technical advance is a version 'in families' of the gappedness criterion for commuting nearby cycles past tensor or Hom.</description>

      <title>Homogeneous potentials, Lagrange's identity and Poisson geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Lagrange identity expresses the second derivative of the moment of inertia of a system of material points through kinetic energy and homogeneous potential energy, from which follows the Jacobi well-known result on the instability of a system of gravitating bodies. In this work, it is proven that if a Hamiltonian system satisfies the Lagrange identity, then it possesses additional tensor invariants that are not expressed through the basic invariants existing for all Hamiltonian systems. A new class of Hamiltonian systems with inhomogeneous potentials is considered, which also possess similar additional tensor invariants.</description>

      <title>A Presymplectic and Symmetry Reduced Formulation of the Maxwell Vlasov System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a unified geometric formulation of the Maxwell-Vlasov system using the infinite-dimensional Skinner-Rusk (SR) formalism. In this framework, particles and fields are treated simultaneously within a single presymplectic manifold, and the Gotay--Nester--Hinds algorithm recovers the full Maxwell-Vlasov equations as the compatibility conditions of a single variational system. The hierarchy of constraints -- including Vlasov advection, Gauss and Faraday laws, and the electromagnetic gauge structure -- arises naturally from the presymplectic geometry of the SR formalism.
  Reduction by the diffeomorphism group of phase space produces a reduced presymplectic manifold whose dynamics reproduces both the Euler--Poincare formulation for the Vlasov sector and the Marsden--Weinstein/Morrison--Greene Lie--Poisson Hamiltonian structure. We further extend the construction to equilibria that partially break the relabeling symmetry, obtaining a translated SR system that yields an effective symplectic linearization, clarifies the appearance of Goldstone-type neutral modes, and provides a geometric foundation for the energy--Casimir method.
  Finally, we incorporate external antenna fields into this setting by introducing affine Hamiltonian controls and establishing a theory of controlled symmetry breaking within the reduced SR framework. This leads to controlled Lie--Poisson equations for plasma--antenna coupling and a geometric mechanism for stabilization through Casimir shaping and symmetry-selective forcing. The resulting picture provides a single presymplectic structure that unifies Lagrangian, Hamiltonian, gauge, reduction, and control-theoretic aspects of the Maxwell-Vlasov system.</description>

      <title>On the volume functions and the cohomology rings of special weight varieties of type A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.16461v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the cohomology rings of some multiple weight varieties of type A, that is, symplectic torus quotients for a direct product of several coadjoint orbits of the special unitary group. Under some specific assumptions, we prove the symplectic volumes of multiple weight varieties are equal to the volumes of flow polytopes. Using differential equations satisfied by the volume functions of flow polytopes, we give an explicit presentation of the cohomology ring of the multiple weight variety of special type.</description>

      <title>Concave symplectic toric fillings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03912v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As shown by Etnyre and Honda in [EH], every contact 3-manifold admits infinitely many concave symplectic fillings that are mutually not symplectomorphic and not related by blow ups. In this note we refine this result in the toric setting by showing that every contact toric 3-manifold admits infinitely many concave symplectic toric fillings that are mutually not equivariantly symplectomorphic and not related by blow ups. The concave symplectic toric structure is constructed on certain linear and cyclic plumbings over spheres.</description>
