      <title>Newton's algorithm for discrete classical dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recent article in J. Chem. Phys. argues that the two algorithms, the velocity-Verlet, and position-Verlet integrators, commonly used in Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations, are different \cite{Ni2024}. But not only are the two algorithms just different formulations of the same discrete algorithm, but so are other simple discrete algorithms used in MD in the natural sciences. They are all reformulations of the discrete algorithm derived by Newton in 1687 in $\textit{Proposition I}$ in the very first part of his book $Principia$. The different reformulations of Newton's algorithm for discrete dynamics lead to identical discrete dynamics with the same invariances, momentum, angular momentum, and energy as Newton's analytical dynamics. Hundreds of thousands of MD simulations with Newton's discrete dynamics have appeared, but unfortunately with many recorded errors for energies, potential energies, temperatures, and heat capacities. The public software for MD should be corrected.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Cauchy Elasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most theories and applications of elasticity rely on an energy function that depends on the strains from which the stresses can be derived. This is the traditional setting of Green elasticity, also known as hyper-elasticity. However, in its original form the theory of elasticity does not assume the existence of a strain-energy function. In this case, called Cauchy elasticity, stresses are directly related to the strains. Since the emergence of modern elasticity in the 1940s, research on Cauchy elasticity has been relatively limited. One possible reason is that for Cauchy materials, the net work performed by stress along a closed path in the strain space may be nonzero. Therefore, such materials may require access to both energy sources and sinks. This characteristic has led some mechanicians to question the viability of Cauchy elasticity as a physically plausible theory of elasticity. In this paper, motivated by its relevance to recent applications, such as the modeling of active solids, we revisit Cauchy elasticity in a modern form.</description>

      <title>Time-reversed Young's experiment: Deterministic, diffractionless second-order interference effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The classic Young's double-slit experiment exhibits first-order interference, producing alternating bright and dark fringes modulated by the diffraction effect of the slits. In contrast, here we demonstrate that its time-reversed configuration produces an ideal, deterministic second-order 'ghost' interference pattern devoid of diffraction and first-order effect, with the size dependent on the dimensions of the `effectively extended light source.' Furthermore, the new system enables a range of effects and phenomena not available in traditional double-slit interference studies, including the formation of programmed and digitized interference fringes and the coincidence of the pattern plane and the source plane. Despite the absence of first-order interference, our proposed experiment does not rely on nonclassical correlations or quantum entanglement. The elimination of diffraction through time-reversal symmetry holds promise for advancing superresolution optical imaging and sensing techniques beyond existing capabilities.</description>
