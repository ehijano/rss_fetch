      <title>Optimal Motion Planning for Two Square Robots in a Rectilinear Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{W} \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ be a rectilinear polygonal environment (that is, a rectilinear polygon potentially with holes) with a total of $n$ vertices, and let $A,B$ be two robots, each modeled as an axis-aligned unit square, that can move rectilinearly inside $\mathcal{W}$. The goal is to compute a collision-free motion plan $\boldsymbol{\pi}$, that is, a motion plan that continuously moves $A$ from $s_A$ to $t_A$ and $B$ from $s_B$ to $t_B$ so that $A$ and $B$ remain inside $\mathcal{W}$ and do not collide with each other during the motion. We study two variants of this problem which are focused additionally on the optimality of $\boldsymbol{\pi}$, and obtain the following results.
  1. Min-Sum: Here the goal is to compute a motion plan that minimizes the sum of the lengths of the paths of the robots. We present an $O(n^4\log{n})$-time algorithm for computing an optimal solution to the min-sum problem. This is the first polynomial-time algorithm to compute an optimal, collision-free motion of two robots amid obstacles in a planar polygonal environment.
  2. Min-Makespan: Here the robots can move with at most unit speed, and the goal is to compute a motion plan that minimizes the maximum time taken by a robot to reach its target location. We prove that the min-makespan variant is NP-hard.</description>

      <title>Polyhedral design with blended $n$-sided interpolants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new parametric surface representation is proposed that interpolates the vertices of a given closed mesh of arbitrary topology. Smoothly connecting quadrilateral patches are created by blending local, multi-sided quadratic interpolants. In the non-four-sided case, this requires a special parameterization technique involving rational curves. Appropriate handling of triangular subpatches and alternative subpatch representations are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Convex Hull 3D Filtering with GPU Ray Tracing and Tensor Cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, applications such as real-time simulations, autonomous systems, and video games increasingly demand the processing of complex geometric models under stringent time constraints. Traditional geometric algorithms, including the convex hull, are subject to these challenges. A common approach to improve performance is scaling computational resources, which often results in higher energy consumption. Given the growing global concern regarding sustainable use of energy, this becomes a critical limitation. This work presents a 3D preprocessing filter for the convex hull algorithm using ray tracing and tensor core technologies. The filter builds a delimiter polyhedron based on Manhattan distances that discards points from the original set. The filter is evaluated on two point distributions: uniform and sphere. Experimental results show that the proposed filter, combined with convex hull construction, accelerates the computation of the 3D convex hull by up to $200 \times$ with respect to a CPU parallel implementation. This research demonstrates that geometric algorithms can be accelerated through massive parallelism while maintaining efficient energy utilization. Beyond execution time and speedup evaluation, we also analyze GPU energy consumption, showing that the proposed preprocessing filter not only reduces the computational workload but also achieves performance gains with controlled energy usage. These results highlight the dual benefit of the method in terms of both speed and energy efficiency, reinforcing its applicability in modern high-performance scenarios.</description>

      <title>On the Number of Almost Empty Monochromatic Triangles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of counting almost empty monochromatic triangles in colored planar point sets, that is, triangles whose vertices are all assigned the same color and that contain only a few interior points. Specifically, we show that any $c$-coloring of a set of $n$ points in the plane in general position (that is, no three on a line) contains $\Omega(n^2)$ monochromatic triangles with at most $c-1$ interior points and $\Omega(n^{\frac{4}{3}})$ monochromatic triangles with at most $c-2$ interior points, for any fixed $c \geq 2$. The latter, in particular, generalizes the result of Pach and T\'{o}th (2013) on the number of monochromatic empty triangles in 2-colored point sets, to the setting of multiple colors and monochromatic triangles with a few interior points. We also derive the limiting value of the expected number of triangles with $s$ interior points in random point sets, for any integer $s \geq 0$. As a result, we obtain the expected number of monochromatic triangles with at most $s$ interior points in random colorings of random point sets.</description>
