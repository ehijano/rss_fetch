      <title>Wavefunction optimization at the complete basis set limit with Mutliwavelets and DMRG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) is a powerful numerical technique to solve strongly correlated quantum systems: it deals well with systems which are not dominated by a single configuration (unlike Coupled Cluster) and it converges rapidly to the Full Configuration Interaction (FCI) limit (unlike truncated Configuration Interaction (CI) expansions). In this work, we develop an algorithm integrating DMRG within the multiwavelet-based multiresolution analysis (MRA). Unlike fixed basis sets, multiwavelets offer an adaptive and hierarchical representation of functions, approaching the complete basis set limit to a specified precision. As a result, this combined technique leverages the multireference capability of DMRG and the complete basis set limit of MRA and multiwavelets. More specifically, we adopt a pre-existing Lagrangian optimization algorithm for orbitals represented in the MRA domain and improve its computational efficiency by replacing the original CI calculations with DMRG. Additionally, we substitute the reduced density matrices computation with the direct extraction of energy gradients from the DMRG tensors. We apply our method to small systems such H2, He, HeH2, BeH2 and N2. The results demonstrate that our approach reduces the final energy while keeping the number of orbitals low compared to FCI calculations on an atomic orbital basis set.</description>

      <title>Interplay between Static and Dynamic Disorder: Contrasting Effects on Dark State Population inside a Cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong light-matter interactions between molecules and quantized electromagnetic fields inside an optical cavity open up novel possibilities, though inevitably influenced by disorder, an inherent attribute of realistic molecular systems. Here, we explore the steady-state optical response of molecular emitters within a lossy cavity, with a focus on the combined effects of static and dynamic disorder, as frequently observed in solution-phase experiments. By analyzing the transmission spectra, molecular energy change, and dark state population, we uncover the contrasting effects of static and dynamic disorder on the dark state population and its interplay with polariton states. We find that the Rabi splitting exhibits an inversion with increasing disorder strength where the maximum splitting is determined by the interplay of static and dynamic disorder. Furthermore, we identify a dark state-induced polariton linewidth narrowing, revealing a mechanism distinct from motional narrowing induced by frequency fluctuations. These mechanistic insights highlight the critical role of dark states, establishing a foundation for future developments in the fields of polariton chemistry and strong coupling spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Water is a superacid at extreme thermodynamic conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The chemical behavior of water under extreme pressures and temperatures lies at the heart of processes shaping planetary interiors, influences the deep carbon cycle, and underpins innovative high-temperature, high-pressure synthesis of materials. Recent experiments reveal that hydrocarbons immersed in ionized water under extreme conditions transform into heavy hydrocarbons and nanodiamonds. However, the chemistry of water at extreme conditions and its role in hydrocarbon condensation remains poorly understood. Here, using ab initio molecular dynamics simulations with enhanced sampling techniques and machine-learning interatomic potentials, we show that increasing pressure at high temperature induces water ionization, creating a superacid-like environment that favors the protonation of hydrocarbons into transient pentacoordinated carbonium ions like CH$_5^+$. These elusive intermediates release molecular hydrogen and yield highly reactive carbocations, driving hydrocarbon chain growth toward nanodiamonds. We demonstrate how the combination of water ionization and pressure-induced methane polarization leads to superacid-driven hydrocarbon chemistry, famously known at far milder conditions. Our findings reveal, for the first time, a superacid aqueous regime and establish the existence of superacid chemistry under extreme conditions. Moreover, they provide a unifying reaction network that explains chemical transformations in environments such as planetary interiors and high pressure, high temperature experiments.</description>

      <title>DNA Origami Nanostructures Observed in Transmission Electron Microscopy Images can be Characterized through Convolutional Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) models remain an emerging strategy to accelerate materials design and development. We demonstrate that convolutional neural network (CNN) models can characterize DNA origami nanostructures employed in programmable self-assembling, which is important in many applications such as in biomedicine. Specifically, we benchmark the performance of 9 CNN models -- viz. AlexNet, GoogLeNet, VGG16, VGG19, ResNet18, ResNet34, ResNet50, ResNet101, and ResNet152 -- to characterize the ligation number of DNA origami nanostructures in transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images. We first pre-train CNN models using a large image dataset of 720 images from our coarse-grained (CG) molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Then, we fine-tune the pre-trained CNN models, using a small experimental TEM dataset with 146 TEM images. All CNN models were found to have similar computational time requirements, while their model sizes and performances are different. We use 20 test MD images to demonstrate that among all of the pre-trained CNN models ResNet50 and VGG16 have the highest and second highest accuracies. Among the fine-tuned models, VGG16 was found to have the highest agreement on the test TEM images. Thus, we conclude that fine-tuned VGG16 models can quickly characterize the ligation number of nanostructures in large TEM images.</description>

      <title>Stochastic resolution of identity to CC2 for large systems: Oscillator strength and ground state gradient calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An implementation of stochastic resolution of identity (sRI) approximation to CC2 oscillator strengths as well as ground state analytical gradients is presented. The essential 4-index electron repulsion integrals (ERIs) are contracted with a set of stochastic orbitals on the basis of the RI technique and the orbital energy differences in the denominators are decoupled with the Laplace transform. These lead to a significant scaling reduction from O(N^5) to O(N^3) for oscillator strengths and gradients with the size of the basis set, N. The gradients need a large number of stochastic orbitals with O(N^3), so we provide an additional O(N^4) version with better accuracy and smaller prefactor by adopting sRI partially. Such steep computational acceleration of nearly two or one order of magnitude is very attractive for large systems. This work is an extension to our previous implementations of sRI-CC2 ground and excited state energies and shows the feasibility of introducing sRI to CC2 properties beyond energies.</description>

      <title>First principles prediction of wavelength-dependent isomerization quantum yields of a second-generation molecular nanomotor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Second-generation molecular nanomotors are becoming more popular within the biomedical field and intense research is being conducted to increase their efficiency for light-induced ultrafast photoisomerization. A key requirement for designing efficient molecular nanomotors is ensuring unidirectional rotation during isomerization and thermal helix inversion. Here, we used non-adiabatic trajectory surface hopping molecular dynamics based on TDDFT to study the excited state dynamics of the stable M- and metastable P-conformers of a second-generation Feringa-type molecular nanomotor. From the trajectories, we computed quantum yields for clockwise and anti-clockwise photoisomerization. Results show that the helicity of the initial structure dictates the direction of the isomerization: 52 $\%$ of the trajectories starting from M-conformers isomerize clockwise, whereas 23 $\%$ of the trajectories starting from P-conformers isomerize anti-clockwise. The quantum yield for clockwise isomerization can be maximized by excitation in the center of the absorption spectrum (350 - 400 nm). In this region, the M-conformer exhibits its maximum absorption and maximum (clockwise) isomerization quantum yield, whereas the P-conformer shows negligible excitation probability and (anti-clockwise) isomerization quantum yield. Moreover, we also find several trajectories, where thermal helix inversion occurs in the hot ground state, directly after excited state relaxation. While helix inversion was observed to proceed in both directions, its net effect favors unidirectional rotation. We further report excited state lifetimes and details about the structural dynamics.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Hydrogen Evolution Using $\beta$-MnO$_2$ Monolayer on Ni Electrode with Engineered Oxygen Vacancies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing cost-effective and high-performance electrodes is critical for advancing hydrogen (H$_2$) production through electrochemical water splitting. In this study, we present a novel electrode design by depositing a $\beta$-MnO$_2$ monolayer on a conventional Ni(100) substrate (MnO$_2$(110)/Ni(100)) and systematically investigate its electrocatalytic properties. This work uniquely explores the influence of oxygen vacancies (OVs) at distinct sites -- Osub-top and bridge sites -- on both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Our findings reveal that the Osub-top vacancy (OOV-MnO$_2$(110)/Ni(100)) significantly enhances HER activity, achieving a hydrogen Gibbs free energy ($\Delta G_{\rm H}$) of $-0.015$ eV, which surpasses the performance of noble metals such as Pt/C ($-0.082$ eV) and Ir ($-0.08$ eV). Additionally, the cathodic exchange current density $(J_{0,c})$ of OOV-MnO$_2$(110)/Ni(100) reaches $10^{-0.774}$ Acm$^{-2}$, outperforming Pt/C ($10^{-0.92}$ Acm$^{-2}$) and Ir ($10^{-1.44}$ Acm$^{-2}$). Electrochemical analysis confirms a cathodic activation overpotential $(\eta_{a,c})$ of 0.141 V at 10 mAcm$^{-2}$ in a 0.5 M H$_2$SO$_4$ solution, achieving a hydrogen production rate (HPR) of 0.91 mmolh$^{-1}$cm$^{-2}$ at an applied voltage ($V_{\rm app}$) of 1.60 V. This study provides the first comprehensive analysis of site-specific oxygen vacancy effects on bifunctional MnO$_2$-based electrodes, demonstrating superior HER activity while maintaining dual functionality for both cathodic and anodic processes. Our results highlight the potential of engineered oxygen vacancies to develop low-cost, high-efficiency electrodes for sustainable hydrogen production, offering a competitive alternative to precious metal-based catalysts.</description>

      <title>Ions at electrochemical interfaces: from explicit to implicit molecular solvent descriptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the interplay between electronic screening inside a metal and screening by a polar molecular solvent, focusing on their impact on the charge induced by an ion and the solvent structure at the interface. To that end, we consider atomistically resolved electrodes within the Thomas-Fermi model of screening and describe the molecular solvent either explicitly via classical molecular dynamics or implicitly using Molecular Density Functional Theory (MDFT). Specifically, we examine the effect of screening by tuning the Thomas-Fermi screening length $l_\text{TF}$, the ion charge by considering Na$^+$ and Cl$^-$ and the solvent nature by studying water and acetonitrile. Consistently with our previous findings without solvent, $l_\text{TF}$ significantly affects the charge distribution inside the metal. However, $l_\text{TF}$ has no significant impact on the interfacial solvent structure, suggesting that its effect on the charge distribution induced inside the metal by the ion is essentially due to how the metal responds to the (same) external charge distribution, including the solvent, even though the coupling between both sides of the interface may play a secondary role. Furthermore, MDFT accurately reproduces fine details of the interfacial solvent structure around the ion at a fraction of the computational cost of MD simulations. These results highlight the relevance of MDFT as a powerful tool to model electrochemical systems at the molecular level.</description>

      <title>Extending Ambient Pressure X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy to Plasma Studies: A novel and flexible plasma gun approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The characterization of the electronic structure and chemical states of gases, solids, and liquids can be effectively performed using ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (AP-XPS). However, the acquisition of electronic and chemical information under plasma conditions poses significant challenges. In this study, we have developed an advanced experimental system capable of garnering electronic information amidst plasma environments, alongside providing detailed surface chemical states of samples subjected to plasma conditions. By designing a customized plasma generation apparatus, we successfully integrated it with a traditional AP-XPS system. This novel plasma-AP-XPS system confined plasma proximal to the sample area, with adjustable intensity parameters controlled by either modifying the distance between the plasma source and the sample surface or adjusting the voltage applied. This configuration permitted the direct detection of electrons in the plasma via the XPS electron detector. To substantiate the efficacy and versatility of this setup, it was applied to two distinct studies: the plasma etching of graphene and plasma oxidation of platinum (Pt). The investigations confirmed that argon (Ar) plasma facilitates the etching of graphene, a phenomenon clearly evidenced by the XPS spectra. Similarly, the exposure of the Pt surface to oxygen plasma was found to induce effective oxidation. This developed system significantly extends the utility of AP-XPS, enhancing its application for in-depth studies of plasma-enhanced reactions under operando conditions, thereby holding promise for the advancement in material science and chemical engineering fields.</description>

      <title>On the Functional Dependence of Transition-Potential Coupled Cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orbital relaxation of the core region is a primary source of error in the computation of core ionization and core excitation energies. Recently, Transition-Potential Coupled Cluster (TP-CC) methods have been used to explicitly treat orbital relaxation using non-variational molecular orbitals determined by reoccupation of orbitals optimized for a fractional core occupation. The amount of fractional occupation is governed by parameter $\lambda$, and recommended values for accurate TP-CCSD and XTP-CCSD computations of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and fluorine 1s K-edges were previously determined. Herein, we explore the performance of a several density functionals for generating the fractionally occupied orbitals used in TP-CCSD. These functionals include HF, BP86, BH&amp;HLYP, B3LYP, M06-2X, and $\omega$B97m-V. The fractionally occupied orbitals computed across the various functionals were subsequently employed as the initial orbitals for our TP-CCSD calculations of organic K-edge x-ray absorption and photoelectron spectra. Regardless of the functional used to generate the fractionally occupied orbitals, the TP-CCSD calculations yield accurate and comparable core ionization energies, core excitation energies, and oscillator strengths.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically propose a new method in cavity- and surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) with improved temporal resolution in the measurement of stochastic Raman spectral fluctuations. Our approach combines Fourier spectroscopy and photon correlation to decouple the integration time from the temporal resolution. Using statistical optics simulations, we establish the relationship between time resolution and Raman signal strength, revealing that typical Raman spectral fluctuations, commensurate with molecular conformational dynamics, can theoretically be resolved on micro- to millisecond timescales. The method can further extract average single-molecule dynamics from small sub-ensembles, thereby potentially mitigating challenges in achieving strictly single-molecule isolation on SERS substrates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hybrid functionals have been considered insufficiently reliable for the prediction of band gaps in solids and surfaces. We revisit this issue with a new generation of optimally-tuned range-separated hybrid functionals, focusing on the reconstructed Si(111)-(2x1) and Ge(111)-(2x1) surfaces. We show that certain hybrid functionals can accurately predict the surface-state and bulk fundamental and optical gaps, as well as projected band structures of these surfaces, by combining ground-state and time-dependent density functional theory.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Manipulation of Multiphase Fluid in Microgravity Using Photoresponsive Surfactant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Control of bubble motion is essential for improving efficiency and creating new functionalities in electrochemistry, heat transfer, and biomedical systems. Photoresponsive surfactants enable bubble manipulation by creating surface tension gradients, inducing a photo-Marangoni flow under illumination, without needing any engineered substrates, by leveraging a reversible switch in molecular conformation. Although previous studies have demonstrated bubble manipulation using photo-responsive surfactants, a comprehensive understanding of how fluid behavior is affected by critical parameters, such as bubble size, illumination, photo-switching kinetics, concentration, and adsorption desorption kinetics, remains elusive. Advances have been limited by the complex multiphysics processed involved, and by the fact that earth-bound experiments cannot study bubble photo-Marangoni dynamics without interference from bubble buoyancy and photo-thermal convection. We elucidate the factors enabling fast photo-Marangoni-driven bubble motion, by performing microgravity experiments, enabled by a bespoke photo-surfactant, complemented by a detailed modeling framework. We identify an optimal bubble size for migration, since smaller and larger bubbles incur weaker photo-Marangoni stresses and larger drag, respectively. Surfactants that switch rapidly under illumination drive fast migration, provided their reverse switch (in darkness) is much slower, yet not negligible. These foundational results enable the synthesis of next-generation photo-surfactants and photo-Marangoni manipulation across multiphase fluid systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural network potentials trained on quantum-mechanical data can calculate molecular interactions with relatively high speed and accuracy. However, neural network potentials might exhibit instabilities, nonphysical behavior, or lack accuracy. To assess the reliability of neural network potentials, a series of tests is conducted during model training, in the gas phase, and in the condensed phase. The testing procedure is performed for eight in-house neural network potentials based on the ANI-2x dataset, using both the ANI-2x and MACE architectures. This allows an evaluation of the effect of the model architecture on its performance. We also perform stability tests of the publicly available neural network potentials ANI-2x, ANI-1ccx, MACE-OFF23, and AIMNet2. A normal mode analysis of 14 simple benchmark molecules revealed that the small MACE-OFF23 model shows large deviations from the reference quantum-mechanical energy surface. Also, some MACE models with a reduced number of parameters failed to produce stable molecular dynamics simulations in the gas phase, and all MACE models exhibit unfavorable behavior during steric clashes. The published ANI-2x and one of the in-house MACE models are not able to reproduce the structure of liquid water at ambient conditions, forming an amorphous solid phase instead. The ANI-1ccx model shows nonphysical additional energy minima in bond length and bond angle space, which caused a phase transition to an amorphous solid. Out of all 13 considered public and in-house models, only one in-house model based on the ANI-2x B97-3c dataset shows better agreement with the experimental radial distribution function of water than the simple molecular mechanics TIP3P model. This shows that great care must be taken during model training and when selecting a neural network potential for real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Edge Exposure as the Trigger for Structural Instability in LP-N and HLP-N</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: LP-N and HLP-N are promising high-energy-density materials. However, these materials synthesized under high pressure cannot be maintained stable at ambient conditions. The mechanism behind their instability remains unclear. Our research, based on first-principles calculations and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, reveals that while not edge exposed, LP-N and HLP-N exhibit substantial structural, dynamic, and mechanical stability under ambient conditions. The stability of HLP-N is governed by an interlocking mechanism, which becomes ineffective upon exposure of the edges, leading to internal breakdown. As a result, H saturated adsorption has no impact on it. In contrast, LP-N benefits modestly from H saturated adsorption due to its edge-initiated dissociation. The interlocking mechanism offer valuable insights into the design of new materials.</description>

      <title>Assessing zero-shot generalisation behaviour in graph-neural-network interatomic potentials</title>

Abstract: With the rapidly growing availability of machine-learned interatomic potential (MLIP) models for chemistry, much current research focuses on the development of generally applicable and ``foundational'' MLIPs. An important question in this context is whether, and how well, such models can transfer from one application domain to another. Here, we assess this transferability for an MLIP model at the interface of materials and molecular chemistry. Specifically, we study GO-MACE-23, a model designed for the extended covalent network of graphene oxide, and quantify its zero-shot performance for small, isolated molecules and chemical reactions outside its direct scope--in direct comparison with a state-of-the-art model which has been trained in-domain. Our work provides quantitative insight into the transfer and generalisation ability of graph-neural-network potentials and, more generally, makes a step towards the more widespread applicability of MLIPs in chemistry.</description>

      <title>Graph Fourier Neural ODEs: Modeling Spatial-temporal Multi-scales in Molecular Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01600</link>

Abstract: Accurately predicting long-horizon molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories remains a significant challenge, as existing deep learning methods often struggle to retain fidelity over extended simulations. We hypothesize that one key factor limiting accuracy is the difficulty of capturing interactions that span distinct spatial and temporal scales-ranging from high-frequency local vibrations to low-frequency global conformational changes. To address these limitations, we propose Graph Fourier Neural ODEs (GF-NODE), integrating a graph Fourier transform for spatial frequency decomposition with a Neural ODE framework for continuous-time evolution. Specifically, GF-NODE first decomposes molecular configurations into multiple spatial frequency modes using the graph Laplacian, then evolves the frequency components in time via a learnable Neural ODE module that captures both local and global dynamics, and finally reconstructs the updated molecular geometry through an inverse graph Fourier transform. By explicitly modeling high- and low-frequency phenomena in this unified pipeline, GF-NODE more effectively captures long-range correlations and local fluctuations alike. Experimental results on challenging MD benchmarks, including MD17 and alanine dipeptide, demonstrate that GF-NODE achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while preserving essential geometrical features over extended simulations. These findings highlight the promise of bridging spectral decomposition with continuous-time modeling to improve the robustness and predictive power of MD simulations.</description>

      <title>First-Passage Approach to Optimizing Perturbations for Improved Training of Machine Learning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04121v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning models have become indispensable tools in applications across the physical sciences. Their training is often time-consuming, vastly exceeding the inference timescales. Several protocols have been developed to perturb the learning process and improve the training, such as shrink and perturb, warm restarts, and stochastic resetting. For classifiers, these perturbations have been shown to result in enhanced speedups or improved generalization. However, the design of such perturbations is usually done ad hoc by intuition and trial and error. To rationally optimize training protocols, we frame them as first-passage processes and consider their response to perturbations. We show that if the unperturbed learning process reaches a quasi-steady state, the response at a single perturbation frequency can predict the behavior at a wide range of frequencies. We employ this approach to a CIFAR-10 classifier using the ResNet-18 model and identify a useful perturbation and frequency among several possibilities. Our work allows optimization of perturbations for improving the training of machine learning models using a first-passage approach.</description>
