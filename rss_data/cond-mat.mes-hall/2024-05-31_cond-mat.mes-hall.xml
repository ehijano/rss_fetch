      <title>Interaction-induced crystalline topology of excitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply the topological theory of symmetry indicators to interaction-induced exciton band structures in centrosymmetric semiconductors. Crucially, we distinguish between the topological invariants inherited from the underlying electron and hole bands, and those that are intrinsic to the exciton wavefunction itself. Focusing on the latter, we show that there exists a class of exciton bands for which the maximally-localised exciton Wannier states are shifted with respect to the electronic Wannier states by a quantised amount; we call these excitons shift excitons. Our analysis explains how the exciton spectrum can be topologically nontrivial and sustain exciton edge states in open boundary conditions even when the underlying noninteracting bands have a trivial atomic limit. We demonstrate the presence of shift excitons as the lowest energy neutral excitations of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model in its trivial phase when supplemented by local two-body interactions, and show that they can be accessed experimentally in local optical conductivity measurements.</description>

      <title>Quarter- and half-filled quantum Hall states and their competing interactions in bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bilayer graphene has emerged as a key platform for studying non-Abelian fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states. Its multiple half-filled plateaus with large energy gaps combined with its tunability offer an opportunity to distill the principles that determine their topological order. Here, we report four additional plateaus at $\nu=\frac{1}{2}$ for different spin and valley, revealing a systematic pattern of non-Abelian states according to their Levin--Halperin daughter states. Whenever a pair of $N=1$ Landau levels cross, anti-Pfaffian and Pfaffian develop at half filling of the lower and higher levels, respectively. In the $N=0$ levels, where half-filled plateaus are absent, we instead observe four unexpected incompressible quarter-filled states along with daughters. The mutual exclusion of half- and quarter-filled states indicates a robust competition between the interactions favoring either paired states of two-flux or four-flux composite fermions. Finally, we observe several FQH states that require strong interactions between composite fermions. Our combined findings herald a new generation of quantum Hall physics in graphene-based heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Electric-field-tuned binding energies of trions in silicene, germanene, and stanene monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We predict a formation of intravalley and intervalley controllable trions in buckled 2D materials such as silicene, germanene and stanene monolayers in an external electric field. A study is performed within the framework of a nonrelativistic potential model using the method of hyperspherical harmonics (HH). We solve the three-body Schr\"{o}dinger equation with the Rytova-Keldysh potential by expanding the wave functions of a trion in terms of the HH. A resultant system of coupled differential equations are solved numerically. Controllable ground state energies of intravalley and intervalley trions by the external electric field are presented. The dependencies of the binding energy (BE) of trions in the silicene, germanene and stanene as a function of the electric field are qualitatively similar. BEs of trions formed by $A$ and $B$ excitons have a non-negligible differences which slightly increase as the electric field increases. It is demonstrated that trion BEs can be controlled by the external electric field and the dielectric environment has a significant effect on the trion BE</description>

      <title>Transport signatures of phase fluctuations in superconducting qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Josephson junctions supply the nonlinear inductance element in superconducting qubits. In the widely used transmon configuration, where the junction is shunted by a large capacitor, the low charging energy minimizes the sensitivity of the qubit to charge noise while maintaining the necessary anharmonicity to qubit states. We report here low-frequency transport measurements on small standalone junctions and identically fabricated capacitively-shunted junctions that show two distinct features normally attributed to small capacitance junctions near zero bias: reduced switching currents and prominent finite resistance associated with phase diffusion in the current-voltage characteristic. Our transport data reveals the existence of phase fluctuations in transmons arising from intrinsic junction capacitance.</description>

      <title>The manifestation of Fermi level oscillations in the magnetoresistance of HgTe quantum wells with a split spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations and magneto-intersubband oscillations of magnetoresistance of structures with single HgTe quantum wells with a width of (10-18) nm have been experimentally studied. The spectrum of the conduction band in these structures is split by the spin-orbit interaction. This leads to beats of the SdH oscillations and the appearance of low-frequency magneto-intersubband oscillations. The mutual position of the antinodes of the SdH oscillations and the maxima of the magneto-interband oscillations is unusual -- in low magnetic fields it is directly opposite to the predictions of the theory. Measurements in high magnetic fields, in which the relative amplitude of the SdH oscillations becomes greater than 0.2-0.3, show a change in the relative position of the antinodes of the SdH oscillations and the maxima of low-frequency oscillations. Numerical calculations and additional measurements at different temperatures show that the observed effects are due to oscillations of the Fermi level in the magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Unidirectional charge orders induced by oxygen vacancies on SrTiO$_3$(001)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of high-mobility two-dimensional electron gas and low carrier density superconductivity in multiple SrTiO$_3$-based heterostructures has stimulated intense interest in the surface properties of SrTiO$_3$. The recent discovery of high-T$_c$ superconductivity in the monolayer FeSe/SrTiO$_3$ aroused the upsurge and underscored the atomic precision probe of the surface structure. By performing atomically resolved cryogenic scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy characterization on dual-TiO$_{2}$-${\delta}$-terminated SrTiO$_3$(001) surfaces with ($\sqrt{13}$ $\times$ $\sqrt{13}$), c(4 $\times$ 2), mixed (2 $\times$ 1), and (2 $\times$ 2) reconstructions, we disclosed universally broken rotational symmetry and contrasting bias- and temperature-dependent electronic states for apical and equatorial oxygen sites. With the sequentially evolved surface reconstructions and simultaneously increasing equatorial oxygen vacancies, the surface anisotropy reduces, and the work function lowers. Intriguingly, unidirectional stripe orders appear on the c(4 $\times$ 2) surface, whereas local (4 $\times$ 4) order emerges and eventually forms long-range unidirectional c(4 $\times$ 4) charge order on the (2 $\times$ 2) surface. This work reveals robust unidirectional charge orders induced by oxygen vacancies due to strong and delicate electronic-lattice interaction under broken rotational symmetry, providing insights into understanding the complex behaviors in perovskite oxide-based heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Trembling Motion of Exciton-Polaritons Close to the Rashba-Dresselhaus Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the experimental emulation of trembling quantum motion, or Zitterbewegung, of exciton polaritons in a perovskite microcavity at room temperature. By introducing liquid crystal molecules into the microcavity, we achieve spinor states with synthetic Rashba-Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling and tunable energy splitting. Under a resonant excitation, the polariton fluid exhibits clear trembling motion perpendicular to its flowing direction, accompanied by a unique spin pattern resembling interlocked fingers. Furthermore, leveraging on the sizable tunability of energy gaps by external electrical voltages, we observe the continuous transition of polariton Zitterbewegung from relativistic (small gaps) to non-relativistic (large gaps) regimes. Our findings pave the way for using exciton polaritons in the emulation of relativistic quantum physics.</description>

      <title>Material and size dependent corrections to conductance quantization in anomalous Hall effect from anomaly inflow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) systems, the Hall conductance is quantized and the corresponding effective topological theory of the system is the Chern-Simons theory. The conductance quantum is given by the universal constant $e^2/h$ -- the inverse von Klitzing constant -- that is independent of the bulk gap, as well as the size of the system. This picture relies on the assumption that the edge modes are sharply localized at the edge, i.e. they have zero width. We show that considering the physical case where the edge modes have finite localization length $b$, the effective action would not be topological in bulk direction anymore. Due to non-zero $b$ the conductance quantum will be corrected as $(1-\varepsilon)e^2/h$ where $\varepsilon$ encompasses the non-universal (i.e. material/sample dependent) part that is determined by the dimensionless ratios $\frac{gb}{\hbar v_F}$ and $\frac{b}{L}$ where $g,v_F,L$ are the bulk gap, Fermi velocity and sample length. To compute the non-universal correction $\varepsilon$ we use anomaly inflow framework according to which the bulk action produces the correct amount of anomaly inflow that would cancel the anomaly of the chiral edge modes. These corrections place limits on the precision of measurable quantization in units of the inverse von Klitzing constant for QAH systems with smaller sizes and/or smaller bulk gaps. Our result suggests that the failure of precision measurements to reproduce the exact conductance quantum $e^2/h$ is not an annoying sample quality issue, but it contains the quantitative physics of anomaly inflow that can be inferred by the systematic study of such corrections.</description>

      <title>Atomistic compositional details and their importance for spin qubits in isotope-purified silicon-germanium quantum wells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding crystal characteristics down to the atomistic level increasingly emerges as a crucial insight for creating solid state platforms for qubits with reproducible and homogeneous properties. Here, isotope composition depth profiles in a SiGe/$^{28}$Si/SiGe heterostructure are analyzed with atom probe tomography (APT) and time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectrometry. Spin-echo dephasing times $T_2^{echo}=128 \mu s$ and valley energy splittings around $200 \mu eV$ have been observed for single spin qubits in this quantum well (QW) heterostructure, pointing towards the suppression of qubit decoherence through hyperfine interaction or via scattering between valley states. The concentration of nuclear spin-carrying $^{29}$Si is 50 ppm in the $^{28}$Si QW. APT allows to uncover that both the top SiGe/$^{28}$Si and the bottom $^{28}$Si/SiGe interfaces of the QW are shaped by epitaxial growth front segregation signatures on a few monolayer scale. A subsequent thermal treatment broadens the top interface by about two monolayers, while the width of the bottom interface remains unchanged. Using a tight-binding model including SiGe alloy disorder, these experimental results suggest that the combination of the slightly thermally broadened top interface and of a minimal Ge concentration of $0.3 \%$ in the QW, resulting from segregation, is instrumental for the observed large valley splitting. Minimal Ge additions $&lt; 1 \%$, which get more likely in thin QWs, will hence support high valley splitting without compromising coherence times. At the same time, taking thermal treatments during device processing as well as the occurrence of crystal growth characteristics into account seems important for the design of reproducible qubit properties.</description>

      <title>Propagation, dissipation and breakdown in quantum anomalous Hall edge states probed by microwave edge plasmons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect, with its single chiral, topologically protected edge state, offers a platform for flying Majorana states as well as non-reciprocal microwave devices. While recent research showed the non-reciprocity of edge plasmons in Cr-doped $\mathrm{(Bi_xSb_\text{1-x})_2Te_3}$, the understanding of their dissipation remains incomplete. Our study explores edge plasmon dissipation in V-doped $\mathrm{(Bi_xSb_\text{1-x})_2Te_3}$ films, analyzing microwave transmission across various conditions. We identify interactions with charge puddles as a primary source of dissipation, providing insights critical for developing improved QAH-based technologies.</description>

      <title>On equivalence of two formulas of orbital magnetic susceptibility for tight-binding models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that two formulas of the orbital magnetic susceptibility, namely, Koshino-Ando's formula and G\'{o}mes-Santos and Stauber's formula, are equivalent for the tight-binding models. The difference between these two formulas can be written in a form containing the surface terms arising from the momentum-space integration, and we show that the surface terms are exactly vanishing although the primitive functions are seemingly non-periodic with respect to the translation by the reciprocal lattice vector.</description>

      <title>Pick-up and assembling of chemically sensitive van der Waals heterostructures using dry cryogenic exfoliation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assembling atomic layers of van der Waals materials (vdW) combines the physics of two materials, offering opportunities for novel functional devices. Realization of this has been possible because of advancements in nanofabrication processes which often involve chemical processing of the materials under study; this can be detrimental to device performance. To address this issue, we have developed a modified micro-manipulator setup for cryogenic exfoliation, pick up, and transfer of vdW materials to assemble heterostructures. We use the glass transition of a polymer PDMS to cleave a flake into two, followed by its pick-up and drop to form pristine twisted junctions. To demonstrate the potential of the technique, we fabricated twisted heterostructure of Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$ (BSCCO), a van der Waals high-temperature cuprate superconductor. We also employed this method to re-exfoliate NbSe$_2$ and make twisted heterostructure. Transport measurements of the fabricated devices indicate the high quality of the artificial twisted interface. In addition, we extend this cryogenic exfoliation method for other vdW materials, offering an effective way of assembling heterostructures and twisted junctions with pristine interfaces.</description>

      <title>Aharonov-Bohm flux and dual gaps effects on energy levels in graphene magnetic quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the question of how the Aharonov-Bohm flux $\Phi_{AB}$ can affect the energy levels of graphene magnetic quantum dots (GMQDs) of radius $R$. To answer this question, we consider GMQDs induced by a magnetic field $B$ and subjected to two different gaps - an internal gap $\Delta_1$ and an external gap $\Delta_2$. After determining the eigenspinors and ensuring continuity at the boundary of the GMQDs, we formulate an analytical equation describing the corresponding energy levels. Our results show that the energy levels can exhibit either a symmetric or an asymmetric behavior depending on the valleys $K$ and $K'$ together with the quantum angular momentum $m$. In addition, we find that $\Phi_{AB}$ causes an increase in the band gap width when $\Delta_1$ is present inside the GMQDs. This effect is less significant when a gap is present outside, resulting in a longer lifetime of the confined electronic states. Further increases in \(\Phi_{AB}\) reduce the number of levels between the conduction and valence bands, thereby increasing the band gap. These results demonstrate that the electronic properties of graphene can be tuned by the presence of the AB flux, offering the potential to control the behavior of graphene-based quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Generalized Cluster Correlation Expansion theory for STIRAP processes in the presence of a spin bath</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Stimulated Raman Adiabatic Passage (STIRAP) is applied to a system coupled to a bath made of fully-interacting two-level systems, whose dynamics is studied exploiting the generalized Cluster Correlation Expansion (gCCE) theory. We specialize our analysis to a negatively charged silicon vacancy (SiV-1) in non-purified 4H-SiC to assess the possibility of transferring population between two states of the ground manifold, also taking into account the interaction with a spherical nuclear spin bath formed by nuclei of 29Si and 13C. For this system, it is demonstrated that the presence of a small/medium sized bath has no effect on the protocol, finding in particular a set of parameter values for an efficient STIRAP process.</description>

      <title>Variational Mapping of Chern Bands to Landau Levels: Application to Fractional Chern Insulators in Twisted MoTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theoretical study of mapping between Chern bands and generalized Landau levels in twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$, where fractional Chern insulators have been observed. We construct an exact Landau-level representation of moir\'e bands, where the bases are derived from Landau-level wavefunctions dressed by spinors aligned or antialigned with the layer pseudospin skyrmion field and maintain uniform quantum geometry. We further generalize the dressed zeroth Landau level to a variational wavefunction with an ideal yet nonuniform quantum geometry and variationally maximize its weight in the first moir\'e band. The variational wavefunction quantitatively reproduces the exact diagonalization spectra of fractional Chern insulators at hole-filling factors $\nu_h=2/3$ and $3/5$ across a large twist-angle range. Our work introduces a new approach to studying fractional states by bridging the gap between Chern bands and Landau levels.</description>

      <title>Hall-like behaviour of higher rank Chern-Simons theory of fractons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fracton phases of matter constitute an interesting point of contact between condensed matter and high-energy physics. The limited mobility property of fracton quasiparticles finds applications in many different contexts, including quantum information, spin liquids, elasticity, hydrodynamics, gravity and holography. In this paper we adopt a field theoretical approach to investigate the three dimensional action of a rank-2 symmetric tensor field invariant under the covariant fracton symmetry. The theory appears as a non-topological higher rank generalization of the ordinary Chern-Simons model, depending only on the traceless part of the tensor gauge field. After defining a field strength, a rank-2 traceless ``electric'' field and a ``magnetic'' vector field are identified, in analogy with the standard Chern-Simons ones. Once matter is introduced, a Hall-like behaviour with fractonic features emerges. In particular, our model shows a Hall-like dipole current, together with a vectorial ``flux-attachment'' relation for dipoles. This gives a possible starting point for a fracton - vortex duality. A gauge-fixing term is then introduced, from which propagators are computed and the counting of the degrees of freedom is performed. Finally, the energy-momentum tensor is shown to be conserved and the integrated energy density is proved to be zero, which reminds the topological nature of the standard Chern-Simons model.</description>

      <title>Optomechanical entanglement induced by backward stimulated Brillouin scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a scheme to generate robust optomechanical entanglement. This scheme is based on a Backward Stimulated Brillouin Scattering (BSBS) process, which is hosted within an optomechanical structure. Our benchmark system consists of an acoustic (mechanical) mode coupled to two optical modes through the BSBS (radiation pressure) process. For a moderate values of the effective mechanical coupling, the BSBS induces a relatively weak entanglement. This entanglement is greatly enhanced, for at least up to one order of magnitude, when the mechanical coupling strength is strong enough. The generated entanglement is robust enough against thermal fluctuation. Our work provides a new scheme for entanglement generation based on BSBS effect, and can be extended to microwaves and hybrid optomechanical structures. Such a generated entangled states can be used for quantum information processing, quantum sensing, and quantum computing.</description>

      <title>MXene's Surface Functionalization Patterns and Their Impacts on Magnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional transition metal carbides and nitrides (MXenes) are a perspective group of materials with a broad palette of applications. Surface terminations are a product of the MXene preparation, and post-processing can also lead to partial coverage. Despite applicability and fundamental properties being driven by termination patterns, it is not fully clear, how they behave on MXene surfaces with various degrees of surface coverage. Here, as the first step, we used density functional theory to predict possible patterns in prototypic Ti$_2$C MXene, demonstrating the different behavior of the two most frequent terminal atoms, oxygen, and fluorine. Oxygen (with formal charge -2$e$) prefers a zigzag line both-side adsorption pattern on bare Ti$_2$C, attracting the next adsorbent to a minimal distance. Oxygen defects in fully O-terminated MXene tend to form similar zigzag line vacancy patterns. On the other hand, fluorine (with a formal charge of -1$e$) prefers one-side flake (island) adsorption on bare Ti$_2$C and a similar desorption style from fully fluorinated Ti$_2$C. MXene magnetic behavior is subsequently driven by the patterns, either compensating locally and holding the global magnetic state of the MXene until some limit (oxygen case) or gradually increasing total magnetism by summing of local effects (fluorine case). The systematic combinatoric study of Ti$_2$CT$_x$ with various coverages ($0 \leq x \leq 2$) of distinct terminal atoms T = O or F brings encouraging possibilities of tunable behavior of MXenes and provides useful guidance for its modeling towards electronic nanodevices.</description>

      <title>Analytical modeling of coated plasmonic particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biomedical applications of plasmonic nanoparticle conjugates need control over their optical properties modulated by surface coating with stabilizing or targeting molecules often attached to or embedded in the secondary functionalization shell, such as silica. Although current numerical techniques can simulate the plasmonic response of such structures, it is desirable in practice to have analytical models based on simple physical ideas that can be implemented without considerable computer resources. Here, we present two efficient analytical methods based on improved electrostatic approximation (IEA) and model expansion method (MEM) combined with the dipole equivalence method (DEM). The last approach avoids additional electromagnetic simulations and provides a direct bridge between analytical IEA and MEM models for bare particles and those with multilayer shells. As simple as the original IEA and MEM, the developed analytical extensions provide accurate extinction and scattering spectra for coated particles compared to exact calculations by separation of variable method and COMSOL. The possibility and accuracy of analytical models are illustrated by extensive simulations for prolate and oblate gold and silver nanoparticles with a maximal size of up to 200 nm, aspect ratio from 2 to 6, and 3-30 nm dielectric coating.</description>

      <title>Magnetic nonreciprocity in a hybrid device of asymmetric artificial spin-ice-superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controlling the size and distribution of potential barriers within a medium of interacting particles can unveil unique collective behaviors and innovative functionalities. In this study, we introduce a unique superconducting hybrid device using a novel artificial spin ice structure composed of asymmetric nanomagnets. This structure forms a distinctive superconducting pinning potential that steers unconventional motion of superconducting vortices, thereby inducing a magnetic nonreciprocal effect, in contrast to the electric nonreciprocal effect commonly observed in superconducting diodes. Furthermore, the polarity of the magnetic nonreciprocity is in-situ reversible through the tunable magnetic patterns of artificial spin ice. Our findings demonstrate that artificial spin ice not only precisely modulates superconducting characteristics but also opens the door to novel functionalities, offering a groundbreaking paradigm for superconducting electronics.</description>

      <title>Polarized sub-meV Photoluminescence in 2D PbS Nanoplatelets at Cryogenic Temperatures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals are promising materials for classical and quantum light sources due to their versatile chemistry and efficient photoluminescence (PL) properties. While visible emitters are well-established, the pursuit of excellent (near-)infrared sources continues. One notable candidate in this regard are photoluminescent two-dimensional (2D) PbS nanoplatelets (NPLs) exhibiting excitonic emission at 720 nm (1.7 eV) directly tying to the typical emission range limit of CdSe NPLs. Here, we present the first comprehensive analysis of low-temperature PL from this material class. Ultrathin 2D PbS NPLs exhibit high crystallinity confirmed by scanning transmission electron microscopy, and revealing Moire patterns in overlapping structures. At 4K, we observe unique PL features in single PbS NPLs, including narrow zero-phonon lines with line widths down to 0.6 meV and a linear degree of polarization up to 90%. Time-resolved measurements identify trions as the dominant emission source with a 2.3 ns decay time. Sub-meV spectral diffusion and no immanent blinking over minutes is observed, as well as discrete spectral jumps without memory effects. These findings advance the understanding and underpin the potential of colloidal PbS NPLs for optical and quantum technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) of magnetic quantum impurities in (partially) polarized phases of two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals magnets. Focusing on the Kitaev-Heisenberg honeycomb model for transition metal trihalides, e.g., CrI$_3$ or $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$, we consider adatom and substitutional impurity positions. Unlike the non-magnetic case, magnetic impurities can induce bound states below the magnon gap, whose energy one can measured by STS at finite bias voltage. Whenever the bound state energy vanishes as function of the magnetic field, we predict discontinuous local spin transitions which are expected to be ubiquitous in 2D magnets. They can be detected by STS in the zero-bias limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photonic modes exhibiting a polarization winding akin to a vortex possess an integer topological charge. Lasing with topological charge 1 or 2 can be realized in periodic lattices of up to six-fold rotational symmetry. Higher order charges require symmetries not compatible with any two-dimensional Bravais lattice. Here, we experimentally demonstrate lasing with topological charges as high as -5, +7, -17 and +19 in quasicrystals. We discover rich ordered structures of increasing topological charges in the reciprocal space. Our quasicrystal design utilizes group theory in determining electromagnetic field nodes, where lossy plasmonic nanoparticles are positioned to maximize gain. Our results open a new path for fundamental studies of higher-order topological defects, coherent light beams of high topological charge, and realizations of omni-directional, flat-band-like lasing.</description>

      <title>Strain-Induced Changes of Electronic and Optical Properties of Zr-based MXenes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Zr-based MXenes recently attracted attention because of its experimental preparation showing temperature stability, mechanical strength, and promising energy, sensoric, and electrochemistry applications. However, necessary theoretical predictions at a precise/predictive level are complicated due to essential excitonic features and strong electron correlation (i.e., a necessity to go beyond standard density functional theory, DFT). Contrary to the prevailing focus on oxygen-terminated MXenes and standard predictions of other Zr-based MXenes as conductors, based on the hybrid DFT and GW many-body perturbational theory, we were able to find seven different semiconductors (five of them for their equilibrium geometry and two others under slight tensile biaxial strain) in the case of two- and three-layered Zr$_2$CT$_2$ and Zr$_3$C$_2$T$_2$ configurations with various terminations (T = O, F, S, Cl). We observed semiconductor-to-conductor transition induced by strain in the majority of such Zr-based MXenes at experimentally achievable strain range. Furthermore, using the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE), we demonstrated that selected semiconducting Zr-based MXenes possess high optical absorption efficiency (20-30%) in the visible light range, underscoring their potential in photonic applications. The high sensitivity of Zr-based MXenes to external conditions and functionalization combined with the thermal stability make the materials promising for applications at operational temperatures in electronic and optical technologies.</description>

Abstract: Vortices in electron fluids are a key indicator of electron hydrodynamics. However, a comprehensive framework linking macroscopic vorticity measurements with microscopic interactions and scattering mechanisms has been lacking. We employ wavenumber-dependent conductivity $\sigma(k)$ incorporating realistic microscopic scattering processes, aiming to clarify the relationship between nonlocal response and vortices across ballistic and hydrodynamic phases. Vorticity is found to take similar values in both phases but feature very different sensitivity to momentum-relaxing scattering, with ballistic vortical flows being orders-of-magnitude more resilient than the hydrodynamic ones. This behavior can serve as a simple diagnostic of the microscopic origin of vorticity in electron fluids.</description>

Abstract: We study cross-relaxation features near zero magnetic field with ensembles of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond and examine their properties in samples with a range (0.9 ppm - 16.0 ppm) of NV concentrations. The observed NV-NV cross-relaxation features between differently oriented NV centers in high (greater than 0.9 ppm)-NV-density samples hold promise for a variety of magnetometry applications where microwave fields (or any bias field) disturb the system under study. We theoretically determine the values of the bias magnetic fields corresponding to cross-relaxations between different axes and experimentally validate them. The behavior of zero-field cross-relaxation features as a function of temperature is also investigated.</description>

Abstract: We develop a practical machine learning approach to determine the disorder landscape of Majorana nanowires by using training of the conductance matrix and inverting the conductance data in order to obtain the disorder details in the system. The inversion carried out through machine learning using different disorder parametrizations turns out to be unique in the sense that any input tunnel conductance as a function of chemical potential and Zeeman energy can indeed be inverted to provide the correct disorder landscape. Our work opens up a qualitatively new direction of directly determining the topological invariant and the Majorana wave-function structure corresponding to a transport profile of a device using simulations that quantitatively match the specific conductance profile. In addition, this also opens up the possibility for optimizing Majorana systems by figuring out the (generally unknown) underlying disorder only through the conductance data. An accurate estimate of the applicable spin-orbit coupling in the system can also be obtained within the same scheme.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.17399v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modelling the electrical response of multi-level quantum systems at finite frequency has been typically performed in the context of two incomplete paradigms: (i) input-output theory, which is valid at any frequency but neglects dynamic losses, and (ii) semiclassical theory, which captures well dynamic dissipation effects but is only accurate at low frequencies. Here, we develop a unifying theory, valid for arbitrary frequencies, that captures both the quantum behaviour and the non-unitary effects introduced by relaxation and dephasing. The theory allows a multi-level system to be described by a universal small-signal equivalent circuit model, a resonant RLC circuit, whose topology only depends on the number of energy levels. We apply our model to a double quantum-dot charge qubit and a Majorana qubit, showing the capability to continuously describe the systems from adiabatic to resonant and from coherent to incoherent, suggesting new and realistic experiments for improved quantum state readout. Our model will facilitate the design of hybrid quantum-classical circuits and the simulation of qubit control and quantum state readout.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.02501v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Single electrons trapped on solid neon surfaces (eNe) have recently emerged as a promising platform for charge qubits. Experimental results have revealed their exceptionally long coherence times, yet the actual quantum states of these trapped electrons, presumably on imperfectly flat neon surfaces, remain elusive. In this paper, we examine the electron's interactions with neon surface topography, such as bumps and valleys. By evaluating the surface charges induced by the electron, we demonstrate its strong perpendicular binding to the neon surface. The Schr\"{o}dinger equation for the electron's lateral motion on the curved 2D surface is then solved for extensive topographical variations. Our results reveal that surface bumps can naturally bind an electron, forming unique quantum ring states that align with experimental observations. We also show that the electron's excitation energy can be tuned using a modest magnetic field to facilitate qubit operation. This study offers a leap in our understanding of eNe qubit properties and provides strategic insights on minimizing charge noise and scaling the system to propel forward quantum computing architectures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04967v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnonic topological phases realize chiral edge spin waves that are protected against backscattering, potentially enabling highly efficient spin transport. Here we show that the spin transport through these magnonic chiral edge states can be electrically manipulated by non-Hermitian control. We consider the paradigmatic magnon Haldane model and show that it is transformed into an effective non-Hermitian magnon Chern insulator by including a sublattice-dependent spin-orbit torque. In linear spin-wave theory, this electrically induced torque reduces the damping of the chiral edge magnons along certain edge directions, leading to an enhancement of the spin-wave amplitude. This prediction is confirmed by numerical simulations based on the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation. For a spin-wave transport setup, in which magnons are excited by a microwave field and detected with a normal metal conductor, we find that the magnon amplification is remarkably robust against disorder, establishing non-Hermitian control as a promising avenue for topological magnonics.</description>

Abstract: When the perpendicular magnetic flux per unit cell in a crystal is equal to the quantum of magnetic flux, $\Phi_0=h/e$, we enter the 'Hofstadter regime'. The large unit cell of moir\'e materials like magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) allows the experimental study of this regime at feasible values of the field around $20$ to $30$ T. In this work, we report numerical analysis of a tight-binding model for MATBG at one quantum of external magnetic flux, including the long-range Coulomb and on-site Hubbard interaction. We study the correlated states for dopings of $-2,0$ and $2$ electrons per unit cell at the mean-field level. We find competing insulators with Chern numbers $2$ and $0$ at positive doping, the stability of which is determined by the dielectric screening, which opens up the possibility of observing a topological phase transition in this system.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by the recent discovery of fractional quantum anomalous Hall states in moir\'e systems, we consider the possibility of realizing non-Abelian phases in topological minibands. We study a family of moir\'e systems, skyrmion Chern band (SCB) models, which can be realized in two-dimensional semiconductor/magnetic skyrmion heterostructures and also capture the essence of twisted transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) homobilayers. We show using many-body exact diagonalization that, in spite of strong Berry curvature variations in momentum space, the non-Abelian Moore-Read state can be realized at half filling of the second miniband. These results demonstrate the feasibility of non-Abelian fractionalization in moir\'e systems without Landau levels and shed light on the desirable conditions for their realization. In particular, we highlight the prospect of realizing the Moore-Read state in twisted semiconductor bilayers.</description>

      <title>Inelastic tunneling through normal and superconducting junctions in the presence of photonic bath within Lindbladian formalism</title>

Abstract: An electron tunneling across a junction integrated into an electric circuit can generate an excitation in the photonic field (electromagnetic environment) and lose energy in the process. Such inelastic tunneling of particles is commonly described using the $P(E)$ theory. In the conventional approach to this theory, the tunneling rate and the electric current through the junction are derived using Fermi's golden rule and by averaging over the environmental photonic degrees of freedom. In this work, we address the same problem of inelastic tunneling due to photonic environment in Lindbladian formalism and we present how the photonic degrees of freedom are traced out in quantum master equation approach. The resulting quantum master equation is parameterized by the same $P(E)$ function and enables us to obtain not only the electric current but various other quantities, for instance the heat current, in a systematic and convenient way. We also demonstrate that the Lindbladian formalism provides a comprehensive description of Bogoliubov quasiparticle tunneling through superconducting junctions and that it properly accounts for the coherence factors. The coherence factors become important if the normal-state density of states is particle-hole asymmetric.</description>

      <title>A coherence sweet spot with enhanced dipolar coupling</title>

Abstract: Qubits require a compromise between operation speed and coherence. Here, we demonstrate a compromise-free singlet-triplet (ST) qubit, where the qubit couples maximally to the driving field while simultaneously coupling minimally to the dominant noise sources. The qubit is implemented in a crystal-phase defined double-quantum dot in an InAs nanowire. Using a superconducting resonator, we measure the spin-orbit interaction (SOI) gap, the spin-photon coupling strength and the qubit decoherence rate as a function of the in-plane magnetic-field orientation. We demonstrate a spin qubit sweet spot maximizing the dipolar coupling and simultaneously minimizing the decoherence. Our theoretical description postulates phonons as the most likely dominant noise source. The compromise-free sweet spot originates from the SOI suggesting that it is not restricted to this material platform, but might find applications in any material with SOI. These findings pave the way for enhanced engineering of these nanomaterials for next-generation qubit technologies.</description>

      <title>Experimental demonstration of magnetic tunnel junction-based computational random-access memory</title>

Abstract: Conventional computing paradigm struggles to fulfill the rapidly growing demands from emerging applications, especially those for machine intelligence, because much of the power and energy is consumed by constant data transfers between logic and memory modules. A new paradigm, called "computational random-access memory (CRAM)" has emerged to address this fundamental limitation. CRAM performs logic operations directly using the memory cells themselves, without having the data ever leave the memory. The energy and performance benefits of CRAM for both conventional and emerging applications have been well established by prior numerical studies. However, there lacks an experimental demonstration and study of CRAM to evaluate its computation accuracy, which is a realistic and application-critical metrics for its technological feasibility and competitiveness. In this work, a CRAM array based on magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) is experimentally demonstrated. First, basic memory operations as well as 2-, 3-, and 5-input logic operations are studied. Then, a 1-bit full adder with two different designs is demonstrated. Based on the experimental results, a suite of modeling has been developed to characterize the accuracy of CRAM computation. Scalar addition, multiplication, and matrix multiplication, which are essential building blocks for many conventional and machine intelligence applications, are evaluated and show promising accuracy performance. With the confirmation of MTJ-based CRAM's accuracy, there is a strong case that this technology will have a significant impact on power- and energy-demanding applications of machine intelligence.</description>

      <title>Comparative Microscopic Study of Entropies and their Production</title>

Abstract: We study the time evolution of eleven microscopic entropy definitions (of Boltzmann-surface, Gibbs-volume, canonical, coarse-grained-observational, entanglement and diagonal type) and three microscopic temperature definitions (based on Boltzmann, Gibbs or canonical entropy). This is done for the archetypal nonequilibrium setup of two systems exchanging energy, modeled here with random matrix theory, based on numerical integration of the Schroedinger equation. We consider three types of pure initial states (local energy eigenstates, decorrelated and entangled microcanonical states) and three classes of systems: (A) two normal systems, (B) a normal and a negative temperature system and (C) a normal and a negative heat capacity system.
  We find: (1) All types of initial states give rise to the same macroscopic dynamics. (2) Entanglement and diagonal entropy sensitively depend on the microstate, in contrast to all other entropies. (3) For class B and C, Gibbs-volume entropies can violate the second law and the associated temperature becomes meaningless. (4) For class C, Boltzmann-surface entropies can violate the second law and the associated temperature becomes meaningless. (5) Canonical entropy has a tendency to remain almost constant. (6) For a Haar random initial state, entanglement or diagonal entropy behave similar or identical to coarse-grained-observational entropy.</description>

      <title>A multi-module silicon-on-insulator chip assembly containing quantum dots and cryogenic radio-frequency readout electronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04104</link>

Abstract: Quantum processing units will be modules of larger information processing systems containing also digital and analog electronics modules. Silicon-based quantum computing offers the enticing opportunity to manufacture all the modules using the same technology platform. Here, we present a cryogenic multi-module assembly for multiplexed readout of silicon quantum devices where all modules have been fabricated using the same fully-depleted silicon-on-insulator (FDSOI) CMOS process. The assembly is constituted by three chiplets: (i) a low-noise amplifier (LNA), (ii) a single-pole eight-throw switch (SP8T), and (iii) a silicon quantum dot (QD) array. We characterise each module individually and show (i) a gain over 35 dB, a bandwidth of 118 MHz, a minimum noise temperature of 4.2 K, (ii) an insertion loss smaller than 1.1 dB, a noise temperature smaller than 1.1~K across 0-2 GHz, and (iii) single-electron box (SEB) charge sensors. Finally, we combine all elements into a single demonstration showing time-domain radio-frequency multiplexing of two SEBs paving the way to an all-silicon quantum computing system.</description>
