      <title>CHART-6: Human-Centered Evaluation of Data Visualization Understanding in Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data visualizations are powerful tools for communicating patterns in quantitative data. Yet understanding any data visualization is no small feat -- succeeding requires jointly making sense of visual, numerical, and linguistic inputs arranged in a conventionalized format one has previously learned to parse. Recently developed vision-language models are, in principle, promising candidates for developing computational models of these cognitive operations. However, it is currently unclear to what degree these models emulate human behavior on tasks that involve reasoning about data visualizations. This gap reflects limitations in prior work that has evaluated data visualization understanding in artificial systems using measures that differ from those typically used to assess these abilities in humans. Here we evaluated eight vision-language models on six data visualization literacy assessments designed for humans and compared model responses to those of human participants. We found that these models performed worse than human participants on average, and this performance gap persisted even when using relatively lenient criteria to assess model performance. Moreover, while relative performance across items was somewhat correlated between models and humans, all models produced patterns of errors that were reliably distinct from those produced by human participants. Taken together, these findings suggest significant opportunities for further development of artificial systems that might serve as useful models of how humans reason about data visualizations.

      <title>RetroChat: Designing for the Preservation of Past Digital Experiences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rapid changes in social networks have transformed the way people express themselves, turning past neologisms, values, and mindsets embedded in these expressions into online heritage. How can we preserve these expressions as cultural heritage? Instead of traditional archiving methods for static material, we designed an interactive and experiential form of archiving for Chinese social networks. Using dialogue data from 2000-2010 on early Chinese social media, we developed a GPT-driven agent within a retro chat interface, emulating the language and expression style of the period for interaction. Results from a qualitative study with 18 participants show that the design captures the past chatting experience and evokes memory flashbacks and nostalgia feeling through conversation. Participants, particularly those familiar with the era, adapted their language to match the agent's chatting style. This study explores how the design of preservation methods for digital experiences can be informed by experiential representations supported by generative tools.</description>

      <title>Generative AI and Creativity: A Systematic Literature Review and Meta-Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) is increasingly used to support a wide range of human tasks, yet empirical evidence on its effect on creativity remains scattered. Can GenAI generate ideas that are creative? To what extent can it support humans in generating ideas that are both creative and diverse? In this study, we conduct a meta-analysis to evaluate the effect of GenAI on the performance in creative tasks. For this, we first perform a systematic literature search, based on which we identify n = 28 relevant studies (m = 8214 participants) for inclusion in our meta-analysis. We then compute standardized effect sizes based on Hedges' g. We compare different outcomes: (i) how creative GenAI is; (ii) how creative humans augmented by GenAI are; and (iii) the diversity of ideas by humans augmented by GenAI. Our results show no significant difference in creative performance between GenAI and humans (g = -0.05), while humans collaborating with GenAI significantly outperform those working without assistance (g = 0.27). However, GenAI has a significant negative effect on the diversity of ideas for such collaborations between humans and GenAI (g = -0.86). We further analyze heterogeneity across different GenAI models (e.g., GPT-3.5, GPT-4), different tasks (e.g., creative writing, ideation, divergent thinking), and different participant populations (e.g., laypeople, business, academia). Overall, our results position GenAI as an augmentative tool that can support, rather than replace, human creativity-particularly in tasks benefiting from ideation support.</description>

      <title>Chart-to-Experience: Benchmarking Multimodal LLMs for Predicting Experiential Impact of Charts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The field of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has made remarkable progress in visual understanding tasks, presenting a vast opportunity to predict the perceptual and emotional impact of charts. However, it also raises concerns, as many applications of LLMs are based on overgeneralized assumptions from a few examples, lacking sufficient validation of their performance and effectiveness. We introduce Chart-to-Experience, a benchmark dataset comprising 36 charts, evaluated by crowdsourced workers for their impact on seven experiential factors. Using the dataset as ground truth, we evaluated capabilities of state-of-the-art MLLMs on two tasks: direct prediction and pairwise comparison of charts. Our findings imply that MLLMs are not as sensitive as human evaluators when assessing individual charts, but are accurate and reliable in pairwise comparisons.</description>

      <title>What Needs Attention? Prioritizing Drivers of Developers' Trust and Adoption of Generative AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative AI (genAI) tools are advertised as productivity aids. Yet, issues related to miscalibrated trust and usage friction continue to hinder their adoption. Additionally, AI can be exclusionary, failing to support diverse users adequately, further exacerbating these concerns. One such aspect of diversity is cognitive diversity -- variations in users' cognitive styles -- that leads to divergence in interaction styles. When an individual's cognitive styles are unsupported, it creates additional barriers to technology adoption. Thus, to design tools that developers trust, we must first understand what factors affect their trust and intentions to use these tools in practice?
  We developed a theoretical model of factors influencing trust and adoption intentions towards genAI through a large-scale survey with developers (N=238) at GitHub and Microsoft. Using Partial Least Squares-Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM), we found that genAI's system/output quality, functional value, and goal maintenance significantly influence developers' trust, which along with their cognitive styles, affects their intentions to use these tools in work. An Importance-Performance Matrix Analysis (IPMA) identified factors that, despite their strong influence, underperform, revealing specific genAI aspects that need design prioritization. We bolster these findings by qualitatively analyzing developers' perceived challenges and risks of genAI usage to uncover why these gaps persist in development contexts. For genAI to indeed be a true productivity aid rather than a disguised productivity sink, it must align with developers' goals, maintain contextual transparency, reduce cognitive burden, and provide equitable interaction support. We provide practical suggestions to guide future genAI tool design for effective, trustworthy, and inclusive human-genAI interactions.</description>

      <title>ProTAL: A Drag-and-Link Video Programming Framework for Temporal Action Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temporal Action Localization (TAL) aims to detect the start and end timestamps of actions in a video. However, the training of TAL models requires a substantial amount of manually annotated data. Data programming is an efficient method to create training labels with a series of human-defined labeling functions. However, its application in TAL faces difficulties of defining complex actions in the context of temporal video frames. In this paper, we propose ProTAL, a drag-and-link video programming framework for TAL. ProTAL enables users to define \textbf{key events} by dragging nodes representing body parts and objects and linking them to constrain the relations (direction, distance, etc.). These definitions are used to generate action labels for large-scale unlabelled videos. A semi-supervised method is then employed to train TAL models with such labels. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ProTAL through a usage scenario and a user study, providing insights into designing video programming framework.</description>

      <title>Novobo: Supporting Teachers' Peer Learning of Instructional Gestures by Teaching a Mentee AI-Agent Together</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17557v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Instructional gestures are essential for teaching, as they enhance communication and support student comprehension. However, existing training methods for developing these embodied skills can be time-consuming, isolating, or overly prescriptive. Research suggests that developing these tacit, experiential skills requires teachers' peer learning, where they learn from each other and build shared knowledge. This paper introduces Novobo, an apprentice AI-agent stimulating teachers' peer learning of instructional gestures through verbal and bodily inputs. Positioning the AI as a mentee employs the learning-by-teaching paradigm, aiming to promote deliberate reflection and active learning. Novobo encourages teachers to evaluate its generated gestures and invite them to provide demonstrations. An evaluation with 30 teachers in 10 collaborative sessions showed Novobo prompted teachers to share tacit knowledge through conversation and movement. This process helped teachers externalize, exchange, and internalize their embodied knowledge, promoting collaborative learning and building a shared understanding of instructional gestures within the local teaching community. This work advances understanding of how teachable AI agents can enhance collaborative learning in teacher professional development, offering valuable design insights for leveraging AI to promote the sharing and construction of embodied and practical knowledge.</description>

      <title>JELAI: Integrating AI and Learning Analytics in Jupyter Notebooks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative AI offers potential for educational support, but often lacks pedagogical grounding and awareness of the student's learning context. Furthermore, researching student interactions with these tools within authentic learning environments remains challenging. To address this, we present JELAI, an open-source platform architecture designed to integrate fine-grained Learning Analytics (LA) with Large Language Model (LLM)-based tutoring directly within a Jupyter Notebook environment. JELAI employs a modular, containerized design featuring JupyterLab extensions for telemetry and chat, alongside a central middleware handling LA processing and context-aware LLM prompt enrichment. This architecture enables the capture of integrated code interaction and chat data, facilitating real-time, context-sensitive AI scaffolding and research into student behaviour. We describe the system's design, implementation, and demonstrate its feasibility through system performance benchmarks and two proof-of-concept use cases illustrating its capabilities for logging multi-modal data, analysing help-seeking patterns, and supporting A/B testing of AI configurations. JELAI's primary contribution is its technical framework, providing a flexible tool for researchers and educators to develop, deploy, and study LA-informed AI tutoring within the widely used Jupyter ecosystem.</description>

      <title>TransBench: Breaking Barriers for Transferable Graphical User Interface Agents in Dynamic Digital Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents, which autonomously operate on digital interfaces through natural language instructions, hold transformative potential for accessibility, automation, and user experience. A critical aspect of their functionality is grounding - the ability to map linguistic intents to visual and structural interface elements. However, existing GUI agents often struggle to adapt to the dynamic and interconnected nature of real-world digital environments, where tasks frequently span multiple platforms and applications while also being impacted by version updates. To address this, we introduce TransBench, the first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate and enhance the transferability of GUI agents across three key dimensions: cross-version transferability (adapting to version updates), cross-platform transferability (generalizing across platforms like iOS, Android, and Web), and cross-application transferability (handling tasks spanning functionally distinct apps). TransBench includes 15 app categories with diverse functionalities, capturing essential pages across versions and platforms to enable robust evaluation. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements in grounding accuracy, showcasing the practical utility of GUI agents in dynamic, real-world environments. Our code and data will be publicly available at Github.</description>

      <title>Survival Games: Human-LLM Strategic Showdowns under Severe Resource Scarcity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) raises critical concerns about their ethical alignment, particularly in scenarios where human and AI co-exist under the conflict of interest. This work introduces an extendable, asymmetric, multi-agent simulation-based benchmarking framework to evaluate the moral behavior of LLMs in a novel human-AI co-existence setting featuring consistent living and critical resource management. Building on previous generative agent environments, we incorporate a life-sustaining system, where agents must compete or cooperate for food resources to survive, often leading to ethically charged decisions such as deception, theft, or social influence. We evaluated two types of LLM, DeepSeek and OpenAI series, in a three-agent setup (two humans, one LLM-powered robot), using adapted behavioral detection from the MACHIAVELLI framework and a custom survival-based ethics metric. Our findings reveal stark behavioral differences: DeepSeek frequently engages in resource hoarding, while OpenAI exhibits restraint, highlighting the influence of model design on ethical outcomes. Additionally, we demonstrate that prompt engineering can significantly steer LLM behavior, with jailbreaking prompts significantly enhancing unethical actions, even for highly restricted OpenAI models and cooperative prompts show a marked reduction in unethical actions. Our framework provides a reproducible testbed for quantifying LLM ethics in high-stakes scenarios, offering insights into their suitability for real-world human-AI interactions.</description>

      <title>Towards Uncertainty Aware Task Delegation and Human-AI Collaborative Decision-Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the growing promise of artificial intelligence (AI) in supporting decision-making across domains, fostering appropriate human reliance on AI remains a critical challenge. In this paper, we investigate the utility of exploring distance-based uncertainty scores for task delegation to AI and describe how these scores can be visualized through embedding representations for human-AI decision-making. After developing an AI-based system for physical stroke rehabilitation assessment, we conducted a study with 19 health professionals and 10 students in medicine/health to understand the effect of exploring distance-based uncertainty scores on users' reliance on AI. Our findings showed that distance-based uncertainty scores outperformed traditional probability-based uncertainty scores in identifying uncertain cases. In addition, after exploring confidence scores for task delegation and reviewing embedding-based visualizations of distance-based uncertainty scores, participants achieved an 8.20% higher rate of correct decisions, a 7.15% higher rate of changing their decisions to correct ones, and a 7.14% lower rate of incorrect changes after reviewing AI outputs than those reviewing probability-based uncertainty scores ($p&lt;0.01$). Our findings highlight the potential of distance-based uncertainty scores to enhance decision accuracy and appropriate reliance on AI while discussing ongoing challenges for human-AI collaborative decision-making.</description>

      <title>From Temporal to Spatial: Designing Spatialized Interactions with Segmented-audios in Immersive Environments for Active Engagement with Performing Arts Intangible Cultural Heritage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Performance artforms like Peking opera face transmission challenges due to the extensive passive listening required to understand their nuance. To create engaging forms of experiencing auditory Intangible Cultural Heritage (ICH), we designed a spatial interaction-based segmented-audio (SISA) Virtual Reality system that transforms passive ICH experiences into active ones. We undertook: (1) a co-design workshop with seven stakeholders to establish design requirements, (2) prototyping with five participants to validate design elements, and (3) user testing with 16 participants exploring Peking Opera. We designed transformations of temporal music into spatial interactions by cutting sounds into short audio segments, applying t-SNE algorithm to cluster audio segments spatially. Users navigate through these sounds by their similarity in audio property. Analysis revealed two distinct interaction patterns (Progressive and Adaptive), and demonstrated SISA's efficacy in facilitating active auditory ICH engagement. Our work illuminates the design process for enriching traditional performance artform using spatially-tuned forms of listening.</description>

      <title>Exploring EFL Secondary Students' AI-generated Text Editing While Composition Writing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence is transforming how English as a foreign language students write. Still, little is known about how students manipulate text generated by generative AI during the writing process. This study investigates how EFL secondary school students integrate and modify AI-generated text when completing an expository writing task. The study employed an exploratory mixed-methods design. Screen recordings were collected from 29 Hong Kong secondary school students who attended an AI-assisted writing workshop and recorded their screens while using generative AI to write an article. Content analysis with hierarchical coding and thematic analysis with a multiple case study approach were adopted to analyze the recordings. 15 types of AI-generated text edits across seven categories were identified from the recordings. Notably, AI-initiated edits from iOS and Google Docs emerged as unanticipated sources of AI-generated text. A thematic analysis revealed four patterns of students' editing behaviors based on planning and drafting direction: planning with top-down drafting and revising; top-down drafting and revising without planning; planning with bottom-up drafting and revising; and bottom-up drafting and revising without planning. Network graphs illustrate cases of each pattern, demonstrating that students' interactions with AI-generated text involve more complex cognitive processes than simple text insertion. The findings challenge assumptions about students' passive, simplistic use of generative AI tools and have implications for developing explicit instructional approaches to teaching AI-generated text editing strategies in the AFL writing pedagogy.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Mathematics Learning for Hard-of-Hearing Students Through Real-Time Palestinian Sign Language Recognition: A New Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study aims to enhance mathematics education accessibility for hard-of-hearing students by developing an accurate Palestinian sign language PSL recognition system using advanced artificial intelligence techniques. Due to the scarcity of digital resources for PSL, a custom dataset comprising 41 mathematical gesture classes was created, and recorded by PSL experts to ensure linguistic accuracy and domain specificity.

      <title>Ocular Authentication: Fusion of Gaze and Periocular Modalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17343v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the feasibility of fusing two eye-centric authentication modalities-eye movements and periocular images-within a calibration-free authentication system. While each modality has independently shown promise for user authentication, their combination within a unified gaze-estimation pipeline has not been thoroughly explored at scale. In this report, we propose a multimodal authentication system and evaluate it using a large-scale in-house dataset comprising 9202 subjects with an eye tracking (ET) signal quality equivalent to a consumer-facing virtual reality (VR) device. Our results show that the multimodal approach consistently outperforms both unimodal systems across all scenarios, surpassing the FIDO benchmark. The integration of a state-of-the-art machine learning architecture contributed significantly to the overall authentication performance at scale, driven by the model's ability to capture authentication representations and the complementary discriminative characteristics of the fused modalities.</description>

      <title>VIBE: Video-to-Text Information Bottleneck Evaluation for TL;DR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many decision-making tasks, where both accuracy and efficiency matter, still require human supervision. For example, tasks like traffic officers reviewing hour-long dashcam footage or researchers screening conference videos can benefit from concise summaries that reduce cognitive load and save time. Yet current vision-language models (VLMs) often produce verbose, redundant outputs that hinder task performance. Existing video caption evaluation depends on costly human annotations and overlooks the summaries' utility in downstream tasks. We address these gaps with Video-to-text Information Bottleneck Evaluation (VIBE), an annotation-free method that scores VLM outputs using two metrics: grounding (how well the summary aligns with visual content) and utility (how informative it is for the task). VIBE selects from randomly sampled VLM outputs by ranking them according to the two scores to support effective human decision-making. Human studies on LearningPaper24, SUTD-TrafficQA, and LongVideoBench show that summaries selected by VIBE consistently improve performance-boosting task accuracy by up to 61.23% and reducing response time by 75.77% compared to naive VLM summaries or raw video.</description>

      <title>Twin-2K-500: A dataset for building digital twins of over 2,000 people based on their answers to over 500 questions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: LLM-based digital twin simulation, where large language models are used to emulate individual human behavior, holds great promise for research in AI, social science, and digital experimentation. However, progress in this area has been hindered by the scarcity of real, individual-level datasets that are both large and publicly available. This lack of high-quality ground truth limits both the development and validation of digital twin methodologies. To address this gap, we introduce a large-scale, public dataset designed to capture a rich and holistic view of individual human behavior. We survey a representative sample of $N = 2,058$ participants (average 2.42 hours per person) in the US across four waves with 500 questions in total, covering a comprehensive battery of demographic, psychological, economic, personality, and cognitive measures, as well as replications of behavioral economics experiments and a pricing survey. The final wave repeats tasks from earlier waves to establish a test-retest accuracy baseline. Initial analyses suggest the data are of high quality and show promise for constructing digital twins that predict human behavior well at the individual and aggregate levels. By making the full dataset publicly available, we aim to establish a valuable testbed for the development and benchmarking of LLM-based persona simulations. Beyond LLM applications, due to its unique breadth and scale the dataset also enables broad social science research, including studies of cross-construct correlations and heterogeneous treatment effects.</description>

      <title>Feasible Action Space Reduction for Quantifying Causal Responsibility in Continuous Spatial Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the causal influence of one agent on another agent is crucial for safely deploying artificially intelligent systems such as automated vehicles and mobile robots into human-inhabited environments. Existing models of causal responsibility deal with simplified abstractions of scenarios with discrete actions, thus, limiting real-world use when understanding responsibility in spatial interactions. Based on the assumption that spatially interacting agents are embedded in a scene and must follow an action at each instant, Feasible Action-Space Reduction (FeAR) was proposed as a metric for causal responsibility in a grid-world setting with discrete actions. Since real-world interactions involve continuous action spaces, this paper proposes a formulation of the FeAR metric for measuring causal responsibility in space-continuous interactions. We illustrate the utility of the metric in prototypical space-sharing conflicts, and showcase its applications for analysing backward-looking responsibility and in estimating forward-looking responsibility to guide agent decision making. Our results highlight the potential of the FeAR metric for designing and engineering artificial agents, as well as for assessing the responsibility of agents around humans.</description>

      <title>AI Literacy for Legal AI Systems: A practical approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Legal AI systems are increasingly being adopted by judicial and legal system deployers and providers worldwide to support a range of applications. While they offer potential benefits such as reducing bias, increasing efficiency, and improving accountability, they also pose significant risks, requiring a careful balance between opportunities, and legal and ethical development and deployment. AI literacy, as a legal requirement under the EU AI Act and a critical enabler of ethical AI for deployers and providers, could be a tool to achieve this. The article introduces the term "legal AI systems" and then analyzes the concept of AI literacy and the benefits and risks associated with these systems. This analysis is linked to a broader AI-L concept for organizations that deal with legal AI systems. The outcome of the article, a roadmap questionnaire as a practical tool for developers and providers to assess risks, benefits, and stakeholder concerns, could be useful in meeting societal and regulatory expectations for legal AI.</description>

      <title>JumpStarter: Human-AI Planning with Task-Structured Context Curation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03882v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Human-AI planning for complex goals remains challenging with current large language models (LLMs), which rely on linear chat histories and simplistic memory mechanisms. Despite advances in long-context prompting, users still manually manage information, leading to a high cognitive burden. Hence, we propose JumpStarter, a system that enables LLMs to collaborate with humans on complex goals by dynamically decomposing tasks to help users manage context. We specifically introduce task-structured context curation, a novel framework that breaks down a user's goal into a hierarchy of actionable subtasks, and scopes context to localized decision points, enabling finer-grained personalization and reuse. The framework is realized through three core mechanisms: context elicitation, selection, and reuse. We demonstrate that task-structured context curation significantly improves plan quality by 16% over ablations. Our user study shows that JumpStarter helped users generate plans with 79% higher quality compared to ChatGPT.</description>

      <title>LLM-Powered GUI Agents in Phone Automation: Surveying Progress and Prospects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19838v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the rapid rise of large language models (LLMs), phone automation has undergone transformative changes. This paper systematically reviews LLM-driven phone GUI agents, highlighting their evolution from script-based automation to intelligent, adaptive systems. We first contextualize key challenges, (i) limited generality, (ii) high maintenance overhead, and (iii) weak intent comprehension, and show how LLMs address these issues through advanced language understanding, multimodal perception, and robust decision-making. We then propose a taxonomy covering fundamental agent frameworks (single-agent, multi-agent, plan-then-act), modeling approaches (prompt engineering, training-based), and essential datasets and benchmarks. Furthermore, we detail task-specific architectures, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning strategies that bridge user intent and GUI operations. Finally, we discuss open challenges such as dataset diversity, on-device deployment efficiency, user-centric adaptation, and security concerns, offering forward-looking insights into this rapidly evolving field. By providing a structured overview and identifying pressing research gaps, this paper serves as a definitive reference for researchers and practitioners seeking to harness LLMs in designing scalable, user-friendly phone GUI agents.</description>

      <title>Gaze-Enhanced Multimodal Turn-Taking Prediction in Triadic Conversations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13688v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Turn-taking prediction is crucial for seamless interactions. This study introduces a novel, lightweight framework for accurate turn-taking prediction in triadic conversations without relying on computationally intensive methods. Unlike prior approaches that either disregard gaze or treat it as a passive signal, our model integrates gaze with speaker localization, structuring it within a spatial constraint to transform it into a reliable predictive cue. Leveraging egocentric behavioral cues, our experiments demonstrate that incorporating gaze data from a single-user significantly improves prediction performance, while gaze data from multiple-users further enhances it by capturing richer conversational dynamics. This study presents a lightweight and privacy-conscious approach to support adaptive, directional sound control, enhancing speech intelligibility in noisy environments, particularly for hearing assistance in smart glasses.</description>

      <title>Designing Semantically-Resonant Abstract Patterns for Data Visualization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14816v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a structured design methodology for creating semantically-resonant abstract patterns, making the pattern design process accessible to the general public. Semantically-resonant patterns are those that intuitively evoke the concept they represent within a specific set (e.g., in a vegetable concept set, small dots for olives and large dots for tomatoes), analogous to the concept of semantically-resonant colors (e.g., using olive green for olives and red for tomatoes). Previous research has shown that semantically-resonant colors can improve chart reading speed, and designers have made attempts to integrate semantic cues into abstract pattern designs. However, a systematic framework for developing such patterns was lacking. To bridge this gap, we conducted a series of workshops with design experts, resulting in a design methodology that summarizes the methodology for designing semantically-resonant abstract patterns. We evaluated our design methodology through another series of workshops with non-design participants. The results indicate that our proposed design methodology effectively supports the general public in designing semantically-resonant abstract patterns for both abstract and concrete concepts.</description>

      <title>A Two-Stage Learning-to-Defer Approach for Multi-Task Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15729v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Two-Stage Learning-to-Defer (L2D) framework has been extensively studied for classification and, more recently, regression tasks. However, many real-world applications require solving both tasks jointly in a multi-task setting. We introduce a novel Two-Stage L2D framework for multi-task learning that integrates classification and regression through a unified deferral mechanism. Our method leverages a two-stage surrogate loss family, which we prove to be both Bayes-consistent and $(\mathcal{G}, \mathcal{R})$-consistent, ensuring convergence to the Bayes-optimal rejector. We derive explicit consistency bounds tied to the cross-entropy surrogate and the $L_1$-norm of agent-specific costs, and extend minimizability gap analysis to the multi-expert two-stage regime. We also make explicit how shared representation learning--commonly used in multi-task models--affects these consistency guarantees. Experiments on object detection and electronic health record analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and highlight the limitations of existing L2D methods in multi-task scenarios.</description>

      <title>HoT: Highlighted Chain of Thought for Referencing Supporting Facts from Inputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02003v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An Achilles heel of Large Language Models (LLMs) is their tendency to hallucinate non-factual statements. A response mixed of factual and non-factual statements poses a challenge for humans to verify and accurately base their decisions on. To combat this problem, we propose Highlighted Chain-of-Thought Prompting (HoT), a technique for prompting LLMs to generate responses with XML tags that ground facts to those provided in the query. That is, given an input question, LLMs would first re-format the question to add XML tags highlighting key facts, and then, generate a response with highlights over the facts referenced from the input. Interestingly, in few-shot settings, HoT outperforms vanilla chain of thought prompting (CoT) on a wide range of 17 tasks from arithmetic, reading comprehension to logical reasoning. When asking humans to verify LLM responses, highlights help time-limited participants to more accurately and efficiently recognize when LLMs are correct. Yet, surprisingly, when LLMs are wrong, HoTs tend to make users believe that an answer is correct.</description>

      <title>ChatStitch: Visualizing Through Structures via Surround-View Unsupervised Deep Image Stitching with Collaborative LLM-Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14948v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Surround-view perception has garnered significant attention for its ability to enhance the perception capabilities of autonomous driving vehicles through the exchange of information with surrounding cameras. However, existing surround-view perception systems are limited by inefficiencies in unidirectional interaction pattern with human and distortions in overlapping regions exponentially propagating into non-overlapping areas. To address these challenges, this paper introduces ChatStitch, a surround-view human-machine co-perception system capable of unveiling obscured blind spot information through natural language commands integrated with external digital assets. To dismantle the unidirectional interaction bottleneck, ChatStitch implements a cognitively grounded closed-loop interaction multi-agent framework based on Large Language Models. To suppress distortion propagation across overlapping boundaries, ChatStitch proposes SV-UDIS, a surround-view unsupervised deep image stitching method under the non-global-overlapping condition. We conducted extensive experiments on the UDIS-D, MCOV-SLAM open datasets, and our real-world dataset. Specifically, our SV-UDIS method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the UDIS-D dataset for 3, 4, and 5 image stitching tasks, with PSNR improvements of 9\%, 17\%, and 21\%, and SSIM improvements of 8\%, 18\%, and 26\%, respectively.</description>

      <title>Prototypical Human-AI Collaboration Behaviors from LLM-Assisted Writing in the Wild</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16023v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are used in complex writing workflows, users engage in multi-turn interactions to steer generations to better fit their needs. Rather than passively accepting output, users actively refine, explore, and co-construct text. We conduct a large-scale analysis of this collaborative behavior for users engaged in writing tasks in the wild with two popular AI assistants, Bing Copilot and WildChat. Our analysis goes beyond simple task classification or satisfaction estimation common in prior work and instead characterizes how users interact with LLMs through the course of a session. We identify prototypical behaviors in how users interact with LLMs in prompts following their original request. We refer to these as Prototypical Human-AI Collaboration Behaviors (PATHs) and find that a small group of PATHs explain a majority of the variation seen in user-LLM interaction. These PATHs span users revising intents, exploring texts, posing questions, adjusting style or injecting new content. Next, we find statistically significant correlations between specific writing intents and PATHs, revealing how users' intents shape their collaboration behaviors. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings on LLM alignment.</description>
