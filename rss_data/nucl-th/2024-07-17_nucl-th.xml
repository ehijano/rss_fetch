      <title>Multipole responses in fissioning nuclei and their uncertainties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electromagnetic multipole responses are key inputs to model the structure, decay and reaction of atomic nuclei. With the introduction of the finite amplitude method (FAM), large-scale calculations of the nuclear linear response in heavy deformed nuclei have become possible. This work provides a detailed study of multipole responses in actinide nuclei with Skyrme energy density functionals. We quantify both systematic and statistical uncertainties induced by the functional parameterization in FAM calculations. We also extend the FAM formalism to perform blocking calculations with the equal filling approximation for odd-mass and odd-odd nuclei, and analyze the impact of blocking configurations on the response. By examining the entire plutonium isotopic chain from the proton to the neutron dripline, we find a large variability of the response with the neutron number and study how it correlates with the deformation of the nuclear ground state.</description>

      <title>Spin entanglement in two-proton emission from $^6$Be</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an evaluation of coupled-spin entanglement in the two-proton ($2p$) radioactive emission. The three-body model of $^{6}$Be with the proton-proton interaction, which is adjusted to reproduce the experimental energy release, is utilized. Time-dependent calculation is performed to compute the coupled-spin state of the emitted two protons. The spin-correlation function $S$ as Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) indicator is obtained as $\abs{S} \cong 2.72$. Namely, the $2p$-spin entanglement beyond the limit of local-hidden-variable (LHV) theory is concluded. This entanglement is sensitive to the proton-proton interaction. The short-lived (broad-width) $2p$~state has the weaker spin entanglement. In parallel, the core-proton interactions do not harm this entanglement during the time-dependent decaying process. The CHSH measurement can be a probe into the effective nuclear interaction inside finite systems.</description>

      <title>Neutron stars and the dense matter equation of state: from microscopic theory to macroscopic observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The past years have witnessed tremendous progress in understanding the properties of neutron stars and of the dense matter in their cores, made possible by electromagnetic observations of neutron stars and the detection of gravitational waves from their mergers. These observations provided novel constraints on neutron-star structure, that is intimately related to the properties of dense neutron-rich matter described by the nuclear equation of state. Nevertheless, constraining the equation of state over the wide range of densities probed by astrophysical observations is still challenging, as the physics involved is very broad and the system spans many orders of magnitude in densities. Here, we review theoretical approaches to calculate and model the neutron-star equation of state in various regimes of densities, and discuss the related consequent properties of neutron stars. We describe how the equation of state can be calculated from nuclear interactions that are constrained and benchmarked by nuclear experiments. We review neutron-star observations, with particular emphasis on information provided by gravitational-wave signals and electromagnetic observations. Finally, we discuss future challenges and opportunities in the field.</description>

      <title>Proton drip line of deformed hypernuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proton drip line of (hyper)nuclei is examined within the framework of the deformed Skyrme-Hartree Fock approach by adjusting the nuclear force parameters to exactly reproduce the core binding energies. The impact of adding a {\Lambda} hyperon in a s or p state is studied, and it is found that in some cases the deformation effect facilitates the extension of the drip line by an added p-state hyperon. However, no extension of the drip line is found for s-state hypernuclei.</description>

      <title>The first-order phase transition in the neutron star from the deep neural network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the first-order phase transition within neutron stars, leveraging the deep neural network (DNN) framework alongside contemporary astronomical measurements. The equation of state (EOS) for neutron stars is delineated in a piecewise polytropic form, with the speed of sound ($c_s$) serving as a pivotal determinant. In the phase transition region, $c_s$ is presumed to be zero, while in other intervals, it is optimized utilizing the DNN. Various onset energy densities of phase transition ($\varepsilon_{pt}$), spanning from $2\varepsilon_0$ to $3\varepsilon_0$ (where $\varepsilon_0$ denotes the energy density at nuclear saturation density), as well as phase transition widths ($\Delta\varepsilon$) ranging from $0.5\varepsilon_0$ to $\varepsilon_0$, are examined. Our findings underscore that smaller values of $\varepsilon_{pt}$ lead to a more substantial impact of $\Delta\varepsilon$ on neutron star properties, encompassing maximum mass, corresponding radius, tidal deformability, phase transition mass, and trace anomaly. Conversely, when $\varepsilon_{pt}$ exceeds $2.5\varepsilon_0$, the influence of $\Delta\varepsilon$ diminishes, resulting in a stiffer EOS compared to scenarios lacking a phase transition. Furthermore, the trace anomaly at high density shifts to negative values upon the commencement of the phase transition. It is noteworthy that the correlations between the average speed of sound at different energy density segments demonstrate a notably weak connection. The discernment of whether a phase transition has occurred with the present observables of neutron stars poses a challenging task.</description>

      <title>New physical processes for extracting GPDs with a better sensitivity to partonic structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new type of exclusive processes for a better study of generalized parton distributions (GPDs), which we refer to as single-diffractive hard exclusive processes (SDHEPs). We advocate a two-stage framework for picturing SDHEPs based on the separation of scales, which gives a clear description both kinematically and dynamically. We examine the sensitivity of the SDHEP to the parton momentum fraction $x$-dependence of GPDs, and demonstrate it quantitatively with two specific processes that can be readily measured at J-PARC or AMBER using a pion beam and at JLab using a photon beam, respectively. Both processes are capable of providing enhanced sensitivity to the $x$-dependence, overcoming the problem of shadow GPDs, and disentangling different types of GPDs with various spin asymmetries.</description>

      <title>Reexamining charm versus bottom quark energy loss inside a color-deconfined medium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.14808v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The general intuition that heavier partons suffer weaker energy loss inside a quark-gluon plasma (QGP) medium is critically re-examined. Within a linear Boltzmann transport model that includes both Yukawa and string types of interactions between heavy quarks and the QGP, we find that while the radiative energy loss is suppressed by the parton mass, heavier partons can experience stronger string potential scatterings with the medium. Their competition may result in less energy loss of bottom quarks than charm quarks at low transverse momentum ($p_\mathrm{T}$) but an inverse order at high $p_\mathrm{T}$. Our model calculation shows a weaker nuclear modification on bottom particles than charm particles at low $p_\mathrm{T}$, as observed by both RHIC and LHC experiments, but predicts an opposite hierarchy at high $p_\mathrm{T}$. A larger momentum space transport coefficient ($\hat{q}$) and a smaller spatial diffusion coefficient ($D_\mathrm{s}$) are found for bottom quarks than for charm quarks.</description>

      <title>Uncovering the mechanism of chiral three-nucleon force in driving spin-orbit splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02007v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The three-nucleon force (3NF) is crucial in shaping the shell structure of atomic nuclei, particularly impacting the enhancement of spin-orbit (SO) splitting, especially in nuclei with significant deviations from stability. Despite its importance, the specific mechanisms driving this enhancement remain unclear. In this study, we introduce a decomposition scheme based on the rank of irreducible tensors forming the 3NF, derived from chiral effective field theory at next-to-next-to-leading order, to elucidate their influence on SO splitting. Within the shell-model framework, our analysis reveals that the rank-1 component of the 3NF is the primary factor enlarging the energy gap between the $0p_{3/2}$ and $0p_{1/2}$ single-particle levels in $p$-shell nuclei, while the rank-2 component makes a subdominant contribution. Since the rank-1 component originates exclusively from the $2\pi$-exchange 3NF, our finding will not depend on the choice of the low-energy constants of contact terms. We also remark on the antisymmetry of the rank-1 3NF, which can affect the quantum entanglement of spin states. This study lays the groundwork for further exploration into this field toward a microscopic understanding of the 3NF impact on the nuclear shell structure.</description>

Abstract: The calculation of nuclear electromagnetic sum rules by directly diagonalizing the nuclear Hamiltonian in a large basis is numerically challenging and has not been performed for $A&gt;2$ nuclei. With the significant progress of high performance computing, we show that calculating sum rules using numerous discretized continuum states obtained by directly diagonalizing the ab initio no-core shell model Hamiltonian is achievable numerically. Specifically, we calculate the $^{4}$He electric dipole ($E1$) polarizability, that is an inverse energy weighted sum rule, employing the Daejeon16 $NN$ interaction. We demonstrate that the calculations are numerically tractable as the dimension of the basis increases and are convergent. Our results for the $^{4}$He electric dipole polarizability are consistent with the most recent experimental data and are compared with those of other theoretical studies employing different techniques and various interactions.</description>

      <title>Electron scattering cross sections for 6,7Li and 7Be nuclei within the unified electroweak theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06407v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present study employs the multipole expansion within the unified electroweak theory to investigate the electron scattering cross sections for 6,7Li and 7Be nuclei. The multipole form factors presented in the expressions of the cross sections are directly calculated based on the many-particle shell model and fractional parentage coefficients without using any approximations. The results obtained indicate that the conventional impulse approximation can be applied to the electron-nucleus scattering only when the energy of incident electrons does not exceed twice the nucleon mass. In addition, the quasi-elastic scattering cross section of 7Li in the excitation from its ground state to the nearest excited state and that of elastic scattering in the ground state are independently treated, whereas they have not been separately measured in experiments. The calculated scattering cross sections using the V-A structure agree reasonably well with the available experimental data at low (MeV) energies and provide predictive information at high (GeV) energies. The scattering cross sections are found to rapidly decrease in all cases with increasing the incident electron energy and scattering angle. In particular, at the energies of hundreds of GeV and higher, there are only the forward scattering processes. Furthermore, by comparing the elastic cross sections of three investigated nuclei at a certain energy and scattering angle, the rule that the nuclear size is proportional to the number of nucleons is clearly shown.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic neutron star crust, solar system mountains, and gravitational waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.04855v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: "Mountains" or non-axisymmetric deformations of rotating neutron stars (NS) efficiently radiate gravitational waves (GW). We consider analogies between NS mountains and surface features of solar system bodies. Both NS and moons such as Europa or Enceladus have thin crusts over deep oceans while Mercury has a thin crust over a large metallic core. Thin sheets may wrinkle in universal ways. Europa has linear features, Enceladus has "Tiger" stripes, and Mercury has lobate scarps. NS may have analogous features. The innermost inner core of the Earth is anisotropic with a shear modulus that depends on direction. If NS crust material is also anisotropic this will produce an ellipticity, when the crust is stressed, that grows with spin frequency. This yields a braking index (log derivative of spin down rate assuming only GW spin down) very different from $n=5$ and could explain the maximum spin observed for neutron stars and a possible minimum ellipticity of millisecond pulsars.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.00447v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the jet quenching parameter $\hat q$ in a non-equilibrium plasma using the QCD effective kinetic theory. We discuss subleading terms at large jet momentum p, show that our expression for $\hat q$ reproduces thermal results at small and large transverse momentum cutoffs for infinite p and construct an interpolation between these limits to be used in phenomenological applications. Using simple non-equilibrium distributions that model pertinent features of the bottom-up thermalization scenario, we analytically assess how anisotropy, under- or overoccupation affect the jet quenching parameter. Our work provides more details on the $\hat q$ formula used in our preceding work [arXiv:2303.12595] and sets the stage for further numerical studies of jet momentum broadening in the initial stages of heavy-ion collisions from QCD kinetic theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17298v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Employing the neural network framework, we obtain empirical fits to the electron-scattering cross sections for carbon over a broad kinematic region, extending from the quasielastic peak through resonance excitation to the onset of deep-inelastic scattering. We consider two different methods of obtaining such model-independent parametrizations and the corresponding uncertainties: based on the bootstrap approach and the Monte Carlo dropout approach. In our analysis, the $\chi^2$ defines the loss function, including point-to-point and normalization uncertainties for each independent set of measurements. Our statistical approaches lead to fits of comparable quality and similar uncertainties of the order of $7$%. To test these models, we compare their predictions to test datasets excluded from the training process and theoretical predictions obtained within the spectral function approach. The predictions of both models agree with experimental measurements and theoretical calculations. We also perform a comparison to a dataset lying beyond the covered kinematic region, and find that the bootstrap approach shows better interpolation and extrapolation abilities than the one based on the dropout algorithm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06095v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using a symmetry-preserving formulation of a vector$\,\times\,$vector contact interaction (SCI) and treating the proton as a quark + interacting-diquark bound state, whose structure is obtained by solving a Poincar\'e-covariant Faddeev equation, we provide a comprehensive, coherent set of predictions for unpolarised and polarised proton parton distribution functions (DFs): valence, glue, and four-flavour separated sea. The results enable many themes to be addressed, including: the asymmetry of antimatter in the proton; the neutron:proton structure function ratio; helicity retention in hard scattering processes; the charm quark momentum fraction; the sign and size of the polarised gluon DF; and the origin of the proton spin. In all cases where sound analyses of data are available, SCI predictions are semiquantitatively in agreement with the results. Those mismatches which exist are typically attributable to the momentum-independence of the underlying interaction. Judiciously interpreted, the SCI delivers a sound and insightful explanation of proton structure as expressed in DFs.</description>

      <title>Qu8its for Quantum Simulations of Lattice Quantum Chromodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14537v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the utility of $d=8$ qudits, qu8its, for quantum simulations of the dynamics of 1+1D SU(3) lattice quantum chromodynamics, including a mapping for arbitrary numbers of flavors and lattice size and a re-organization of the Hamiltonian for efficient time-evolution. Recent advances in parallel gate applications, along with the shorter application times of single-qudit operations compared with two-qudit operations, lead to significant projected advantages in quantum simulation fidelities and circuit depths using qu8its rather than qubits. The number of two-qudit entangling gates required for time evolution using qu8its is found to be more than a factor of five fewer than for qubits.

Abstract: Thermal properties of quantum fields at finite temperature are crucial to understanding strongly interacting matter and recent development in quantum computing has provided an alternative and promising avenue of study. In this work, we study thermal field theories involving only fermions using quantum algorithms. We first delve into the presentations of fermion fields via qubits on digital quantum computers alongside the quantum algorithms such as quantum imaginary time evolutions employed to evaluate thermal properties of generic quantum field theories. Specifically, we show numerical results such as the thermal distribution and the energy density of thermal field theories for Majorana fermions in 1+1 dimensions using quantum simulators. In addition to free field theory, we also study the effects of interactions resulting from coupling with a spatially homogeneous Majorana field. In both cases, we show analytically that thermal properties of the system can be described using phase-space distributions, and the quantum simulation results agree with analytical and semiclassical expectations. Our work is an important step to understand thermal fixed points, preparing for quantum simulation of thermalization in real time.</description>

      <title>$U_A(1)$ symmetry breaking quark interactions from vacuum polarization</title>

Abstract: By considering the one loop background field method for a quark-antiquark interaction, mediated by one (non perturbative) gluon exchange, sixth order quark effective interactions are derived and investigated in the limit of zero momentum transfer for large quark and/or gluon effective masses. They extend fourth order quark interactions worked out in previous works of the author. These interactions break $U_A(1)$ symmetry and may be either momentum independent or dependent. Part of these interactions vanish in the limit of massless quarks, and several other -- involving vector and/or axial quark currents -- survive. In the local limit of the resulting interactions, some phenomenological implications are presented, which correspond to corrections to the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model.By means of the auxiliary field method, the local interactions give rise to three meson interactions whose values are compared to phenomenological values found in the literature. Contributions for meson-mixing parameters are calculated and compared to available results.</description>

      <title>Solar Models and Astrophysical S-factors Constrained by Helioseismic Results and Updated Neutrino Fluxes</title>

Abstract: The ratio of metal abundance to hydrogen abundance of the solar photosphere, $(Z/X)_{s}$, has been revised several times. Standard solar models, based on these revised solar abundances, are in disagreement with seismically inferred results. Recently, Magg et al. introduced a new value for $(Z/X)_{s}$, which is still in debate in the community. The solar abundance problem or solar modeling problem remains a topic of ongoing debate. We constructed rotating solar models in accordance with various abundance scales where the effects of convection overshoot and enhanced diffusion were included. Among these models, those utilizing Magg's abundance scale exhibit superior sound-speed and density profiles compared to models using other abundance scales. Additionally, they reproduce the observed frequency separation ratios $r_{02}$ and $r_{13}$. These models also match the seismically inferred surface helium abundance and convection zone depth within $1\sigma$ level. Furthermore, the calculated neutrino fluxes from these models agree with detected ones at the level of $1\sigma$. We found that neutrino fluxes and density profile are influenced by nuclear reactions, allowing us to use the combination of detected neutrino fluxes and seismically inferred density for diagnosing astrophysical $S$-factors. This diagnostic approach shows that $S_{11}$ may be underestimated by $2\%$, while $S_{33}$ may be overestimated by about $3\%$ in previous determinations. The $S$-factors favored by updated neutrino fluxes and helioseismic results can lead to significant improvements in solar models.</description>
