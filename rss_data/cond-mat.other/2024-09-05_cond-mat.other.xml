      <title>Multifractaility, topology and anomalous Hall conductivity on a 30 degrees twisted bilayer honeycomb lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider $30^{\circ}$ twisted bilayer formed by two copies of Haldane model and explore evolution of its properties with varying interlayer coupling strength. Specifically, we compute the system's energy spectrum, its fractal dimensions, topological entanglement entropy, local Chern markers and anomalous Hall conductivity. We find that at weak interlayer coupling, the system remains gapped and retains topological properties of the isolated layers, but at strong interlayer coupling, the system forms a gapless multifractal state. We also establish that anomalous Hall conductivity can be used to characterize the system's topological properties in the same way as a local Chern marker.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent approach to the dynamics of excitation energy transfer in multichromophoric systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computationally tractable and reliable, albeit approximate, methods for studying exciton transport in molecular aggregates immersed in structured bosonic environments have been actively developed. Going beyond the lowest-order (Born) approximation for the memory kernel of the generalized quantum master equation typically results in complicated and possibly divergent expressions. Starting from the memory kernel in the Born approximation, and recognizing the quantum master equation as the Dyson equation of the Green's functions theory, we formulate the self-consistent Born approximation to resum the memory-kernel perturbation series in powers of the exciton-environment interaction. Our formulation is in the Liouville space and frequency domain, and handles arbitrary exciton-environment spectral densities. In a molecular dimer coupled to an overdamped oscillator environment, we conclude that the self-consistent cycle significantly improves the Born-approximation energy-transfer dynamics. The dynamics in the self-consistent Born approximation agree well with solutions of hierarchical equations of motion over a wide range of parameters, including the most challenging regimes of strong exciton-environment interactions, slow environments, and low temperatures. This is rationalized by analytical considerations of coherence-dephasing dynamics in the pure-dephasing model. We find that the self-consistent Born approximation is good (poor) at describing energy transfer modulated by an underdamped vibration resonant (off-resonant) with the exciton energy gap. Nevertheless, it reasonably describes exciton dynamics in the seven-site model of the Fenna-Matthews-Olson complex in a realistic environment comprising both an overdamped continuum and underdamped vibrations.</description>

      <title>Radiation-induced dynamical formation of Floquet-Bloch bands in Dirac Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00285v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent experiments, combing ultrafast strong-field irradiation of surfaces with time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, allow for monitoring the time-dependent charge carrier dynamics and the build-up of transient sidebands due to the radiation pulses. While these structures are reminiscent of Floquet-Bloch bands, standard Floquet theory is not applicable since it requires a strictly time-periodic driving field. To study the emergence and formation of such sidebands, i.e. to provide a link between common Floquet physics and dynamical mechanisms underlying short driving pulses, we consider a generalization of Floquet theory, the so-called $t-t^{\prime}$ formalism. This approach naturally extents Floquet theory to driving field amplitudes with a superimposed envelope shape. Motivated by experiments we study 2D Dirac Hamiltonians subject to linearly and circularly polarised light waves with a Gaussian field envelope of a few cycles. For these Floquet-Bloch Hamiltonians we study the evolution of their Floquet-Bloch spectra, accompanied by a systematic analysis of the time-dependent (sideband) transitions. We show that sideband occupation requires circularly polarized light for linear Dirac systems such as graphene, while for Dirac models with trigonal warping, describing surface states of topological insulators such as Bi$_2$ Se$_3$, both linearly and circularly polarised pulses induce sideband excitations.</description>
