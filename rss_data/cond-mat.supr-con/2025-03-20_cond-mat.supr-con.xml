      <title>Superconducting nonlinear Hall effect induced by geometric phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the nonlinear Hall effect in superconductors without magnetic fields induced by a quantum geometric phase (i.e., the Aharonov-Bohm phase) carried by single or pair particles. We find that the second-order nonlinear Hall conductivity diverges in the dc limit in a robust way against dissipation when the system is superconducting, suggesting that the supercurrent flows perpendicular to the direction of the applied electric field. This superconducting nonlinear Hall effect (SNHE) is demonstrated for the Haldane model with attractive interaction and its variant with pair hoppings. In the Ginzburg-Landau theory, the SNHE can be understood as those arising from a higher-order Lifshitz invariant, that is, a symmetry invariant constructed from order parameters that contains an odd number of spatial derivatives. We perform real-time simulations including the effect of collective modes for the models driven by a multi-cycle pulse, and show that the SNHE leads to large rectification of the Hall current under light driving.</description>

      <title>Interaction tuned pattern-selective superconductivity: Application to the dodecagonal quasicrystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasicrystals exhibit superconductivity under the unique interplay of long-range order and strong inhomogeneity, distinguishing them from both crystalline and amorphous systems. Understanding how this structural complexity affects superconducting states and phase transitions remains an important open question. Here, we unveil anomalous superconductivity in a dodecagonal quasicrystal using the attractive Hubbard model within the Bogoliubov-de Gennes framework. We show that both the gap structure and critical temperature depend on the local pattern due to inhomogeneous charge distribution and kinetic terms. This leads to unconventional phase transitions between mixed phases where superconducting and normal metal regions coexist, even without external fields, which we term pattern-selective superconductivity. Furthermore, superconductivity can be anomalously suppressed even under stronger attractive interactions due to the alignment of the Fermi level with a spectral gap in the fragmented Hartree-shifted spectrum. These findings, not observed in conventional crystals, amorphous systems, or previous studies of quasicrystal superconductivity, highlight the distinct role of quasicrystalline order.</description>

      <title>Quantum Geometry of Time-Reversal Symmetry Breaking in Flat-Band Superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several physical phenomena in superconductors, such as helical superconductivity and the diode effect, rely on breaking time-reversal symmetry. This symmetry-breaking is usually accounted for via the Lifshitz invariant, a contribution to the free energy which is linear in the phase gradient of the order parameter. In dispersive single-band superconductors with conventional pairing, the Lifshitz invariant can be computed from the asymmetries of the spectrum near the Fermi surface. We show that in multi-band superconductors, the quantum geometry also contributes to the Lifshitz invariant, and this is the dominant contribution when the low-energy bands are flat.</description>

      <title>The crucial role of substrate in FeSe/STO: new insights to interface-driven superconductivity from first-principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the superconducting properties of monolayer FeSe, both freestanding (ML FeSe) and on SrTiO$_3$ (STO), by simultaneously solving the Kohn-Sham Density Functional Theory and Bogoliubov--de Gennes equations. Our results demonstrate that the substrate profoundly alters both the normal-state and superconducting properties of FeSe. We identify proximity-induced superconductivity in the interfacial TiO$_2$ layer of STO, due to hybridization between Fe $d$ and O $p$ orbitals. This hybridization results in a fivefold increase in the superconducting gap width and confines superconducting states to the $M$ point in the Brillouin Zone. This is in contrast to ML FeSe, where superconductivity emerges at both the $\Gamma$ and $M$ points. Furthermore, the substrate modifies the orbital character of the states responsible for superconductivity, which change from Fe $d_{z^2}$ in ML FeSe to Fe $d_{xz}/d_{yz}$ in FeSe/STO. In both systems, we demonstrate an anisotropic superconducting gap with multiple coherence peaks, originating at different k-points in the Brillouin Zone. Additionally, in FeSe/STO, we identify emerging states unique to the superconducting phase arising from electron-hole hybridization at $M$, in agreement with experiments. Our findings highlight the decisive impact of substrate (hybridization, strain, charge transfer, magnetic order) on the superconducting properties of FeSe. We suggest potential pathways for engineering novel high-temperature FeSe-based superconductors by leveraging interfacial interactions in substrates with high electron affinity.</description>

      <title>Transition from $s_{\pm}$-wave to $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$-wave superconductivity driven by interlayer interaction in the bilayer two-orbital model of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We utilize the fluctuation-exchange approximation on a bilayer two-orbital model, incorporating $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and $d_{z^2}$ orbitals, to explore potential pairing symmetries in the bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. Our study particularly examines the impact of interlayer Coulomb interactions. In the absence of these interactions, the superconducting gap exhibits $s_{\pm}$-wave symmetry, with predominant intraorbital pairing in the $d_{z^2}$ orbital. As interlayer interactions increase, $s_{\pm}$-wave superconductivity is suppressed, while the superconductivity with a $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave gap is enhanced, resulting in a transition at a critical interaction strength. This $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave superconductivity is distinct not only from the $s_{\pm}$-wave superconductivity but also from the intraorbital $d$-wave pairing in cuprate superconductors, as it is dominated by the interlayer pairing between the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and $d_{z^2}$ orbitals. Additionally, charge fluctuations play a crucial role in driving the transition from $s_{\pm}$ wave to $d_{x^2-y^2}$ wave superconductivity. Our findings indicate that interlayer Coulomb interactions are crucial for understanding the pairing mechanism in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.</description>

      <title>Superconducting diode effect in Ising superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the superconducting diode effect (SDE) in an Ising superconductor with broken basal mirror symmetry in a parallel magnetic field. We show that in the presence of a small Rashba spin splitting, $\Delta_R$, the dominant Ising spin-orbit coupling ($\Delta_I &gt;&gt; \Delta_R$) dramatically enhances the SDE efficiency compared to a Rashba superconductor with $\Delta_I = 0$ and the same $\Delta_R$. The suppression of the SDE for $\Delta_I = 0$ at $\Delta_R$ much larger than the critical temperature ($T_c$) is accidental. At $\Delta_R &lt;&lt; T_c$, the SDE efficiency is small because, to linear order, $\Delta_R$ can be removed by a gauge transformation. These two factors -- the accidental suppression of the SDE at large $\Delta_R$ and the systematic suppression at small $\Delta_R$ -- are eliminated by Ising spin-orbit coupling. As a result, SDE efficiency is substantially enhanced for $\Delta_I &gt;&gt; \Delta_R \neq 0$.</description>

      <title>Strong correlation between $H$-linear magnetoresistance and strange metal in FeSe superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In strange metals, a strong and anomalous scattering effect exists and increases linearly with temperature. In FeSe, we observed that the temperature dependence of resistivity exhibits non-Fermi liquid behavior in two regions below and above a critical pressure, $p_\text{c}$$\sim$2 GPa. As pressure increases, a transition from quadratic to nonsaturating magnetoresistance is observed, with a distinct crossover between these two behaviors indicated by $B^{*}$ in the derivative analysis. After subtracting the quadratic term from the magnetoresistance, the residual magnetoresistance clearly exhibits an $H$-linear behavior. Additionally, two segments of $H$-inear magnetoresistance appear with increasing pressure, each arising from distinct origins. Notably, the two $H$-linear magnetoresistances exist and develop within the strange metal states. These results suggest that $H$-linear magnetoresistance is in strong correlation with the strange metal state, which may affect superconductivity in FeSe under pressure. Our study provides valuable insights into the strange metal state and clues for underlying unconventional superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Trapped Magnetic Vortex Losses in Niobium Resonators at mK Temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trapped magnetic vortices in niobium can introduce microwave losses in superconducting devices, affecting both niobium-based qubits and resonators. While our group has extensively studied this problem at temperatures above 1~K, in this study we quantify for the first time the losses driven by magnetic vortices for niobium-based quantum devices operating down to millikelvin temperature, and in the low photon counts regime. By cooling a single interface system a 3-D niobium superconducting cavity in a dilution refrigerator through the superconducting transition temperature in controlled levels of magnetic fields, we isolate the flux-induced losses and quantify the added surface resistance per unit of trapped magnetic flux. Our findings indicate that magnetic flux introduces approximately 2~n$\Omega /$mG at 10~mK and at 6~GHz in high RRR niobium. We find that the decay rate of a 6~GHz niobium cavity at 10~mK which contains a native niobium pentoxide will be dominated by the TLS oxide losses until vortices begin to impact $T_1$ for trapped magnetic field ($B_{\text{trap}}$) levels of $&gt;$100~mG. In the absence of the niobium pentoxide, $B_{\text{trap}}=$~10~mG limits $Q_0\sim$~10\textsuperscript{10}, or $T_1\sim$~350~ms, highlighting the importance of magnetic shielding and magnetic hygiene in enabling $T_1&gt;$~1~s. We observe that the flux-induced resistance decreases with temperature-yet remains largely field-independent, qualitatively explained by thermal activation of vortices in the flux-flow regime. We present a phenomenological model which captures the salient experimental observations. Scaling our findings to typical transmon qubit dimensions suggests that these 2-D structures could be robust against vortex dissipation up to several hundreds~mG. We are directly addressing vortex losses in transmon qubits made with low RRR Nb films in a separate experimental study.</description>

      <title>Quasi-$\Phi_0$-periodic supercurrent at quantum Hall transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The combination of superconductivity and quantum Hall (QH) effect is regarded as a key milestone in advancing topological quantum computation in solid-state systems. Recent quantum interference studies suggest that QH edge states can effectively mediate a supercurrent across high-quality graphene weak links. In this work we report the observation of a supercurrent associated with transitions between adjacent QH plateaus, where transport paths develop within the compressible two-dimensional bulk. We employ a back-gated graphene Josephson junction, comprising high-mobility CVD-grown graphene encapsulated in hexagonal Boron Nitride (hBN) and contacted by Nb leads. Superconducting pockets are detected persisting beyond the QH onset, up to 2.4 T, hence approaching the upper critical field of the Nb contacts. We observe an approximate $\Phi_0=h/2e$ periodicity of the QH-supercurrent as a function of the magnetic field, indicating superconducting interference in a proximitized percolative phase. These results provide a promising experimental platform to investigate the transport regime of percolative supercurrents, leveraging the flexibility of van der Waals devices.</description>

      <title>Finite-momentum pairing and superlattice superconductivity in valley-imbalanced rhombohedral graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the recent experimental discovery of superconductivity emerging from a time-reversal symmetry-breaking normal state in tetralayer rhombohedral graphene, we here investigate superconducting instabilities in this system. We classify the possible pairing instabilities, including states with commensurate and incommensurate center of mass momenta. As rotational symmetry is broken in the latter type of pairing states, their momentum-space structure is most naturally characterized by a "valley-independent Chern number", measuring the relative chirality between the normal and superconducting state. We further demonstrate that superconductivity can condense at multiple incommensurate momenta simultaneously, leading to the spontaneous formation of a translational-symmetry-breaking superlattice superconductor. Studying multiple different pairing mechanisms and varying the degree of spin and valley polarization in the normal state, we compare the energetics of these superconductors. Our results demonstrate that valley-imbalanced rhombohedral tetralayer graphene can give rise to rich superconducting phenomenologies.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium effects in ballistic point contacts Ta-Cu and 2H-NbSe2-Cu. Two-gap superconductivity in 2H-NbSe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.02441v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ta-Cu and NbSe2-Cu heterocontacts have been studied. For Ta-Cu contacts, a theoretical estimation of the delta-functional barrier at the boundary, arising due to the mismatch of the Fermi parameters of the contacting metals, has been carried out, and good agreement between the calculation and experiment has been obtained. An expression for estimating the diameter of the heterocontact on both sides of the boundary is obtained. The value of the jump-like reduction of the excess current (and superconducting gap) associated with the phase transition of the superconducting region near the point contact to a spatially inhomogeneous state when the critical concentration of nonequilibrium quasiparticles is reached is determined. The dependence of the additive differential resistance on the displacement at the contact arising after the phase transition due to the excess charge of quasiparticles and the associated reverse current (or additive voltage) is obtained. In 2H-NbSe2, a two-zone superconductivity character with an 8-fold difference in the energy gap values takes place. Under the action of current injection of nonequilibrium quasiparticles, there is a sequential phase transition of layers adjacent to the point contact into a spatially inhomogeneous state with a suppressed gap, which is accompanied by a stepwise change in the slope of the I-V curve with a discrete increase in the differential resistance.</description>

      <title>Nature of Andreev bound states in Josephson junctions of triple-point semimetals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15350v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study superconductor-barrier-superconductor (S-B-S) Josephson junctions constructed out of two-dimensional and three-dimensional triple-point semimetals, which feature a threefold degeneracy at a single nodal point. We assume a weak and homogeneous s-wave pairing in each superconducting region, and a potential difference is applied across a piece of normal-state semimetal to create the barrier region. We compute the wavefunctions of the Andreev bound states (ABSs), considering the thin-barrier limit. The appropriate boundary conditions at the S-B and B-S junctions allow us to compute the discrete energy eigenvalues $\pm |\varepsilon| $ of the ABSs. We get two distinct solutions for $|\varepsilon| $. This result differs from that in graphene and Weyl semimetals, where one obtains only one solution for $|\varepsilon| $. The multifold nature of the triple-point fermions is responsible for this difference. We also illustrate the behaviour of the Josephson current flowing across the S-B-S junction.</description>

      <title>Interplay between evanescent scattering modes and finite dispersion in superconducting junctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07035v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superconducting junctions are essential building blocks for quantum hardware, and their fundamental behaviour remains a highly active research field. The behaviour of generic junctions is conveniently described by Beenakker's determinant formula, linking the subgap energy spectrum to the scattering matrix characterising the junction. In particular, the gap closing between bound and continuum states in short junctions follows from unitarity of the scattering matrix, and thus, from probability conservation. In this work, we critically reassess two assumptions: that scattering in short junctions is approximately energy-independent and dominated by planar channels. We argue that strongly energy-dependant scattering follows from finite dispersion of the conductor electrons even when they spend little time within the scattering region, and show that evanescent modes play a central role when cross-channel scattering is important. By generalising Beenakker's equation and performing a mapping to an effective Hamiltonian, we show that the gap closing is linked to a chiral symmetry. While finite energy dependence in the scattering breaks the chiral symmetry, we show two distinct mechanisms preserving the gap closing, each connected to new types of constraints on energy-dependant scattering matrices beyond unitarity. If the dispersive mode is planar, the gap closing is still preserved through a time-dependant probability conservation analysis of the scattering process. If the dispersive channel is evanescent, we derive a constraint which, notably, cannot follow from probability conservation. We thus demonstrate that Andreev physics reveal a much wider variety of properties of normal-metal scattering than commonly expected. We expect that our findings will have an impact on the dissipative behaviour of driven junctions, and offer a new perspective on fundamental properties of scattering matrices.</description>
