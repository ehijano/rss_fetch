      <title>Extragalactic Planetary Nebulae (xPNe). Chemical evolution and assembly histories of nearby galaxies using Oxygen and Argon abundances. From the local universe to cosmic dawn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How galaxies formed and evolved in the expanding Universe is the main science goal of Near-Field Cosmology research. Studies of the properties of galaxies' resolved stars open a widow on their ancient galactic components, probing star formation during epochs more than 10 billion years ago. Extragalactic Planetary Nebulae (xPNe) can help decipher the signatures of mergers and interactions persisting over many dynamical times by tracing elemental abundances coupled with their kinematics and spatial distributions. With new facilities, reaching higher angular resolution, area coverage and sensitivity, one can use xPNe to map Oxygen and Argon element abundances, in addition to their kinematics, to extend the Galactic Archeology investigation to the oldest stellar aggregates in our Local Universe.</description>

      <title>Learning at the Edge: Tailed-Uniform Sampling for Robust Simulation-Based Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the \textsc{Tailed-Uniform} proposal distribution for generating training simulations in simulation-based inference. Instead of sampling parameters uniformly within bounded regions, we extend the distribution beyond prior boundaries with smooth Gaussian tails. This eliminates sharp discontinuities that cause neural posterior estimators to fail when the posterior distribution intersects or extends beyond the prior bounds. The method requires minimal hyperparameter tuning, with tail widths of 10--30\% of the prior width proving robust across problems. We demonstrate these benefits on a synthetic Gaussian linear task and cosmological parameter inference from the matter power spectrum. We also find that \tail-trained models outperform \textsc{Uniform} ones near the boundaries across various training set sizes and dimensions of the parameter space. This advantage grows in higher dimensions, where boundaries dominate parameter space volume. All code is publicly available on Github at https://github.com/chaipattira/tailed-uniform-sbi.</description>

      <title>STIS Cycle 30 Calibration Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the suite of STIS calibration programs executed during HST Cycle 30, covering the period 2022 Nov 07 through 2023 Nov 05. For each of the 19 current regular calibration programs, we provide brief descriptions of the objectives, observations, analysis procedures, and results - with comparisons to the results from previous cycles and to desired accuracies, as well as references to more detailed analyses of the calibration data. Many of these calibration programs produce routine reference file deliveries or demonstrate the continuing applicability of existing reference files for processing STIS observations. This ISR provides a brief snapshot of the current instrument performance, similar to those given in annual reports for Cycles 7-10 and 17-21. Two Appendices briefly discuss the state of the onboard calibration lamps and the ongoing major effort to revise the flux calibration for the many STIS spectroscopic and imaging modes.</description>

      <title>Detached eclipsing binary star science in the 2040s</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detached eclipsing binary stars (DEBS) are currently the best source of accurate and precise fundamental stellar parameters. This makes DEBS crucial targets for constraining the impact of various physical processes on stellar structure and evolution. Long-period binaries are particularly interesting because their separation minimises interactions between the components. This makes long-period binaries more comparable to single stars. However, the current sample of DEBS with high precision stellar parameters are dominated by short-period systems (e.g. ~90% of the Gaia DR3 eclipsing binaries have periods &lt; 5 days). Facilities capable of performing detailed studies of long-period DEBS will be essential to further improve our understanding of stellar structure and evolution. Such facilities would need to be able to obtain spectroscopic observations of more distant objects at high resolution and cadence. 2-8m class telescopes with echelle spectrographs and an ability to monitor a large sample of stars would be required.</description>

      <title>Improving Generalization and Uncertainty Quantification of Photometric Redshift Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate redshift estimates are a vital component in understanding galaxy evolution and precision cosmology. In this paper, we explore approaches to increase the applicability of machine learning models for photometric redshift estimation on a broader range of galaxy types. Typical models are trained with ground-truth redshifts from spectroscopy. We test the utility and effectiveness of two approaches for combining spectroscopic redshifts and redshifts derived from multiband ($\sim$35 filters) photometry, which sample different types of galaxies compared to spectroscopic surveys. The two approaches are (1) training on a composite dataset and (2) transfer learning from one dataset to another. We compile photometric redshifts from the COSMOS2020 catalog (TransferZ) to complement an established spectroscopic redshift dataset (GalaxiesML). We used two architectures, deterministic neural networks (NN) and Bayesian neural networks (BNN), to examine and evaluate their performance with respect to the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) photo-$z$ science requirements. We also use split conformal prediction for calibrating uncertainty estimates and producing prediction intervals for the BNN and NN, respectively. We find that a NN trained on a composite dataset predicts photo-$z$'s that are 4.5 times less biased within the redshift range $0.3&lt;z&lt;1.5$, 1.1 times less scattered, and has a 1.4 times lower outlier rate than a model trained on only spectroscopic ground truths. We also find that BNNs produce reliable uncertainty estimates, but are sensitive to the different ground truths. This investigation leverages different sources of ground truths to develop models that can accurately predict photo-$z$'s for a broader population of galaxies crucial for surveys such as Euclid and LSST.</description>

      <title>2MASS Re-processing I: The Search for Faint Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an automated, DAOFind-based pipeline developed to reprocess J-band Atlas All Sky Release Survey Images from the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS). By optimizing the detection parameters and implementing a screening procedure that jointly evaluates the signal-to-noise ratio and central sharpness, the pipeline effectively identifies faint point sources that were previously undetected. Applying this method to eight representative sky regions improves the 2MASS detection limit from 16.20 to 16.60 mag and increases the number of detected point sources by approximately 21.36% relative to the 2MASS Point Source Catalog, with a false-positive rate of only 4.80%. These results demonstrate that the proposed reprocessing pipeline can substantially enhance the scientific yield of archival 2MASS data, providing valuable faint-source supplements for studies of time-domain variability, Galactic structure, and cold, low-luminosity objects.</description>

      <title>SiGMa-Net II: Distinguishing Binary Black Holes from Glitches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With increasing sensitivity of the gravitational wave (GW) detectors, we expect a significant rise in the detectable GW events. To process, analyse and identify such large amounts of GW signals arising from mergers of Binary Black Holes (BBH), we need both speed and accuracy. In the search for (massive) BBH signals, the biggest hurdle is posed by the various non-gaussian noise transients called glitches. Compared to our previous work, which used a simple convolutional neural network to distinguish BBHs from Blip glitches, this work uses transfer learning with InceptionNetV3 to distinguish BBHs from six types of most popular glitches from the third observing run of LIGO. While the glitches are real and identified via GravitySpy, the BBH signals are simulated and then injected into the real detector noise for each of the two LIGO detectors. We generate Sine-Gaussian Projection (SGP) maps by cross-correlating data with Sine-Gaussian functions of varied quality factors ($Q$) and central frequencies ($f_0$) and projected on the $Q$ - $f_0$ plane. We find that SGP maps make it easier to distinguish BBHs from glitches that look very similar to BBHs in the Time-Frequency maps like the Blips, while also maintaining significant morphological differences between BBHs and the more frequent glitches - Scattered Light and Fast Scattering. Our network has an accuracy of $87%$, a TPR of 0.83 for an FPR of 0.1 on our test dataset. It is also robust, retaining its level of accuracy, when tested on real BBH events identified in the first three observing runs of LIGO. Our proposed method shows the viability of using the SGP maps and neural networks for fast identification of GW events improving the efficiency of standard search pipelines.</description>

      <title>150 years of ground-based solar instrumentation at Meudon observatory (1876-2026)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Sun has been observed through a telescope for four centuries. However, its study made a prodigious leap at the end of the nineteenth century with the appearance of photography and spectroscopy, then at the beginning of the following century with the invention of the coronagraph and monochromatic filters, and finally in the second half of the twentieth century with the advent of large ground-based telescopes and space exploration. This article retraces the main stages of solar instrumental developments in Meudon, from its foundation by Jules Janssen in 1876 to the present day, limited to ground-based or balloon instrumentation, designed in Meudon and installed there or in other places (Nan{\c c}ay, Pic du Midi, Canary Islands). The Meudon astronomers played a pioneering role in the history of solar physics through the experimentation of innovative techniques. After the golden age of inventions, came the time of large instruments, studied in Meudon but often installed in more favourable sites, and that of space, in a framework of international collaboration, but this is not discussed here.</description>

      <title>Photoexcitation spectroscopy of highly charged ions for application to astronomy using a compact electron beam ion trap (EBIT) at the synchrotron radiation facility SPring-8</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the past few decades, X-ray astronomy satellites equipped with grating spectrometers and microcalorimeters have enabled high-resolution spectroscopic observations of astrophysical objects. The need for accurate atomic data has arose as we attempt detailed analysis of the high-resolution spectra they provide. This is because current spectral models, which heavily rely on theoretical calculations, entail non-negligible uncertainties. We employ a plasma spectroscopy device called electron beam ion trap (EBIT) to experimentally obtain precise atomic data. An EBIT with a design that allows combined operation with synchrotron radiation facilities was developed based on the Heidelberg Compact EBIT and installed at ISAS/JAXA for this purpose. We conducted a spectroscopic experiment using the JAXA-EBIT at the synchrotron radiation facility SPring-8, and successfully obtained high-resolution spectra of the L$\alpha$ resonance transition of Ne-like Fe$^{16+}$ ions, 3C, as well as the K$\alpha$ resonance transition of He-like O$^{6+}$ ions. We also measured another Ne-like Fe$^{16+}$ L$\alpha$ resonance transition, 3G, and constrained an upper limit of the oscillator strength ratio of 3G to 3C, using our experimental results. The experimental values obtained in this study will be applied to observational studies of astrophysical objects as a part of the plasma spectral modeling.</description>

      <title>tilepy: A Flexible Open-Source Scheduling Engine for Time-Domain and Multi-Messenger Astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The era of multi-messenger astrophysics requires rapid and efficient follow-up of transient events, many of which, such as gravitational waves (GW), gamma-ray bursts (GRB), and high-energy neutrinos, suffer from poor sky localisation. We present tilepy, a Python-based software designed to optimize observation schedules for these events. We here detail the modular architecture of tilepy, which separates high-level scheduling logic from low-level tiling and pointing tools, enabling full adaptability for ground- and space-based observatories. Furthermore, we describe the integration of tilepy into the Astro-COLIBRI platform, providing the community with a user-friendly interface and API for triggering complex observation campaigns in real time.</description>

      <title>Decameter-sized Earth Impactors -- II: A Bayesian Inference Approach to Meteoroid Ablation Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Small asteroids and large meteoroids frequently impact the Earth, though their physical and material properties remain poorly understood. When observed as fireballs in Earth's atmosphere, these properties can be inferred from their ablation and fragmentation behavior. The 2022 release of previously classified United States Government (USG) satellite sensor data has provided hundreds of new fireball light curves, allowing for more detailed analysis. Here we present a new Bayesian inference method based on dynamic nested sampling that can robustly estimate these objects' physical parameters from their observed light curves, starting from relatively uninformative, flat priors. We validate our method against seven USG sensor-observed fireballs with independent ground-based observations and demonstrate that our results are consistent with previous estimates. We then apply our technique to $13$ decameter-size Earth impactors to conduct the most detailed population-level study of their structure and material strength to date. We identify three structurally distinct groups within the decameter impactors. The first group are primarily structurally homogeneous, weak objects which catastrophically disrupt below $\sim1.5$ MPa. The second group are heterogeneous objects which progressively fragment starting from $\sim1$ MPa typically up to $\sim3-8$ MPa. The third group are strong aggregates which remain mostly intact until $9-10$ MPa. Our results also suggest that decameter-size asteroids fragment in two distinct phases: an initial phase at $\sim0.04-0.09$ MPa and a second at $\sim1-4$ MPa. While decimeter- to meter-size objects typically lose most of their mass in the initial phase, larger decameter-size objects instead lose most of their mass in the second phase.</description>

      <title>Visualisation of spherical harmonics in Peirce's quincuncial projection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spherical harmonics $Y_{\ell m}(\theta,\varphi)$ are complex-valued functions on the surface of a sphere, and have found widespread application in physics and astronomy. Every physics students knows them from quantum mechanics and electromagnetic theory, where they form the basis of hydrogen orbitals and of the multipole expansion, respectively. More advanced applications include the physics of the cosmic microwave background, gravitational lensing, and gravitational waves. In this paper I aim to contrast their usual $3d$ visualisation with Peirce's quincuncial projection, a conformal projection of the sphere onto a $2d$ unfolded square dihedron, where the projection respects the fundamental rotational symmetries and preserves angles. With this mapping, I guide the reader through the properties of the spherical harmonics in a pedagogical way and show that many of their mathematical relations have an intuitive visualisation on Peirce's $2d$ map, which might be useful for people challenged by processing $3d$ shapes, or which people might appreciate aesthetically.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Mars Rover Module for Soil Sampling and Life Component Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The search for extraterrestrial life has long been a primary focus of scientific exploration, driven by rapid advancements in technology and our understanding of the universe. The discovery of water on Mars has sparked significant interest, raising the question of whether life could exist on the planet. This study proposes a novel approach to simulate and illustrate the detection of life using a proof-of-life module integrated into a Mars rover. The module is an autonomous system capable of traveling to designated regions, excavating soil, collecting samples, and performing biochemical testing onboard the rover itself. The project is inherently multidisciplinary, integrating mechanical systems such as a drill mechanism and a vacuum system, alongside biochemical analysis for soil testing. The module is capable of successfully detecting the presence or absence of living components of life from the collected soil particles. This proof-of-life module serves as a proof-of-concept for autonomous life detection in extraterrestrial environments and lays the foundation for future exploration missions.</description>

      <title>AstroTimer: Rethinking Non-Access Stratum Timers in LEO Constellations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) constellations expand 5G coverage to remote regions but differ fundamentally from terrestrial networks due to rapidly changing topologies, fluctuating delays, and constrained onboard resources. Existing 3GPP Non-Access Stratum (NAS) timers, inherited from terrestrial and geostationary (GEO) or medium Earth orbit (MEO) systems, fail to accommodate these dynamics, leading to signaling storms and inefficiency. This paper introduces AstroTimer, a lightweight, adaptive framework for sizing NAS timers based on LEO-specific parameters such as link variability, processing delays, and network-function placement. AstroTimer derives a closed-form timer model with low computational cost and optimizes both watchdog and backoff timers for the 5G registration procedure. Simulation results demonstrate that AstroTimer significantly reduces registration time, retry frequency, and user equipment (UE) energy consumption compared to 3GPP defaults, while preventing signaling overloads. The proposed approach provides an operator-ready foundation for reliable, efficient, and scalable non-terrestrial 5G/6G deployments.</description>

      <title>Higher-Order Gravitational Models: A Tutorial on Spherical Harmonics and the Newtonian Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate modeling of gravitational interactions is fundamental to the analysis, prediction, and control of space systems. While the Newtonian point-mass approximation suffices for many preliminary studies, real celestial bodies exhibit deviations from spherical symmetry, including oblateness, localized mass concentrations, and higher-order shape irregularities. These features can significantly perturb spacecraft trajectories, especially in low-altitude or long-duration missions, leading to cumulative orbit prediction errors and increased control demands. This article presents a tutorial introduction to spherical harmonic gravity models, outlining their theoretical foundations and underlying assumptions. Higher-order gravitational fields are derived as solutions to the Laplace equation, providing a systematic framework to capture the effects of non-uniform mass distributions. The impact of these higher-order terms on orbital dynamics is illustrated through examples involving Low Earth Orbit satellites and spacecraft near irregularly shaped asteroids, highlighting the practical significance of moving beyond the point-mass approximation.</description>

      <title>Neuro-Parametric Spectral Classification of Black Hole and Neutron Star X-ray Binary Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform the classification of black hole and neutron star X-ray binary systems using deep neural networks applied to archival RXTE X-ray spectral data. We first construct two neural network models: one trained using only spectral flux values and another trained using both fluxes and their associated errors. Both models achieve high classification accuracies of ~90-94 %. To gain physical interpretability of these networks, we fit all spectra with a simple phenomenological model consisting of a thermal disk component and a power-law. From this analysis, we identify the blackbody temperature, power-law index, the ratio of blackbody to power-law flux, the reduced $\chi^2$, and the variance of the data as key parameters that likely contribute to the classification. We validate this inference by designing an additional neural network trained exclusively on this reduced parameter set, without using the spectral data directly. This parameter-based model achieves a classification accuracy comparable to that of the spectral models. Our results show that deep neural networks can not only classify compact objects in X-ray binaries with high accuracy but can also be interpreted in terms of physically meaningful spectral parameters derived from conventional X-ray spectral analysis. This framework offers a promising, mission-agnostic approach for compact object classification in current and future X-ray surveys.</description>

      <title>AI-based separation of turbulence from coherent background flows in decaying hydrodynamic turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Separating turbulent fluctuations from coherent large-scale background flows is a fundamental challenge in the analysis of numerical simulations and astronomical observations. Traditional approaches to this problem commonly rely on decomposition-based techniques, including scale-based filtering methods such as Fourier or wavelet transforms, as well as adaptive methods like the Hilbert-Huang transformation. In realistic flows, however, coherent motions and turbulent fluctuations often overlap across a broad range of scales and interact nonlinearly, rendering any clear and unique separation inherently ambiguous, particularly in astrophysical settings where data are projected or sparsely sampled. In this work, we assess the robustness of AI-based turbulence-background separation using two-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes simulations of decaying hydrodynamic turbulence. The simulations are initialized with a coherent background flow and divergence-free turbulent perturbations with a Kolmogorov-like power spectrum, and evolve without external forcing, providing a conservative physical testbed. A neural network trained exclusively on static synthetic images is applied to simulation snapshots at different evolutionary stages. We find that the model successfully recovers turbulent fluctuations during early and intermediate stages, when partial scale separation is preserved. At later stages, despite the substantial decay of turbulent energy and the resulting reduction in fluctuation strength, the model continues to recover visually and spectrally plausible turbulent structures and preserves inertial-range spectral scaling, demonstrating robust separation under increasingly challenging conditions. These results demonstrate the potential of applying AI models trained on static data to time-evolving turbulent flows, with direct implications for astrophysical and cosmological applications.</description>

Abstract: The gravitational wave event GW190521 seems to be the only BH merger event possibly correlated with an electromagnetic counterpart, which appeared about 34 days after the GW event. This work aims to confirm that the electromagnetic bump towards the Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) J1249+3449 can be explained within the framework of the gravitational microlensing phenomenon. In particular, considering the data of the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), what emerges from a detailed analysis of the observed light curve using three fitting models (Point Source Point Lens, Finite Source Point Lens, Uniform Source Binary Lens) is that the optical bump can be explained as a microlensing event caused by a lens with mass {$\sim\,$0.1 $M_{\odot}$}, lying in the host galaxy of the AGN in question.} %MDPI: Please confirm if the bold formatting is necessary; if not, please remove it.</description>

      <title>Assessing astrophysical foreground subtraction in DECIGO using compact binary populations inferred from the first part of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA's fourth observation run</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) from our Universe under the inflationary era is one of the primary scientific objectives of DECIGO, a space-borne gravitational wave detector sensitive in the 0.1 Hz frequency band. This frequency band is dominated by the gravitational waves from inspiraling compact object binaries. Subtracting these signals is necessary to search for the primordial SGWB. In this paper, we assess the feasibility of the subtraction of such binary signals by employing the population model inferred from the latest gravitational wave event catalogue of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration. We find that the projection scheme, which was originally proposed by Cutler &amp; Harms (2005), is necessary to reduce the binary signals to the level where DECIGO can detect the primordial background.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This chapter introduces the fundamental principles of gravitational wave detectors in a simple and comprehensive manner. Because these instruments aim for extremely high sensitivity, it is essential to understand their various noise sources, how such noise couples to the detector output, and the strategies used to mitigate them. These noises contributions are computed in the frame of the Virgo detector and a sensitivity curve is calculated. Although a simplified layout of a gravitational wave detector is considered, it takes into account the most dominant effects and yields in a sensitivity estimate close to the what is observed in real detectors.</description>

      <title>XFit: Global Optimization and Degeneracy Mapping in X-ray Spectral Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The standard approach to modeling X-ray spectral data relies on local optimization methods, such as the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. While effective for simple models and speedy spectral fitting, these local optimizers are prone to becoming trapped in local minima, particularly in high-dimensional or degenerate parameter spaces, and typically require extensive user intervention. In this work, we introduce XFit, a global optimization method for fitting X-ray data, which makes extensive use of the Ferret evolutionary algorithm. XFit enables automated exploration of complex parameter spaces, efficient mapping of confidence intervals, and identification of degenerate solutions that may be overlooked by local methods. We demonstrate the performance of XFit using two representative X-ray sources: the Central Compact Object in Cassiopeia A and the supernova remnant G41.1-0.3. These examples span both low- and high-dimensional models, allowing us to illustrate the advantages of global optimization. In both cases, XFit produces solutions that are consistent with or improve upon those found with traditional methods, while also revealing alternative fits or degenerate solutions within statistically acceptable confidence levels. The automated mapping of parameter space offered by XFit makes it a powerful complement to existing spectral fitting tools, particularly as models and data quality become increasingly complex. Future work will expand the application of XFit to broader datasets and more physically motivated models.</description>

      <title>Learned harmonic mean estimation of the marginal likelihood for multimodal posteriors with flow matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The marginal likelihood, or Bayesian evidence, is a crucial quantity for Bayesian model comparison but its computation can be challenging for complex models, even in parameters space of moderate dimension. The learned harmonic mean estimator has been shown to provide accurate and robust estimates of the marginal likelihood simply using posterior samples. It is agnostic to the sampling strategy, meaning that the samples can be obtained using any method. This enables marginal likelihood calculation and model comparison with whatever sampling is most suitable for the task. However, the internal density estimators considered previously for the learned harmonic mean can struggle with highly multimodal posteriors. In this work we introduce flow matching-based continuous normalizing flows as a powerful architecture for the internal density estimation of the learned harmonic mean. We demonstrate the ability to handle challenging multimodal posteriors, including an example in 20 parameter dimensions, showcasing the method's ability to handle complex posteriors without the need for fine-tuning or heuristic modifications to the base distribution.</description>

      <title>Deep-learning-based prediction of Precipitable Water Vapor in the Chajnantor area</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09575v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Astronomical observations at millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths heavily depend on the amount of Precipitable Water Vapor (PWV) in the atmosphere, directly affecting the sky transparency and degrading the quality of the signals received by radio telescopes. Predictions of PWV at different forecasting horizons is crucial to support telescope operations, engineering planning, and observational scheduling and efficiency of radio observatories installed in the Chajnantor area in northern Chile. We developed and validated a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) deep learning-based model to predict PWV at forecasting horizons of 12, 24, 36, and 48 hours using historical data from two 183 GHz radiometers and a weather station in the Chajnantor area. We find the LSTM method is able to predict PWV in the 12 and 24 hours forecasting horizons with Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 22% compared to 36% of the traditional Global Forecast System (GFS) method used by Atacama Pathfinder EXperiment (APEX) and the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) in mm are reduced by 50%. We present a first application of deep learning techniques for preliminary predictions of PWV in the Chajnantor area. The prediction performance shows significant improvements to traditional methods in 12 and 24 hours time windows. We also propose upgrades to improve our method in short (&lt; 1 hour) and long (&gt; 36 hours) forecasting timescales for future work.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13152v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Intensity interferometry (II) offers a powerful means to observe stellar objects with a high resolution. In this work, we demonstrate that II can also probe internal stellar kinematics by revealing a time-asymmetric Hanbury Brown and Twiss (HBT) effect, causing a measurable shift in the temporal correlation peak away from zero delay. We develop numerical models to simulate this effect for two distinct astrophysical scenarios: an emission-line circumstellar disk and an absorption-line binary system. Our simulations reveal a clear sensitivity of this temporal asymmetry to the system's inclination angle, velocity symmetry, and internal dynamics. This suggests that, with sufficiently high time resolution, II can be used to extract quantitative information about internal kinematics, offering a new observational window on stellar dynamics.</description>

      <title>Sample-efficient non-Gaussian noise reduction in gravitational wave data via learnable wavelets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14326v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce $\texttt{WaveletNet}$, a wavelet-based neural network architecture to identify and reduce non-Gaussian noise in gravitational wave data. Traditionally, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been widely used as a flexible machine learning method to mitigate non-Gaussian noise. However, training CNNs requires many data samples, especially when the input data segments are long. Glitches that mimic high-mass black hole signals are empirically known to have a wavelet-like structure. We exploit this property in $\texttt{WaveletNet}$ by using simple neural networks to learn the best family of wavelets to model glitches in the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA O3 data. Due to its simplicity, our framework is significantly more sample-efficient than CNNs. As a use case, we build upon the $\texttt{TIER}$ method and show how $\texttt{WaveletNet}$ can improve the performance of any search pipeline. We take potential GW candidates from the pipeline, and then downweight the candidates having noisy strain regions in their vicinity. We use our framework in a modular way: we provide an output score which can be added to the pipeline's existing detection statistic score for the candidates. We test our method using candidates from the $\texttt{IAS-HM}$ search pipeline and show that it improves the search sensitive volume by up to 15% for high-mass, asymmetric binaries.</description>

      <title>Distance-Independent Atmospheric Refraction Correction for Accurate Retrieval of Fireball Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15805v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate determination of fireball direction is essential for retrieving trajectories and velocities. Errors in these measurements have significant implications, affecting the calculated pre-impact orbit, influencing mass estimates, and impacting the accuracy of dark flight simulations, where applicable. Here we implement a new atmospheric refraction correction technique that addresses a significant aspect previously overlooked in the field of meteor science. Traditional refraction correction techniques, originally designed for objects positioned at infinite distances, tend to overcompensate when applied to objects within the Earth's atmosphere. To rectify this issue, our study introduces the concept of the atmospheric refraction delta z correction technique, involving the artificial elevation of the observer site height above sea level. We utilize analytically derived formulas for the delta z correction in conjunction with commonly used refraction models, validating these results against a numerical solution that traces light rays through the atmosphere. This ray-tracing model is applied to finely meshed atmospheric layers, yielding precise correction values. We evaluate multiple sources of error in order to quantify the achievable accuracy of the proposed method. Our approach (1) enables the determination of fireball positions with improved astrometric accuracy, (2) removes the explicit dependence on the fireball distance from the observer or its height above Earth's surface within the limits imposed by realistic atmospheric variability, and (3) simplifies meteor data processing by providing a robust framework for analyzing low-elevation fireball observations, for which atmospheric refraction is significant and is automatically corrected by the method. As a result of this work, we provide open, publicly accessible software for calculating the delta z correction.</description>

      <title>Phased-Array Laser Power Beaming from Cislunar Space to the Lunar Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10855v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a time-dependent, end-to-end framework for laser power beaming from cislunar orbits to the lunar surface. The model links on-orbit generation (solar arrays and wall-plug to optical), terrain-masked visibility and range, beam propagation with realistic divergence and jitter, and surface conversion with thermal and dust limits, returning delivered daily energy. Baseline loads for early polar activities (habitat survival, mobility, comm/nav, pilot ISRU) set target W h/day and are used consistently in scaling laws and design maps. A near-rectilinear halo orbit (NRHO) to a Shackleton-rim site provides a worked example: for a 2 m-class phased array at 1064 nm the reference geometry yields ~0.6-0.8 kW h/day to a 1m$^2$ receiver (about 28 W averaged over the day). We place this result in context by comparing on the same daily-energy metric to surface photovoltaics (PV) with storage and to compact fission, and by showing how delivered energy scales nearly linearly with transmit power and as $D_{\rm eff}^2$ via encircled-energy capture, with a multiplicative gain from visibility (constellations). The same framework indicates practical regimes already within reach: e.g., a 10 m effective-aperture optical phased array at $P_{\rm tx}=100$ kW delivers ~30-50 kW h/day at polar sites with typical single-orbiter visibility, as quantified by the delivered-energy and sizing maps. Thus, laser beaming is mass-competitive where darkness or permanent shadow forces deep storage for PV, or where distributed and duty-cycled users can amortize a shared transmitter; compact fission retains advantage for continuous multi-kW baseload at fixed sites.</description>

Abstract: Broad all-sky searches for continuous gravitational waves have high computational costs and require hierarchical pipelines. The sensitivity of these approaches is set by the initial search and by the number of candidates from that stage that can be followed up. The current follow-up schemes for the deepest surveys require careful tuning and set-up, have a significant human-labor cost and this impacts the number of follow-ups that can be afforded. Here we present and demonstrate a new follow-up framework based on Bayesian parameter estimation for the rapid, highly automated follow-up of candidates produced by the early stages of deep, wide-parameter space searches for continuous waves.</description>

      <title>Reducing Simulation Dependence in Neutrino Telescopes with Masked Point Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01733</link>

Abstract: Machine learning techniques in neutrino physics have traditionally relied on simulated data, which provides access to ground-truth labels. However, the accuracy of these simulations and the discrepancies between simulated and real data remain significant concerns, particularly for large-scale neutrino telescopes that operate in complex natural media. In recent years, self-supervised learning has emerged as a powerful paradigm for reducing dependence on labeled datasets. Here, we present the first self-supervised training pipeline for neutrino telescopes, leveraging point cloud transformers and masked autoencoders. By shifting the majority of training to real data, this approach minimizes reliance on simulations, thereby mitigating associated systematic uncertainties. This represents a fundamental departure from previous machine learning applications in neutrino telescopes, paving the way for substantial improvements in event reconstruction and classification.</description>

      <title>The Dawes Review 13: A New Look at The Dynamic Radio Sky</title>

Abstract: Astronomical objects that change rapidly give us insight into extreme environments, allowing us to identify new phenomena, test fundamental physics, and probe the Universe on all scales. Transient and variable radio sources range from the cosmological, such as gamma-ray bursts, to much more local events, such as massive flares from stars in our Galactic neighbourhood. The capability to observe the sky repeatedly, over many frequencies and timescales, has allowed us to explore and understand dynamic phenomena in a way that has not been previously possible. In the past decade, there have been great strides forward as we prepared for the revolution in time domain radio astronomy that is being enabled by the SKA Observatory telescopes, the SKAO pathfinders and precursors, and other `next generation' radio telescopes. Hence it is timely to review the current status of the field, and summarise the developments that have happened to get to our current point. This review focuses on image domain (or `slow') transients, on timescales of seconds to years. We discuss the physical mechanisms that cause radio variability, and the classes of radio transients that result. We then outline what an ideal image domain radio transients survey would look like, and summarise the history of the field, from targeted observations to surveys with existing radio telescopes. We discuss methods and approaches for transient discovery and classification, and identify some of the challenges in scaling up current methods for future telescopes. Finally, we present our current understanding of the dynamic radio sky, in terms of source populations and transient rates, and look at what we can expect from surveys on future radio telescopes.</description>

      <title>Fastest or Significant: A Systematic Framework for Validating Global Minimum Variability Timescale Measurements of Gamma-ray Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16204v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The minimum variability timescale (MVT) is a key observable used to probe the central engines of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) by constraining the emission region size and the outflow Lorentz factor. However, its interpretation is often ambiguous: statistical noise and analysis choices can bias measurements, making it difficult to distinguish genuine source variability from artifacts. Here we perform a comprehensive suite of simulations to establish a quantitative framework for validating Haar-based MVT measurements. We show that in multi--component light curves, the MVT returns the most statistically significant structure in the interval, which is not necessarily the fastest intrinsic timescale, and can therefore converge to intermediate values. Reliability is found to depend jointly on the MVT value and its signal-to-noise ratio ($\mathrm{SNR}_{\mathrm{MVT}}$), with shorter intrinsic timescales requiring proportionally higher $\mathrm{SNR}_{\mathrm{MVT}}$ to be resolved.
  We use this relation to define an empirical MVT Validation Curve, and provide a practical workflow to classify measurements as robust detections or upper limits. Applying this procedure to a sample of Fermi-GBM bursts shows that several published MVT values are better interpreted as upper limits. These results provide a path toward standardizing MVT analyses and highlight the caution required when inferring physical constraints from a single MVT measurement in complex events.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic modeling of Cherenkov emission from particle showers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00944v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Subatomic particles can interact with target nuclei in matter or decay in flight, and an individual high-energy particle can induce a particle shower composed of numerous, lower-energy secondaries. These particle showers broadly exhibit universality across diverse media, including air, water, ice, and other materials, with their development governed by the Standard Model. Full Monte Carlo simulation of particle showers, where each secondary is individually tracked and propagated, can be a computational challenge to perform at scale. Experiments thus resort to parametrized approximations when efficient simulation becomes necessary. Here, we construct distributions of parameters capable of describing the Cherenkov light yield from particle showers in ice, and extensible to other, similar media. Sampling from the distributions allows for a much improved description of event-to-event fluctuations, in amplitude and shape, along the shower axis. Including these effects is essential for a more accurate simulation of signal and background events in current and next-generation neutrino telescopes.</description>
