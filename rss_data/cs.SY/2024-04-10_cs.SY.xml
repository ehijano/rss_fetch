      <title>On Bounds for Greedy Schemes in String Optimization based on Greedy Curvatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the celebrated bound introduced by Conforti and Cornu\'ejols (1984) for greedy schemes in submodular optimization. The bound assumes a submodular function defined on a collection of sets forming a matroid and is based on greedy curvature. We show that the bound holds for a very general class of string problems that includes maximizing submodular functions over set matroids as a special case. We also derive a bound that is computable in the sense that they depend only on quantities along the greedy trajectory. We prove that our bound is superior to the greedy curvature bound of Conforti and Cornu\'ejols. In addition, our bound holds under a condition that is weaker than submodularity.</description>

      <title>Dual Ensemble Kalman Filter for Stochastic Optimal Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, stochastic optimal control problems in continuous time and space are considered. In recent years, such problems have received renewed attention from the lens of reinforcement learning (RL) which is also one of our motivation. The main contribution is a simulation-based algorithm -- dual ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) -- to numerically approximate the solution of these problems. The paper extends our previous work where the dual EnKF was applied in deterministic settings of the problem. The theoretical results and algorithms are illustrated with numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Iterative distributed moving horizon estimation of linear systems with penalties on both system disturbances and noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, partition-based distributed state estimation of general linear systems is considered. A distributed moving horizon state estimation scheme is developed via decomposing the entire system model into subsystem models and partitioning the global objective function of centralized moving horizon estimation (MHE) into local objective functions. The subsystem estimators of the distributed scheme that are required to be executed iteratively within each sampling period are designed based on MHE. Two distributed MHE algorithms are proposed to handle the unconstrained case and the case when hard constraints on states and disturbances, respectively. Sufficient conditions on the convergence of the estimates and the stability of the estimation error dynamics for the entire system are derived for both cases. A benchmark reactor-separator process example is introduced to illustrate the proposed distributed state estimation approach.</description>

      <title>Partition-based distributed extended Kalman filter for large-scale nonlinear processes with application to chemical and wastewater treatment processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we address a partition-based distributed state estimation problem for large-scale general nonlinear processes by proposing a Kalman-based approach. First, we formulate a linear full-information estimation design within a distributed framework as the basis for developing our approach. Second, the analytical solution to the local optimization problems associated with the formulated distributed full-information design is established, in the form of a recursive distributed Kalman filter algorithm. Then, the linear distributed Kalman filter is extended to the nonlinear context by incorporating successive linearization of nonlinear subsystem models, and the proposed distributed extended Kalman filter approach is formulated. We conduct rigorous analysis and prove the stability of the estimation error dynamics provided by the proposed method for general nonlinear processes consisting of interconnected subsystems. A chemical process example is used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and to justify the validity of the theoretical findings. In addition, the proposed method is applied to a wastewater treatment process for estimating the full state of the process with 145 state variables.</description>

      <title>Data-driven parallel Koopman subsystem modeling and distributed moving horizon state estimation for large-scale nonlinear processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we consider a state estimation problem for large-scale nonlinear processes in the absence of first-principles process models. By exploiting process operation data, both process modeling and state estimation design are addressed within a distributed framework. By leveraging the Koopman operator concept, a parallel subsystem modeling approach is proposed to establish interactive linear subsystem process models in higher-dimensional subspaces, each of which correlates with the original nonlinear subspace of the corresponding process subsystem via a nonlinear mapping. The data-driven linear subsystem models can be used to collaboratively characterize and predict the dynamical behaviors of the entire nonlinear process. Based on the established subsystem models, local state estimators that can explicitly handle process operation constraints are designed using moving horizon estimation. The local estimators are integrated via information exchange to form a distributed estimation scheme, which provides estimates of the unmeasured/unmeasurable state variables of the original nonlinear process in a linear manner. The proposed framework is applied to a chemical process and an agro-hydrological process to illustrate its effectiveness and applicability. Good open-loop predictability of the linear subsystem models is confirmed, and accurate estimates of the process states are obtained without requiring a first-principles process model.</description>

      <title>Synchronization Conditions for Nonlinear Oscillator Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding conditions for the synchronization of a network of interconnected oscillators is a challenging problem. Typically, only sufficient conditions are reported for the synchronization problem. Here, we adopted the Lyapunov-Floquet theory and the Master Stability Function approach in order to derive the synchronization conditions for a set of coupled nonlinear oscillators. We found that the positivity of the coupling constant is a necessary and sufficient condition for synchronizing linearly full-state coupled identical oscillators. Moreover, in the case of partial state coupling, the asymptotic convergence of volume in state space is ensured by a positive coupling constant. The numerical calculation of the Master Stability Function for a benchmark two-dimensional oscillator validates the synchronization corresponding to the positive coupling. The results are illustrated using numerical simulations and experimentation on benchmark oscillators.</description>

      <title>Complementarity-constrained predictive control for efficient gas-balanced hybrid power systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling gas turbines (GTs) efficiently is vital as GTs are used to balance power in onshore/offshore hybrid power systems with variable renewable energy and energy storage. However, predictive control of GTs is non-trivial when formulated as a dynamic optimisation problem due to the semi-continuous operating regions of GTs, which must be included to ensure complete combustion and high fuel efficiency. This paper studies two approaches for handling the semi-continuous operating regions of GTs in hybrid power systems through predictive control, dynamic optimisation, and complementarity constraints. The proposed solutions are qualitatively investigated and compared with baseline controllers in a case study involving GTs, offshore wind, and batteries. While one of the baseline controllers considers fuel efficiency, it employs a continuous formulation, which results in lower efficiency than the two proposed approaches as it does not account for the semi-continuous operating regions of each GT.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal Analysis of Shared Situation Awareness among Connected Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shared situation awareness (SSA) has been garnering explosive interest in various applications for intelligent transportation systems (ITS). In addition, the delay-constrained nature of supporting vehicular networks makes it critical to precisely analyze the performance of a SSA procedure. Extending the relevant literature, this paper provides an analysis framework that evaluates the performance of SSA in spatial and temporal aspects simultaneously. Specifically, this paper provides a closed-form probability distribution for the length of time taken for constitution of a SSA among a group of connected vehicles. This paper extends the calculation to investigation of feasibility of SSA in supporting various types of safety messages defined by the SAE J2735.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a sequential decision-making problem for a profit-maximizing operator of an Autonomous Mobility-on-Demand system. Optimizing a central operator's vehicle-to-request dispatching policy requires efficient and effective fleet control strategies. To this end, we employ a multi-agent Soft Actor-Critic algorithm combined with weighted bipartite matching. We propose a novel vehicle-based algorithm architecture and adapt the critic's loss function to appropriately consider global actions. Furthermore, we extend our algorithm to incorporate rebalancing capabilities. Through numerical experiments, we show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks by up to 12.9% for dispatching and up to 38.9% with integrated rebalancing.</description>

      <title>Analytical Formula for Calculations of Armour Losses in Three-Core Power Cables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past decade, significant progress has been made in the field of loss and rating calculations for armoured three-core cables. This development was prompted by an industry realization that the applicable international standards often overestimate losses, leading to unnecessarily bulky and more expensive cables. Starting with first-principles, this paper presents an accurate analytical formula for armour losses in three-core cables. The formula has undergone rigorous validation against 3D Finite Element Analysis (FEA) and demonstrate excellent accuracy. In the specific cases examined, the largest deviation from FEA results in terms of armour loss is approximately 2.4 percent for fully armoured cables. Although this study specifically focuses on armour losses, it establishes the groundwork for precise loss calculations in armoured three-core cables, including the conductor and screen losses. And the work presented here formed the basis for the complete loss calculations presented in the CIGRE Technical Brochure 908.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Mode Decomposition with Non-uniform Sampling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) and its extensions (EDMD) have been at the forefront of data-based approaches to Koopman operators. Most (E)DMD algorithms assume that the entire state is sampled at a uniform sampling rate. In this paper, we provide an algorithm where the entire state is not uniformly sampled, with individual components of the states measured at individual (but known) sampling rates. We propose a two-step DMD algorithm where the first step performs Hankel DMD on individual state components to estimate them at specified time instants. With the entire state reconstructed at the same time instants, we compute the (E)DMD for the system with the estimated data in the second step.</description>

      <title>EVLearn: Extending the CityLearn Framework with Electric Vehicle Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intelligent energy management strategies, such as Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) and Grid-to-Vehicle (G2V) emerge as a potential solution to the Electric Vehicles' (EVs) integration into the energy grid. These strategies promise enhanced grid resilience and economic benefits for both vehicle owners and grid operators. Despite the announced prospective, the adoption of these strategies is still hindered by an array of operational problems. Key among these is the lack of a simulation platform that allows to validate and refine V2G and G2V strategies. Including the development, training, and testing in the context of Energy Communities (ECs) incorporating multiple flexible energy assets. Addressing this gap, first we introduce the EVLearn, a simulation module for researching in both V2G and G2V energy management strategies, that models EVs, their charging infrastructure and associated energy flexibility dynamics; second, this paper integrates EVLearn with the existing CityLearn framework, providing V2G and G2V simulation capabilities into the study of broader energy management strategies. Results validated EVLearn and its integration into CityLearn, where the impact of these strategies is highlighted through a comparative simulation scenario.</description>

      <title>Learning Strategies For Successful Crowd Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Teaching autonomous mobile robots to successfully navigate human crowds is a challenging task. Not only does it require planning, but it requires maintaining social norms which may differ from one context to another. Here we focus on crowd navigation, using a neural network to learn specific strategies in-situ with a robot. This allows us to take into account human behavior and reactions toward a real robot as well as learn strategies that are specific to various scenarios in that context. A CNN takes a top-down image of the scene as input and outputs the next action for the robot to take in terms of speed and angle. Here we present the method, experimental results, and quantitatively evaluate our approach.</description>

      <title>Fast and Accurate Relative Motion Tracking for Two Industrial Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Industrial robotic applications such as spraying, welding, and additive manufacturing frequently require fast, accurate, and uniform motion along a 3D spatial curve. To increase process throughput, some manufacturers propose a dual-robot setup to overcome the speed limitation of a single robot. Industrial robot motion is programmed through waypoints connected by motion primitives (Cartesian linear and circular paths and linear joint paths at constant Cartesian speed). The actual robot motion is affected by the blending between these motion primitives and the pose of the robot (an outstretched/close to singularity pose tends to have larger path-tracking errors). Choosing the waypoints and the speed along each motion segment to achieve the performance requirement is challenging. At present, there is no automated solution, and laborious manual tuning by robot experts is needed to approach the desired performance. In this paper, we present a systematic three-step approach to designing and programming a dual-robot system to optimize system performance. The first step is to select the relative placement between the two robots based on the specified relative motion path. The second step is to select the relative waypoints and the motion primitives. The final step is to update the waypoints iteratively based on the actual relative motion. Waypoint iteration is first executed in simulation and then completed using the actual robots. For performance measures, we use the mean path speed subject to the relative position and orientation constraints and the path speed uniformity constraint. We have demonstrated the effectiveness of this method with ABB and FANUC robots on two challenging test curves. The performance improvement over the current industrial practice baseline is over 300%. Compared to the optimized single-arm case that we have previously reported, the improvement is over 14%.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Safety in Mixed Traffic: Learning-Based Modeling and Efficient Control of Autonomous and Human-Driven Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the increasing presence of autonomous vehicles (AVs) on public roads, developing robust control strategies to navigate the uncertainty of human-driven vehicles (HVs) is crucial. This paper introduces an advanced method for modeling HV behavior, combining a first-principles model with Gaussian process (GP) learning to enhance velocity prediction accuracy and provide a measurable uncertainty. We validated this innovative HV model using real-world data from field experiments and applied it to develop a GP-enhanced model predictive control (GP-MPC) strategy. This strategy aims to improve safety in mixed vehicle platoons by integrating uncertainty assessment into distance constraints. Comparative simulation studies with a conventional model predictive control (MPC) approach demonstrated that our GP-MPC strategy ensures more reliable safe distancing and fosters efficient vehicular dynamics, achieving notably higher speeds within the platoon. By incorporating a sparse GP technique in HV modeling and adopting a dynamic GP prediction within the MPC framework, we significantly reduced the computation time of GP-MPC, marking it only 4.6% higher than that of the conventional MPC. This represents a substantial improvement, making the process about 100 times faster than our preliminary work without these approximations. Our findings underscore the effectiveness of learning-based HV modeling in enhancing both safety and operational efficiency in mixed-traffic environments, paving the way for more harmonious AV-HV interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid expansion of renewable energy sources introduces significant volatility and unpredictability to the energy supply chain, challenging the stability and reliability of the power grid. This work presents a method that enhances existing static optimization models by converting them into dynamic models suitable for the real-time optimization of flexible energy resources. By adapting static models for real-time application, the proposed two-stage optimization strategy allows for flexible adjustments of operational plans, facilitating the seamless integration of renewable energy sources. This approach not only ensures grid reliability but also improves economic efficiency by optimizing resource utilization. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated through a case study involving a system of electrolyzers, showcasing significant advantages over traditional static optimization methods in aligning energy consumption with renewable energy generation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mass production and the practical number of cryogenic quantum devices producible in a single chip are limited to the number of electrical contact pads and wiring of the cryostat or dilution refrigerator. It is, therefore, beneficial to contrast the measurements of hundreds of devices fabricated in a single chip in one cooldown process to promote the scalability, integrability, reliability, and reproducibility of quantum devices and to save evaluation time, cost and energy. Here, we use a cryogenic on-chip multiplexer architecture and investigate the statistics of the 0.7 anomaly observed on the first three plateaus of the quantized conductance of semiconductor quantum point contact (QPC) transistors. Our single chips contain 256 split gate field effect QPC transistors (QFET) each, with two 16-branch multiplexed source-drain and gate pads, allowing individual transistors to be selected, addressed and controlled through an electrostatic gate voltage process. A total of 1280 quantum transistors with nano-scale dimensions are patterned in 5 different chips of GaAs heterostructures. From the measurements of 571 functioning QPCs taken at temperatures T= 1.4 K and T= 40 mK, it is found that the spontaneous polarisation model and Kondo effect do not fit our results. Furthermore, some of the features in our data largely agreed with van Hove model with short-range interactions. Our approach provides further insight into the quantum mechanical properties and microscopic origin of the 0.7 anomaly in QPCs, paving the way for the development of semiconducting quantum circuits and integrated cryogenic electronics, for scalable quantum logic control, readout, synthesis, and processing applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a method to upper-bound extreme-values of time-windowed risks for stochastic processes. Examples of such risks include the maximum average or 90\% quantile of the current along a transmission line in any 5-minute window. This work casts the time-windowed risk analysis problem as an infinite-dimensional linear program in occupation measures. In particular, we employ the coherent risk measures of the mean and the expected shortfall (conditional value at risk) to define the maximal time-windowed risk along trajectories. The infinite-dimensional linear program must then be truncated into finite-dimensional optimization problems, such as by using the moment-sum of squares hierarchy of semidefinite programs. The infinite-dimensional linear program will have the same optimal value as the original nonconvex risk estimation task under compactness and regularity assumptions, and the sequence of semidefinite programs will converge to the true value under additional properties of algebraic characterization. The scheme is demonstrated for</description>

      <title>Algebraic Proofs of Path Disconnectedness using Time-Dependent Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two subsets of a given set are path-disconnected if they lie in different connected components of the larger set. Verification of path-disconnectedness is essential in proving the infeasibility of motion planning and trajectory optimization algorithms. We formulate path-disconnectedness as the infeasibility of a single-integrator control task to move between an initial set and a target set in a sufficiently long time horizon. This control-infeasibility task is certified through the generation of a time-dependent barrier function that separates the initial and final sets. The existence of a time-dependent barrier function is a necessary and sufficient condition for path-disconnectedness under compactness conditions. Numerically, the search for a polynomial barrier function is formulated using the moment-sum-of-squares hierarchy of semidefinite programs. The barrier function proves path-disconnectedness at a sufficiently large polynomial degree. The computational complexity of these semidefinite programs can be reduced by elimination of the control variables. Disconnectedness proofs are synthesized for example systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.09743v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Real-world network systems are inherently dynamic, with network topologies undergoing continuous changes over time. External control signals can be applied to a designated set of nodes within a network, known as the Minimum Driver Set (MDS), to steer the network from any state to a desired one. However, the efficacy of the incumbent MDS may diminish as the network topologies evolve. Previous research has often overlooked this challenge, assuming foreknowledge of future changes in network topologies. In reality, the evolution of network topologies is typically unpredictable, rendering the control of dynamic networks exceptionally challenging. Here, we introduce adaptive control - a novel approach to dynamically construct a series of MDSs to accommodate variations in network topology without prior knowledge. We present an efficient algorithm for adaptive control that minimizes adjustments to MDSs and overall control costs throughout the control period. Extensive experimental evaluation on synthetic and real dynamic networks demonstrated our algorithm's superior performance over several state-of-the-art methods. Adaptive control is general and broadly applicable to various applications in diverse fields.</description>

      <title>Model Consistency for Mechanical Design: Bridging Lumped and Distributed Parameter Models with A Priori Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.07082v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Engineering design often involves representation in at least two levels of abstraction: the system-level, represented by lumped parameter models (LPMs), and the geometric-level, represented by distributed parameter models (DPMs). Functional design innovation commonly occurs at the system-level, followed by a geometric-level realization of functional LPM components. However, comparing these two levels in terms of behavioral outcomes can be challenging and time-consuming, leading to delays in design translations between system and mechanical engineers.
  In this paper, we propose a simulation-free scheme that compares LPMs and spatially-discretized DPMs based on their model specifications and behaviors of interest, regardless of modeling languages and numerical methods. We adopt a model order reduction (MOR) technique that a priori guarantees accuracy, stability, and convergence to improve the computational efficiency of large-scale models. Our approach is demonstrated through the model consistency analysis of several mechanical designs, showing its validity, efficiency, and generality. Our method provides a systematic way to compare system-level and geometric-level designs, improving reliability and facilitating design translation.</description>

      <title>BONES: Near-Optimal Neural-Enhanced Video Streaming</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.09920v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accessing high-quality video content can be challenging due to insufficient and unstable network bandwidth. Recent advances in neural enhancement have shown promising results in improving the quality of degraded videos through deep learning. Neural-Enhanced Streaming (NES) incorporates this new approach into video streaming, allowing users to download low-quality video segments and then enhance them to obtain high-quality content without violating the playback of the video stream. We introduce BONES, an NES control algorithm that jointly manages the network and computational resources to maximize the quality of experience (QoE) of the user. BONES formulates NES as a Lyapunov optimization problem and solves it in an online manner with near-optimal performance, making it the first NES algorithm to provide a theoretical performance guarantee. Comprehensive experimental results indicate that BONES increases QoE by 5\% to 20\% over state-of-the-art algorithms with minimal overhead.

      <title>Exploring the Influence of Driving Context on Lateral Driving Style Preferences: A Simulator-Based Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14432v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Technological advancements focus on developing comfortable and acceptable driving characteristics in autonomous vehicles. Present driving functions predominantly possess predefined parameters, and there is no universally accepted driving style for autonomous vehicles. While driving may be technically safe and the likelihood of road accidents is reduced, passengers may still feel insecure due to a mismatch in driving styles between the human and the autonomous system. Incorporating driving style preferences into automated vehicles enhances acceptance, reduces uncertainty, and poses the opportunity to expedite their adoption. Despite the increased research focus on driving styles, there remains a need for comprehensive studies investigating how variations in the driving context impact the assessment of automated driving functions. Therefore, this work evaluates lateral driving style preferences for autonomous vehicles on rural roads, considering different weather and traffic situations. A controlled study was conducted with a variety of German participants utilizing a high-fidelity driving simulator. The subjects experienced four different driving styles, including mimicking of their own driving behavior under two weather conditions. A notable preference for a more passive driving style became evident based on statistical analyses of participants' responses during and after the drives. This study could not confirm the hypothesis that subjects prefer to be driven by mimicking their own driving behavior. Furthermore, the study illustrated that weather conditions and oncoming traffic substantially influence the perceived comfort during autonomous rides. The gathered dataset is openly accessible at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jhaselberger/idcld-subject-study-on-driving-style-preferences.</description>

Abstract: This work analyzes unobservable directions of Vision-aided Inertial Navigation System (VINS) and Lidar-aided Inertial Navigation System (LINS) nonlinear model. Under the assumption that there exist two features observed by the camera without occlusion, the unobservable directions of VINS are uniformly globally translation and global rotations about the gravity vector. The unobservable directions of LINS are same as VINS, while only one feature need to be observed. Also, a constraint in Observability-Constrained VINS (OC-VINS) is proved.</description>

      <title>Discovering Closed-Loop Failures of Vision-Based Controllers via Reachability Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.02736v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning driven image-based controllers allow robotic systems to take intelligent actions based on the visual feedback from their environment. Understanding when these controllers might lead to system safety violations is important for their integration in safety-critical applications and engineering corrective safety measures for the system. Existing methods leverage simulation-based testing (or falsification) to find the failures of vision-based controllers, i.e., the visual inputs that lead to closed-loop safety violations. However, these techniques do not scale well to the scenarios involving high-dimensional and complex visual inputs, such as RGB images. In this work, we cast the problem of finding closed-loop vision failures as a Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability problem. Our approach blends simulation-based analysis with HJ reachability methods to compute an approximation of the backward reachable tube (BRT) of the system, i.e., the set of unsafe states for the system under vision-based controllers. Utilizing the BRT, we can tractably and systematically find the system states and corresponding visual inputs that lead to closed-loop failures. These visual inputs can be subsequently analyzed to find the input characteristics that might have caused the failure. Besides its scalability to high-dimensional visual inputs, an explicit computation of BRT allows the proposed approach to capture non-trivial system failures that are difficult to expose via random simulations. We demonstrate our framework on two case studies involving an RGB image-based neural network controller for (a) autonomous indoor navigation, and (b) autonomous aircraft taxiing.</description>

      <title>Verification of Neural Reachable Tubes via Scenario Optimization and Conformal Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08604v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning-based approaches for controlling safety-critical systems are rapidly growing in popularity; thus, it is important to assure their performance and safety. Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis is a popular formal verification tool for providing such guarantees, since it can handle general nonlinear system dynamics, bounded adversarial system disturbances, and state and input constraints. However, its computational and memory complexity scales exponentially with the state dimension, making it intractable for large-scale systems. To overcome this challenge, neural approaches, such as DeepReach, have been used to synthesize reachable tubes and safety controllers for high-dimensional systems. However, verifying these neural reachable tubes remains challenging. In this work, we propose two verification methods, based on robust scenario optimization and conformal prediction, to provide probabilistic safety guarantees for neural reachable tubes. Our methods allow a direct trade-off between resilience to outlier errors in the neural tube, which are inevitable in a learning-based approach, and the strength of the probabilistic safety guarantee. Furthermore, we show that split conformal prediction, a widely used method in the machine learning community for uncertainty quantification, reduces to a scenario-based approach, making the two methods equivalent not only for verification of neural reachable tubes but also more generally. To our knowledge, our proof is the first in the literature to show a strong relationship between conformal prediction and scenario optimization. Finally, we propose an outlier-adjusted verification approach that uses the error distribution in neural reachable tubes to recover greater safe volumes. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approaches for the high-dimensional problems of multi-vehicle collision avoidance and rocket landing with no-go zones.</description>

Abstract: Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems are a major driver of energy consumption in commercial and residential buildings. Recent studies have shown that Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms can outperform traditional reactive controllers. However, DRL-based solutions are generally designed for ad hoc setups and lack standardization for comparison. To fill this gap, this paper provides a critical and reproducible evaluation, in terms of comfort and energy consumption, of several state-of-the-art DRL algorithms for HVAC control. The study examines the controllers' robustness, adaptability, and trade-off between optimization goals by using the Sinergym framework. The results obtained confirm the potential of DRL algorithms, such as SAC and TD3, in complex scenarios and reveal several challenges related to generalization and incremental learning.</description>

      <title>Looking back and forward: A retrospective and future directions on Software Engineering for systems-of-systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16740v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern systems are increasingly connected and more integrated with other existing systems, giving rise to \textit{systems-of-systems} (SoS). An SoS consists of a set of independent, heterogeneous systems that interact to provide new functionalities and accomplish global missions through emergent behavior manifested at runtime. The distinctive characteristics of SoS, when contrasted to traditional systems, pose significant research challenges within Software Engineering. These challenges motivate the need for a paradigm shift and the exploration of novel approaches for designing, developing, deploying, and evolving these systems. The \textit{International Workshop on Software Engineering for Systems-of-Systems} (SESoS) series started in 2013 to fill a gap in scientific forums addressing SoS from the Software Engineering perspective, becoming the first venue for this purpose. This article presents a study aimed at outlining the evolution and future trajectory of Software Engineering for SoS based on the examination of 57 papers spanning the 11 editions of the SESoS workshop (2013-2023). The study combined scoping review and scientometric analysis methods to categorize and analyze the research contributions concerning temporal and geographic distribution, topics of interest, research methodologies employed, application domains, and research impact. Based on such a comprehensive overview, this article discusses current and future directions in Software Engineering for SoS.</description>
