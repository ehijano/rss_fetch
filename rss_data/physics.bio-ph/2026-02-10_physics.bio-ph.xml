      <title>Emergence of Superintelligence from Collective Near-Critical Dynamics in Reentrant Neural Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superintelligence is commonly envisioned as a quantitative extrapolation of human cognitive abilities driven by scale and computational power. Here we show that qualitative transitions in intelligence instead arise as dynamical phase transitions governed by collective critical dynamics. Building on a unified dynamical field-theoretic framework for cognition, we demonstrate that progressive collective coupling generated by reentrant mixing drives the system toward an infrared critical regime in which an extensive band of slow collective modes emerges. This spectral condensation reorganizes cognitive dynamics from localized relaxation to coherent motion along emergent low-dimensional manifolds. Through numerical analysis of the time-scale density of states, we identify robust power-law scaling of collective relaxation rates with well-defined critical exponents, placing the system within the universality class of self-organized critical many-body dynamics. Criticality alone would generically lead to instability. We further show that homeostatic regulation introduces a gapped stabilizing direction that protects the collective critical sector, yielding a dynamically maintained meta-stable infrared phase in which long-lived inference trajectories persist without collapse. The coexistence of scale-free collective dynamics and global stabilization defines a protected sector-critical regime in which coherence and internal flexibility coexist. Superintelligence therefore corresponds to a distinct dynamical stability class--a self-organized critical phase embedded within a stabilized cognitive manifold--rather than a smooth quantitative continuation of existing cognitive systems.</description>

      <title>Cell strain-stiffening drives cell breakout from embedded spheroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how cells escape from embedded spheroids requires a mechanical framework linking stress generation within cells, across cells, and between cells and the surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM). We develop such a framework by coupling a 3D vertex model of a spheroid to a fibrous ECM network and deriving a 3D Cauchy stress tensor for deformable polyhedral cells, enabling direct cell-level stress quantification in three dimensions. We analyze maximum shear stress in solid-like and fluid-like spheroids: solid-like spheroids exhibit broader stress distributions and radial stress gradients, while fluid-like spheroids show lower stresses with weak spatial organization. Cell shape anisotropy is not generically aligned with principal stress directions, indicating that morphology alone is an unreliable proxy for mechanical state. We further demonstrate strain stiffening at the single-cell level, where elongation produces nonlinear increases in maximum shear stress, allowing boundary cells in otherwise low-stress, fluid-like spheroids to transiently generate forces sufficient to remodel the matrix. To connect strain-induced stress amplification to invasion modes, we introduce an extended 3D vertex model with explicit, tunable cell-cell adhesion springs. In this minimal mechanical framework, single-cell breakout results from strain stiffening combined with reduced adhesion, whereas multi-cell streaming additionally requires anisotropic adhesion strengthened along the elongation axis and weakened orthogonally. Together, these results identify distinct mechanical pathways coupling cell strain, stress amplification, and adhesion organization to spheroid invasion.</description>

      <title>Quo vadis biophotonics? Wearing serendipity and slow science as a badge of pride, and embracing biology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article is a reflection on the themes of the Faraday Discussion meeting on "Biological and bio-inspired optics" held from 20 to 22 July 2020. It is a personal perspective on the nature of this field as a broad and interdisciplinary field that has led to a sound understanding of the material properties of biological nanostructured and optical materials. The article describes how the nature of the field and the themes of the conference are reflected in particular in work on the 3D bicontinuous biophotonic nanostructures known as single gyroids and in bicontinuous structures more broadly. Such single gyroid materials are found for example in the butterfly Thecla opisena, where the questions of biophotonic response, of bio-inspired optics, of the relationship between structure and function, and of the relationship between natural and synthetic realisations are closely interlinked. This multitude of facets of research on single gyroid structures reflects the beauty of the broader field of biophotonics, namely as a field that lives through embracing the serendipitous discovery of the biophotonic marvels that nature offers to us as seeds for in-depth analysis and understanding. The meandering nature of its discoveries, and the need to accept the slowness that comes from exploration of intellectually new or foreign territory, mean that the field shares some traits with biological evolution itself. Looking into the future, I consider that a closer engagement with living tissue and with the biological questions of function and formation, rather than with the materials science of biological materials, will help ensure the continuing great success of this field.</description>

      <title>Denoise Stepwise Signals by Diffusion Model Based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stepwise signals are ubiquitous in single-molecule detections, where abrupt changes in signal levels typically correspond to molecular conformational changes or state transitions. However, these features are inevitably obscured by noise, leading to uncertainty in estimating both signal levels and transition points. Traditional frequency-domain filtering is ineffective for denoising stepwise signals, as edge-related high-frequency components strongly overlap with noise. Although Hidden Markov Model-based approaches are widely used, they rely on stationarity assumptions and are not specifically designed for signal denoising. Here, we propose a diffusion model-based algorithm for stepwise signal denoising, named the Stepwise Signal Diffusion Model (SSDM). During training, SSDM learns the statistical structure of stepwise signals via a forward diffusion process that progressively adds noise. In the following reverse process, the model reconstructs clean signals from noisy observations, integrating a multi-scale convolutional network with an attention mechanism. Training data are generated by simulating stepwise signals through a Markov process with additive Gaussian noise. Across a broad range of signal-to-noise ratios, SSDM consistently outperforms traditional methods in both signal level reconstruction and transition point detection. Its effectiveness is further demonstrated on experimental data from single-molecule Forster Resonance Energy Transfer and nanopore DNA translocation measurements. Overall, SSDM provides a general and robust framework for recovering stepwise signals in various single-molecule detections and other physical systems exhibiting discrete state transitions.</description>

      <title>Information bounds the robustness of self-organized systems</title>

Abstract: Self-organized systems, from synthetic nanostructures to developing organisms, are composed of fluctuating units capable of forming robust functional structures despite noise. Here, we ask: are there fundamental bounds on the robustness of noisy self-organized systems? By viewing self-organization as noisy encoding, we prove that the positional information capacity of short-range classical systems with discrete states obeys a bound reminiscent of area laws for quantum information. We illustrate this principle with lattice models whose dynamics is captured by continuum models derived using exact coarse-graining techniques and validated through Dynamical Renormalization Group calculations. The universal bound is saturated by fine-tuning transport coefficients, which can be rationalized in the continuum limit upon considering the effects of boundaries on domain wall dynamics. We illustrate how this limit can be bypassed when long-range correlations are present by investigating a wave-pinning model motivated by biological mechanisms. In this class of models, global constraints reduce the need for fine-tuning by providing effective integral feedback. Our work identifies fundamental limits for the ability of natural and synthetic microsystems to self-assemble into patterns and rationalizes them on purely information-theoretic grounds.</description>

      <title>Chitosan/alginate bionanocomposites adorned with mesoporous silica nanoparticles for bone tissue engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22192v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The regeneration of oral and craniofacial bone defects ranging from minor periodontal and peri-implant defects to large and critical lesions imposes a substantial global health burden. Conventional therapies are associated with several limitations, highlighting the development of a unique treatment strategy, such as tissue engineering. A well-designed scaffold for bone tissue engineering should possess biocompatibility, biodegradability, mechanical strength, and osteoconductivity. For this purpose, mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) were synthesized and incorporated at different ratios (10, 20, and 30%) into alginate/chitosan (Alg/Chit)-based porous composite scaffolds fabricated through the freeze-drying method. The MSN incorporation significantly improved the mechanical strength of the scaffolds while showing a negligible decreasing effect on the porosity. All of the samples showed desirable swelling behaviors, which is beneficial for cell attachment and proliferation. The MSN-containing scaffolds indicated a decreased hydrolytic degradation in an MSN percentage-dependent manner. The fabricated scaffolds did not depict cytotoxic characteristics. The Alg/Chit/MSN30 scaffolds not only showed noncytotoxic properties, but also increased the cell viability significantly compared to the control group. The biomineralization properties of the MSN-containing nanocomposite scaffolds were significantly higher than the Alg/Chit composite, suggesting the potential of these nanoparticles for bone tissue engineering applications. Taken together, it is concluded that the Alg/Chit/ MSN30 scaffolds are considerable substances for bone tissue regeneration, and MSN has a great tissue engineering potential in addition to its extensive biomedical applications.</description>
