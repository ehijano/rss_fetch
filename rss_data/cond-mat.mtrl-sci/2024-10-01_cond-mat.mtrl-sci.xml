      <title>Equilibrium non-linear phononics by electric field fluctuations of terahertz cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Selective excitation of vibrational modes using strong laser pulses has emerged as a powerful material engineering paradigm. However, to realize deterministic control over material properties for device applications, it is desirable to have an analogous scheme without a drive, operating in thermal equilibrium. We here propose such an equilibrium analog of the light-driven paradigm, leveraging the strong coupling between lattice degrees of freedom and the quantum fluctuations of the electric field of a THz micro-cavity. We demonstrate this approach by showing, using \textit{ab initio} data, how electric field fluctuations can induce a sub-dominant ferromagnetic order, on top of the dominant zig-zag antiferromagnet order, in FePS$_3$ close to its N\'eel temperature.</description>

      <title>A combined Quantum Monte Carlo and DFT study of the strain response and magnetic properties of two-dimensional (2D) 1T-VSe$_2$ with charge density wave</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) 1T-VSe$_2$ has prompted significant interest due to the discrepancies regarding alleged ferromagnetism (FM) at room temperature, charge density wave (CDW) states and the interplay between the two. We employed a combined Diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) and density functional theory (DFT) approach to accurately investigate the magnetic properties and response of strain of monolayer 1T-VSe$_2$. Our calculations show the delicate competition between various phases, revealing critical insights into the relationship between their energetic and structural properties. We went on to perform Classical Monte Carlo simulations informed by our DMC and DFT results, and found the magnetic transition temperature ($T_c$) of the undistorted (non-CDW) FM phase to be 228 K and the distorted (CDW) phase to be 68 K. Additionally, we studied the response of biaxial strain on the energetic stability and magnetic properties of various phases of 2D 1T-VSe$_2$ and found that small amounts of strain can enhance the $T_c$, suggesting a promising route for engineering and enhancing magnetic behavior. Finally, we synthesized 1T-VSe$_2$ and performed Raman spectroscopy measurements, which were in close agreement with our calculated results. Our work emphasizes the role of highly accurate DMC methods in advancing the understanding of monolayer 1T-VSe$_2$ and provides a robust framework for future studies of 2D magnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Generative deep learning for the inverse design of materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In addition to the forward inference of materials properties using machine learning, generative deep learning techniques applied on materials science allow the inverse design of materials, i.e., assessing the composition-processing-(micro-)structure-property relationships in a reversed way. In this review, we focus on the (micro-)structure-property mapping, i.e., crystal structure-intrinsic property and microstructure-extrinsic property, and summarize comprehensively how generative deep learning can be performed. Three key elements, i.e., the construction of latent spaces for both the crystal structures and microstructures, generative learning approaches, and property constraints, are discussed in detail. A perspective is given outlining the challenges of the existing methods in terms of computational resource consumption, data compatibility, and yield of generation.</description>

      <title>Stable diffusion for the inverse design of microstructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In materials science, microstructures and their associated extrinsic properties are critical for engineering advanced structural and functional materials, yet their robust reconstruction and generation remain significant challenges. In this work, we developed a microstructure generation model based on the Stable Diffusion (SD) model, training it on a dataset of 576,000 2D synthetic microstructures containing both phase and grain orientation information. This model was applied to a range of tasks, including microstructure reconstruction, interpolation, inpainting, and generation. Experimental results demonstrate that our image-based approach can analyze and generate complex microstructural features with exceptional statistical and morphological fidelity. Additionally, by integrating the ControlNet fine-tuning model, we achieved the inverse design of microstructures based on specific properties. Compared to conventional methods, our approach offers greater accuracy, efficiency, and versatility, showcasing its generative potential in exploring previously uncharted microstructures and paving the way for data-driven development of advanced materials with tailored properties.</description>

      <title>Failure process of fiber bundles with random misalignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the failure process of fiber bundles with structural disorder represented by the random misalignment of fibers. The strength of fibers is assumed to be constant so that misalignment is the only source of disorder, which results in a heterogeneous load distribution over fibers. We show by analytical calculations and computer simulations that increasing the amount of structural disorder a transition occurs from a perfectly brittle behaviour with abrupt global failure to a quasi-brittle phase where failure is preceded by breaking avalanches. The size distribution of avalanches follows a power law functional form with a complex dependence of the exponent on the amount of disorder. In the vicinity of the critical point the avalanche exponent is 3/2, however, with increasing disorder a crossover emerges to a higher exponent 5/2. We show analytically that the mechanical behaviour of the bundle of misaligned fiber with no strength disorder can be mapped to an equal load sharing fiber bundle of perfectly aligned fibers with properly selected strength disorder.</description>

      <title>Melting of atomic hydrogen and deuterium with path-integral Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the melting line of atomic hydrogen and deuterium up to 900 GPa with path-integral Monte Carlo using a machine-learned interatomic potential. We improve upon previous simulations of melting by treating the electrons with reptation quantum Monte Carlo, and by performing solid and liquid simulations using isothermal-isobaric path-integral Monte Carlo. The resulting melting line for atomic hydrogen is higher than previous estimates. There is a small but resolvable decrease in the melting temperature as pressure is increased, which can be attributed to quantum effects.</description>

      <title>The Role of the Dopant in the Electronic Structure of Erbium-Doped \ch{TiO2} for Quantum Emit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Erbium-doped \ch{TiO2} materials are promising candidates for advancing quantum technologies, necessitating a thorough understanding of their electronic and crystal structures to tailor their properties and enhance coherence times. This study explored epitaxial erbium-doped rutile \ch{TiO2} films deposited on r-sapphire substrates using molecular beam epitaxy. Photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy demonstrated decreasing fluorescence lifetimes with erbium doping, indicating limited coherence times. Lattice distortions associated with \ch{Er^{3+}} were probed by X-ray absorption spectroscopy, indicating that erbium primarily occupies \ch{Ti^{4+}} sites and influences oxygen vacancies. Significant lattice distortions in the higher-order shells and full coordination around erbium suggest that additional defects are likely prevalent in these regions. These findings indicate that defects contribute to limited coherence times by introducing alternative decay pathways, leading to shorter fluorescence lifetimes.</description>

      <title>Magnons from time-dependent density-functional perturbation theory and the noncollinear Hubbard formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin excitations play a fundamental role in understanding magnetic properties of materials, and have significant technological implications for magnonic devices. However, accurately modeling these in transition-metal and rare-earth compounds remains a formidable challenge. Here, we present a fully first-principles approach for calculating spin-waves spectra based on time-dependent (TD) density-functional perturbation theory (DFPT), using Hubbard functionals in a noncollinear formulation. Unlike methods that rely on empirical Hubbard $U$ parameters to describe the ground state and Heisenberg Hamiltonians for describing magnetic excitations, the methodology developed here probes directly the dynamical spin susceptibility (efficiently evaluated with TDDFPT throught the Liouville-Lanczos approach), and treats the linear variation of the Hubbard augmentation (in itself calculated non empirically) in full at a self-consistent level. We benchmark the novel computational scheme on prototypical transition-metal monoxides NiO and MnO, showing remarkable agreement with experiments and highlighting the pivotal role of these newly implemented Hubbard corrections. The method holds great promise for describing collective spin excitations in complex materials containing localized electronic states.</description>

      <title>Magnetization Plateaus by the Field-Induced Partitioning of Spin Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To search for a conceptual picture describing the magnetization plateau phenomenon, we surveyed the crystal structures and the spin lattices of those magnets exhibiting plateaus in their magnetization vs. magnetic field curves by probing the three questions: (a) why only certain magnets exhibit magnetization plateaus, (b) why there occur several different types of magnetization plateaus, and (c) what controls the widths of magnetization plateaus. We show that the answers to these questions lie in how the magnets under field absorb Zeeman energy hence changing their magnetic structures. The magnetic structure of a magnet insulator is commonly described in terms of its spin lattice, which requires the determination of the spin exchanges nonnegligible strengths between the magnetic ions. Our work strongly suggests that a magnet under magnetic field partitions its spin lattice into antiferromagnetic (AFM) or ferrimagnetic fragments by breaking its weak magnetic bonds. Our supposition of the field-induced partitioning of spin lattice into magnetic fragments is supported by the anisotropic magnetization plateaus of Ising magnets and by the highly anisotropic width of the 1/3-magnetization plateau in azurite. The answers to the three questions (a) - (c) emerge naturally by analyzing how these fragments are formed under magnetic field.</description>

      <title>A Universal Deep Learning Framework for Materials X-ray Absorption Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) is a powerful characterization technique for probing the local chemical environment of absorbing atoms. However, analyzing XAS data presents with significant challenges, often requiring extensive, computationally intensive simulations, as well as significant domain expertise. These limitations hinder the development of fast, robust XAS analysis pipelines that are essential in high-throughput studies and for autonomous experimentation. We address these challenges with a suite of transfer learning approaches for XAS prediction, each uniquely contributing to improved accuracy and efficiency, as demonstrated on K-edge spectra database covering eight 3d transition metals (Ti-Cu). Our framework is built upon three distinct strategies. First, we use M3GNet to derive latent representations of the local chemical environment of absorption sites as input for XAS prediction, achieving up to order-of-magnitude improvements over conventional featurization techniques. Second, we employ a hierarchical transfer learning strategy, training a universal multi-task model across elements before fine-tuning for element-specific predictions. This cascaded approach after element-wise fine-turning yields models that outperform element-specific models by up to 31\%. Third, we implement cross-fidelity transfer learning, adapting a universal model to predict spectra generated by simulation of a different fidelity with a much higher computational cost. This approach improves prediction accuracy by up to 24\% over models trained on the target fidelity alone. Our approach is extendable to XAS prediction for a broader range of elements and offers a generalizable transfer learning framework to enhance other deep-learning models in materials science.</description>

      <title>Octupole topological insulating phase in Brillouin three-dimensional real projective space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in quantum polarization theory have propelled the exploration of topological insulators (TIs) into the realm of higher-order systems, leading to the study of the celebrated two-dimensional (2D) quadrupole and three-dimensional (3D) octupole TIs. Traditionally, these topological phases have been associated with the toroidal topology of the conventional Brillouin zone (BZ). This Letter reports on the discovery of a novel octupole topological insulating phase emerging within the framework of the Brillouin 3D real projective space ($\mathbb{RP}^3$). We theoretically propose the model and its corresponding topological invariant, experimentally construct this insulator within a topological circuit framework, and capture the octupole insulating phase as a localized impedance peak at the circuit's corner. Furthermore, our $\mathbb{RP}^3$ circuit stands out as a pioneering 3D model to simultaneously exhibit both intrinsic, termination-independent symmetry-protected topological phases (SPTPs) and extrinsic, termination-dependent boundary-obstructed topological phases (BOTPs), which broadly encompass 2D surface-obstructed topological phases (SOTPs) and 1D hinge-obstructed topological phases (HOTPs). Our results broaden the topological landscape and provide insights into the band theory within the manifold of the Brillouin $\mathbb{RP}^3$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The structure of an Al(111)3x3-Si surface was examined by combining data from positron diffraction and core-level photoemission spectroscopy. Analysis of the diffraction rocking curves indicated that the overlayer had a flat honeycomb lattice structure. Simulations of Si core-level spectra calculated via the first-principles indicated that one of the Si atoms in the unit cell was replaced by an Al atom. The surface superstructure was thus a two-dimensional layer of Al-embedded silicene on Al(111).</description>

      <title>Ferroelectricity-Driven Metallicity and Magnetic Skyrmions in van der Waals Cr2Ge2Te6/Hf2Ge2Te6 Multiferroic Heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) multiferroic heterostructures present a promising platform for advanced spin devices by leveraging the coexisting ferromagnetic (FM) and ferroelectric (FE) orders. Through first-principles calculations and micromagnetic simulations, we reveal non-volatile control of metallicity and topological spin textures in the Cr2Ge2Te6/Hf2Ge2Te6(CGT/HGT) heterostructure. Notably, manipulating ferroelectric polarization in HGT significantly modulates the magnetic anisotropy energy (MAE) and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) of CGT/HGT, reversing the easy magnetization axis from in-plane to out-of-plane. By analyzing the atomic-resolved SOC energy (\Delta Esoc), it is found that the cause of the change comes from the Fert-Levy mechanism. Additionally, this polarization control enables the creation and annihilation of bimerons and skyrmions, with interlayer sliding further altering magnetic ordering. Our findings offer valuable insights into magnetoelectric coupling and spin texture manipulation in 2D magnets, highlighting their potential for next-generation spintronic and memory devices.</description>

      <title>Emergence of reentrant structural modulations far beyond the thermal limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A single material can exist in different states, with solids, liquids, and gases being the most familiar examples. In materials, these states can exhibit periodic structures spanning from atomic to macroscopic length scales. The conventional wisdom is that a low-symmetry periodic structure transitions into a high-symmetry structure as temperature increases beyond the critical point, which is defined by a thermal limit. In this work, we demonstrate an unforeseen emergence of low-symmetry modulated structures with a reentrant phase in nanoflakes of two-dimensional TaCo2Te2 far beyond their thermal limit, using in-situ heating transmission electron microscopy. We contend that entropy can drive the reappearance of structural modulations, consistent with predicted dynamic structural instabilities in undistorted TaCo2Te2, and further supported by Raman measurements. These findings not only reveal unexpected phase transitions in a crystalline material but also present a new pathway for creating novel ordered phases in low-dimensional systems.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To effectively track and manipulate topological solitons (e.g. skyrmions) are the key challenge before their applications. Inspired by the idea of sliding ferroelectricity, here a general strategy is proposed to print magnetic skyrmions to electric skyrmions in van der Waals bilayers. Through the proximate interactions, there is an isoperiodic bijection relationship between local dipoles and spin moments. This magnetoelectric imprint effect not only extends the strategies to create electric skyrmions, but also leads to an approach for all-electrical readout/manipulation of magnetic skyrmions.</description>

      <title>Perspective: imaging atomic step geometry to determine surface terminations of kagome materials and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we review scanning tunneling microscopy research on the surface determination for various types of kagome materials, including 11-type (CoSn, FeSn, FeGe), 32-type (Fe3Sn2), 13-type (Mn3Sn), 135-type (AV3Sb5, A = K, Rb, Cs), 166-type (TbMn6Sn6, YMn6Sn6 and ScV6Sn6), and 322-type (Co3Sn2S2 and Ni3In2Se2). We first demonstrate that the measured step height between different surfaces typically deviates from the expected value of +-0.4~0.8A, which is owing to the tunneling convolution effect with electronic states and becomes a serious issue for Co3Sn2S2 where the expected Sn-S interlayer distance is 0.6A. Hence, we put forward a general methodology for surface determination as atomic step geometry imaging, which is fundamental but also experimentally challenging to locate the step and to image with atomic precision. We discuss how this method can be used to resolve the surface termination puzzle in Co3Sn2S2. This method provides a natural explanation for the existence of adatoms and vacancies, and beyond using unknown impurity states, we propose and use designer layer-selective substitutional chemical markers to confirm the validity of this method. Finally, we apply this method to determine the surface of a new kagome material Ni3In2Se2, as a cousin of Co3Sn2S2, and we image the underlying kagome geometry on the determined Se surface above the kagome layer, which directly visualizes the p-d hybridization physics. We emphasize that this general method does not rely on theory, but the determined surface identity can provide guidelines for first-principles calculations with adjustable parameters on the surface-dependent local density of states and quasi-particle interference patterns.</description>

      <title>Autonomous tip-induced chemical reactions in scanning probe microscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scanning Probe Microscopy (SPM) techniques have shown great potential in fabricating nanoscale structures endowed with exotic quantum properties achieved through various manipulations of atoms and molecules. However, the selection of proper manipulation parameters requires extensive domain knowledge, which is not necessarily transferable to new systems. Therefore, efficient and autonomous SPM techniques are needed to reduce the reliance on user supervision and learn optimal strategies for new systems, in particular for the challenge of controlling chemical reactions. In this paper, we developed a software infrastructure named AutoOSS (Autonomous On-Surface Synthesis) to automate bromine removal from Zn(II)-5,15- bis(4-bromo-2,6-dimethylphenyl)porphyrin (ZnBr2Me4DPP) on Au(111), using neural network models to interpret STM outputs and deep reinforcement learning models to optimize manipulation parameters. This is further supported by Bayesian Optimization Structure Search (BOSS) and Density Functional Theory (DFT) computations to explore 3D structures and reaction mechanisms based on STM images.</description>

      <title>Phase Composition of AlTiNbMoV, AlTiNbTaZr and AlTiNbMoCr Refractory Complex Concentrated Alloys: A Correlation of Predictions and Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing complex concentrated alloys (CCA), also known as high entropy alloys (HEA), requires reliable and accessible thermodynamic predictions due to vast space of possible compositions. Numerous semiempirical parameters have been developed for phase predictions over the years. However, in this paper we show that none of these parameters is a robust indicator of phase content in various refractory CCA. CALPHAD proved to be a more powerful tool for phase predictions, however, the predictions face several limitations. AlTiNbMoV, AlTiNbTaZr and AlTiNbMoCr alloys were prepared using blended elemental powder metallurgy. Their phase and chemical composition were investigated by the means of scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction. Apart from the minor contamination phases (Al2O3 and Ti(C,N,O)), AlTiNbMoV and AlTiNbMoCr exhibited single-phase solid solution microstructure at the homogenization temperature of 1400 {\deg}C, while Al3Zr5 based intermetallics were present in the AlTiNbTaZr alloy. None of the simple semiempirical parameter was able to predict phase content correctly in all three alloys. Predictions by CALPHAD (TCHEA4 database) were able to predict the phases with limited accuracy only. Critical limitation of the TCHEA4 database is that only binary and ternary phase diagrams are assessed and some more complex phases cannot be predicted.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-resolved terahertz spectroscopy is used to investigate formation and ultrafast long-distance propagation of electron-hole plasma in strongly photoexcited GaAs and InP. The observed phenomena involve fundamental interactions of electron-hole system with light, which manifest themselves in two different regimes: a coherent one with the plasma propagation speeds up to c/10 (in GaAs at 20 K) and an incoherent one reaching up to c/25 (in InP at 20 K), both over a macroscopic distance &gt; 100 micrometers. We explore a broad range of experimental conditions by investigating the two materials, by tuning their band gap with temperature and by controlling the interaction strength with the optical pump fluence. Our interpretation suggests that the observed phenomena should occur in most direct band semiconductors upon strong photoexcitation with low excess energy.</description>

      <title>Powder Ball Milling: An energy balance approach to particle size reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Milling of brittle materials shows a lower limit in size reduction, below which grinding cannot proceed further. Experimentally, the smallest particle size is determined by the milling media energy, and it is time-independent. Rittinger's law, which applies to fine grinding, does not consider any lower limit in size, leading to nonphysical results. A damping factor gradually inhibiting grinding efficiency has already been suggested as a modification. Milling mechanics and changes in material properties at small sizes have been associated to this behavior. In this work, the grinding inhibition is linked to an energy balance between the powder's specific surface energy and the energy density, calculated as the kinetic energy of the milling media divided by the impacted volume. By introducing the idea of energy equilibrium, comminution behaves as a phase transformation characterized by a JMAK kinetics. Validation of this formulation has been conducted on published and original data.</description>

      <title>Formation of martensitic microstructure in epitaxial Ni-Mn-Ga films after fast cooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shape memory alloys have a wide range of applications, including high stroke actuation, energy-efficient ferroic cooling, and energy harvesting. These applications are based on a reversible martensitic transformation, which results in a complex microstructure in the martensitic state. Understanding the formation of this microstructure after fast heating and cooling is crucial, as a high cycle frequency is essential for achieving high power density in the mentioned applications. This article uses an epitaxial Ni-Mn-Ga film as a model system to study the formation of the martensitic microstructure, since the high surface-to-volume ratio of thin films enables rapid heating and cooling, and since the formation of a multi-level hierarchical microstructure during slow cooling of this material system is already well understood. We apply a millisecond flash lamp pulse of varying energy density on the Ni-Mn-Ga film and analyse the hierarchical martensitic microstructure afterwards. Substantial differences compared to slow cooling occur, which we attribute to the limited time available for the microstructure to form and to the thermal stress between film and substrate during rapid temperature changes.</description>

      <title>Mechanical properties and deformation mechanisms of the C14 Laves and \mu-phase in the ternary Ta-Fe(-Al) system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As structural and functional materials, topologically close-packed (TCP) phases of transition metal compounds offer a wide range of attractive properties. Due to their complex crystal structure and the resulting brittleness, the knowledge on their mechanical behaviour is still very limited, especially below the brittle-to-ductile transition temperature. In this study, we systematically analyse the influence of composition and crystal structure on the mechanical properties and deformation mechanisms in the binary Ta-Fe system as well as in the ternary Ta-Fe-Al system as both systems contain a hexagonal C14 Laves and a mu-phase. We use nanoindentation, slip trace analysis and transmission electron microscopy to study the influence of crystal structure, composition and crystal orientation. The composition strongly influences the indentation modulus in the binary Ta-Fe system, showing a decreasing trend with increasing Ta content. The addition of Al, however, does not lead to a significant change of the mechanical properties of the ternary TCP phases. The investigation of the deformation mechanisms revealed that the Laves phase primarily deforms via non-basal slip while the basal plane is the favoured slip plane in the mu-phase. By partly replacing Fe with Al, the plasticity is not affected strongly, but the proportion of non-basal slip slightly increases for both ternary TCP phases compared to the binary ones.</description>

      <title>A quantitative model for the Frank-Read dislocation source based on pinned mean curvature flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces a quantitative model for the Frank-Read source, considered to be one of the most important micro-mechanical mechanisms of dislocation creation in crystalline materials. It has long been known that these sources create dislocations in a repetitive, oscillatory process, which is driven by an external shear force. Unlike the existing explanations in the literature, the model introduced in the present article is based on just a few simple physical principles, namely line tension and dislocation motion due to a single slip plane flow rule, together with a pinning constraint on the ends of the central dislocation line. A complete discretisation, including suitable re-meshing and 'topological cutting' algorithms, is described and simulation results are discussed. Despite its conceptual simplicity, the model and discretisation described in the present work yield remarkably accurate predictions about the shape and properties of the Frank-Read source. In particular, it is shown that only one dimensionless parameter controls the dynamics of the Frank-Read source if one neglects crystal anisotropy. This allows to derive an emergent law about the length of dislocation line generated per shear energy.</description>

      <title>Spin Excitations of High Spin Iron(II) in Metal-Organic Chains on Metal and Superconductor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many-body interactions in metal-organic frameworks are fundamental for emergent quantum physics. Unlike their solution counterpart, magnetization at surfaces in low-dimensional analogues is strongly influenced by magnetic anisotropy induced by the substrate and still not well understood. Here, we use on-surface coordination chemistry to synthesize on Ag(111) and superconducting Pb(111) an iron-based spin chain by using pyrene-4,5,9,10-tetraone precursors as ligands. Using low-temperature scanning probe microscopy, we compare their structures and low-energy spin excitations of coordinated Fe atoms with high S = 2 spin-state. Although the chain and coordination centers are identical on both substrates, the long-range spin-spin coupling due to a superexchange through the ligand observed on Ag is absent on Pb(111). We ascribe this reduction of spin-spin interactions on Pb to the depletion of electronic states around the Fermi level in the Pb(111) superconductor as compared to silver.</description>

      <title>Mode-Dependent Phonon Relaxation in fcc Ni: Insights from Molecular Dynamics Simulations with Frozen-Trajectory Excitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a computational study of phonon relaxation in face-centered cubic (fcc) nickel (Ni), focusing on ultra-fast magnetization dynamics. The phonons are excited beyond their thermal equilibrium population, and the relaxation behavior is analyzed as a function of both wave vector ($\vec{q}$) and phonon frequency ($\omega$). To efficiently investigate these excitations, we introduce a trajectory post-processing technique, the frozen-trajectory excitation, which facilitates the $(\vec{q},\omega)$-resolved analysis. Molecular dynamics simulations combined with the frozen-phonon multislice method predict relaxation signatures observable with time-resolved transmission electron microscopy (TEM) at 10 -- 20 fs resolution. Our findings indicate mode dependence in the relaxation processes, highlighting the importance of phonon-specific behavior consideration in ultrafast dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An equimolar NiCoFeCrGa high entropy alloy having dual-phase homogeneous components was studied, where the constituent phases exhibit distinct mechanical properties. Micropillars with various diameters were created from two differently heat treated samples, then they were compressed at slow strain rates, that revealed the material's limited sensitivity to size. On the other hand, increased strain rate sensitivity at high deformation speeds was observed, that differs substantially depending on the phase composition of the specimen. Dislocations within the two phases were studied by high resolution transmission electron microscopy and high angular resolution electron backscatter diffraction. The performed chemical analysis confirmed that slow cooling during casting create Cr-rich precipitates, that have significant impact on the global strength of the material.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20456v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnets are defined as magnetic states with fully compensated spin angular momenta (spins) and broken PT (P: parity, T: time reversal, PT: parity times time reversal) symmetry. We classify three kinds of altermagnets: Type-I: broken T symmetry and nonzero net magnetic moments, Type-II: broken T symmetry and zero net magnetic moments, and Type-III: unbroken T and broken P symmetries. Furthermore, strong altermagnets have spin split bands through exchange coupling in the non-relativistic limit, i.e., for zero spin-orbit coupling (SOC), and weak altermagnets has spin split bands only with non-zero SOC. These strong vs. weak altermagnets can be identified from the total number of symmetric orthogonal spin rotation operations. These classifications of altermagnets will be an essential guidance for the future research on altermagnetism.</description>

      <title>Orbital Hall effect in transition metals from first-principles scattering calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use first-principles scattering calculations based upon wave-function matching and implemented with a tight-binding MTO basis to evaluate the orbital Hall conductivity $\sigma_{\rm oH}$ for Ti, V, Cr, Cu and Pt metals with temperature-induced lattice disorder. Only interatomic fluxes of orbital angular momentum are included in these estimates; intraatomic fluxes which do not contribute to the transfer of angular momentum are explicitly excluded. The resistivity and orbital Hall angle are both found to be linear in temperature so $\sigma_{\rm oH}$ is at most weakly temperature dependent. The value of $\sigma_{\rm oH}$ we obtain for bulk Cr is $ \approx 2 \times 10^3 (\hbar/e) \, (\Omega \, {\rm cm})^{-1}$ which is substantially lower than previously obtained theoretical results but agrees well with experiment. In units of $10^3 (\hbar/e) (\Omega \, {\rm cm})^{-1}$, the values obtained for Ti, V and Pt are $5$, $6$ and $7$, respectively.</description>

      <title>Closing the reproducibility gap: 2D materials research</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 2D materials research has reached significant scientific milestones, accompanied by a rapidly growing industrial sector in the two decades since the field's inception. Such rapid progress requires pushing past the boundary of what is technically and scientifically feasible and carries the risk of disseminating irreproducible research results. This Expert Recommendation addresses the need for enhanced reproducibility in 2D materials science and physics. Through a comprehensive examination of the factors that affect reproducibility the authors present a set of concrete guidelines designed to improve the reliability of research results. The introduction of a Standardised Template for Experimental Procedures (STEP) offers a novel approach to documenting experimental details that are crucial for replication and troubleshooting. We emphasise the importance of involving stakeholders from research, industry, publishing, funding agencies, and policymaking to foster a culture of transparency, reliability, and trust without blind angles and critical oversights. By addressing systemic issues that hinder reproducibility and presenting actionable steps for improvement, we aim to pave the way for more robust research practices in 2D materials science, contributing to the field's scientific maturation and the subsequent development of beneficial technologies.</description>

      <title>The optimal vector phase matching conditions in biaxial crystalline materials determined by extreme surfaces method: the case of orthorhombic crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The optimal geometries of vector phase matching are determined for the cases of second harmonic, sum and difference frequency generation in a number of orthorhombic nonlinear optical crystals - KTP, KTA, KB5, KNbO3, LBO, CBO, LRB4. Extreme surface method was used to define wave vectors directions of highest possible generation efficiency. As it is shown, in a significant number of cases vector phase matching ensures higher efficiencies than the scalar one.</description>

      <title>Quantum Enhanced Josephson Junction Field-Effect Transistors for Logic Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Josephson junction field-effect transistors (JJFETs) have recently re-emerged as promising candidates for superconducting computing. For JJFETs to perform Boolean logic operations, the so-called gain factor $\alpha_{R}$ must be larger than 1. In a conventional JJFET made with a classical channel material, due to a gradual dependence of superconducting critical current on the gate bias, $\alpha_{R}$ is much smaller than 1. In this Letter, we propose a new device structure of quantum enhanced JJFETs in a zero-energy-gap InAs/GaSb heterostructure. We demonstrate that, due to an excitonic insulator quantum phase transition in this zero-gap heterostructure, the superconducting critical current displays a sharp transition as a function of gate bias, and the deduced gain factor $\alpha_{R}$ ~ 0.06 is more than 50 times that (~ 0.001) reported in a classical JJFET. Further optimization may allow achieving a gain factor larger than 1 for logic applications.</description>

      <title>Boosting SISSO Performance on Small Sample Datasets by Using Random Forests Prescreening for Complex Feature Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In materials science, data-driven methods accelerate material discovery and optimization while reducing costs and improving success rates. Symbolic regression is a key to extracting material descriptors from large datasets, in particular the Sure Independence Screening and Sparsifying Operator (SISSO) method. While SISSO needs to store the entire expression space to impose heavy memory demands, it limits the performance in complex problems. To address this issue, we propose a RF-SISSO algorithm by combining Random Forests (RF) with SISSO. In this algorithm, the Random Forest algorithm is used for prescreening, capturing non-linear relationships and improving feature selection, which may enhance the quality of the input data and boost the accuracy and efficiency on regression and classification tasks. For a testing on the SISSO's verification problem for 299 materials, RF-SISSO demonstrates its robust performance and high accuracy. RF-SISSO can maintain the testing accuracy above 0.9 across all four training sample sizes and significantly enhancing regression efficiency, especially in training subsets with smaller sample sizes. For the training subset with 45 samples, the efficiency of RF-SISSO was 265 times higher than that of original SISSO. As collecting large datasets would be both costly and time-consuming in the practical experiments, it is thus believed that RF-SISSO may benefit scientific researches by offering a high predicting accuracy with limited data efficiently.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the ODMR Signal of Organic Molecular Qubits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the fields of quantum information science and sensing, electron spins are often purified into a specific polarisation through an optical-spin interface, a process known as optically-detected magnetic resonance (ODMR). Diamond-NV centres and transition metals are both excellent platforms for these so-called colour centres, while metal-free molecular analogues are also gaining popularity for their extended polarisation lifetimes, milder environmental impacts, and reduced costs. In our earlier attempt at designing such organic high-spin $\pi$-diradicals, we proposed to spin-polarise by shelving triplet $M_{S}=\pm1$ populations as singlets. This was recently verified by experiments albeit with low ODMR contrasts of &lt;1% at temperatures above 5 K. In this work, we propose to improve the ODMR signal by moving singlet populations back into the triplet $M_{S}=0$ sublevel, designing a true carbon-based molecular analogue to the NV centre. To achieve both spin channels in $\pi$-diradicals, we leverage on weaker spin-orbit couplings beyond the nearest-neighbour approximation, made possible by careful control of orbital nodal structures and group-theoretical considerations. These analyses are further confirmed by ab initio calculations of a realistic trityl-based radical dimer. Microkinetic analyses point towards high ODMR contrasts of around 30% under experimentally-feasible conditions, a stark improvement from previous works. Finally, in our quest towards ground-state optically-addressable molecular spin qubits, we exemplify how our symmetry-based design avoids Zeeman-induced singlet-triplet mixings during electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) experiments, setting the scene for realising electron spin qubit gates.</description>

      <title>New measurement method for weak magnetic fields using magnetically induced deformation of chemical bonds in Co-CsPbBr3 quantum dots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The research on weak magnetic field detection is of great significance in advancing the development of bioscience, aerospace, chip manufacturing and other fields. However, the weak magnetic detecting still face some problems, including the large size of the detectors and the limited detection scale. To contribute to the detection of weak magnetic fields, the Co-CsPbBr3 colloidal quantum dots (QDs) composite magnetic material was synthesised on the basis of the theory of room temperature ferromagnetism, molecular polarisation and vibration level of chemical bond. The synthesis involved the mixing of Co2+ into CsPbBr3, an all-inorganic perovskite with activated ions. Subsequently, a weak magnetic field measurement system was devised, comprising working medium samples and a vibration level detection optical path. Following the acquisition, comparison, processing and analysis of multiple data sets, a Stokes displacement function model was established under different magnetic field sizes and the weak magnetic field intensity range of Pitsla (pT) was measured. The Pitsla weak magnetic field measurement system proposed in this paper provides a reference for the development of non-contact weak magnetic measurement methods and for the advancement of intelligent and low-dimensional weak signal measurement applications.</description>

      <title>Imaging the diffusive-to-ballistic crossover of magnetotransport in graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scanning tunneling potentiometry (STP) is used to probe the local, current-induced electrochemical potential of carriers in graphene near circular electrostatic barriers in an out-of-plane magnetic field ranging from 0 to 1.4 T. These measurements provide nanometer-resolved information about the local motion of carriers, revealing significant changes in carrier dynamics with increasing field strength. At low magnetic fields the electrochemical potential displays a spiral-like pattern, while at high fields it exhibits distinct changes at particular radii. We show that the observed behavior indicates a transition from diffusive to ballistic transport. Additionally, the sharp changes in the measured potential profile at high fields result from the `spirograph' motion of carriers, which creates a local enhancement of the Hall field one cyclotron diameter away from the semiclassical turning point near the electrostatic barrier.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Anisotropy Effect on Stabilizing Magnetization Plateaus of Kagome Strip Chain Heisenberg Antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the anisotropic effect of magnetization plateaus in the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on a kagome strip chain. The kagome strip chain Heisenberg model, composed of a hexagonal net of triangles forming five-site unit cells, exhibits four magnetization plateaus in the presence of an applied magnetic field. Using numerical density matrix renormalization group method, we find that the magnetization plateaus are stable against anisotropic interactions in the same direction of the applied magnetic field but the plateaus vanish with strong anisotropic interactions in other directions. We further analyze the stability of the magnetic plateaus with spin wave theory. The emergence of the lowest flat magnon band and its evolution with the anisotropic interactions can explain the robustness of magnetization plateaus, which is consistent with our numerical findings. In addition, upon tuning down the interaction strength for the two lower legs below a critical value, the kagome strip chain decouples into two spin chains, which can be used to determine the effective lattice structure in materials with strong distortions. Our results enhance the theoretical understanding of the anisotropic effect and the nature of magnetization plateaus in frustrated kagome lattice materials, which can contribute to the design and manipulation of kagome materials with tailored properties.</description>

      <title>The Discovery of Giant Positive Magnetoresistance in Proximity to Helimagnetic Order in Manganese Phosphide Nanostructured Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of magnetoresistance (MR) phenomena has been pivotal in advancing magnetic sensors and spintronic devices. Helimagnets present an intriguing avenue for spintronics research. Theoretical predictions suggest that MR magnitude in the helimagnetic (HM) regime surpasses that in the ferromagnetic (FM) regime by over an order of magnitude. However, in metallic helimagnets like manganese phosphide, MR in the HM phase remains modest (10%), limiting its application in MR devices. Here, a groundbreaking approach is presented to achieve a giant low field MR effect in nanostructured manganese phosphide films by leveraging confinement and strain effects along with spin helicity. Unlike the modest MR observed in bulk manganese phosphide single crystals and large grain polycrystalline films, which exhibit a small negative MR in the FM region (2%) increasing to 8% in the HM region across 10-300 K, a grain size-dependent giant positive MR (90%) is discovered near FM to HM transition temperature (110 K), followed by a rapid decline to a negative MR below 55 K in manganese phosphide nanocrystalline films. These findings illuminate a novel strain-mediated spin helicity phenomenon in nanostructured helimagnets, presenting a promising pathway for the development of high-performance MR sensors and spintronic devices through the strategic utilization of confinement and strain effects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The catalytic activities of high-spin small Fe(III) oxides have been investigated for efficient hydrogen production through ammonia decomposition, using the Artificial Force Induced Reaction (AFIR) method within the framework of density functional theory (DFT) with the B3LYP hybrid exchange-correlation functional. Our results reveal that the adsorption free energy of NH$_3$ on (Fe$_2$O$_3$)$_n$ ($n=1-4$) decreases with increasing cluster size up to $n=3$, followed by a slight increase at $n=4$. The strongest NH$_3$ adsorption energy, 33.68 kcal/mol, was found for Fe$_2$O$_3$, where NH$_3$ interacts with a two-coordinated Fe site, forming an Fe-N bond with a length of 2.11 \AA. A comparative analysis of NH$_3$ decomposition and H$_2$ formation on various Fe(III) oxide sizes identifies the rate-determining steps for each reaction. We found that the rate-determining step for the full NH$_3$ decomposition on (Fe$_2$O$_3$)$_n$ ($n=1-4$) is size-dependent, with the NH$^{*}$ $\rightleftharpoons$ N$^{*}$ + 3H$^{*}$ reaction acting as the limiting step for $n=1-3$. Additionally, our findings indicate that H$_2$ formation is favored following the partial decomposition of NH$_3$ on Fe(III) oxides.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Van der Waals heterostructures have emerged as a versatile platform to study correlated and topological electron physics. Spectroscopy experiments in the THz regime are crucial, since the energy of THz photons matches that of relevant excitations and charge dynamics. However, their micron-size and complex (dual-)gated structures have challenged such measurements. Here, we demonstrate on-chip THz spectroscopy on a dual-gated bilayer graphene device at liquid helium temperature. To avoid unwanted THz absorption by metallic gates, we developed a scheme of operation by combining semiconducting gates and optically controlled gating. This allows us to measure the clean THz response of graphene without being affected by the gates. We observed the THz signatures of electric-field-induced bandgap opening at the charge neutrality. We measured Drude conductivities at varied charge densities and extracted key parameters, including effective masses and scattering rates. This work paves the way for studying novel emergent phenomena in dual-gated two-dimensional materials.</description>

      <title>Doping Dependence of Upper Critical Field of High-Tc Cuprate Bi2+xSr2-xCaCu2O8+d Estimated from Irreversibility Field at Zero Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigated the temperature (T) dependence of the irreversibility field Hirr(T) in high-critical-temperature cuprate Bi2+xSr2-xCa1-yYyCu2O8+d (Bi-2212) single crystals over a wide range of hole doping level (p). Hirr(T) was evaluated by measuring the magnetization hysteresis loop. The value of Hirr(T) extrapolated to T = 0 K [Hirr(0)], is either equal to or sets the lower boundary for the upper critical field at T = 0 K [Hc2(0)]. Tc shows a parabolic p-dependence (peak at p = 0.16), whereas Hirr(0) increases monotonically with p by approximately one order of magnitude, from 19 T for the most underdoped sample (p = 0.065, Tc = 24 K) to 209 T for the most overdoped sample (p = 0.200, Tc = 75 K). The present results qualitatively agree with Hc2(0) values evaluated from the specific heat measurements. The observed p-dependence of Hirr(0) in Bi-2212 is distinct from those in YBa2Cu3O7-d and HgBa2CuO6+d, in which a pronounced dip structure appears in the underdoped region. Considering that the dip structures observed in these two systems are likely associated with the formation of competing orders (most likely field-induced charge orders), the present results indicate that the influence of the competing order in Bi-2212 is less prominent than that in the other two systems.</description>

      <title>Individually Addressable Nanoscale OLEDs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR), require miniaturized displays with ultrahigh pixel densities. Here, we demonstrate an individually addressable subwavelength OLED pixel based on a nanoscale electrode capable of supporting plasmonic modes. Our approach is based on the notion that when scaling down pixel size, the 2D planar geometry of conventional organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) evolves into a significantly more complex 3D geometry governed by sharp nanoelectrode contours. These cause (i) spatially imbalanced charge carrier transport and recombination, resulting in a low quantum efficiency, and (ii) filament growth, leading to rapid device failure. Here, we circumvent such effects by selectively covering sharp electrode contours with an insulating layer, while utilizing a nano-aperture in flat areas of the electrode. We thereby ensure controlled charge carrier injection and recombination at the nanoscale and suppress filament growth. As a proof of principle, we first demonstrate stable and efficient hole injection from Au nanoelectrodes in hole-only devices with above 90 % pixel yield and longtime operation stability and then a complete vertical OLED pixel with an individually addressable nanoelectrode (300 x 300 nm$^{2}$), highlighting the potential to further leverage plasmonic nanoantenna effects to enhance the performance and functionality of nano-OLEDs.</description>

      <title>Linear Magnetoresistance and Type-I Superconductivity in $\beta$-IrSn$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Layered material $\beta$-IrSn$_4$ ($I4_1/acd$, $D^{20}_{4h}$, #142), whose electron bands have symmetry-enforced Dirac points, was investigated using high-quality single crystals. It exhibits a pronounced linear field-dependence of magnetoresistance (LMR), which cannot be explained by currently existing models. Structures in the field-angle dependence of magnetoresistance and Hall resistivity are attributable to the Fermi surface topology; the presence of open orbits is inferred. At the superconducting (SC) transition, the specific-heat jump exhibits a significant increase in applied fields, revealing the type-I SC nature. This feature is attributable to the high Fermi velocity of linearly dispersive multibands. To clarify the mechanism of the puzzling LMR, investigations into the topological nature of those multibands in applied fields are highly desired.</description>

      <title>High-field ultrasound study of elastic constants and possible magnetic symmetry transformations in UO2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we probe the coupling between magnetism and lattice dynamics in UO2, a 3k antiferromagnet that undergoes magnetic ordering below its Neel temperature (TN) of 30.8 K. Ultrasound measurements provide insights into the interplay between the material's magnetic properties and lattice vibrations in response to the applied high magnetic field. A model analysis based on ab initio calculated superexchange interactions predicts a change in the magnetic structure from 3k to 2k at around 50 T. Although this change is not evident in the magnetization curve, we observe a crossover of ultrasound velocity Dv/v using a phase-sensitive pulse-echo technique in pulsed magnetic fields of up to 65 T. We show that at Hz &gt; 50 T, the structure remains antiferromagnetic in the (x, y) plane and becomes ferromagnetic in the z direction. A further transition into the 1k structure is theoretically predicted to take place at a magnetic field of ~104 tesla.</description>

      <title>A general machine learning model of aluminosilicate melt viscosity and its application to the surface properties of dry lava planets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultra-short-period exoplanets like K2-141 b likely have magma oceans on their dayside, which play a critical role in redistributing heat within the planet. This could lead to a warm nightside surface, measurable by the James Webb Space Telescope, offering insights into the planet's structure. Accurate models of properties like viscosity, which can vary by orders of magnitude, are essential for such studies.
  We present a new model for predicting molten magma viscosity, applicable in diverse scenarios, including magma oceans on lava planets. Using a database of 28,898 viscosity measurements on phospho-alumino-silicate melts, spanning superliquidus to undercooled temperatures and pressures up to 30 GPa, we trained a greybox artificial neural network, refined by a Gaussian process. This model achieves high predictive accuracy (RMSE $\approx 0.4 \log_{10}$ Pa$\cdot$s) and can handle compositions from SiO$_2$ to multicomponent magmatic and industrial glasses, accounting for pressure effects up to 30 GPa for compositions such as peridotite.
  Applying this model, we calculated the viscosity of K2-141 b's magma ocean under different compositions. Phase diagram calculations suggest that the dayside is fully molten, with extreme temperatures primarily controlling viscosity. A tenuous atmosphere (0.1 bar) might exist around a 40{\deg} radius from the substellar point. At higher longitudes, atmospheric pressure drops, and by 90{\deg}, magma viscosity rapidly increases as solidification occurs. The nightside surface is likely solid, but previously estimated surface temperatures above 400 K imply a partly molten mantle, feeding geothermal flux through vertical convection.</description>

      <title>Helium atom micro-diffraction as a characterisation tool for 2D materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present helium atom micro-diffraction as an ideal technique for characterization of 2D materials due to its ultimate surface sensitivity combined with sub-micron spatial resolution. Thermal energy neutral helium scatters from the valence electron density, 2-3A above the ionic cores of a surface, making the technique ideal for studying 2D materials, where other approaches can struggle due to small interaction cross-sections with few-layer samples. Sub-micron spatial resolution is key development in neutral atom scattering to allow measurements from device-scale samples. We present measurements of monolayer-substrate interactions, thermal expansion coefficients, the electron-phonon coupling constant and vacancy-type defect density on monolayer-MoS2. We also discuss extensions to the presented methods which can be immediately implemented on existing instruments to perform spatial mapping of these material properties.</description>

      <title>Doping dependence of linear-in-temperature scattering rate in three-orbital Emery model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent experimental demonstration of the doping dependence of the linear-in-temperature resistivity coefficient in cuprates, we numerically investigated the three-orbital Emery model focusing on the slope of the $T$-linear electronic and quasiparticle scattering rates by adopting dynamical cluster quantum Monte Carlo simulations. Our exploration discovered that the slope of electronic scattering rate evolves linearly with the electron-doping; while it is inversely proportional to the hole-doping level at intermediate doping regime and then crossovers to the linear-like dependence on further hole doping. These features remarkably match with the experimental findings qualitatively. We further discuss the doping-dependent slope of the quasiparticle scattering rate and also estimate the resistivity coefficient. Our presented work provides promising insight on the three-orbital Emery model, particularly its doping evolution and connection to the underlying mechanism of the $T$-linear resistivity in cuprates.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-Informed Screening for Safer Solvents Used in the Synthesis of Perovskite via Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The challenge of accurately predicting toxicity of industrial solvents used in perovskite synthesis is a necessary undertaking but is limited by a lack of a targeted and structured toxicity data. This paper presents a novel framework that combines an automated data extraction using language models, and an uncertainty-informed prediction model to fill data gaps and improve prediction confidence. First, we have utilized and compared two approaches to automatically extract relevant data from a corpus of scientific literature on solvents used in perovskite synthesis: smaller bidirectional language models like BERT and ELMo are used for their repeatability and deterministic outputs, while autoregressive large language model (LLM) such as GPT-3.5 is used to leverage its larger training corpus and better response generation. Our novel 'prompting and verification' technique integrated with an LLM aims at targeted extraction and refinement, thereby reducing hallucination and improving the quality of the extracted data using the LLM. Next, the extracted data is fed into our pre-trained multi-task binary classification deep learning to predict the ED nature of extracted solvents. We have used a Shannon entropy-based uncertainty quantification utilizing the class probabilities obtained from the classification model to quantify uncertainty and identify data gaps in our predictions. This approach leads to the curation of a structured dataset for solvents used in perovskite synthesis and their uncertainty-informed virtual toxicity assessment. Additionally, chord diagrams have been used to visualize solvent interactions and prioritize those with potential hazards, revealing that 70% of the solvent interactions were primarily associated with two specific perovskites.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Thickness of the Air-Water Interface from Two Extremes of Interface Hydrogen Bond Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2204.13941v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The air-water interface plays a crucial role in many aspects of science, because of its unique properties, such as a two-dimensional hydrogen bond (HB) network and completely different HB dynamics compared to bulk water. However, accurately determining the boundary of interfacial and bulk water, that is, the thickness of the air-water interface, still challenges experimentalists. Various simulation-based methods have been developed to estimate the thickness, converging on a range of approximately 3--10 (Angstrom). In this study, we introduce a novel approach, grounded in density functional theory-based molecular dynamics and deep potential molecular dynamics simulations, to measure the air-water interface thickness, offering a different perspective based on prior research. To capture realistic HB dynamics in the air-water interface, two extreme scenarios of the interface HB dynamics are obtained: one underestimates the interface HB dynamics, while the other overestimates it. Surprisingly, our results suggest that the interface HB dynamics in both scenarios converges as the thickness of the air-water interface increases to 4 (Angstrom). This convergence point, indicative of the realistic interface thickness, is also validated by our calculation of anisotropic decay of OH stretch and the free OH dynamics at the air-water interface.</description>

      <title>Flexoelectricity and surface ferroelectricity of water ice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.00323v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The phase diagram of ice is complex and contains many phases, but the most common (frozen water at ambient pressure, also known as Ih ice) is a non-polar material despite individual water molecules being polar. Consequently, ice is not piezoelectric and cannot generate electricity under pressure. On the other hand, the coupling between polarization and strain gradient (flexoelectricity) is universal, so ice may in theory generate electricity under bending. Here we report the experimental demonstration that ice is flexoelectric, finding a coefficient comparable to that of ceramics such as SrTiO3 or TiO2. Additionally, and unexpectedly, the sensitivity of flexoelectric measurements to surface boundary conditions has also revealed a ferroelectric phase transition around 163 confined in the near-surface region of the ice slabs. The electromechanical properties of ice may find applications for low-cost transducers made in-situ in cold and remote locations, but perhaps more important are the consequences for natural phenomena involving ice electrification. In particular, we have calculated the flexoelectric polarization generated in collisions between ice and graupel particles, which reproduces the experimentally reported results for contact electrification in such events, known to cause electrification in storm clouds.</description>

      <title>Damage Localisation in Fresh Cement Mortar Observed via In Situ (Timelapse) X-ray {\mu}CT imaging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11988v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents the outcome of a study focused on the evolution of internal damage in fresh cement mortar over 25 hours of hardening. In situ timelapse X-ray computed micro-tomography ({\mu}XCT) imaging method was used to detect internal damage and capture its evolution in cement mortar hardening. During {\mu}XCT scans, the temperature released during the cement hydration was measured, which provided insight into the internal damage evolution with a link to a hydration temperature rise. The measured temperature during cement mortar hardening was compared with an analytical model, which showed a relatively good agreement with the experimental data. Using 20 CT scans acquired throughout the observed cement mortar hardening, it was possible to obtain a quantified characterisation of the porous space. Additionally, the use of timelapse {\mu}XCT imaging over 25 hours allowed for studying the crack growth inside the meso-structure including its volume and surface characterisation. The results provide valuable insights into cement mortar shrinkage and serve as a proof-of-concept methodology for future material characterisation.</description>

Abstract: The Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) is a powerful theoretical approach that is capable to accurately treat electron-hole interactions in materials in an excited state. We developed an ab initio framework based on the BSE to describe a pump-probe experiment, in which an x-ray pulse probes solid-state valence excitons by means of x-ray absorption spectroscopy. Our theoretical framework is of relevance for an accurate modeling of pump-probe experiments of photo-excited materials that utilize novel capabilities offered by x-ray science.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10931v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: At the heart of the flourishing field of machine learning potentials are graph neural networks, where deep learning is interwoven with physics-informed machine learning (PIML) architectures. Various PIML models, upon training with density functional theory (DFT) material structure-property datasets, have achieved unprecedented prediction accuracy for a range of molecular and material properties. A critical component in the learned graph representation of crystal structures in PIMLs is how the various fragments of the structure's graph are embedded in a neural network. Several of the state-of-art PIML models apply spherical harmonic functions. Such functions are based on the assumption that DFT computes the Coulomb potential of atom-atom interactions. However, DFT does not directly compute such potentials, but integrates the electron-atom potentials. We introduce the direct integration of the external potential (DIEP) methods which more faithfully reflects that actual computational workflow in DFT. DIEP integrates the external (electron-atom) potential and uses these quantities to embed the structure graph into a deep learning model. We demonstrate the enhanced accuracy of the DIEP model in predicting the energies of pristine and defective materials. By training DIEP to predict the potential energy surface, we show the ability of the model in predicting the onset of fracture of pristine and defective carbon nanotubes.</description>

      <title>Evaporation of cations from non-conductive nano-samples using single-cycle THz pulses: an experimental and theoretical study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04470v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the emission of cations from silica samples by single-cycle THz pulses, focusing on the influence of pulse polarity. Negative THz pulses were found to efficiently trigger the evaporation of cations from nanoneedles in amorphous silica samples compared to positive pulses. Conversely, this dependence on pulse polarity could not be found in samples with metallic behaviour such as LaB$_6$ and when multi-cycle pulses in different frequency ranges such as ultraviolet (UV) are used. First-principles simulations focus on silica under THz laser irradiation and show critical fields for ion evaporation of hydroxyl groups from Si(OH)$_4$, which serves as a model precursor molecule for the amorphous solid matrix. To explain our experimental results, we propose a simplified theoretical model that determines the role of the polarity of the THz pulse by taking into account the differences in electron mobility between silica and semi-metallic samples. The study explores the nonlinear microscopic mechanisms of atomic evaporation under external static and THz laser fields and clarifies the dynamics of THz-enhanced APT and related applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01320v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Identifying crystal defects is vital for unraveling the origins of many physical phenomena. Traditionally used order parameters are system-dependent and can be computationally expensive to calculate for long molecular dynamics simulations. Unsupervised algorithms offer an alternative independent of the studied system and can utilize precalculated atomistic potential descriptors from molecular dynamics simulations. We compare the performance of three such algorithms (PCA, UMAP, and PaCMAP) on silicon and water systems. Initially, we evaluate the algorithms for recognizing phases, including crystal polymorphs and the melt, followed by an extension of our analysis to identify interstitials, vacancies, and interfaces. While PCA is found unsuitable for effective classification, it has been shown to be a suitable initialization for UMAP and PaCMAP. Both UMAP and PaCMAP show promising results overall, with PaCMAP proving more robust in classification, except in cases of significant class imbalance, where UMAP performs better. Notably, both algorithms successfully identify nuclei in supercooled water, demonstrating their applicability to ice nucleation in water.</description>

      <title>Chemical-motif characterization of short-range order with E(3)-equivariant graph neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08628v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Crystalline materials have atomic-scale fluctuations in their chemical composition that modulate various mesoscale properties. Establishing chemistry-microstructure relationships in such materials requires proper characterization of these chemical fluctuations. Yet, current characterization approaches (e.g., Warren-Cowley parameters) make only partial use of the complete chemical and structural information contained in local chemical motifs. Here we introduce a framework based on E(3)-equivariant graph neural networks that is capable of completely identifying chemical motifs in arbitrary crystalline structures with any number of chemical elements. This approach naturally leads to a proper information-theoretic measure for quantifying chemical short-range order (SRO) in chemically complex materials, and a reduced - but complete - representation of the chemical space. Our framework enables the correlation of any per-atom property with their corresponding local chemical motif, thereby offering novel avenues to explore structure-property relationships in chemically-complex materials. Using the MoTaNbTi high-entropy alloy as a test system, we demonstrate the versatility of this approach by evaluating the lattice strain associated with each chemical motif, and computing the temperature dependence of chemical-fluctuations length scale.</description>

Abstract: Functionalities of solid-state materials are usually considered to be dependent on their crystal structures. The limited structural types observed in the emerged high-entropy oxides put constraints on exploration of their physical properties and potential applications. Herein, we synthesized the first high-entropy oxide in a trirutile structure, (Mn0.2Fe0.2Co0.2Ni0.2Cu0.2)Ta1.92O6, and investigated its magnetism. The phase purity and high-entropy nature were confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction and energy-dispersive spectroscopy, respectively. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy indicated divalent Mn, Co, Ni and Cu along with trivalent Fe. Magnetic properties measurements showed antiferromagnetic coupling and potential short-range magnetic ordering below ~ 4 K. The temperature-dependent heat capacity data measured under zero and high magnetic field confirmed the lack of long-range magnetic ordering and a possible low-temperature phonon excitation. The discovery of the first trirutile high-entropy oxide opens a new way for studying the relationship between the highly disordered atomic arrangement and their magnetic interaction. Furthermore, it provides a new direction for exploring functionalities of high-entropy oxides.</description>

      <title>Interacting-bath dynamical embedding for capturing non-local electron correlation in solids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07531v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantitative simulation of electronic structure of solids requires treating local and non-local electron correlations on an equal footing. We present a new ab initio formulation of Green's function embedding which, unlike dynamical mean-field theory that uses non-interacting bath, derives bath representation with general two-particle interactions in a systematically improvable manner. The resulting interacting-bath dynamical embedding theory (ibDET) utilizes an efficient real-axis coupled-cluster solver to compute the self-energy, approaching the full system limit at much reduced cost. When combined with the GW theory, GW+ibDET achieves good agreement with experimental spectral properties across a range of semiconducting, insulating and metallic materials. Our approach also enables quantifying the role of non-local electron correlation in determining material properties and addressing the long-standing debate on the bandwidth narrowing of metallic sodium.</description>

      <title>Beyond Gaussian fluctuations of quantum anharmonic nuclei. The case of rotational degrees of freedom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14131v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The atomic motion in molecular crystals, such as high-pressure hydrogen or hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites, is very complex due to quantum anharmonic effects. In addition, these materials accommodate rotational degrees of freedom. All the approximate methods that describe the nuclei thermodynamics using Cartesian coordinates lead to an unphysical hybridization of roto-librations with other high-energy modes. Hence, they do not accurately account for the free energy contributions of these degrees of freedom. So, a reliable description of a molecular crystal's phase diagram is only possible with Path Integral Molecular Dynamics (PIMD) at a high computational cost. This work shows how to include roto-librational modes in the Self-Consistent Harmonic Approximation (SCHA) framework. SCHA approximates the nuclei Cartesian fluctuations to be Gaussian, thus neglecting curvilinear motion. Keeping its low computational cost, we employ the generalization of SCHA, called nonlinear SCHA (NLSCHA). Our method relies on a Gaussian \textit{ansatz} for the nuclei density matrix on a curved manifold, allowing us to map roto-librations into harmonic modes defined on a surface. By optimizing the surface's curvature variationally, we minimize the free energy, allowing the spontaneous activation of these degrees of freedom without external parameters. Notably, in the limit of vanishing curvature, we recover the standard SCHA.</description>

      <title>Magnetically dead layer in interacting ultrafine NiFe2O4 nanoparticles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16203v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The relation of the magnetically dead layer and structural defects in ultrafine interacting NiFe2O4 nanoparticles (&lt;d&gt; = 4 nm) have been investigated using transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, ^57Fe M\"ossbauer spectroscopy, and dc magnetization and ac susceptibility measurements. According to the magnetic data, we found out three magnetic subsystems in NiFe2O4 nanoparticles. The first one with the lowest blocking (spin freezing) temperature (TS = 8 K) established by atomic magnetic moments of magnetically disordered particles with the d &lt; 4 nm. The other two subsystems are formed by the magnetic moments of the "core" of nanoparticles having size more than 4 nm and correlated surface spins in nanoparticle clusters, correspondingly. Magnetic moments of ferrimagnetically ordered "core" are blocking at a higher temperature ( \approx 40 K). It has been shown that the most significant contribution to the energy dissipation is made upon blocking of the correlated nanoparticle surface spins from the magnetically dead layer on the nanoparticles' surface. By the magnetic data, the thickness of this layer is dmd \approx 1 nm for a particle with the &lt;d&gt; \approx 4 nm. At the same time or meanwhile, the ^57Fe M\"ossbauer spectroscopy has revealed a structural disorder penetrating to a depth of up to dcd \approx 0.6 nm in a particle with &lt;d&gt; = 4 nm. This evidences for a faster destruction of the magnetic order as compared with the crystal order upon moving away from the center of a particle to its periphery.</description>

      <title>Highly efficient path-integral molecular dynamics simulations with GPUMD using neuroevolution potentials: Case studies on thermal properties of materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04430v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Path-integral molecular dynamics (PIMD) simulations are crucial for accurately capturing nuclear quantum effects in materials. However, their computational intensity and reliance on multiple software packages often limit their applicability at large scales. Here, we present an integration of PIMD methods, including thermostatted ring-polymer molecular dynamics (TRPMD), into the open-source GPUMD package, combined with highly accurate and efficient machine-learned neuroevolution potential (NEP) models. This approach achieves almost the accuracy of first-principles calculations with the computational efficiency of empirical potentials, enabling large-scale atomistic simulations that incorporate nuclear quantum effects. We demonstrate the efficacy of the combined NEP-PIMD approach by examining various thermal properties of diverse materials, including lithium hydride (LiH), three porous metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), liquid water, and elemental aluminum. For LiH, our NEP-PIMD simulations successfully capture the isotope effect, reproducing the experimentally observed dependence of the lattice parameter on the reduced mass. For MOFs, our results reveal that achieving good agreement with experimental data requires consideration of both nuclear quantum effects and dispersive interactions. For water, our PIMD simulations capture the significant impact of nuclear quantum effects on its microscopic structure. For aluminum, the TRPMD method effectively captures thermal expansion and phonon properties, aligning well with quantum mechanical predictions. This efficient NEP-PIMD approach opens new avenues for exploring complex material properties influenced by nuclear quantum effects, with potential applications across a broad range of materials.</description>

      <title>Smart Data-Driven GRU Predictor for SnO$_2$ Thin films Characteristics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11782v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In material physics, characterization techniques are foremost crucial for obtaining the materials data regarding the physical properties as well as structural, electronics, magnetic, optic, dielectric, and spectroscopic characteristics. However, for many materials, ensuring availability and safe accessibility is not always easy and fully warranted. Moreover, the use of modeling and simulation techniques need a lot of theoretical knowledge, in addition of being associated to costly computation time and a great complexity deal. Thus, analyzing materials with different techniques for multiple samples simultaneously, still be very challenging for engineers and researchers. It is worth noting that although of being very risky, X-ray diffraction is the well known and widely used characterization technique which gathers data from structural properties of crystalline 1d, 2d or 3d materials. We propose in this paper, a Smart GRU for Gated Recurrent Unit model to forcast structural characteristics or properties of thin films of tin oxide SnO$_2$(110). Indeed, thin films samples are elaborated and managed experimentally and the collected data dictionary is then used to generate an AI -- Artificial Intelligence -- GRU model for the thin films of tin oxide SnO$_2$(110) structural property characterization.</description>

      <title>Exceptional Reduction of Electrical Resistivity in Ultrathin Non-Crystalline NbP Semimetal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17337v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The electrical resistivity of conventional metals, such as copper, is known to increase in thinner films due to electron-surface scattering, limiting the performance of metals in nanoscale electronics. Here, we uncover an exceptional reduction of resistivity with decreasing film thickness in NbP semimetal, deposited at relatively low temperatures of 400 {\deg}C. In sub-5 nm thin films, we find a significantly lower resistivity (~34 microOhm.cm for 1.5 nm thin NbP, at room temperature) than in the bulk form, and lower than conventional metals at similar thickness. Remarkably, the NbP films are not crystalline, but display local nanocrystalline, short-range order within an amorphous matrix. Our analysis suggests that the lower resistivity is due to conduction through surface channels, together with high surface carrier density and sufficiently good mobility, as the film thickness is reduced. These results and the fundamental insights obtained here could enable ultrathin, low-resistivity wires for nanoelectronics, beyond the limitations of conventional metals.</description>

      <title>Correlated interaction effects in three-dimensional semi-Dirac semimetal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2101.05794v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the correlation effects in unconventional topological materials, in which the fermion excitations take unusual dispersion, is an important topic in recent condensed matter physics. We study the influence of short-range four-fermion interactions on three-dimensional semi-Dirac semimetal with an unusual fermion dispersion, that is linear along two directions and quadratic along the third one. Based on renormalization group theory, we find all of 11 unstable fixed points including 5 quantum critical points, 5 bicritical points, and one tricritical point. The physical essences of the quantum critical points are determined by analyzing the susceptibility exponents for all of the source terms in particle-hole and particle-particle channels. We also verify phase diagrams of the system in the parameter space through numerically studying the flows of the four-fermion coupling parameters and behaviors of the susceptibility exponents. These results are helpful for us to understand the physical properties of candidate materials for three-dimensional semi-Dirac semimetal such as ZrTe$_{5}$.</description>

      <title>Origin of spin reorientation and intrinsic anomalous Hall effect in the kagome ferrimagnet TbMn6Sn6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.17246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.17246v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: TbMn$_6$Sn$_6$ has attracted a lot of recent interest for a variety of reasons, most importantly, because of the hypothesis that it may support quantum-limit Chern topological magnetism, derived from the kagome geometry. Besides, TbMn$_6$Sn$_6$ features a highly unusual magnetic reorientation transition about 100 K below the Curie point, whereby all spins in the system, remaining collinear, rotate by 90$^\circ$. In this work, we address both issues combining experiment, mean-field theory and first-principle calculations. Both magnetic reorientation and the unusual temperature dependence of the anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) find quantitative explanation in the fact that Mn and Tb, by virtue of the Mermin-Wagner theorem, have very different spin dynamics, with Tb spins experiencing much more rapid fluctuation. We were able to cleanly extract the intrinsic AHC from our experiment, and calculated the same microscopically, with good semiquantitative agreement. We have identified the points in the band structure responsible for the AHC and showed that they are not the kagome-derived Dirac points at the K-corner of the Brillouin zone, as conjectured previously.</description>

Abstract: We study the spatiotemporal dynamics of ultrafast electron spin transport across nanometer-thick copper layers using broadband terahertz spectroscopy. Our analysis of temporal delays, broadening and attenuation of the spin-current pulse revealed ballistic-like propagation of the pulse peak, approaching the Fermi velocity, and diffusive features including a significant velocity dispersion. A comparison to the frequency-dependent Ficks law identified the diffusion-dominated transport regime for distances larger than 2 nm. The findings lie the groundwork for designing future broadband spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Antiferromagnetic Chern insulator with large charge gap in heavy transition-metal compounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12918v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the discovery of multiple intrinsic magnetic topological insulators in recent years the observation of Chern insulators is still restricted to very low temperatures due to the negligible charge gaps. Here, we uncover the potential of heavy transition-metal compounds for realizing a collinear antiferromagnetic Chern insulator (AFCI) with a charge gap as large as 300 meV. Our analysis relies on the Kane-Mele-Kondo model with a ferromagnetic Hund coupling $J_{\rm H}$ between the spins of itinerant electrons and the localized spins of size $S$. We show that a spin-orbit coupling $\lambda_{\rm SO} \gtrsim 0.03t$, where $t$ is the nearest-neighbor hopping element, is already large enough to stabilize an AFCI provided the alternating sublattice potential $\delta$ is in the range $\delta \approx SJ_{\rm H}$. We establish a remarkable increase in the charge gap upon increasing $\lambda_{\rm SO}$ in the AFCI phase. Using our results we explain the collinear AFCI recently found in monolayers of CrO and MoO with charge gaps of 1 and $50$ meV, respectively. In addition, we propose bilayers of heavy transition-metal oxides of perovskite structure as candidates to realize a room-temperature AFCI if grown along the $[111]$ direction and subjected to a perpendicular electric field.</description>

      <title>Thermophotovoltaic performance metrics and technoeconomics: efficiency vs. power density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00940v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thermophotovoltaics (TPV) are a promising new approach for converting heat to electricity. Their performance is primarily characterized by two metrics: efficiency and power density. While recent works have shown high efficiency, as ensuing efforts to commercialize the technology develop, it is important to understand how both of these metrics impact the technoeconomics of a TPV system. In this work, we develop a technoeconomic model based on the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) to understand the relative importance of efficiency and power density. We find that systems with high infrastructure and fuel costs should prioritize TPV efficiency, while systems where the TPV cell cost dominates should prioritize power density. We then evaluate how five example systems fit into these cost regimes. Finally, we analyze how cell improvements could improve system technoeconomics, and we identify the most impactful properties. Namely, improving spectral control with sub-bandgap reflectance is the most effective way to reduce LCOE in systems with high infrastructural costs, while increasing the view factor and reducing series resistance are most critical in systems where the TPV cell cost is high. Improving just one or two of these properties can reduce the LCOE by 30-50%, reaching competitive values ~ 8 cents/kWh-e, less than the average cost of electricity in the US. This study elucidates which TPV performance metric is more important for a given application and how to maximize it.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10148v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new theory for partitioning simulations of periodic and solid-state systems into physically sound atomic contributions at the level of Kohn-Sham density functional theory. Our theory is based on spatially localized linear combinations of crystalline Gaussian-type orbitals and, as such, capable of exposing local features within periodic electronic structures in a more intuitive and robust manner than alternatives based on the spatial distribution of atomic basis functions alone. Early decomposed cohesive energies of both molecular polymers and different crystalline polymorphs demonstrate how the atomic properties yielded by our theory convincingly align with the expected charge polarization in these systems, also whenever partial charges and Madelung energies may lend themselves somewhat ambiguous to interpretation.</description>
