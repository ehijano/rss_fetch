      <title>Eigenvalue bounds for Schr\"odinger operators on quantum graphs with $\delta$-coupling conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove sharp upper bounds for eigenvalues of Schr\"odinger operators on quantum graphs with $\delta$-coupling (also known as Robin) conditions at all vertices. The bounds depend only on metric properties of the graph, and on the potential, but are independent of the strength of the couplings, answering a question of Rohleder and Seifert. We obtain those bounds via the variational characterisation, comparing with Dirichlet boundary conditions, which amount to comparing the eigenvalues to those of a disconnected graph.</description>

      <title>Numbers omitting digits in certain base expansions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In DOI:10.1017/etds.2022.2 the author proved that for each integer $k$ there is an implicit number $M &gt; 0$ such that if $b_1, \cdots , b_k$ are multiplicatively independent integers greater than $M$, there are infinitely many integers whose base $b_1, b_2, \cdots , b_k$ expansions all do not have zero digits. In this paper we don't require the multiplicative independence condition and make the result quantitative, getting an explicit value for $M$. We also obtain a result for the case when the missing digit(s) may not be zero. Finally, we extend our method to study various missing-digit sets in an algebraic setting.</description>

      <title>Weighted inequalities for sub-monotone functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20115v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a set of relations between several quite diverse types of weighted inequalities involving various integral operators and fairly general quasinorm-like functionals which we call sub-monotone. The main result enables one to solve a specific problem by transferring it to another one for which a solution is known. The main result is formulated in a rather surprising generality, involving previously unknown cases, and it works even for some nonlinear operators such as the geometric or harmonic mean operators. Proofs use only elementary means.</description>

      <title>A Counterexample to the Mizohata-Takeuchi Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06137v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive a family of $L^p$ estimates of the X-Ray transform of positive measures in $\mathbb R^d$, which we use to construct a $\log R$-loss counterexample to the Mizohata-Takeuchi conjecture for every $C^2$ hypersurface in $\mathbb R^d$ that does not lie in a hyperplane. In particular, multilinear restriction estimates at the endpoint cannot be sharpened directly by the Mizohata-Takeuchi conjecture.</description>

      <title>Approximations on certain domains of $\mathbb{C}^{n}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.11107v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the domains in $\mathbb{C}^n$ that are invariant under the positive flows of some globally defined, complete holomorphic vector field
  with a globally attracting fixed point at the origin. Our first result says that such a domain $\Omega$ is always Runge. Next, with an additional assumption on the rate of convergence of the flow, we show that
  any biholomorphism $\Phi\colon \Omega \to \Phi(\Omega)$, with $\Phi(\Omega)$ is Runge, can be approximated by automorphisms of $\mathbb{C}^{n}$ uniformly on compacts. This generalizes all earlier known theorems in this direction substantially, even when the vector field is linear. As an application of our approximation results, on such domains that are also complete hyperbolic, we show that any Loewner PDE in a complete hyperbolic domain $\Omega$ admits an essentially unique univalent solution with values in $\mathbb{C}^n$. We also provide an approximation result for volume preserving biholomorphisms on above domains.
  We provide several examples of such domains.</description>

      <title>$h$-function, Hilbert-Kunz density function and Frobenius-Poincar\'e function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10270v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given ideals $I,J$ of a noetherian local ring $(R, \mathfrak m)$ such that $I+J$ is $\mathfrak m$-primary and a finitely generated $R$-module $M$, we associate an invariant of $(M,R,I,J)$ called the $h$-function. Our results on $h$-functions allow extensions of the theories of Frobenius-Poincar\'e functions and Hilbert-Kunz density functions from the known graded case to the local case, answering a question of V.Trivedi. When $J$ is $\mathfrak m$-primary, we describe the support of the corresponding density function in terms of other invariants of $(R, I,J)$. We show that the support captures the $F$-threshold: $c^J(I)$, under mild assumptions, extending results of V. Trivedi and Watanabe. The $h$-function encodes Hilbert-Samuel, Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity and $F$-threshold of the ideal pair involved. Using this feature of $h$-functions, we provide an equivalent formulation of a conjecture of Huneke, Musta\c{t}\u{a}, Takagi, Watanabe; recover a result of Smirnov and Betancourt; give a new proof of a result answering Watanabe-Yoshida's question comparing Hilbert-Kunz and Hilbert-Samuel multiplicity and establish lower bounds on $F$-thresholds. We also point out that a conjecture of Smirnov-Betancourt as stated is false and suggest a correction which we relate to the conjecture of Huneke et al.
  We develop the theory of $h$-functions in a more general setting which yields a density function for $F$-signature. A key to many results on $h$-functions is a `convexity technique' that we introduce, which in particular proves differentiability of Hilbert-Kunz density functions almost everywhere on $(0,\infty)$, thus contributing to another question of Trivedi.</description>
