      <title>Hidformer: Transformer-Style Neural Network in Stock Price Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the application of Transformer-based neural networks to stock price forecasting, with a special focus on the intersection of machine learning techniques and financial market analysis. The evolution of Transformer models, from their inception to their adaptation for time series analysis in financial contexts, is reviewed and discussed. Central to our study is the exploration of the Hidformer model, which is currently recognized for its promising performance in time series prediction. The primary aim of this paper is to determine whether Hidformer will also prove itself in the task of stock price prediction. This slightly modified model serves as the framework for our experiments, integrating the principles of technical analysis with advanced machine learning concepts to enhance stock price prediction accuracy. We conduct an evaluation of the Hidformer model's performance, using a set of criteria to determine its efficacy. Our findings offer additional insights into the practical application of Transformer architectures in financial time series forecasting, highlighting their potential to improve algorithmic trading strategies, including human decision making.</description>

      <title>A finite strain model for fiber angle plasticity of textile fabrics based on isogeometric shell finite elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a shear elastoplasticity model for textile fabrics within the theoretical framework of anisotropic Kirchhoff-Love shells with bending of embedded fibers proposed by Duong et al. (2023). The plasticity model aims at capturing the rotational inter-ply frictional sliding between fiber families in textile composites undergoing large deformation. Such effects are usually dominant in dry textile fabrics such as woven and non-crimp fabrics. The model explicitly uses relative angles between fiber families as strain measures for the kinematics. The plasticity model is formulated directly with surface invariants without resorting to thickness integration. Motivated by experimental observations from the picture frame test, a yield function is proposed with isotropic hardening and a simple evolution equation. A classical return mapping algorithm is employed to solve the elastoplastic problem within the isogeometric finite shell element formulation of Duong et al. (2022). The verification of the implementation is facilitated by the analytical solution for the picture frame test. The proposed plasticity model is calibrated from the picture frame test and is then validated by the bias extension test, considering available experimental data for different samples from the literature. Good agreement between model prediction and experimental data is obtained. Finally, the applicability of the elastoplasticity model to 3D shell problems is demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Powering the Future: Innovations in Electric Vehicle Battery Recycling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The global shift towards electric vehicles (EVs) as a sustainable alternative to traditional gasoline-powered cars has triggered a significant rise in the demand for lithium-ion batteries. However, as the adoption of EVs grows, the issue of battery disposal and recycling has emerged as a critical challenge. The recycling of EV batteries is essential not only for reducing the environmental impact of battery waste but also for ensuring the sustainable supply of critical raw materials such as lithium, cobalt, and nickel. This paper explores recent innovations in the field of electric vehicle battery recycling, examining advanced techniques such as direct recycling, hydrometallurgical processes, and sustainable battery design. It also highlights the role of policy and industry collaboration in improving recycling infrastructure and addressing the economic and environmental challenges associated with battery waste. By focusing on both the technical and regulatory aspects of EV battery recycling, this paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the state of the industry and the future outlook for recycling technologies, ultimately paving the way for a cleaner, more sustainable future in transportation.</description>

      <title>Navigating Chemical-Linguistic Sharing Space with Heterogeneous Molecular Encoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chemical language models (CLMs) are prominent for their effectiveness in exploring chemical space and enabling molecular engineering. However, while exploring chemical-linguistic space, CLMs suffer from the gap between natural language and molecular representations. This challenge is primarily due to the inherent modeling differences between molecules and texts: molecules operate unified modeling to learn chemical space, while natural language sequentially models the semantic space. Additionally, the limited availability of high-quality text-to-molecule datasets further exacerbates this challenge. To address the problem, we first verified the information bias in molecular representations from different perspectives. We then developed the Heterogeneous Molecular Encoding (HME) framework, a unified molecular encoder compressing the molecular features from fragment sequence, topology, and conformation with Q-learning. To better model chemical-linguistic space, we further constructed the MCMoD dataset, which contains over one million molecules with various conditions, including properties, fragments, and descriptions. Experimentally, HME promotes CLMs to achieve chemical-linguistic sharing space exploration: (1) chemical space exploration with linguistic guidance, where HME achieves significant improvements (+37.8\% FCD) for molecular design in multiple constraints, even in zero-shot scenarios; (2) linguistic space exploration with molecular guidance, where HME generates textual descriptions with high qualities (+11.6\% BLEU) for molecules. These results highlight the precision of HME in handling multi-objective and cross-domain tasks, as well as its remarkable generalization capability on unseen task combinations. HME offers a new perspective on navigating chemical-linguistic sharing space, advancing the potential of CLMs in both fundamental research and practical applications in chemistry.</description>

      <title>TradingAgents: Multi-Agents LLM Financial Trading Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Significant progress has been made in automated problem-solving using societies of agents powered by large language models (LLMs). In finance, efforts have largely focused on single-agent systems handling specific tasks or multi-agent frameworks independently gathering data. However, multi-agent systems' potential to replicate real-world trading firms' collaborative dynamics remains underexplored. TradingAgents proposes a novel stock trading framework inspired by trading firms, featuring LLM-powered agents in specialized roles such as fundamental analysts, sentiment analysts, technical analysts, and traders with varied risk profiles. The framework includes Bull and Bear researcher agents assessing market conditions, a risk management team monitoring exposure, and traders synthesizing insights from debates and historical data to make informed decisions. By simulating a dynamic, collaborative trading environment, this framework aims to improve trading performance. Detailed architecture and extensive experiments reveal its superiority over baseline models, with notable improvements in cumulative returns, Sharpe ratio, and maximum drawdown, highlighting the potential of multi-agent LLM frameworks in financial trading.</description>

      <title>MATEY: multiscale adaptive foundation models for spatiotemporal physical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate representation of the multiscale features in spatiotemporal physical systems using vision transformer (ViT) architectures requires extremely long, computationally prohibitive token sequences. To address this issue, we propose two adaptive tokenization schemes that dynamically adjust patch sizes based on local features: one ensures convergent behavior to uniform patch refinement, while the other offers better computational efficiency. Moreover, we present a set of spatiotemporal attention schemes, where the temporal or axial spatial dimensions are decoupled, and evaluate their computational and data efficiencies. We assess the performance of the proposed multiscale adaptive model, MATEY, in a sequence of experiments. The results show that adaptive tokenization schemes achieve improved accuracy without significantly increasing the length of the token sequence. Compared to a full spatiotemporal attention scheme or a scheme that decouples only the temporal dimension, we find that fully decoupled axial attention is less efficient and expressive, requiring more training time and model weights to achieve the same accuracy. Finally, we demonstrate in two fine-tuning tasks featuring different physics that models pretrained on PDEBench data outperform the ones trained from scratch, especially in the low data regime with frozen attention.</description>

      <title>TOPress3D: 3D topology optimization with design-dependent pressure loads in MATLAB</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07733v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces "\texttt{TOPress3D}," a 3D topology optimization MATLAB code for structures subjected to design-dependent pressure loads. With a primary focus on pedagogical objectives, the code provides an easy learning experience, making it a valuable tool and practical gateway for newcomers, students, and researchers towards this topic. \texttt{TOPress3D} uses Darcy's law with a drainage term to link the given pressure load to design variables that, in turn, is converted to consistent nodal loads. Optimization problems focused on compliance minimization under volume constraints with pressure loads are solved. Load sensitivities arising due to design-dependent nature of the loads are evaluated using the adjoint-variable approach. The method of moving asymptotes is used to update the design variables. \texttt{TOPress3D} is constituted by six main parts. Each is described in detail. The code is also tailored to solve different problems. The robustness and success of the code are demonstrated in designing a few pressure load-bearing structures. The code is provided in Appendix~B and is available with extensions in the supplementary material and publicly at \url{https://github.com/PrabhatIn/TOPress3D}.</description>

      <title>QUBO Formulations for Variation of Domination Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21277v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the development of quantum computing, the use of quantum algorithms to solve combinatorial optimization problems on quantum computers has become a major research focus. The Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) model serves as a bridge between combinatorial optimization problems and quantum computers, and is a prerequisite for these studies. In combinatorial optimization problems, the Domination Problem (DP) is related to many practical issues in the real world, such as the fire station problem, social network theory, and so on. Additionally, the DP has numerous variants, such as independent DP, total DP, k-domination, and so forth. However, there is a scarcity of quantum computing research on these variant problems. A possible reason for this is the lack of research on QUBO modeling for these issues. This paper investigates the QUBO modeling methods for the classic DP and its variants. Compared to previous studies, the QUBO modeling method we propose for the classic DP can utilize fewer qubits. This will lower the barrier for solving DP on quantum computers. At the same time, for many variants of DP problems, we provide their QUBO modeling methods for the first time. Our work will accelerate the entry of DP into the quantum era.</description>
