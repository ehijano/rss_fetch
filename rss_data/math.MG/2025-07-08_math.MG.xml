      <title>A note on Global Positioning System (GPS) and Euclidean distance matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $D$ be an $n \times n$ Euclidean distance matrix (EDM) with embedding dimension $r$; and let $d \in R^n$ be a given vector. In this note, we consider the problem of finding a vector $y \in R^n$, that is closest to d in Euclidean norm, such that the augmented matrix $\left[ \begin{array}{cc} 0 &amp; y^T \\ y &amp; D \end{array}\right]$ is itself an EDM of embedding dimension $r$. This problem is motivated by applications in Global Positioning System (GPS). We present a fault detection criterion and three algorithms: one for the case $n=4$, and two for the case $n \geq 5$.</description>

      <title>The Wild, Elusive Singularities of the T-fractal Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06926</link>
      <description>arXiv:1703.06926v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a rigorous definition of the T-fractal translation surface, and describe some its basic geometric and dynamical properties. In particular, we study the singularities attached to the surface by its metric completion and show there exists a Cantor set of "elusive singularities." We show these elusive singularities can be thought of as a generalization of the wild singularities introduced by Bowman and Valdez. In particular, we show that every elusive singularities has an infinite discrete set of rotational components. We also show that each rotational component of an elusive singularity with an irrational address has zero length (angle).</description>

      <title>Recognition of near-duplicate periodic patterns by continuous metrics with approximation guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.15298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.15298v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper rigorously solves the challenging problem of recognizing periodic patterns under rigid motion in Euclidean geometry. The 3-dimensional case is practically important for justifying the novelty of solid crystalline materials (periodic crystals) and for patenting medical drugs in a solid tablet form. Past descriptors based on finite subsets fail when a unit cell of a periodic pattern discontinuously changes under almost any perturbation of atoms, which is inevitable due to noise and atomic vibrations. The major problem is not only to find complete invariants (descriptors with no false negatives and no false positives for all periodic patterns) but to design efficient algorithms for distance metrics on these invariants that should continuously behave under noise. The proposed continuous metrics solve this problem in any Euclidean dimension and are algorithmically approximated with small error factors in times that are explicitly bounded in the size and complexity of a given pattern. The proved Lipschitz continuity allows us to confirm all near-duplicates filtered by simpler invariants in major databases of experimental and simulated crystals. This practical detection of noisy duplicates will stop the artificial generation of `new' materials from slight perturbations of known crystals. Several such duplicates are under investigation by five journals for data integrity.</description>

      <title>Gromov-Hausdorff distances, Borsuk-Ulam theorems, and Vietoris-Rips complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.00246v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore emerging relationships between the Gromov--Hausdorff distance, Borsuk--Ulam theorems, and Vietoris--Rips simplicial complexes. The Gromov--Hausdorff distance between two metric spaces $X$ and~$Y$ can be lower bounded by the distortion of (possibly discontinuous) functions between them. The more these functions must distort the metrics, the larger the Gromov--Hausdorff distance must be. Topology has few tools to obstruct the existence of discontinuous functions. However, an arbitrary function $f\colon X\to Y$ induces a continuous map between their Vietoris--Rips simplicial complexes, where the allowable choices of scale parameters depend on how much the function $f$ distorts distances. We can then use equivariant topology to obstruct the existence of certain continuous maps between Vietoris--Rips complexes. With these ideas we bound how discontinuous an odd map between spheres $S^k\to S^n$ with $k&gt;n$ must be, generalizing a result by Dubins and Schwarz (1981), which is the case $k=n+1$. As an application, we recover or improve upon all of the lower bounds from Lim, M{\'e}moli, and Smith (2022) on the Gromov--Hausdorff distances between spheres of different dimensions. We also provide new upper bounds on the Gromov--Hausdorff distance between spheres of adjacent dimensions.</description>

      <title>Minimal and Maximal Distances in Metric Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14648v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given functions $f,g: [n] \rightarrow [n]$ do there exist $n$ points $A_1,A_2\ldots A_n$ in some metric space such that $A_{f(i)},A_{g(i)}$ are the points closest and farthest from point $A_i$? In this paper we characterize precisely which pairs of functions have this property. If the metric space is $\mathbb{R}^k$ we show that the maximal number $m(k)$ so that any pair of functions $f,g: [m(k)]\rightarrow [m(k)]$ realizable in some metric space is also realizable in $\mathbb{R}^k$ grows exponentially in $k$. In the final section of this paper we consider what happens when we look at minimal and maximal distances separately. We show that any function $g$ that can be a maximal distance function can also be a maximal distance function in $\mathbb{R}^2$. We also find an interesting family of functions that can be minimal distance functions but not in $\mathbb{R}^k$.</description>

      <title>A note on the $L_p$-Brunn-Minkowski inequality for intrinsic volumes and the $L_p$-Christoffel-Minkowski problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17896v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The first goal of this paper is to improve some of the results in \cite{BCPR}. Namely, we establish the $L_p$-Brunn-Minkwoski inequality for intrinsic volumes for origin-symmetric convex bodies that are close to the ball in the $C^2$ sense for a certain range of $p&lt;1$ (including negative values) and we prove that this inequality does not hold true in the entire class of origin-symmetric convex bodies for any $p&lt;1$. The second goal is to establish a uniqueness result for the (closely related) $L_p$-Christoffel-Minkowski problem. More specifically, we show uniqueness in the symmetric case when $p\in[0,1)$ and the data function $g$ in the right hand side is sufficiently close to the constant 1. One of the main ingredients of the proof is the existence of upper and lower bounds for the (convex) solution, that depend only $\|\log g\|_{L^\infty}$, a fact that might be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>SL($n$) contravariant tensor valuations of small orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12277v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A complete classification of \(\mathrm{SL}(n)\) contravariant, \(p\)-order tensor valuations on convex polytopes in \( \mathbb{R}^n \) for \( n \geq p \) is established without imposing additional assumptions, particularly omitting any symmetry requirements on the tensors. Beyond recovering known symmetric tensor valuations, our classification reveals asymmetric counterparts associated with the cross tensor and the Levi-Civita tensor. Additionally, some Minkowski type relations for these asymmetric tensor valuations are obtained, extending the classical Minkowski relation of surface area measures.</description>

      <title>Isoperimetric inequalities in Hadamard spaces of asymptotic rank two</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04882v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gromov's isoperimetric gap conjecture for Hadamard spaces states that cycles in dimensions greater than or equal to the asymptotic rank admit linear isoperimetric filling inequalities, as opposed to the inequalities of Euclidean type in lower dimensions. In the case of asymptotic rank 2, recent progress was made by Dru\c{t}u-Lang-Papasoglu-Stadler who established a homotopical inequality for Lipschitz 2-spheres with exponents arbitrarily close to 1. We prove a homological inequality of the same type for general cycles in dimensions at least 2, assuming that the ambient space has finite linearly controlled asymptotic dimension. This holds in particular for all Hadamard 3-manifolds and finite-dimensional CAT(0) cube complexes.</description>

      <title>Euclidean sets with only one distance modulo a prime ideal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.12331v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a finite set in the Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^d$. If the squared distance between any two distinct points in $X$ is an odd integer, then the cardinality of $X$ is bounded above by $d+2$, as shown by Rosenfeld (1997) or Smith (1995). They proved that there exists a $(d+2)$-point set $X$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$ having only odd integral squared distances if and only if $d+2$ is congruent to $0$ modulo $4$. The distances can be interpreted as an element of the finite field $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$. We generalize this result for a local ring $(A_\mathfrak{p},\mathfrak{p}A_\mathfrak{p})$ as follows. Let $K$ be an algebraic number field that can be embedded into $\mathbb{R}$. Fix an embedding of $K$ into $\mathbb{R}$, and $K$ is interpreted as a subfield of $\mathbb{R}$. Let $A=O_K$ be the ring of integers of $K$, and $\mathfrak{p}$ a prime ideal of $O_K$. Let $(A_\mathfrak{p},\mathfrak{p}A_\mathfrak{p})$ be the local ring obtained from the localization $(A\setminus \mathfrak{p})^{-1} A$, which is interpreted as a subring of $\mathbb{R}$. If the squared distances of $X\subset \mathbb{R}^d$ are in $A_\mathfrak{p}$ and each squared distance is congruent to some constant $k \not\equiv 0 $ modulo $\mathfrak{p} A_\mathfrak{p}$, then $|X| \leq d+2$, as shown by Nozaki (2023). In this paper, we prove that there exists a set $X\subset \mathbb{R}^d$ attaining the upper bound $|X| \leq d+2$ if and only if $d+2$ is congruent to $0$ modulo $4$ when the finite field $A_\mathfrak{p}/ \mathfrak{p} A_\mathfrak{p}$ is of characteristic 2, and $d+2$ is congruent to $0$ modulo $p$ when $A_\mathfrak{p}/ \mathfrak{p} A_\mathfrak{p}$ is of characteristic $p$ odd. We also provide examples attaining this upper bound.</description>

      <title>Generalized existence of extremizers for the sharp $p$-Sobolev inequality on Riemannian manifolds with nonnegative curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20592v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the generalized existence of extremizers for the sharp $p$-Sobolev inequality on noncompact Riemannian manifolds in connection with nonnegative curvature and Euclidean volume growth assumptions. Assuming a nonnegative Ricci curvature lower bound, we show that almost extremal functions are close in gradient norm to radial Euclidean bubbles. In the case of nonnegative sectional curvature lower bounds, we additionally deduce that vanishing is the only possible behavior, in the sense that almost extremal functions are almost zero globally. Our arguments rely on nonsmooth concentration compactness methods and Mosco-convergence results for the Cheeger energy on noncompact varying spaces, generalized to every exponent $p\in (1,\infty)$.</description>
