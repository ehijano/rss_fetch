      <title>Convex analysis for composite functions without K-convexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Composite functions have been studied for over 40 years and appear in a wide range of optimization problems. Convex analysis of these functions focuses on (i) conditions for convexity of the function based on properties of its components, (ii) formulas for the convex conjugate of the function based on those of its components and (iii) chain-rule-like formulas for the sub-differential of the function. To the best of our knowledge all existing results on this matter are based on the notion of K-convexity of functions where K is a closed convex cone. These notions can be considered elementary when K is the non-negative orthant, but otherwise may limit the accessibility of the associated results. In this work we show how standard results on perturbation function based duality can be used to recover and extend existing results without the need for K-convexity. We also provide a detailed comparison with K-convexity based results and show that, while K-convexity is not needed for the convex analysis of composite functions, it certainly aids in verifying the conditions associated with our proposed results. Finally, we provide necessary conditions for the conjugate and sub-differential formulas that are less restrictive than those required by the existing results.</description>

      <title>Variational State-Dependent Inverse Problems in PDE-Constrained Optimization: A Survey of Contemporary Computational Methods and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State-dependent parameter identification, where unknown model parameters depend on one or more state variables in partial differential equations (PDEs) or coupled PDE systems, is fundamental to a wide range of problems in physics, engineering, and materials science. This review surveys PDE-constrained optimization approaches for such inverse problems, emphasizing the underlying mathematical theory and key computational advances developed since 2011. We discuss variational formulations, adjoint-based gradient methods, regularization strategies, and modern computational frameworks, and highlight representative applications, with particular emphasis on identifiability, ill-posedness, and structural limits of state-dependent inverse problems. The review concludes with major open challenges and emerging research directions related to nonconvexity, identifiability, regularization, adjoint computation, data limitations, and model-class dependence.</description>

      <title>Specular differentiation in normed vector spaces and its application to nonsmooth convex optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces specular differentiation, which generalizes G\^ateaux and Fr\'echet differentiation in normed vector spaces. Fundamental theoretical properties of specular differentiation are investigated, including the Quasi-Mean Value Theorem and Quasi-Fermat's Theorem. As an application, three numerical methods using specular differentiation are devised to optimize nonsmooth convex functions in higher-dimensional Euclidean spaces. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed methods are capable of minimizing non-differentiable functions that classical methods fail to minimize.</description>

      <title>Modified Dynamic Programming Algorithms for Order Picking in Single-Block and Two-Block Rectangular Warehouses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent research has shown that optimal picker tours in rectangular warehouses exhibit deterministic travel patterns within each aisle, and that certain previously considered traversals are unnecessary. Using these insights, this paper proposes modifications to dynamic programming algorithms that improve computational efficiency without affecting optimality. For layouts with and without a central cross-aisle, the modifications preserve linear-time complexity in the number of aisles while reducing the number of state-action evaluations per stage. The proposed modifications reduce computational effort by factors up to 1.81, confirmed by numerical experiments. These findings are encouraging and highlight how structural refinements can yield significant improvements in practical performance of algorithms.</description>

      <title>Balancing Economic Cost and Disease Impact: Optimization Models for Wolbachia-Based Dengue Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dengue, which affects millions of people each year, is one of the most common diseases transmitted by infected \textit{Aedes aegypti} mosquitoes. In the Philippines, the annual economic cost of dengue infections is estimated at around PHP 17 billion. Previous studies have shown that controlling the population of mosquitoes capable of transmitting the dengue virus can effectively reduce dengue infection rates. This study explores the use of Wolbachia as a strategy for dengue control by targeting mosquitoes. Since the release of Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes involves substantial costs, careful planning is necessary to balance disease control with the associated economic burden. To address this, we propose a mathematical model that captures the dynamics of releasing Wolbachia-carrying mosquitoes and the transmission of dengue in a population. We formulate single- and multi-objective optimization frameworks to minimize the economic costs associated with releasing Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes and the hospitalization costs resulting from dengue infections. This study aims to provide insights into the practical application of Wolbachia-based interventions for controlling dengue transmission. While the analysis is grounded in the Philippine context, the approach is general enough to be applicable to other dengue-endemic countries.</description>

      <title>The Optimal Control Problem of Stochastic Differential System with Extended Mixed Delays and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates an optimal control problem where the system is described by a stochastic differential equation with extended mixed delays that contain point delay, extended distributed delay, and extended noisy memory. The model is general in that the extended mixed delays of the state variable and control variable are components of all the coefficients, in particular, the diffusion term and the terminal cost. To address the difficulties induced by the extended noisy memory, by stochastic Fubini theorem, we transform the delay variational equation into a Volterra integral equation without delay, and then a kind of backward stochastic Volterra integral equation with Malliavin derivatives is introduced by the developed coefficient decomposition method and the generalized duality principle. Therefore, the stochastic maximum principle and the verification theorem are established. Subsequently, with Clark-Ocone formula, the adjoint equation is expressed as a set of anticipated backward stochastic differential equations. Finally, a nonzero-sum stochastic differential game with extended mixed delays and a linear-quadratic solvable example are discussed, as applications.</description>

      <title>The Dynamic Team Orienteering Problem in Spatial Crowdsourcing: A Scenario Sampling Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In services such as retail audits and urban infrastructure monitoring, a platform dispatches rewarded, location-based micro-tasks to mobile workers traveling along personal origin-destination (OD) trips under hard time budgets. As requests with time constraints arrive online over a finite horizon, the platform must decide which requests to accept and how to route workers to maximize collected profit. We model this setting as the Dynamic Team Orienteering Problem in Spatial Crowdsourcing (DTOP-SC). To solve this problem, we propose a scenario-sampling rolling-horizon framework that mitigates myopic bias by augmenting each planning epoch with sampled virtual tasks. At each epoch, the augmented task set defines a deterministic static subproblem solved via an adaptive large neighborhood search (ALNS). We also formulate a mixed-integer programming model to provide offline reference solutions. Computational experiments are conducted on synthetic DTOP-SC instances generated from real-world road-map coordinates and on a dynamic team orienteering (DTOP) benchmark. On the map-based instances, the proposed policy exhibits stable gaps with respect to time-limited MIP solutions across the tested scales, while maintaining smooth computational scalability as the problem size increases. On the DTOP benchmark, the policy achieves an average decision time of 0.14s per instance, with 192-198s reported for multiple plan approach as an indicative reference, while maintaining competitive profit.</description>

      <title>Modular and Mobile Capacity Planning for Hyperconnected Supply Chain Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increased volatility of markets and the pressing need for resource sustainability are driving supply chains towards more agile, distributed, and dynamic designs. Motivated by the Physical Internet initiative, we introduce the Dynamic Stochastic Modular and Mobile Capacity Planning (DSMMCP) problem, which fosters hyperconnectivity through a network-of-networks architecture with modular and mobile capacities. The problem addresses both demand and supply uncertainties by incorporating short-term leasing of modular facilities and dynamic relocation of resources. We formulate DSMMCP as a partially adaptive multi-stage stochastic program that minimizes the expected multi-period costs under uncertainty. To tackle the inherent NP-hardness, we develop an enhanced stochastic dual dynamic integer programming (SDDiP) algorithm, which integrates strengthened cut generation, a tailored alternating cut strategy, and an efficient parallelization framework, and we establish structural dominance and monotonicity properties that formalize the value of the strengthened cuts and partial adaptivity. Numerical experiments inspired by a real case study of a large U.S. construction company demonstrate that the DSMMCP framework achieves approximately 15% cost savings over static planning while improving resilience, reducing outsourcing costs, and supporting sustainability. Complementary experiments on synthetic instances confirm the effectiveness of the proposed SDDiP algorithm in terms of solution quality and runtime, as well as the scalability and robustness of the partially adaptive stochastic modeling framework across different network sizes and uncertainty levels.</description>

      <title>Model-free policy gradient for discrete-time mean-field control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study model-free policy learning for discrete-time mean-field control (MFC) problems with finite state space and compact action space. In contrast to the extensive literature on value-based methods for MFC, policy-based approaches remain largely unexplored due to the intrinsic dependence of transition kernels and rewards on the evolving population state distribution, which prevents the direct use of likelihood-ratio estimators of policy gradients from classical single-agent reinforcement learning. We introduce a novel perturbation scheme on the state-distribution flow and prove that the gradient of the resulting perturbed value function converges to the true policy gradient as the perturbation magnitude vanishes. This construction yields a fully model-free estimator based solely on simulated trajectories and an auxiliary estimate of the sensitivity of the state distribution. Building on this framework, we develop MF-REINFORCE, a model-free policy gradient algorithm for MFC, and establish explicit quantitative bounds on its bias and mean-squared error. Numerical experiments on representative mean-field control tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Controlled Interacting Branching Diffusion Processes: A Viscosity Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study optimal control problems for interacting branching diffusion processes, a class of measure-valued dynamics capturing both spatial motion and branching mechanisms. From the perspective of the dynamic programming principle, we establish a rigorous connection between the control problem and an infinite system of coupled Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman (HJB) equations, obtained through a bijection between admissible particle configurations and the disjoint topological union of countable Euclidean spaces. Under natural coercivity conditions on the cost functionals, we show that these growth conditions transfer to the value function and yield a viscosity characterization in the class of functions satisfying the same bounds. We further prove a comparison principle, which allows us to fully characterize the control problem through the associated HJB equation. Finally, we show that the problem simplifies in the mean-field regime, where the model coefficients exhibit symmetry with respect to the indices of the individuals in the population. This permutation invariance allows us to restrict attention to a reduced class of symmetric admissible controls, a reduction established by combining the viscosity characterization of the value function with measurable selection arguments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.11300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the inverse quasi-variational inequality problem in finite-dimensional spaces. First, we introduce a second-order dynamical system whose trajectory converges exponentially to the solution of the inverse quasi-variational inequality, under the assumptions of Lipschitz continuity and strong monotonicity. Next, we discretize the proposed dynamical system to develop an algorithm, and prove that the iterations converge linearly to the unique solution of the inverse quasi-variational inequality. Finally, we present numerical experiments and applications to validate the theoretical results and compare the performance with existing methods.</description>

      <title>Optimal Abatement Schedules for Excess Carbon Emissions Towards a Net-Zero Target</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving net-zero carbon emissions requires a transformation of energy systems, industrial processes, and consumption patterns. In particular, a transition towards that goal involves a gradual reduction of excess carbon emissions that are not essential for the well-functioning of society. In this paper we study this problem from a stochastic control perspective to identify the optimal gradual reduction of the emission rate, when an allocated excess carbon budget is used up over time. Assuming that updates of the available carbon budget follow a diffusion process, we identify the emission strategy that maximizes expected discounted emissions under the constraint of a non-increasing emission rate, with an additional term rewarding the amount of time for which the budget is not yet depleted. We establish a link of this topic to optimal dividend problems in insurance risk theory under ratcheting constraints and show that the value function is the unique viscosity solution of the associated Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation. We provide numerical illustrations of the resulting optimal abatement schedule of emissions and a quantitative evaluation of the effect of the non-increasing rate constraint on the value function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.11395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study deterministic nonstationary discrete-time optimal control problems in both finite and infinite horizon. With the aid of Gateaux differentials, we prove a discrete-time maximum principle in analogy with the well-known continuous-time maximum principle. We show that this maximum principle, together with a transversality condition, is a necessary condition for optimality; we also show that it is sufficient under additional hypotheses. We use Gateaux differentials as a natural setting to derive first-order conditions. Additionally, we use the discrete-time maximum principle to derive the discrete-time Euler equation and to characterize Nash equilibria for discrete-time dynamic games.</description>

      <title>Statistical Robustness of Interval CVaR Based Regression Models under Perturbation and Contamination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robustness under perturbation and contamination is a prominent issue in statistical learning. We address the robust nonlinear regression based on the so-called interval conditional value-at-risk (In-CVaR), which is introduced to enhance robustness by trimming extreme losses. While recent literature shows that the In-CVaR based statistical learning exhibits superior robustness performance than classical robust regression models, its theoretical robustness analysis for nonlinear regression remains largely unexplored. We rigorously quantify robustness under contamination, with a unified study of distributional breakdown point for a broad class of regression models, including linear, piecewise affine and neural network models with $\ell_1$, $\ell_2$ and Huber losses. Moreover, we analyze the qualitative robustness of the In-CVaR based estimator under perturbation. We show that under several minor assumptions, the In-CVaR based estimator is qualitatively robust in terms of the Prokhorov metric if and only if the largest portion of losses is trimmed. Overall, this study analyzes robustness properties of In-CVaR based nonlinear regression models under both perturbation and contamination, which illustrates the advantages of In-CVaR risk measure over conditional value-at-risk and expectation for robust regression in both theory and numerical experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.11435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies decentralized stochastic nonconvex optimization problem over row-stochastic networks. We consider the heavy-tailed gradient noise which is empirically observed in many popular real-world applications. Specifically, we propose a decentralized normalized stochastic gradient descent with Pull-Diag gradient tracking, which achieves approximate stationary points with the optimal sample complexity and the near-optimal communication complexity. We further follow our framework to study the setting of undirected networks, also achieving the nearly tight upper complexity bounds. Moreover, we conduct empirical studies to show the practical superiority of the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Projection-based discrete-time consensus on the unit sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address discrete-time consensus on the Euclidean unit sphere. For this purpose we consider a distributed algorithm comprising the iterative projection of a conical combination of neighboring states. Neighborhoods are represented by a strongly connected directed graph, and the conical combinations are represented by a (non-negative) weight matrix with a zero structure corresponding to the graph. A first result mirrors earlier results for gradient flows. Under the assumptions that each diagonal element of the weight matrix is more than $\sqrt{2}$ larger than the sum of the other elements in the corresponding row, the sphere dimension is greater or equal to 2, and the graph, as well as the weight matrix, is symmetric, we show that the algorithm comprises gradient ascent, stable fixed points are consensus points, and the set of initial points for which the algorithm converges to a non-consensus fixed point has measure zero. The second result is that for the unit circle and a strongly connected graph or for any unit sphere with dimension greater than or equal to $1$ and the complete graph, only for a measure zero set of weight matrices there are fixed points for the algorithm which do not have consensus or antipodal configurations.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Recursive Inclusions under Biased Perturbations: An Input-to-State Stability Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the asymptotic behavior of stochastic recursive inclusions in the presence of non-zero, non-diminishing bias, a setting that frequently arises in zeroth-order optimization, stochastic approximation with iterate-dependent noise, and distributed learning with adversarial agents. The analysis is conducted through the lens of input-to-state stability of an associated differential inclusion, which serves as the continuous-time limit of the discrete recursion. We first establish that if the limiting differential inclusion is input-to-state stable and the iterates remain almost surely bounded, then the iterates converge almost surely to the neighborhood of desired equilibrium. We then provide a verifiable sufficient condition for almost sure boundedness by assuming that the underlying operator is single-valued and globally Lipschitz. Finally, we show that several zeroth-order variants of stochastic gradient naturally fit within this framework, and we demonstrate their input-to-state stability under standard conditions. Overall, the results provide a unified theoretical foundation for studying almost sure convergence of biased stochastic approximation schemes through the Input to State stability theory of differential inclusions.</description>

      <title>The XL Instances for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new set of large-scale benchmark instances for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). The proposed XL set extends existing benchmarks by covering instances with 1,000 to 10,000 customers and a wide range of structural characteristics, following established generation principles from prior CVRP studies. A computational study involving several state-of-the-art algorithms is conducted to provide initial best known solutions (BKSs) for the XL instances, which serve as a baseline for a community-driven BKS challenge launched on the CVRPLib website. The instances are made publicly available to support experimental evaluation and comparison of solution methods. Furthermore, additional computational analyses are reported to compare algorithmic performance on other existing CVRP benchmark instances.</description>

      <title>A Probabilistic Approach to Trajectory-Based Optimal Experimental Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel probabilistic approach for optimal path experimental design. In this approach a discrete path optimization problem is defined on a static navigation mesh, and trajectories are modeled as random variables governed by a parametric Markov policy. The discrete path optimization problem is then replaced with an equivalent stochastic optimization problem over the policy parameters, resulting in an optimal probability model that samples estimates of the optimal discrete path. This approach enables exploration of the utility function's distribution tail and treats the utility function of the design as a black box, making it applicable to linear and nonlinear inverse problems and beyond experimental design. Numerical verification and analysis are carried out by using a parameter identification problem widely used in model-based optimal experimental design.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent Formation Navigation Using Diffusion-Based Trajectory Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a diffusion-based planner for leader--follower formation control in cluttered environments. The diffusion policy is used to generate the trajectory of the midpoint of two leaders as a rigid bar in the plane, thereby defining their desired motion paths in a planar formation. While the followers track the leaders and form desired foramtion geometry using a distance-constrained formation controller based only on the relative positions in followers' local coordinates. The proposed approach produces smooth motions and low tracking errors, with most failures occurring in narrow obstacle-free space, or obstacle configurations that are not in the training data set. Simulation results demonstrate the potential of diffusion models for reliable multi-agent formation planning.</description>

      <title>Differentiating through binarized topology changes: Second-order subpixel-smoothed projection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A key challenge in topology optimization (TopOpt) is that manufacturable structures, being inherently binary, are non-differentiable, creating a fundamental tension with gradient-based optimization. The subpixel-smoothed projection (SSP) method addresses this issue by smoothing sharp interfaces at the subpixel level through a first-order expansion of the filtered field. However, SSP does not guarantee differentiability under topology changes, such as the merging of two interfaces, and therefore violates the convergence guarantees of many popular gradient-based optimization algorithms. We overcome this limitation by regularizing SSP with the Hessian of the filtered field, resulting in a twice-differentiable projected density during such transitions, while still guaranteeing an almost-everywhere binary structure. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our second-order SSP (SSP2) methodology on both thermal and photonic problems, showing that SSP2 has faster convergence than SSP for connectivity-dominant cases -- where frequent topology changes occur -- while exhibiting comparable performance otherwise. Beyond improving convergence guarantees for CCSA optimizers, SSP2 enables the use of a broader class of optimization algorithms with stronger theoretical guarantees, such as interior-point methods. Since SSP2 adds minimal complexity relative to SSP or traditional projection schemes, it can be used as a drop-in replacement in existing TopOpt codes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.10768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates complex product-innovation processes using models grounded in a set of heuristics. Each heuristic is expressed through simple trends -- increasing, decreasing, or constant -- which serve as minimally information-intensive quantifiers, avoiding reliance on numerical values or rough sets. A solution to a trend model is defined as a set of scenarios with possible transitions between them, represented by a transition graph. Any possible future or past behaviour of the system under study can thus be depicted by a path within this graph.</description>

      <title>Contextual Distributionally Robust Optimization with Causal and Continuous Structure: An Interpretable and Tractable Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a framework for contextual distributionally robust optimization (DRO) that considers the causal and continuous structure of the underlying distribution by developing interpretable and tractable decision rules that prescribe decisions using covariates. We first introduce the causal Sinkhorn discrepancy (CSD), an entropy-regularized causal Wasserstein distance that encourages continuous transport plans while preserving the causal consistency. We then formulate a contextual DRO model with a CSD-based ambiguity set, termed Causal Sinkhorn DRO (Causal-SDRO), and derive its strong dual reformulation where the worst-case distribution is characterized as a mixture of Gibbs distributions. To solve the corresponding infinite-dimensional policy optimization, we propose the Soft Regression Forest (SRF) decision rule, which approximates optimal policies within arbitrary measurable function spaces. The SRF preserves the interpretability of classical decision trees while being fully parametric, differentiable, and Lipschitz smooth, enabling intrinsic interpretation from both global and local perspectives. To solve the Causal-SDRO with parametric decision rules, we develop an efficient stochastic compositional gradient algorithm that converges to an $\varepsilon$-stationary point at a rate of $O(\varepsilon^{-4})$, matching the convergence rate of standard stochastic gradient descent. Finally, we validate our method through numerical experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating its superior performance and interpretability.</description>

      <title>Bond Polytope under Vertex- and Edge-sums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A cut in a graph $G$ is called a {\em bond} if both parts of the cut induce connected subgraphs in $G$, and the {\em bond polytope} is the convex hull of all bonds. Computing the maximum weight bond is an NP-hard problem even for planar graphs. However, the problem is solvable in linear time on $(K_5 \setminus e)$-minor-free graphs, and in more general, on graphs of bounded treewidth, essentially due to clique-sum decomposition into simpler graphs.
  We show how to obtain the bond polytope of graphs that are $1$- or $2$-sum of graphs $G_1$ and $ G_2$ from the bond polytopes of $G_1,G_2$. Using this we show that the extension complexity of the bond polytope of $(K_5 \setminus e)$-minor-free graphs is linear. Prior to this work, a linear size description of the bond polytope was known only for $3$-connected planar $(K_5 \setminus e)$-minor-free graphs, essentially only for wheel graphs.
  We also describe an elementary linear time algorithm for the \MaxBond problem on $(K_5\setminus e)$-minor-free graphs. Prior to this work, a linear time algorithm in this setting was known. However, the hidden constant in the big-Oh notation was large because the algorithm relies on the heavy machinery of linear time algorithms for graphs of bounded treewidth, used as a black box.</description>

      <title>A Defender-Attacker-Defender Model for Optimizing the Resilience of Hospital Networks to Cyberattacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Considering the increasing frequency of cyberattacks affecting multiple hospitals simultaneously, improving resilience at a network level is essential. Various countermeasures exist to improve resilience against cyberattacks, such as deploying controls that strengthen IT infrastructures to limit their impact, or enabling resource sharing, patient transfers and backup capacities to maintain services of hospitals in response to realized attacks. However, determining the most cost-effective combination among these wide range of countermeasures is a complex challenge, further intensified by constrained budgets and competing priorities between maintaining efficient daily hospital operations and investing in disaster preparedness. To address these challenges, we propose a defender-attacker-defender optimization model that supports decision-makers in identifying effective strategies for improving the resilience of a network of hospitals against cyberattacks. The model explicitly captures interdependence between hospital services and their supporting IT infrastructures. By doing so, cyberattacks can be directly translated into reductions of service capacities, which allows to assess proactive and reactive strategies on both the operational and technical sides within a single framework. Further, time-dependent resilience measures are incorporated as design objectives to account for the mid- to long-term consequences of cyberattacks. The model is validated based on the German hospital network, suggesting that enabling cooperation with backup capacities particularly in urban areas, alongside strengthening of IT infrastructures across all hospitals, are crucial strategies.</description>

Abstract: We initiate the polyhedral study of the Virtual Network Embedding (VNE) problem, which arises in modern telecommunication networks. We propose new valid inequalities for the so-called flow formulation. We then prove, through a dedicated flow decomposition algorithm, that these inequalities characterize the VNE polytope in the case of an embedding of a virtual edge on a substrate path. Preliminary experiments show that the new inequalities propose promising speedups for MIP solvers.</description>

      <title>Learning-Based Shrinking Disturbance-Invariant Tubes for State- and Input-Dependent Uncertainty</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.11426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a learning-based framework for constructing shrinking disturbance-invariant tubes under state- and input-dependent uncertainty, intended as a building block for tube Model Predictive Control (MPC), and certify safety via a lifted, isotone (order-preserving) fixed-point map. Gaussian Process (GP) posteriors become $(1-\alpha)$ credible ellipsoids, then polytopic outer sets for deterministic set operations. A two-time-scale scheme separates learning epochs, where these polytopes are frozen, from an inner, outside-in iteration that converges to a compact fixed point $Z^\star\!\subseteq\!\mathcal G$; its state projection is RPI for the plant. As data accumulate, disturbance polytopes tighten, and the associated tubes nest monotonically, resolving the circular dependence between the set to be verified and the disturbance model while preserving hard constraints. A double-integrator study illustrates shrinking tube cross-sections in data-rich regions while maintaining invariance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.06676v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the problem of recovering the topology and admittance of an electrical network from power and voltage data at all vertices is often ill-posed, and sometimes it even has multiple solutions. We reformulate the problem to seek for a sparse network, i.e., with few edges, which fits the data up to a given tolerance. We propose an algorithm to solve this reformulated problem. It combines, in an iterative procedure, the resolution of non-negative linear regression problems, and techniques of spectral graph sparsification. The algorithm is based on original results bounding the fitting error of a sparse approximation of a network. We illustrate our techniques with several experimental results in which we are able to recover a sparse network.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21634v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, the joint use of a mixed penalty-interior point method and direct search is proposed, to address {nonlinear} constrained derivative-free optimization problems. A merit function is considered, wherein the set of nonlinear inequality constraints is divided into two groups: one treated with a logarithmic barrier approach, and another, along with the equality constraints, addressed using a penalization term. This strategy is adapted and incorporated into a direct search method, enabling the effective handling of general nonlinear constraints. Convergence to KKT-stationary points is established under continuous differentiability assumptions, without requiring any kind of convexity. Computational experiments on analytical problems and an engineering application demonstrate the robustness, efficiency, and overall effectiveness of the proposed method, when compared with state-of-the-art solvers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02098v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a graph-theoretic modeling approach for hierarchical optimization that leverages the OptiGraph abstraction implemented in the Julia package Plasmo.jl. We show that the abstraction is flexible and can effectively capture complex hierarchical connectivity that arises from decision-making over multiple spatial and temporal scales (e.g., integration of planning, scheduling, and operations in manufacturing and infrastructures). We also show that the graph abstraction facilitates the conceptualization and implementation of decomposition and approximation schemes. Specifically, we propose a graph-based Benders decomposition (gBD) framework that enables the exploitation of hierarchical (nested) structures and that uses graph aggregation/partitioning procedures to discover such structures. In addition, we provide a Julia implementation of gBD, which we call PlasmoBenders.jl. We illustrate the capabilities using examples arising in the context of energy and power systems.</description>

      <title>Online Rack Placement in Large-Scale Data Centers: Online Sampling Optimization and Deployment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12725v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper optimizes the configuration of large-scale data centers toward cost-effective, reliable and sustainable cloud supply chains. The problem involves placing incoming racks of servers within a data center to maximize demand coverage given space, power and cooling restrictions. We formulate an online integer optimization model to support rack placement decisions. We propose a tractable online sampling optimization (OSO) approach to multi-stage stochastic optimization, which approximates unknown parameters with a sample path and re-optimizes decisions dynamically. We prove that OSO achieves a strong competitive ratio in canonical online resource allocation problems and sublinear regret in the online batched bin packing problem. Theoretical and computational results show it can outperform mean-based certainty-equivalent resolving heuristics. Our algorithm has been packaged into a software solution deployed across Microsoft's data centers, contributing an interactive decision-making process at the human-machine interface. Using deployment data, econometric tests suggest that adoption of the solution has a negative and statistically significant impact on power stranding, estimated at 1-3 percentage point. At the scale of cloud computing, these improvements in data center performance result in significant cost savings and environmental benefits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08578v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the Consensus-Based Optimization (CBO) algorithm with a consensus point rescaled by a small fixed parameter $\kappa \in (0,1)$. Under minimal assumptions on the objective function and the initial data, we establish its unconditional convergence to the global minimizer. Our results hold in the asymptotic regime where both the time--horizon $t \to \infty$ and the inverse--temperature $\alpha \to \infty$, providing a rigorous theoretical foundation for the algorithm's global convergence. Furthermore, our findings extend to the case of multiple and non--discrete set of minimizers.</description>

      <title>Pontryagin Maximum Principle for rough stochastic systems and pathwise stochastic control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22959v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze a novel class of rough stochastic control problems that allows for a convenient approach to solving pathwise stochastic control problems with both non-anticipative and anticipative controls. We first establish the well-posedness of a class of controlled rough SDEs with affine rough driver and establish the continuity of the solution w.r.t.~the driving rough path. This allows us to define pathwise stochastic control problems with anticipative controls. Subsequently, we apply a flow transformation argument to establish a necessary and sufficient maximum principle to identify and characterize optimal strategies for rough and hence pathwise stochastic control problems. We show that the rough and the corresponding pathwise stochastic control problems share the same value function. For the benchmark case of linear-quadratic problems with bounded controls a similar result is shown for optimal controls.</description>

      <title>An operatorial approach of the well-posedness of an algebraic Riccati equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20171v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Finding the state feedback control in an $% H^{\infty }$-optimal control problem involves a challenging approach of the associated algebraic Riccati equation of the generic form $A^{\ast }P+PA+P\Gamma P=F$. In view of this objective, we explore in this paper the existence of the solution to this algebraic Riccati equation by a direct operatorial approach in the space of Hilbert-Schmidt operators. The proofs are provided, under certain assumptions on the operators $\Gamma $ and $F,$ for the cases with $A$ coercive and $A\geq 0,$ respectively. They develop a constructive approach, possibly indicating a method for finding the numerical solution. Next, relying on the existence of the solution to the Riccati equation, we provide then a result concerning the associated $% H^{\infty }$-optimal control problem. An example regarding the application of the existence proof for the solution to the Riccati equation is given for a parabolic equation with a singular potential of Hardy type.</description>

      <title>Predictability Enables Parallelization of Nonlinear State Space Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16817v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rise of parallel computing hardware has made it increasingly important to understand which nonlinear state space models can be efficiently parallelized. Recent advances like DEER (arXiv:2309.12252) and DeepPCR (arXiv:2309.16318) recast sequential evaluation as a parallelizable optimization problem, sometimes yielding dramatic speedups. However, the factors governing the difficulty of these optimization problems remained unclear, limiting broader adoption. In this work, we establish a precise relationship between a system's dynamics and the conditioning of its corresponding optimization problem, as measured by its Polyak-Lojasiewicz (PL) constant. We show that the predictability of a system, defined as the degree to which small perturbations in state influence future behavior and quantified by the largest Lyapunov exponent (LLE), impacts the number of optimization steps required for evaluation. For predictable systems, the state trajectory can be computed in at worst $O((\log T)^2)$ time, where $T$ is the sequence length: a major improvement over the conventional sequential approach. In contrast, chaotic or unpredictable systems exhibit poor conditioning, with the consequence that parallel evaluation converges too slowly to be useful. Importantly, our theoretical analysis shows that predictable systems always yield well-conditioned optimization problems, whereas unpredictable systems lead to severe conditioning degradation. We validate our claims through extensive experiments, providing practical guidance on when nonlinear dynamical systems can be efficiently parallelized. We highlight predictability as a key design principle for parallelizable models.</description>

      <title>A minimization principle behind the diffusion bridge of diurnal fish migration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03824v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fish migration is a mass movement that affects the hydrosphere and ecosystems. While it occurs on multiple temporal scales, including daily and intraday fluctuations, the latter remains less studied. In this study, for a stochastic differential equation model of the intraday unit-time fish count at a fixed observation point, we demonstrate that the model can be derived from a minimization problem in the form of a stochastic control problem. The control problem assumes the form of the Schr\"odinger Bridge but differs from classical formulations by involving a degenerate diffusion process and an objective function with a novel time-dependent weight coefficient. The well-posedness of the control problem and its solution are discussed in detail by using a penalized formulation. The proposed theory is applied to juvenile upstream migration events of the diadromous fish species Plecoglossus altivelis altivelis commonly called Ayu in Japan. We also conduct sensitivity analysis of the models identified from real data.</description>

      <title>Inexact subgradient algorithm with a non-asymptotic convergence guarantee for copositive programming problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27160v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a subgradient algorithm with a non-asymptotic convergence guarantee to solve copositive programming problems. The subproblem to be solved at each iteration is a standard quadratic programming problem, which is NP-hard in general. However, the proposed algorithm allows this subproblem to be solved inexactly. For a prescribed accuracy $\epsilon &gt; 0$ for both the objective function and the constraint arising from the copositivity condition, the proposed algorithm yields an approximate solution after $O(\epsilon^{-2})$ iterations, even when the subproblems are solved inexactly. We also discuss exact and inexact approaches for solving standard quadratic programming problems and compare their performance through numerical experiments. In addition, we apply the proposed algorithm to the problem of testing complete positivity of a matrix and derive a sufficient condition for certifying that a matrix is not completely positive. Experimental results demonstrate that we can detect the lack of complete positivity in various doubly nonnegative matrices that are not completely positive.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05285v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz (P{\L}) inequality extends the favorable optimization properties of strongly convex functions to a broader class of functions. In this paper, we prove a theorem (also obtained by Criscitiello, Rebjock and Boumal in an earlier blog post) showing that the richness of the class of P{\L} functions is rooted in the nonsmooth case since sufficient regularity forces them to be essentially strongly convex. More precisely, we prove that if $f$ is a $C^2$ P{\L} function having a bounded set of minimizers, then it has a unique minimizer and is strongly convex on a sublevel set of the form $\{f\leq a\}$. We show that this implies a result of Asplund on properties of the squared distance function, and discuss some consequences on smoothness assumptions in results in the literature.</description>

      <title>A New Decomposition Paradigm for Graph-structured Nonlinear Programs via Message Passing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24676v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study finite-sum nonlinear programs with localized variable coupling encoded by a (hyper)graph. We introduce a graph-compliant decomposition framework that brings message passing into continuous optimization in a rigorous, implementable, and provable way. The (hyper)graph is partitioned into tree clusters (hypertree factor graphs). At each iteration, agents update in parallel by solving local subproblems whose objective splits into an {\it intra}-cluster term summarized by cost-to-go messages from one min-sum sweep on the cluster tree, and an {\it inter}-cluster coupling term handled Jacobi-style using the latest out-of-cluster variables. To reduce computation/communication, the method supports graph-compliant surrogates that replace exact messages/local solves with compact low-dimensional parametrizations; in hypergraphs, the same principle enables surrogate hyperedge splitting, to tame heavy hyperedge overlaps while retaining finite-time intra-cluster message updates and efficient computation/communication. We establish convergence for (strongly) convex and nonconvex objectives, with topology- and partition-explicit rates that quantify curvature/coupling effects and guide clustering and scalability. To our knowledge, this is the first convergent message-passing method on loopy graphs.</description>

      <title>A Natural Primal-Dual Hybrid Gradient Method for Adversarial Neural Network Training on Solving Partial Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06278v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a scalable preconditioned primal-dual hybrid gradient algorithm for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). We multiply the PDE with a dual test function to obtain an inf-sup problem whose loss functional involves lower-order differential operators. The Primal-Dual Hybrid Gradient (PDHG) algorithm is then leveraged for this saddle point problem. By introducing suitable precondition operators to the proximal steps in the PDHG algorithm, we obtain an alternative natural gradient ascent-descent optimization scheme for updating the neural network parameters. We apply the Krylov subspace method (MINRES) to evaluate the natural gradients efficiently. Such treatment readily handles the inversion of precondition matrices via matrix-vector multiplication. An \textit{a posteriori} convergence analysis is established for the time-continuous version of the proposed algorithm for general linear PDEs. By incorporating appropriate boundary loss terms, we further obtain a refined \textit{a priori} convergence result for elliptic equations in divergence form. The algorithm is tested on various types of PDEs with dimensions ranging from $1$ to $50$, including linear and nonlinear elliptic equations, reaction-diffusion equations, and Monge-Amp\`ere equations stemming from the $L^2$ optimal transport problems. We compare the performance of the proposed method with several commonly used deep learning algorithms such as physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), the DeepRitz method and weak adversarial networks (WANs) using either the Adam or the L-BFGS optimizer. The numerical results suggest that the proposed method performs efficiently and robustly and converges more stably with higher accuracy.</description>

      <title>Universal Architectures for the Learning of Polyhedral Norms and Convex Regularizers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19190v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the task of learning convex regularizers to guide the reconstruction of images from limited data. By imposing that the reconstruction be amplitude-equivariant, we narrow down the class of admissible functionals to those that can be expressed as a power of a seminorm. We then show that such functionals can be approximated to arbitrary precision with the help of polyhedral norms. In particular, we identify two dual parameterizations of such systems: (i) a synthesis form with an $\ell_1$-penalty that involves some learnable dictionary; and (ii) an analysis form with an $\ell_\infty$-penalty that involves a trainable regularization operator. After having provided geometric insights and proved that the two forms are universal, we propose an implementation that relies on a specific architecture (tight frame with a weighted $\ell_1$ penalty) that is easy to train. We illustrate its use for denoising and the reconstruction of biomedical images. We find that the proposed framework outperforms the sparsity-based methods of compressed sensing, while it offers essentially the same convergence and robustness guarantees.</description>

      <title>Distributionally Robust Kalman Filter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06286v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study state estimation for discrete-time linear stochastic systems under distributional ambiguity in the initial state, process noise, and measurement noise. We propose a noise-centric distributionally robust Kalman filter (DRKF) based on Wasserstein ambiguity sets imposed directly on these distributions. This formulation excludes dynamically unreachable priors and yields a Kalman-type recursion driven by least-favorable covariances computed via semidefinite programs (SDP). In the time-invariant case, the steady-state DRKF is obtained from a single stationary SDP, producing a constant gain with Kalman-level online complexity. We establish the convergence of the DR Riccati covariance iteration to the stationary SDP solution, together with an explicit sufficient condition for a prescribed convergence rate. We further show that the proposed noise-centric model induces a priori spectral bounds on all feasible covariances and a Kalman filter sandwiching property for the DRKF covariances. Finally, we prove that the steady-state error dynamics are Schur stable, and the steady-state DRKF is asymptotically minimax optimal with respect to worst-case mean-square error.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Regularized Wasserstein Proximal Sampling Algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.09848v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider sampling from a Gibbs distribution by evolving a finite number of particles using a particular score estimator rather than Brownian motion. To accelerate the particles, we consider a second-order score-based ODE, similar to Nesterov acceleration. In contrast to traditional kernel density score estimation, we use the recently proposed regularized Wasserstein proximal method, yielding the Accelerated Regularized Wasserstein Proximal method (ARWP). We provide a detailed analysis of continuous- and discrete-time non-asymptotic and asymptotic mixing rates for Gaussian initial and target distributions, using techniques from Euclidean acceleration and accelerated information gradients. Compared with the kinetic Langevin sampling algorithm, the proposed algorithm exhibits a higher contraction rate in the asymptotic time regime. Numerical experiments are conducted across various low-dimensional experiments, including multi-modal Gaussian mixtures and ill-conditioned Rosenbrock distributions. ARWP exhibits structured and convergent particles, accelerated discrete-time mixing, and faster tail exploration than the non-accelerated regularized Wasserstein proximal method and kinetic Langevin methods. Additionally, ARWP particles exhibit better generalization properties for some non-log-concave Bayesian neural network tasks.</description>
