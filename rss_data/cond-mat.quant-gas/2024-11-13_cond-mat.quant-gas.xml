      <title>Exploring Thouless Pumping in the Generalized Creutz Model: A Graphical Method and Modulation Schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thouless pumping with nontrivial topological phases provides a powerful means for the manipulation of matter waves in one-dimensional lattice systems. The band topology is revealed by the quantization of pumped charge. In the context of Thouless pumping, we present a graphical representation for the topological phases characterized by the Chern number of an effective two-dimensional band. We illustrate how the two topological phases with distinct Zak phase is connected in the pumping process. Such a visual depiction exhibits typical patterns that is directly related to a linking number and to the Chern number, allowing for the construction of Thouless pumping schemes in a practical way. As a demonstration, we present a generalized Creutz model with tunable Peierls phase, inter-leg imbalance and diagonal hopping. Various modulation schemes for Thouless pumping are studied, focusing on their graphical representations in Bloch space, as well as the quantized pumping phenomenon in real space.</description>

      <title>Spin entanglement in antiferromagnetic spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the spin entanglement in a spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate with antiferromagnetic atomic interactions using the Hartree-Fock approach. Based on the isomorphism between symmetric $N$-qubit states and spin-$j=N/2$ states, we analyze the negativity of the spin-1 ground state of the condensate viewed as a two spins $1/2$, and explore its dependence with the temperature and external Zeeman fields. The scope of this type of entanglement is highlighted and contrasted with other types of entanglement, as the mode and particle entanglement. It is shown that, at finite temperatures, there is a strong dependence of the negativity with respect to the strengths of quadratic Zeeman fields and the spin-spin interactions of the condensate. Interestingly, in the antiferromagnetic ground-state phase, the negativity and the linear Zeeman field are connected quadratically through the equation of a simple circle, in which its radius depends on the temperature. On the other hand, for the polar phase, being the phase that exhibits the highest degree of entanglement, we were able to identify a clear dependency on the spin-spin interactions and the Zeeman fields that can be expressed analytically in a closed form as a function of the temperature. This results might be relevant for applications in quantum information and metrology.</description>

      <title>Interactions and Reconnections of Four-Dimensional Quantum Vortices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interactions and reconnections of vortices are fundamental in many areas of physics, including classical and quantum fluids where they are central to understanding phenomena such as turbulence. In three-dimensional (3D) superfluids, quantum vortices are one-dimensional (1D) filaments that can intersect, reconnect, and recoil with irreversible dynamics described by near-universal scaling laws. We explore quantum-vortex reconnections in a four-dimensional (4D) superfluid, where a vortex is a two-dimensional (2D) surface. Using real-time numerical simulations, we find much richer behaviour than in 3D, including stable intersecting vortex surfaces which do not reconnect, and unusual vortex reconnections which occur without significant energy dissipation, suggesting quasi-reversible dynamics. Our work raises many interesting questions about vortex physics in extra-dimensional systems, and may be extended in the future to more realistic experimental settings where the fourth dimension is simulated with techniques such as synthetic dimensions.</description>

      <title>Tunneling Spectroscopy in Superconducting Circuit Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate tunneling spectroscopy of synthetic quantum matter in superconducting circuit lattices. We measure site-resolved excitation spectra by coupling the lattice to engineered driven-dissipative particle baths that serve as local tunneling probes. Using incoherent particle source and drain, we independently extract quasi-particle and quasi-hole spectra and reconstruct the spatial structure of collective excitations. We perform spectroscopy of a strongly interacting Bose-Hubbard lattice at different densities, observing changes in energy gaps across the superfluid to Mott-insulator transition and the effects of three-body interactions. Our results provide a new toolset for characterizing many-body states in analog quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>One-body dynamical correlation function of Lieb-Liniger model at finite temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.00282v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dynamical correlated properties of one-dimensional (1D) Bose gases provide profound understanding of novel physics emergent from collective excitations, for instance, the breakdown of off-diagonal long-range order, and the establishment of Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL) theory. However, due to the non-perturbative nature of 1D many-body systems, the exact evaluation of correlation functions is notoriously difficult. Here by means of form factor approach based on algebraic Bethe ansatz and numerics, we present a thorough study on the one-body dynamical correlation function (1BDCF) of the Lieb-Liniger model at finite temperature. The influence of thermal fluctuation and dynamical interaction on the behavior of 1BDCF has been demonstrated and analyzed from various perspectives, including the spectral distribution, the line-shape of 1BDCF, and the static correlations etc. The static correlation properties, i.e. the momentum distribution and one body density matrix are shown in good agreement with the TLL prediction.</description>

      <title>Coherent Three-Photon Excitation of the Strontium Clock Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07530v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate coherent three-photon excitation of the strontium clock transition with a contrast of 51(12)% using a Bose-Einstein condensate. We follow it up with a demonstration of three-photon STIRAP-like transfer, overcoming the typical limitations of this technique to odd-level numbers. We also measure the two-body loss coefficient of $^{84}$Sr clock-state atoms. Our work constitutes an essential step towards outcoupling a continuous atom laser beam and provides a fast excitation mechanism for quantum simulation using bosonic alkaline-earth-like atoms.</description>

      <title>Dipolar ordering transitions in many-body quantum optics: Analytical diagrammatic approach to equilibrium quantum spins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18156v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum spin models with a large number of interaction partners per spin are frequently used to describe modern many-body quantum optical systems like arrays of Rydberg atoms, atom-cavity systems or trapped ion crystals. For theoretical analysis the mean-field (MF) ansatz is routinely applied. However, besides special cases of all-to-all or strong long range interactions, the MF ansatz provides only approximate results. Here we present a systematic correction to MF theory based on diagrammatic perturbation theory for quantum spin correlators in thermal equilibrium. Our analytic results are universally applicable for any lattice geometry and spin-length S. We provide pre-computed and easy-to-use building blocks for Ising, Heisenberg and transverse field Ising models in the symmetry-unbroken regime. We showcase the quality and simplicity of the method by computing magnetic phase boundaries and excitations gaps. We also treat the Dicke-Ising model of ground-state superradiance where we show that corrections to the MF phase boundary vanish.</description>

      <title>Trapping of Single Atoms in Metasurface Optical Tweezer Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05321v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical tweezer arrays have emerged as a key experimental platform for quantum computation, quantum simulation, and quantum metrology, enabling unprecedented levels of control over single atoms and molecules. Existing methods to generate tweezer arrays mostly rely on active beam-shaping devices, such as acousto-optic deflectors or liquid-crystal spatial light modulators. However, these approaches have fundamental limitations in array geometry, size, and scalability. Here we demonstrate the trapping of single atoms in optical tweezer arrays generated via holographic metasurfaces. We realize two-dimensional arrays with more than 250 tweezer traps, arranged in arbitrary geometries with trap spacings as small as 1.5 um. The arrays have a high uniformity in terms of trap depth, trap frequency, and positional accuracy, rivaling or exceeding existing approaches. Owing to sub-micrometer pixel sizes and high pixel densities, holographic metasurfaces open a path towards optical tweezer arrays with &gt;100,000 traps, facilitating tweezer-array based quantum applications that require large system sizes.</description>
