      <title>Maximum Spread of Vertex Degrees in a Simple Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the following problem: let $n&gt;k$ be natural numbers, and let $G$ be a graph on $n$ vertices (undirected, without loops or multiple edges). Denote by $h_k(G)$ the number of unordered pairs of vertices in the graph $G$ whose degrees differ by less than $k$. We aim to determine the smallest possible value $f(n,k)$ of the quantity $h_k(G)$. Interest in this question is motivated by the fact that the bipartite analogue of the problem enabled S. Cichomski and F. Petrov to prove the Burdzy -- Pitman conjecture on the spread of independent coherent random variables.
  The problem has been solved under a number of restrictions on $n$ and $k$. A conjecture about the answer in the general case is also presented.</description>

      <title>Cubic tic-tac-toe: A matching-based approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the natural generalization of tic-tac-toe to an $n \times n \times n$ board where $n \in \mathbb{N}$, it is known that the first player has a winning strategy if $n \leq 4$ and that either player can force a draw if $n \geq 8$. The question of whether the first player has a winning strategy if $n = 5, 6$ or $7$ has remained open. Here, we prove that the first player does not have a winning strategy if $n = 7$. The proof, which is computer-assisted, exploits the fact that the second player's first four moves can always be chosen such that their remaining moves can be automated via a simple pairing strategy. The process of finding the pairing strategy involves reframing the problem in such a way that the goal is to seek a maximal matching in a bipartite graph that represents the tic-tac-toe board after each player has made four moves. We use the Hopcroft-Karp matching algorithm to find such maximal matchings.</description>

      <title>Spin Leonard pairs and the zero diagonal space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a Leonard pair $A, A^*$ of linear maps on a vector space $V$ that has finite positive dimension. This Leonard pair $A,A^*$ is said to have spin whenever there exist invertible linear maps $W : V \to V$ and $W^* : V \to V$ such that $W A = A W$ and $W^* A^* = A^* W^*$ and $W A^* W^{-1} = (W^*)^{-1} A W^*$. Let $\{\theta^*_i\}_{i=0}^d$ denote a standard ordering of the eigenvalues of $A^*$. There is a related sequence of scalars $\{a_i\}_{i=0}^d$ called intersection numbers. The Leonard pair $A,A^*$ is called self-dual whenever $\{\theta^*_i\}_{i=0}^d$ is a standard ordering of the eigenvalues of $A$. We obtain the following results under the assumption that the ground field is algebraically closed and $d \geq 3$. We show that a Leonard pair $A,A^*$ on $V$ has spin if and only if both (i) $A,A^*$ is self-dual; (ii) there exist scalars $f_0,f_1,f_2, f_3$ (not all zero) such that $f_0 + f_1 \theta^*_i + f_2 a_i + f_3 a_i \theta^*_i = 0$ for $0 \leq i \leq d$. We also classify the Leonard pairs $A,A^*$ on $V$ that satisfy (ii) without assuming (i). To do this we bring in the following maps. For $0 \leq i \leq d$ let $E^*_i : V \to V$ denote the projection onto the $\theta^*_i$-eigenspace of $A^*$. Let ${\mathcal Z}(A,A^*)$ denote the set of elements $X$ in $\text{Span}\{I, A^*, A, A A^*\}$ such that $E^*_i X E^*_i= 0$ for $0 \leq i \leq d$. We call ${\mathcal Z}(A,A^*)$ the zero diagonal space of $A,A^*$. As we will see, ${\mathcal Z}(A,A^*) \neq 0$ if and only if the above condition (ii) holds. As we investigate the case ${\mathcal Z}(A,A^*) \neq 0$ in detail, we break the problem into 13 cases called types; these are the $q$-Racah type and its relatives. For each type we give a necessary and sufficient condition for ${\mathcal Z}(A,A^*) \not=0$. For each type we give an explicit basis for ${\mathcal Z}(A,A^*)$.</description>

      <title>Zero Forcing, Leaky Zero Forcing, and Leaky Forts on Hopi Rectangle Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the family of Hopi rectangle graphs, a planar generalization of the well-studied Aztec diamond graphs. We provide a new definition of this graph family as induced subgraphs of the Cartesian product of two path graphs, which helps frame our study. We then establish that the maximum nullity and the zero forcing number coincide for all Hopi rectangle graphs. Extending to the fault tolerant framework of leaky zero forcing, we use the notion of leaky forts to get a complete characterization of the $\ell$-leaky forcing number for all $\ell\ge 1$ in Hopi rectangle graphs.</description>

      <title>A weak regularity lemma for polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A regularity lemma for polynomials provides a decomposition in terms of a bounded number of approximately independent polynomials. Such regularity lemmas play an important role in numerous results, yet suffer from the familiar shortcoming of having tower-type bounds or worse. In this paper we design a new, weaker regularity lemma with strong bounds. The new regularity lemma in particular provides means to quantitatively study the curves contained in the image of a polynomial map, which is beyond the reach of standard methods.
  Applications include strong bounds for a problem of Karam on generalized rank, as well as a new method to obtain upper bounds for fan-in parameters in arithmetic circuits. For example, we show that if the image of a polynomial map $\mathbf{P} \colon \mathbb{F}^n \to \mathbb{F}^m$ of degree $d$ does not contain a line, then $\mathbf{P}$ can be computed by a depth-$4$ homogeneous formula with bottom fan-in at most $d/2$ and top fan-in at most $(2m)^{C(d)}$ (with $C(d)=2^{(1+o(1))d}$). Such a result was previously known only with at least a tower-type bound on the top fan-in. One implication of our work is a certain ``barrier'' to arithmetic circuit lower bounds, in terms of the smallest degree of a polynomial curve contained in the image of the given polynomial map.</description>

      <title>Polynomial Invariants of q-Matroids and Rank-Metric Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is shown that the Whitney function of a representable q-matroid and the collection of all higher weight enumerators of any representing rank-metric code determine each other via a monomial substitution. Moreover, the q-matroid itself and the collection of all higher support enumerators of the code determine each other. Next, it is proven that the Whitney function of a q-matroid and the Whitney function of its projectivization determine each other via a monomial substitution. Finally, q-matroids with isomorphic projectivizations are studied. It is shown that the projectivizations are isomorphic iff the q-matroids admit a dimension-preserving lattice isomorphism between their lattices of flats. Such q-matroids are called weakly isomorphic.</description>

      <title>Positroidal aspects of non-nesting rook placements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rook matroids were recently introduced by the author and Alexandersson as matroids whose bases arise from certain restricted rook placements on a skew-shaped board. They were shown to be a subclass of transversal matroids and positroids. We further investigate the structural properties of rook matroids with an emphasis on the positroidal point of view. In particular, we characterize rook matroids in terms of Grassmann necklaces of positroids, answering a question of Lam (2024). Along the way, we give a new proof of the positroidal structure of rook matroids and determine an important subclass of their cyclic flats.</description>

      <title>Stones, Bones, and Snakes: Tilability of the hexagonal grid via the double dimer model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The question of whether a given region can be successfully filled by a finite set of tiles has been commonly studied, and there are many available arguments for whether a given finite region can be tiled. We can show that there is no domino tiling of the mutilated chessboard via a coloring argument, and a slightly more subtle argument for other two-colored square-grid regions using a height function of Thurston. In this paper, we examine finite regions of the hexagonal grid and a set of tiles known as the stone, bone, and snake. Using matrices in $\text{SL}_2(\mathbb{C})$, we exhibit a new necessary criterion for a region to have a signed tiling by these tiles. This originally arose in a study of the double dimer model.</description>

      <title>Planar ternary graphs, flag spheres, and Delannoy polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2022 Kim showed when a graph $G$ is ternary (without induced cycles of length divisible by three), its independence complex $\text{Ind}(G)$ is either contractible or homotopy equivalent to a sphere. In this paper, we show that when $\text{Ind}(G)$ is homotopy equivalent to a sphere of dimension $\dim \text{Ind}(G)$, the complex is Gorenstein. Equivalently, $G$ is a $1$-well-covered graph. This answers a question by Faridi and Holleben.
  We then focus on the independence complexes of Gorenstein planar ternary graphs. We prove that they are boundaries of vertex decomposable simplicial polytopes. We show that the transformations among these flag spheres using edge subdivisions and contractions can be modeled by the Hasse diagram of the partition refinement poset. In addition, their $h$-polynomials are products of Delannoy polynomials and thus real-rooted. Finally, we demonstrate a way to construct nonplanar Gorenstein ($1$-well-covered) ternary graphs from planar ones.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.21744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate conditions under which positions in combinatorial games admit simple values. We introduce a unified diamond framework, the $\Diamond_A$-property ($A\in\{\mathbb{Z},\mathbb{D}$), for sets of positions closed under options. Under certain conditions, this framework guarantees that all values are integers, dyadic rationals, or pairs $\{m|n\}$ (on $\mathbb{Z}$ or $\mathbb{D}$). As an application, we establish that every position in \textsc{Yashima} game on bipartite graphs has an integer pair value.</description>

      <title>On the Precise Asymptotics of $ex(n,n,n,K_{2,t})$ for even $t$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $K_{2,t}$ denote the complete bipartite graph. For an integer $n\ge 1$, let $ex(n,n,n,K_{2,t})$ be the maximum number of edges in an $n\times n\times n$ tripartite graph (that is, a 3-partite graph with three parts each of size $n$) containing no copy of $K_{2,t}$. In this paper we prove that, for even $t\ge 2$, $$ ex(n,n,n,K_{2,t}) \ge \frac{3\sqrt{t-1}}{\sqrt{2}}\, n^{3/2} + o(n^{3/2}). $$ Combining our construction with earlier work of Tait and Timmons, we obtain $$ \lim\limits_{n\to\infty} \frac{ex(n,n,n,K_{2,t})}{n^{3/2}} = \frac{3\sqrt{t-1}}{\sqrt{2}}, \qquad\text{for integer } t\ge 2. $$</description>

      <title>On the Chromatic Number of Stable Kneser Hypergraphs: Verifying the Conjecture for New Families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the key unsolved conjectures in hypergraph coloring is about the chromatic number of $s$-stable $r$-uniform Kneser hypergraphs $\mathrm{KG}^r(n,k)_{s\textup{-stab}}$. The problem remains largely open, particularly in the case where $s &gt; r\geq 3$. To the best of our knowledge, no information is available except a limited number of computations conducted for the instances when $r=3, 4$, $s=4, 5$, $k=2,3$ with some $n$ does not exceed 14. In this study, we verify the conjecture for infinity many values of the parameters $n$ and $k$. In particular, we demonstrate: (i) the validity of the conjecture for $r = 4$, $s = 6$ under the condition that $3 \mid n$ or $k=2$, and (ii) for $r = 4$, $k = 2$, $s = 5$ given $3 \nmid n$. As far as we are aware, this provides the first rigorous theoretical proof of the conjecture (for the case $s &gt; r\geq 3$) for infinitely many parameter values, extending beyond finite computational verification. Furthermore, our methods rely on a detailed study of vector-stable Kneser graphs, an approach that not only yields these results but also provides a deeper understanding of their chromatic numbers.</description>

      <title>On the coefficients of interior and exterior polynomials of polymatroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Tutte polynomial is an important invariant of graphs and matroids. Chen and Guo \emph{[Adv. in Appl. Math. 166 (2025) 102868.]} proved that for a $(k+1)$-edge connected graph $G$ and for any $i$ with $0\leq i &lt;\frac{3(k+1)}{2}$, $$[y^{g-i}]T_{G}(1,y)=\binom{|V(G)|+i-2}{i}-\sum_{j=0}^{i}\binom{|V(G)|+i-2-j}{i-j}|\mathcal{SC}_{j}(G)|,$$ where $g=|E(G)|-|V(G)|+1$, $\mathcal{SC}_{j}(G)$ is the set of all minimal edge cuts with $j$ edges, $T_{G}(x,y)$ is the Tutte polynomial of the graph $G$, and $[y^{g-i}]T_{G}(1,y)$ denotes the coefficient of $y^{g-i}$ in the polynomial $T_{G}(1,y)$. Recently, Ma, Guan and Jin \emph{[arXiv.2503.06095, 2025.]} generalized this result from graphs to matroids and obtained the dual result on coefficients of $T_M(x,1)$ of matroids $M$ at the same time. In 2013, as a generalization of $T_{G}(x,1)$ and $T_{G}(1,y)$ of graphs $G$ to hypergraphs, K\'{a}lm\'{a}n \emph{[Adv. Math. 244 (2013) 823-873.]} introduced interior and exterior polynomials for connected hypergraphs. Chen and Guo posed a problem that can one generalize these results of graphs to interior and exterior polynomials of hypergraphs? In this paper, we solve it in the affirmative by obtaining results for more general polymatroids, which include the case of hypergraphs and also generalize the results of matroids due to Ma, Guan and Jin. As an application, the sequence consisting of these coefficients on polymatroids is proven to be unimodal, while the unimodality of the whole coefficients of matroids was obtained in 2018 by Adiprasito, Huh and Katz using Hodge theory.</description>

      <title>Majority Edge Colouring of Hypergraph</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let G = (V, E) be a hypergraph. A 1/k-majority (k+1)-edge-colouring of a hypergraph is an edge-colouring with k+1 colours such that for every vertex v and each colour i, at most floor(d(v)/k) hyperedges incident to v receive colour i. Motivated by a recent work of P\k{e}ka{\l}a and Przyby{\l}o on majority edge-colouring in graphs, we prove that every hypergraph G with minimum degree delta(G) &gt;= 2 r k^2 admits a 1/k-majority (k+1)-edge-colouring, where r = max_{e in E} |e|, by extending their key lemma.</description>

      <title>List coloring ordered graphs with forbidden induced subgraphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the List $k$-Coloring problem we are given a graph whose every vertex is equipped with a list, which is a subset of $\{1,\ldots,k\}$. We need to decide if $G$ admits a proper coloring, where every vertex receives a color from its list.
  The complexity of the problem in classes defined by forbidding induced subgraphs is a widely studied topic in algorithmic graph theory. Recently, Hajebi, Li, and Spirkl [SIAM J. Discr. Math. 38 (2024)] initiated the study of List $3$-Coloring in ordered graphs, i.e., graphs with fixed linear ordering of vertices. Forbidding ordered induced subgraphs allows us to investigate the boundary of tractability more closely.
  We continue this direction of research, focusing mostly on the case of List $4$-Coloring. We present several algorithmic and hardness results, which altogether provide an almost complete dichotomy for classes defined by forbidding one fixed ordered graph: our investigations leave one minimal open case.</description>

      <title>Tensor rank of the determinant and periodic triangulations of $\mathbb{R}^n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that in any $\mathbb{Z}^n$-periodic triangulation of $\mathbb{R}^n$ the number of $\mathbb{Z}^n$-orbits of $n$-dimensional simplices is at least the tensor rank of the $n$th determinant tensor. The latter is known to be at least $\frac{n^{n-1}}{(n-1)!}$, which is approximately $\frac{e^n}{\sqrt{2\pi n}}$ for large $n$. The triangulation is not assumed to be geometric, meaning that its simplices can be ``curved''.
  We also provide lower bounds for general spaces. A simplicial cell complex is a CW-complex glued out of simplices with the attaching maps being simplicial embeddings; this notion generalizes simplicial complexes. We prove that if $X$ is a simplicial cell complex with cohomological classes $\alpha_i\in H^{d_i}(X;\mathbb{Z}_2)$ satisfying \[ \alpha_1 \smile \alpha_2 \smile \ldots \smile \alpha_n \neq 0, \] then $X$ has at least $2^n$ simplices of dimension $d_1+d_2+\ldots+d_n$. In particular, a simplicial cell complex homeomorphic to $\mathbb{R} P^n$, $\mathbb{C} P^n$, or $(S^2)^n$, has at least $2^n$ top-dimensional simplices.
  A crystallization of a manifold is a simplicial cell complex homeomorphic to this manifold and having the least possible number of vertices. We give a short explicit construction of a crystallization and a triangulation of $\mathbb{R}^n/\mathbb{Z}^n$ with $n+1$ and $2^{n+1}-1$ vertices, resp. Triangulations with this many vertices were described before and no smaller triangulation is known.</description>

      <title>On the D-finiteness of generating functions counting small steps walks in the quadrant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The enumeration of small steps walks confined to the first quadrant of the plane has attracted a lot of attention over the past fifteen years. The associated generating functions are trivariate formal power series in $x,y,t$ where the parameter $t$ encodes the length of the walk while the variables $x,y$ correspond to the coordinates of its ending point. These functions satisfy a functional equation in two catalytic variables.
  Bousquet-M\'{e}lou and Mishna have associated to any small steps model an algebraic curve called the kernel curve and a group called the group of the walk. These two objects turned out to be central in the classification of small steps models. In a recent work, Dreyfus, Elvey Price, and Raschel prove that the group of the walk is finite if and only if the generating function is $D$-finite, that is, it satisfies a linear differential equation with polynomial coefficients in each of its variables $x,y,t$.
  In this paper, we show that if the group of the walk is infinite, the generating function doesn't satisfy a linear differential equation in $x,y$ or $t$ over the field $\mathbb{Q}(x,y,t)$. The proof of Dreyfus, Elvey Price, and Raschel is based on some singularity analysis. Here, we propose a new strategy which relies essentially on the aforementioned functional equation and on algebraic arguments. This point of view sheds also a new light on the algebraic nature of the generating functions of small steps models since it relates their $D$-finiteness more directly to some geometric properties of the kernel curve.</description>

      <title>Extremal distance spectral radius of graphs with $h$-extra $r$-component connectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For two integers $r\geq 2$ and $h\geq 0$, the $h$-extra $r$-component connectivity of a graph $G$, denoted by $c\kappa_{r}^{h}$, is defined as the minimum number of vertices whose removal produces a disconnected graph with at least $r$ components, where each component contains at least $h+1$ vertices. Let $\mathcal{G}_{n,\delta}^{c\kappa_{r}^{h}}$ represent the set of graphs of order $n$ with minimum degree $\delta$ and $h$-extra $r$-component connectivity $c\kappa_{r}^{h}$. Hu, Lin, and Zhang [\textit{Discrete Math.} \textbf{345} (2025) 114621] investigated the case when $h=0$ within $\mathcal{G}_{n,\delta}^{c\kappa_{r}^{h}}$, and characterized the corresponding extremal graphs that minimize the distance spectral radius. In this paper, we further explore the relevant extremal graphs in $\mathcal{G}_{n,\delta}^{c\kappa_{r}^{h}}$ for $h\geq 1$.</description>

      <title>Visibility Polynomial of Some Graph Classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mutual visibility in graphs provides a framework for analysing how vertices can observe one another along shortest paths free of internal obstructions. The visibility polynomial, which enumerates mutual-visibility sets of all orders, has emerged as a central invariant in this study, with both theoretical significance and practical relevance in areas such as surveillance, target tracking, and distributed coordination. While computing this polynomial is computationally demanding, with known complexity $O(n^32^n)$, explicit characterizations for specific graph families yield valuable structural insights. In this paper, we characterize the mutual-visibility sets of several fundamental graph classes and derive closed-form expressions for their associated visibility polynomials. These results deepen the understanding of visibility-based invariants and expand the toolkit available for studying visibility phenomena in networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The induced Ramsey number $R_{\mathrm{ind}}(H; r)$ of a graph $H$ is the minimum number $N$ such that there exists a graph with $N$ vertices for which all $r$-colourings of its edges contain a monochromatic induced copy of $H$. Our main result is the existence of a constant $C &gt; 0$ such that, for every graph $H$ on $k$ vertices, these numbers satisfy \begin{equation*}
  R_{\mathrm{ind}}(H; r) \le r^{C r k}. \end{equation*} When $r = 2$, this resolves a conjecture of Erd\H{o}s from 1975. For $r &gt; 2$, it answers a question of Conlon, Fox and Sudakov in a strong form.</description>

Abstract: We say a sequence $f_0, f_1, f_2, \ldots$ of symmetric functions is Schur log-concave if $f_n^2 - f_{n-1}f_{n+1}$ is Schur positive for all $n\ge1$. We conjecture that a very general class of sequences of Schur functions satisfies this property, and show it for sequences of Schur functions indexed by partitions with growing first part and column. Our findings are related to work of Lam, Postnikov and Pylyavskyy on Schur positivity, and of Butler, Sagan, and the second author on $q$-log-concavity.</description>

      <title>Semi-Random Graphs, Robust Asymmetry, and Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Graph Reconstruction Conjecture famously posits that any undirected graph on at least three vertices is determined up to isomorphism by its family of (unlabeled) induced subgraphs. At present, the conjecture admits partial resolutions of two types: 1) casework-based demonstrations of reconstructibility for families of graphs satisfying certain structural properties, and 2) probabilistic arguments establishing reconstructibility of random graphs by leveraging average-case phenomena. While results in the first category capture the worst-case nature of the conjecture, they play a limited role in understanding the general case. Results in the second category address much larger graph families, but it remains unclear how heavily the necessary arguments rely on optimistic distributional properties. Drawing on the perspectives of smoothed and semi-random analysis, we study the robustness of what are arguably the two most fundamental properties in this latter line of work: asymmetry and uniqueness of subgraphs. Notably, we find that various semi-random graph distributions exhibit these properties asymptotically, much like their Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi counterparts.
  In particular, Bollob\'as (1990) demonstrated that almost all Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graphs $G = (V, E) \sim \mathscr{G}(n, p)$ enjoy the property that their induced subgraphs on $n - \Theta(1)$ vertices are asymmetric and mutually non-isomorphic, for $1 - p, p = \Omega(\log(n) / n)$. We show that this property is robust against perturbation -- even when an adversary is permitted to add/remove each vertex pair in $V^{(2)}$ with (independent) arbitrarily large constant probability. Exploiting this result, we derive asymptotic characterizations of asymmetry in random graphs with planted structure and bounded adversarial corruptions, along with improved bounds on the probability mass of nonreconstructible graphs in $\mathscr{G}(n, p)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.21566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The cocycle stability rate of a simplicial complex measures how far cochains with small coboundaries are from actual cocycles. In this paper, we study the 1-dimensional cocycle stability rate with permutation coefficients of random 2-dimensional Linial--Meshulam complexes. Our main contribution is the following: If, in the middle traingle density range, these random complexes asymptotically almost surely have a linear cocycle stability rate, then there exists a non-sofic hyperbolic group. As no non-sofic group, nor any non-residually finite hyperbolic group, are known to exist, this opens a potential approach to both problems simultaneously. Our proof method is inspired by a well known fact about the non local testability of Sipser--Spielman expander codes.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we generalize the \textit{Clock Theorem} of Formal Knot Theory to knotoids in $S^2$. The clock theorem implies that clock states of a knotoid diagram form a lattice under transpositions. These states form the basis of many invariants of knotoids and linkoids including the Alexander polynomial, Mock Alexander polynomial and the Jones polynomial.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work will appear as a chapter in a forthcoming volume titled `Topics in Probabilistic Graph Theory'.
  For a given graph $G$, each partition of the vertices has a modularity score, with higher values indicating that the partition better captures community structure in $G$. The modularity $q^*(G)$ of $G$ is the maximum over all vertex-partitions of the modularity score, and satisfies $0\leq q^*(G)&lt; 1$. Modularity lies at the heart of the most popular algorithms for community detection. In this chapter we discuss the behaviour of the modularity of various kinds of random graphs, starting with the binomial random graph $G_{n,p}$ with $n$ vertices and edge-probability $p$.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Level Framework for Multi-Objective Hypergraph Partitioning: Combining Minimum Spanning Tree and Proximal Gradient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes an efficient hypergraph partitioning framework based on a novel multi-objective non-convex constrained relaxation model. A modified accelerated proximal gradient algorithm is employed to generate diverse $k$-dimensional vertex features to avoid local optima and enhance partition quality. Two MST-based strategies are designed for different data scales: for small-scale data, the Prim algorithm constructs a minimum spanning tree followed by pruning and clustering; for large-scale data, a subset of representative nodes is selected to build a smaller MST, while the remaining nodes are assigned accordingly to reduce complexity. To further improve partitioning results, refinement strategies including greedy migration, swapping, and recursive MST-based clustering are introduced for partitions.
  Experimental results on public benchmark sets demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves reductions in cut size of approximately 2\%--5\% on average compared to KaHyPar in 2, 3, and 4-way partitioning, with improvements of up to 35\% on specific instances. Particularly on weighted vertex sets, our algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art partitioners including KaHyPar, hMetis, Mt-KaHyPar, and K-SpecPart, highlighting its superior partitioning quality and competitiveness. Furthermore, the proposed refinement strategy improves hMetis partitions by up to 16\%. A comprehensive evaluation based on virtual instance methodology and parameter sensitivity analysis validates the algorithm's competitiveness and characterizes its performance trade-offs.</description>

      <title>Exponential anticoncentration of the permanent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $A\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$ be a random matrix with independent entries, and suppose that the entries are "uniformly anticoncentrated" in the sense that there is a constant $\varepsilon&gt;0$ such that each entry $a_{ij}$ satisfies $\sup_{z}\Pr[a_{ij}=z]\le1-\varepsilon$ (for example, $A$ could be a uniformly random $n\times n$ matrix with $\pm1$ entries). Significantly improving previous bounds of Tao and Vu, we prove that the permanent of $A$ is exponentially anticoncentrated: there is $c_{\varepsilon}&gt;0$ such that $\sup_{z}\Pr[\operatorname{per}(A)=z]\le\exp(-c_{\varepsilon}n)$. Our proof also works for the determinant, giving an alternative proof of a classical theorem of Kahn, Koml\'os and Szemer\'edi. As a consequence, we see that there are at least exponentially many different permanents of $n\times n$ matrices with $\pm1$ entries, resolving a problem of Ingram and Razborov.</description>

Abstract: We study flips in hypertriangulations of planar points sets. Here a level-$k$ hypertriangulation of $n$ points in the planes is a subdivision induced by the projection of a $k$-hypersimplex, which is the convex hull of the barycenters of the $(k-1)$-dimensional faces of the standard $(n-1)$-simplex. In particular, we introduce four types of flips and prove that the level-2 hypertriangulations are connected by these flips.</description>

      <title>Bipartite Powers of Certain Classes of Bipartite Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17279v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The concept of graph powers has been extensively studied in graph theory. Analogous to graph powers, Chandran et al. [3] introduced the notion of bipartite powers for bipartite graphs. In this paper, we show that the class of interval bigraphs, as well as the class of proper interval bigraphs are closed under the operation of taking bipartite powers. Finally, we define strongly closed property for bipartite graphs under powers and have shown that the class of chordal bipartite graphs is strongly closed under bipartite powers.</description>

      <title>On forbidden configurations in point-line incidence graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00954v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The celebrated Szemer\'edi--Trotter theorem states that the maximum number of incidences between $n$ points and $n$ lines in the plane is $O(n^{4/3})$, which is asymptotically tight. Solymosi (2005) conjectured that for any set of points $P_0$ and for any set of lines $\mathcal{L}_0$ in the plane, the maximum number of incidences between $n$ points and $n$ lines in the plane whose incidence graph does not contain the incidence graph of $(P_0,\mathcal{L}_0)$ is $o(n^{4/3})$. This conjecture is mentioned in the book of Brass, Moser, and Pach (2005). Even a stronger conjecture, which states that the bound can be improved to $O(n^{4/3-\varepsilon})$ for some $\varepsilon = \varepsilon(P_0,\mathcal{L}_0)&gt;0$, was introduced by Mirzaei and Suk (2021). We disprove both of these conjectures. We also introduce a new approach for proving the upper bound $O(n^{4/3-\varepsilon})$ on the number of incidences for configurations $(P,\mathcal{L})$ that avoid certain subconfigurations.</description>

      <title>Friezes from surfaces and Farey triangulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13511v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a classification of positive integral friezes on marked bordered surfaces in the style of Conway and Coxeter. More precisely, we prove that positive integral friezes are in one-to-one correspondence with ideal triangulations supplied with a collection of rescaling constants assigned to punctures. For every triangulation the set of the collections of constants is finite and is completely determined by the valencies of vertices in the triangulation. In particular, it follows that the number of non-equivalent friezes on bordered surfaces is finite, and all friezes on unpunctured surfaces are unitary.</description>

      <title>Gibbs partitions and lattice paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03930v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work is devoted to the analysis of a Gibbs partition model, also known as a composition scheme. We consider a natural new condition on the component weights. It leads to a new behavior for the total number of components. We discover a condensation phenomenon, producing a unique giant component comprising almost the entire mass. Additionally, we prove a point process limit describing the asymptotic size of the non-maximal components exhibiting a sublinear power-law growth. A particular motivation for our article stems from applications, ranging from simple random walks in the cube, over lattice paths models in the plane, pairs of directed random walks, over to urn models and card guessing games.</description>

      <title>Geometric realizations of $\nu$-associahedra via brick polyhedra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10477v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Brick polytopes constitute a remarkable family of polytopes associated to the spherical subword complexes of Knutson and Miller. They were introduced for finite Coxeter groups by Pilaud and Stump, who used them to produce geometric realizations of generalized associahedra arising from the theory of cluster algebras of finite types. In this paper, we present an application of the vast generalization of brick polyhedra for general subword complexes (not necessarily spherical) recently introduced by Jahn and Stump.
  More precisely, we show that the $\nu$-associahedron, a polytopal complex whose edge graph is the Hasse diagram of the $\nu$-Tamari lattice introduced by Pr\'eville-Ratelle and Viennot, can be geometrically realized as the complex of bounded faces of the brick polyhedron of a well chosen subword complex. We also present a suitable projection to the appropriate dimension, which leads to an elegant vertex-coordinate description.</description>

      <title>On The General Solution To The Multi-Peg Tower of Hanoi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12941v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The classical three-peg Tower of Hanoi puzzle admits the well-known closed-form solution \(M(3,n)=2^n-1\), but the general case with \(p \geq 4\) pegs has remained unresolved for more than a century. In this paper, we present a complete unified closed-form formula for the minimum number of moves \(M(p,n)\) required to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem for any number of pegs \(p\) and disks \(n\). Our key insight is that the solution naturally partitions into regimes determined by simplex number boundaries, with each regime exhibiting linear growth whose slope doubles at each successive boundary. This structural observation leads to the unified expression:
  \[
  M(p,n) = 2^{i+1}n - \sum_{k=0}^{i} 2^k \binom{p+k-2}{k}, \quad
  i = \min \left\{ j \geq 0 : n \leq \binom{p-1+j}{j+1} \right\}.
  \] We rigorously prove that this formula satisfies the Frame--Stewart recurrence for all \((p,n)\) using a double-induction argument based on a discrete-slope law and a canonical right-end split. The formula recovers classical results, including \(M(3,n)=2^n-1\) and the known four-peg Reve's Puzzle solution, as special cases. Furthermore, this closed-form reduces the computational complexity of determining \(M(p,n)\) in \(O(p\log n)\), providing both a theoretical unification and a practical tool for efficient evaluation.</description>

      <title>The Honeycomb Conjecture in normed planes and an alpha-convex variant of a theorem of Dowker</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10622v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Honeycomb Conjecture states that among tilings with unit area cells in the Euclidean plane, the average perimeter of a cell is minimal for a regular hexagonal tiling. This conjecture was proved by L. Fejes T\'oth for convex tilings, and by Hales for not necessarily convex tilings. In this paper we investigate the same question for tilings of a given normed plane, and show that among normal, convex tilings in a normed plane, the average squared perimeter of a cell is minimal for a tiling whose cells are translates of a centrally symmetric hexagon. We also show that the question whether the same statement is true for the average perimeter of a cell is closely related to an $\alpha$-convex variant of a theorem of Dowker on the area of polygons circumscribed about a convex disk. Exploring this connection we find families of norms in which the average perimeter of a cell of a tiling is minimal for a hexagonal tiling, and prove some additonal related results. Finally, we apply our method to give a partial answer to a problem of Steinhaus about the isoperimetric ratios of cells of certain tilings in the Euclidean plane, appeared in an open problem book of Croft, Falconer and Guy.</description>

      <title>Computation of Graph Polynomials via Tree Decomposition: Theory, Algorithms, and Python Implementation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16816v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph polynomials encode fundamental combinatorial invariants of graphs. Their computation is investigated using tree and path decomposition frameworks, with formal definitions of treewidth, k-trees, and pathwidth establishing the structural basis for algorithmic efficiency. Explicit algorithms are constructed for each polynomial, leveraging decomposition order and state transformation mappings to enable tractable computation on graphs of bounded treewidth. Python implementations validate the methods, and computational complexity is analyzed with respect to sparse and k-degenerate graph classes. These results advance decomposition-based approaches for polynomial computation in algebraic graph theory.</description>
