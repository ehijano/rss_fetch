      <title>Development and extension of a monochromatic neutron beamline for neutron polarimetry device characterization at the Spallation Neutron Source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The precise manipulation and analysis of neutron spin states are foundational for a wide range of physics experiments, from fundamental symmetry tests to materials science. To enable systematic characterization of neutron polarimetry devices, we have constructed and extended a monochromatic neutron beamline at the Spallation Neutron Source, Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The beamline delivers monochromatic neutrons and provides a flexible platform for deploying and evaluating advanced neutron spin manipulation instruments. We describe the design and commissioning of the extended beamline and present a proof-of-concept neutron polarimetry study using three devices: a supermirror neutron polarizer, a Mezei spin flipper, and an in situ neutron 3He spin analyzer system. Performance metrics, optimization strategies, and systematic effects are discussed, demonstrating the beamline utility for neutron instrumentation testing. These results establish the extended monochromatic beamline as a useful resource for the development and validation of neutron polarimetry technologies.</description>

      <title>Inter-detector differential fuzz testing for tamper detection in gamma spectrometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend physical differential fuzz testing as an anti-tamper method for radiation detectors [Vavrek et al., Science and Global Security 2025] to comparisons across multiple detector units. The method was previously introduced as a tamper detection method for authenticating a single radiation detector in nuclear safeguards and treaty verification scenarios, and works by randomly sampling detector configuration parameters to produce a sequence of spectra that form a baseline signature of an untampered system. At a later date, after potential tampering, the same random sequence of parameters is used to generate another series of spectra that can be compared against the baseline. Anomalies in the series of comparisons indicate changes in detector behavior, which may be due to tampering. One limitation of this original method is that once the detector has `gone downrange' and may have been tampered with, the original baseline is fixed, and a new trusted baseline can never be established if tests at new parameters are required. In this work, we extend our anti-tamper fuzz testing concept to multiple detector units, such that the downrange detector can be compared against a trusted or `golden copy' detector, even despite normal inter-detector manufacturing variations. We show using three NaI detectors that this inter-detector differential fuzz testing can detect a representative attack, even when the tested and golden copy detectors are from different manufacturers and have different performances. Here, detecting tampering requires visualizing the comparison metric vs. the parameter values and not just the sample number; moreover this baseline is non-linear and may require anomaly detection methods more complex than a simple threshold. Overall, this extension to multiple detectors improves prospects for operationalizing the technique in real-world treaty verification and safeguards contexts.</description>

      <title>Gamma Imagers for Nuclear Security and Nuclear Forensics: Recommendations based on results from a side-by-side intercomparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nuclear security operations and forensic investigations require the utilization of a suite of instruments ranging from passive gamma spectrometers to high-precision laboratory sample analyzers. Gamma spectroscopy survey is further broken down into wide-area search performed with large-volume scintillator-based mobile survey spectrometers which are integrated with geographic position sensors for mapping and identification of hot zones, and high-precision long-dwell measurements using solid state spectrometers for follow-on characterization to establish isotopic content and ratios. While performing well at detecting the presence, quantity and type of radioactivity, all of these methods have limited ability to determine the location of a source of radioactivity. In recent years, technology advances have resulted in gamma imager devices which can create an image of the distribution of radioactive sources using the gamma emissions which accompany radioactive decay, and overlay this on an optical photograph of the environment. These gamma imaging devices have arisen out of methods developed for medical physics, experimental particle physics, and astrophysics, resulting in a proliferation of different technological approaches. Those responsible for establishing a nuclear security concept of operations, require guidance to choose the proper gamma imager for each of the application spaces in a tiered response. Here the results of an intercomparison of two gamma imagers based on two widely different technologies, semiconductor and scintillator detectors, are presented. The optimal utilization of these imaging technologies in a tiered response is discussed based on the results of the trial. Finally, an outlook on future directions for gamma imaging advances is provided.</description>

      <title>Emerging Technologies and Methods in Wide-Area Search for Nuclear Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Canada, a Tier 1 nuclear nation involved in uranium mining and refining, operating nuclear power reactors, and with a Small Modular Reactor action plan, maintains a rigorous nuclear security infrastructure. The Nuclear Emergency Response team at Natural Resources Canada fulfills federal mandates in high-sensitivity air- and ground-based mobile survey for prevention, detection and response. A robust operational framework exists for deployment of traditional large-volume NaI(Tl)-based detection suites. At the same time, a research arm examines emerging non-nuclear technologies which can enhance the capabilities of the operational team. Herein, the potential for uncrewed mobile systems in nuclear security and emergency response operations is discussed. The impact of new technologies such as silicon photomultipliers, gamma imagers and self-shielding directional detectors is presented, and the use of high-performance computing in modelling of system response functions is discussed. Finally, a capability to extrapolate to the location of a source some distance away from a survey trajectory is shown. The extrapolation method includes propagation of the measurement error to the extrapolated region, essential information for nuclear response operators to know if a region is actually clear of radioactivity or not.</description>

      <title>PCIe400 generic readout board qualification test</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The PCIe400 is a generic board for high-throughput data acquisition systems in high energy physics experiments. Its purpose is to interface up to 48 bidirectional links, supporting custom protocols at 1 to 26 Gbit/s, to modern commercial back-end links providing 400 Gbit/s bandwidth. It also targets clock distribution with phase determinism below 10 ps peak-to-peak. It has been designed for LHCb LS3 enhancement upgrade with experimental features to prepare LHCb Upgrade II, foreseeing an aggregated throughput of 200 Tbit/s. However, its versatility allows it to be used in several experimental environments. The board embeds Altera's flagship Agilex 7 M-series FPGA with a PCIe Gen 5 interface and an experimental QSFP112 serial interface. We present the results of qualification tests performed on prototype boards and the challenges encountered to meet specifications. Section 1 describes board-level validation, including power-up behavior and peripheral access. Section 2 focuses on high-bandwidth interface qualification through BER measurements. Finally, Section 3 investigates phase determinism in Agilex transceivers, a key requirement for precise clock distribution.</description>

      <title>Proton Energy Dependence of Radiation Induced Low Gain Avalanche Detector Degradation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low Gain Avalanche Detectors (LGADs) are key components for precise timing measurements in high-energy physics experiments, including the High Luminosity upgrades of the current LHC detectors. Their performance is, however, limited by radiation induced degradation of the gain layer, primarily driven by acceptor removal. This study presents a systematic comparison of how the degradation evolves with different incident proton energies, using LGADs from Hamamatsu Photonics (HPK) and The Institute of Microelectronics of Barcelona (IMB-CNM) irradiated with 18 MeV, 24 MeV, 400 MeV and 23 GeV protons and fluences up to 2.5x10^15 p/cm2. Electrical characterization is used to extract the acceptor removal coefficients for different proton energies, whereas IR TCT measurements offer complementary insight into the gain evolution in LGADs after irradiation. Across all devices, lower energy protons induce stronger gain layer degradation, confirming expectations. However, 400 MeV protons consistently appear less damaging than both lower and higher energy protons, an unexpected deviation from a monotonic energy trend. Conversion of proton fluences to 1 MeV neutron-equivalent fluences reduces but does not eliminate these differences, indicating that the standard Non-Ionizing Energy Loss (NIEL) scaling does not fully account for the underlying defect formation mechanisms at different energies and requires revision when considering irradiation fields that contain a broader spectrum of particle types and energies.</description>

      <title>Development and characterization of hybrid MCP-PMT with embedded Timepix4 ASIC used as pixelated anode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel single-photon detector based on a vacuum tube incorporating a photocathode, a microchannel plate (MCP), and a Timepix4 CMOS ASIC functioning as a pixelated anode. Designed to handle photon rates up to 1 billion per second across a 7 cm$^2$ active area, the detector achieves outstanding spatial and temporal resolutions of 5-10 $\mu$m and below 50 ps r.m.s., respectively.
  The Timepix4 ASIC comprises approximately 230,000 pixels, each integrating analog and digital front-end electronics. This enables data-driven acquisition and supports data transmission rates up to 160 Gb/s. External FPGA-based electronics manage both configuration and readout.
  In order to test the timing performance of the Timepix4 ASIC we performed preliminary characterization of an assembly bonded to a 100 $\mu$m thick n-on-p silicon sensor using a pulsed infrared laser, which demonstrated a per-pixel timing resolution of 110 ps, with cluster-based averaging methods improving to below 50 ps.
  Six prototype detectors incorporating different MCP stack configurations and end-spoiling depths were produced by Hamamatsu Photonics. We report on their characterization, including dark count rates, gain, and spatial and timing resolutions, assessed both in laboratory conditions and during a test-beam campaign at CERN's SPS facility.</description>

      <title>Observational Evidence for Wind-Driven Low-Pass Filtering of Infrasound at Short Range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Infrasound from controlled explosions provide a unique opportunity to isolate atmospheric effects on propagation. We report observations from two campaigns in May and October 2024, each featuring 10-ton TNT-equivalent controlled surface chemical explosions recorded by a dense network of 31 single-sensor stations within 23 km. Despite identical sources, the observed wavefields were very different. October signals followed a near-unimodal period-distance trend, whereas May signals exhibited a pronounced azimuthal bifurcation in both period and celerity. Downwind paths largely preserved the short-period baseline observed in October, while upwind paths showed systematically longer periods caused by wind-driven low-pass filtering. This study provides the first direct observational evidence that tropospheric winds can impose azimuth-dependent low-pass filtering at local ranges, without the influence of measured temperature inversions. Thus, the structure of the atmosphere can modify the spectral characteristics of low-frequency acoustic waves even at a distance of only a few kilometers.</description>

      <title>KEK Accelerator Test Facility Low-Level RF and Timing Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The KEK Accelerator Test Facility (ATF) is a dedicated testbed for nanobeam technologies in support of the International Linear Collider (ILC). Stable pulsed operation requires synchronization of the facility timing system with the Low-Level RF (LLRF) system. The timing system distributes trigger and gate signals to key subsystems, including the DAQ, klystrons, laser systems, pulsed kicker magnets, and interlocks. The LLRF system provides phase-coherent RF references and facility-wide clock distribution for synchronization. Achieving ~100 fs-level synchronization depends critically on the phase-noise power spectral density (PN-PSD) of the distributed clock signals and on preserving this performance throughout the distribution network. We present facility-wide measurements of the KEK ATF LLRF clock PN-PSD and discuss the resulting synchronization floor imposed by the stability of the ATF Linac and Damping Ring signal generators.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Satellite-based quantum communications represent a critical advancement in the pursuit of secure, global-scale quantum networks. Leveraging the principles of quantum mechanics, these systems offer unparalleled security through Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) and other quantum communication protocols. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of satellite-based quantum communications, focusing on the evolution from terrestrial to space-based systems. We explore the distinct advantages and challenges of discrete-variable (DV) and continuous-variable (CV) quantum communication technologies in the context of satellite deployments. The paper also discusses key milestones such as the successful implementation of quantum communication via the Micius satellite and outlines the primary challenges, including atmospheric turbulence and the development of quantum repeaters, that must be addressed to achieve a global quantum internet. This review aims to consolidate recent advancements in the field, providing insights and perspectives on the future directions and potential innovations that will drive the continued evolution of satellite-based quantum communications.</description>

      <title>Depth Calibration of Double-sided Strip Germanium Detectors for the Compton Spectrometer and Imager Satellite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Double-sided strip high-purity germanium detectors with three-dimensional position reconstruction capability have been developed over three decades, with space-based applications in high-energy astrophysics and heliophysics. Position resolution in three dimensions is key to reconstruction of Compton scattering events, including for the upcoming Compton Spectrometer and Imager (COSI) satellite mission. Two-dimensional position reconstruction is enabled by segmentation of the two detector faces into orthogonal strip contacts, enabling a pixelized analysis. The depth of an interaction cannot be measured directly but must be inferred from the charge collection time difference between the two faces of the detector. Here, we demonstrate for the first time the depth calibration of a detector with the COSI satellite geometry read out using an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) developed for the COSI mission. In this work, we map collection time difference to depth using the Julia-based simulation package SolidStateDetectors.jl and validate it with comparison to the timing distributions observed in data. We also use simulations and data to demonstrate the depth resolution on a per-pixel basis, with &gt;90% of pixels having &lt;0.9 mm (FWHM) resolution at 59.5 keV and &lt;0.6 mm (FWHM) resolution at 122.1 keV.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.15997v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In inertial confinement fusion experiments hollow, spherical mm-sized capsules are used as a container for nuclear fuel. To achieve maximum implosion efficiency, a perfect capsule geometry is required. This paper presents a wall thickness measurement method based on zero-group velocity guided elastic wave resonances. They are measured with a non-destructive, contactless frequency domain laser ultrasound microscopy system. Wall thickness measurements along the equator of a high-density carbon capsule with a diameter of around 2 mm and a wall thickness of around 80 $\unicode{x00B5}$m excellently agree with infrared interferometry reference measurements. In addition, the multi-resonant nature of a spherical shell is studied by complementing experimental observations with plate dispersion calculations and finite element wave propagation simulations. The presented method is scalable and can be applied to a broad range of target materials, including metals, or metal-doped targets.</description>

      <title>Performance study of 4-MU-loaded water for Cherenkov light detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03989v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on R&amp;D study to improve the photon detection efficiency of water Cherenkov detectors by doping ultra-pure water with 4-methylumbelliferone (4-MU), a wavelength shifting additive. Cherenkov light yields from cosmic-ray muons were measured for various 4-MU concentrations and compared with those from pure water. At a concentration of 1 ppm, the detected light yield increased by approximately a factor of three. This enhancement can be attributed to wavelength shifting and improved photon collection efficiency. No noticeable degradation in optical transparency was observed across the tested concentrations of 0.5 and 1 ppm with different concentration of ethanol. These results suggest that 4-MU is a promising additive for improving the performance of water Cherenkov detectors.</description>

      <title>Design and Performance of a 96-channel Resistive PICOSEC Micromegas Detector for ENUBET</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05589v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The PICOSEC-Micromegas (PICOSEC-MM) detector is a fast gaseous detector that achieves picosecond-level timing by coupling a Cherenkov radiator, typically an MgF2 crystal, to a Micromegas-based photodetector with a photocathode. This configuration allows the fast photoelectron-induced signal to suppress the intrinsic time jitter of gaseous detectors, enabling sub-20 ps timing precision while preserving the robustness and scalability of micro-pattern gaseous detector technologies. The 96-pad PICOSEC-MM detector is a large-area demonstrator optimized for precision timing in high-energy physics, building on research and development insights from earlier 7-pad resistive prototypes to validate scalability, uniformity, and robustness for the ENUBET project. It employs a 2.5 nm diamond-like carbon photocathode and a Micromegas board with a surface resistivity of 10 megaohms per square, and was characterized using 150 GeV/c muons at the CERN SPS beamline, with one-third of the active area instrumented per run. A dedicated alignment procedure for multi-pad PICOSEC-MM systems was used to reconstruct pad centers and merge measurements across regions, yielding a timing resolution of 43 ps and uniform signal arrival time distributions over the tested area. Mechanical flatness was identified as a key factor, with planarity tolerances within 10 micrometers required to maintain good timing resolution, and the successful operation of the 96-pad demonstrator confirms the scalability of the PICOSEC-MM concept toward robust, high-granularity, picosecond-level gaseous timing detectors for monitored neutrino beam experiments such as ENUBET.</description>

      <title>Quantitative mobile gamma-ray spectrometry through Bayesian inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18769v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate quantitative mapping of gamma-ray sources is critical for applications ranging from radiological emergency response and environmental monitoring to nuclear security and deep space exploration. Here, we show that integrating high-fidelity, platform-dynamic Monte Carlo simulations and Bayesian inference with mobile gamma-ray spectrometry enables rapid and accurate quantification of distributed and point-like gamma-ray sources. Validated against laboratory and field assays, our framework quantifies natural and anthropogenic gamma-ray sources that conventional methods cannot resolve in $1\,$s with $\sim\!\!1\,\%$ error. The developed method marks a critical advance in quantitative gamma-ray sensing, enabling improved radiological situational awareness, enhanced terrestrial geophysical and geochemical mapping, as well as more robust constraints on radionuclide abundances on extraterrestrial bodies across the Solar System.</description>

      <title>Neutron multiplicity measurement in muon capture on oxygen nuclei in the Gd-loaded Super-Kamiokande detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17002v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent neutrino detectors, neutrons produced in neutrino reactions play an important role. Muon capture on oxygen nuclei is one of the processes that produce neutrons in water Cherenkov detectors. We measured neutron multiplicity in the process using cosmic ray muons that stop in the gadolinium-loaded Super-Kamiokande detector. For this measurement, neutron detection efficiency is obtained with the muon capture events followed by gamma rays to be $50.2^{+2.0}_{-2.1}\%$. By fitting the observed multiplicity considering the detection efficiency, we measure neutron multiplicity in muon capture as $P(0)=24\pm3\%$, $P(1)=70^{+3}_{-2}\%$, $P(2)=6.1\pm0.5\%$, $P(3)=0.38\pm0.09\%$. This is the first measurement of the multiplicity of neutrons associated with muon capture on oxygen without neutron energy threshold.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo simulation of the ISOLPHARM gamma camera for Ag-111 imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20112v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Targeted Radionuclide Therapy (TRT) is a well-established technique for cancer treatment. In this approach, radionuclides are bound to specific drugs that selectively transport them to the tumor site. Within the ISOLPHARM project, a radiopharmaceutical for TRT based on the innovative radionuclide Ag-111 is currently under development. Ag-111 has a half-life of 7.45 days and decays by emitting both electrons and gamma-rays. The emission of gamma-rays, predominantly at an energy of 342 keV, enables the visualization of Ag-111 using a gamma camera. In this work, we describe a Monte Carlo simulation developed to optimize the design parameters of such an imaging device. The simulation is based on the Geant4 toolkit, which accurately models the interactions between particles and matter. The estimated spatial resolution and sensitivity of the system are approximately 4 mm and 19 cps/MBq, respectively. The simulated device is able to resolve lesions with a lesion-to-background activity ratio of 4:1 under in-vivo-like conditions. These results indicate that the proposed gamma camera can provide cost-effective imaging capabilities for preclinical radiopharmaceutical studies.</description>

      <title>Performance and radiation damage mitigation strategy for silicon photomultipliers on LEO space missions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00532v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Space missions require lightweight, low-power consuming, radiation-tolerant components. Silicon photomultipliers are increasingly used for detecting near-UV, optical, and infrared light in space due to their compact design, low cost, low power consumption, robustness, and high photo-detection efficiency, which makes them sensitive to single photons. Although SiPMs outperform traditional photomultiplier tubes in many areas, concerns about their radiation tolerance and noise remain. In this study, we estimate the radiation effects on a satellite in sun-synchronous low Earth orbit (LEO) at an altitude of 550~km during the declining phase of solar cycle 25 (2026-2029). We evaluated silicon photomultipliers produced by the Foundation Bruno Kessler (FBK) using front-side illuminated technology with metal trenches (NUV-HD-MT), assessing their response to a 50~MeV proton beam and exposure to a $\beta$-radioactive source (strontium-90). Simulations with SPENVIS and Geant4 were used to validate the experimental results. Based on our findings, we propose a photosensor annealing strategy for space-based instruments.</description>

      <title>Predicting the single-site and multi-site event discrimination power of dual-phase time projection chambers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02258v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dual-phase xenon time projection chambers (TPCs) are widely used in searches for rare dark matter and neutrino interactions, in part because of their excellent position reconstruction capability in 3D. Despite their millimeter-scale resolution along the charge drift axis, xenon TPCs face challenges in resolving single-site (SS) and multi-site (MS) interactions in the transverse plane. In this paper, we build a generic TPC model with an idealized signal readout, and use Fisher Information (FI) to predict its theoretical capability of differentiating SS and MS events using the electroluminescence signal. We also demonstrate via simulation that, when only statistical photon noise is present, the theoretical limits can be approached with conventional reconstruction algorithms like maximum likelihood estimation, and with a convolutional neural network classifier. The implications of this study on future TPC experiments will be discussed.</description>
