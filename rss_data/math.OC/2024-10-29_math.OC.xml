      <title>Sufficient Condition on Bipartite Consensus of Weakly Connected Matrix-weighted Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in bipartite consensus on matrix-weighted networks, where agents are divided into two disjoint sets with those in the same set agreeing on a certain value and those in different sets converging to opposite values, have highlighted its potential applications across various fields. Traditional approaches often depend on the existence of a positive-negative spanning tree in matrix-weighted networks to achieve bipartite consensus, which greatly restricts the use of these approaches in engineering applications. This study relaxes that assumption by allowing weak connectivity within the network, where paths can be weighted by semidefinite matrices. By analyzing the algebraic constraints imposed by positive-negative trees and semidefinite paths, we derive new sufficient conditions for achieving bipartite consensus. Our findings are validated by numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Splitting Algorithms for Distributionally Robust Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide different splitting methods for solving distributionally robust optimization problems in cases where the uncertainties are described by discrete distributions. The first method involves computing the proximity operator of the supremum function that appears in the optimization problem. The second method solves an equivalent monotone inclusion formulation derived from the first-order optimality conditions, where the resolvents of the monotone operators involved in the inclusion are computable. The proposed methods are applied to solve the Couette inverse problem with uncertainty and the denoising problem with uncertainty. We present numerical results to compare the efficiency of the algorithms.</description>

      <title>Generator Subadditive Functions for Mixed-Integer Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For equality-constrained linear mixed-integer programs (MIP) defined by rational data, it is known that the subadditive dual is a strong dual and that there exists an optimal solution of a particular form, generator subadditive function. Motivated by these results, we explore the connection between Lagrangian duality, subadditive duality and generator subadditive functions for general equality-constrained MIPs where the vector of variables is constrained to be in a monoid. We show that strong duality holds via generator subadditive functions under certain conditions. For the case when the monoid is defined by the set of all mixed-integer points contained in a convex cone, we show that strong duality holds under milder conditions and over a more restrictive set of dual functions. Finally, we provide some examples of applications of our results.</description>

      <title>A novel switched systems approach to nonconvex optimisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a novel switching dynamics that converges to the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) point of a nonlinear optimisation problem. This new approach is particularly notable for its lower dimensionality compared to conventional primal-dual dynamics, as it focuses exclusively on estimating the primal variable. Our method is successfully illustrated on general quadratic optimisation problems, the minimisation of the classical Rosenbrock function, and a nonconvex optimisation problem stemming from the control of energy-efficient buildings.</description>

      <title>Optimization of a lattice spring model with elastoplastic conducting springs: A case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a simple lattice spring model in which every spring is elastoplastic and is capable to conduct current. The elasticity bounds of spring $i$ are taken as $[-c_i,c_i]$ and the resistance of spring $i$ is taken as $1/c_i$, which allows us to compute the resistance of the system. The model is further subjected to a gradual stretching and, due to plasticity, the response force increases until a certain terminal value. We demonstrate that the recently developed sweeping process theory can be used to optimize the interplay between the terminal response force and the resistance on a physical domain of parameters $c_i.$ The proposed methodology can be used by practitioners for the design of multi-functional materials as an alternative to topological optimization.</description>

      <title>Univariate representations of solutions to generic polynomial complementarity problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By using the squared slack variables technique, we show that a general polynomial complementarity problem can be formulated as a system of polynomial equations. Thus, the solution set of such a problem is the image of a real algebraic set under a certain projection. This paper points out that, generically, this polynomial system has finitely many complex zeros. In such a case, we use techniques from symbolic computation to compute a univariate representation of the solution set. Consequently, univariate representations of special solutions, such as least-norm and sparse solutions, are obtained. After that, enumerating solutions boils down to solving problems governed by univariate polynomials. We also provide some experiments on small-scale problems with worst-case scenarios. At the end of the paper, we propose a method for computing approximate solutions to copositive polynomial complementarity problems that may have infinitely many solutions.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Perishable and Non-Perishable Product Assignment to packaging lines in a Sustainable Manufacturing System: An AUGMECON2VIKOR Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying appropriate manufacturing systems for products can be considered a pivotal manufacturing task that contributes to the optimization of operational and planning activities. It has gained importance in the food industry due to the distinct constraints and considerations posed by perishable and non-perishable items in this problem. Hence, this study proposes a new mathematical model - according to knowledge discovery as well as an assignment model to optimize manufacturing systems for perishable, non-perishable, and hybrid products tailored to meet their unique characteristics. In the presented model, three objective functions are taken into account: (1) minimizing the - production costs by assigning the products to the right set of manufacturing systems, (2) maximizing the product quality by assigning the products to the systems, and (3) minimizing the total - CO2 emissions of the machines. A numerical example is utilized to evaluate the performance of AUGMECON2VIKOR compared to AUGMECON2. The results show that AUGMECON2VIKOR obtains superior Pareto solutions across all objective functions. Furthermore, the sensitivity analysis explores the positive green impacts, influencing both cost and quality.</description>

      <title>On invariance of observability for BSDEs and its applications to stochastic control systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the invariance of observability for the observed backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs) with constant coefficients, relative to the filtered probability space. This signifies that the observability of these observed BSDEs with constant coefficients remains unaffected by the selection of the filtered probability space. As an illustrative application, we demonstrate that for stochastic control systems with constant coefficients, weak observability, approximate null controllability with cost, and stabilizability are equivalent across some or any filtered probability spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing theoretical stabilization results for linear, hyperbolic multi-dimensional problems are extended to the discretized multi-dimensional problems. In contrast to existing theoretical and numerical analysis in the spatially one-dimensional case the effect of the numerical dissipation is analyzed and explicitly quantified. Further, using dimensional splitting, the numerical analysis is extended to the multi-dimensional case. The findings are confirmed by numerical simulations for low-order and high-order DG schemes both in the one-dimensional and two-dimensional case.</description>

      <title>On uniqueness in structured model learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of uniqueness in learning physical laws for systems of partial differential equations (PDEs). Contrary to most existing approaches, it considers a framework of structured model learning, where existing, approximately correct physical models are augmented with components that are learned from data. The main result of the paper is a uniqueness result that covers a large class of PDEs and a suitable class of neural networks used for approximating the unknown model components. The uniqueness result shows that, in the idealized setting of full, noiseless measurements, a unique identification of the unknown model components is possible as regularization-minimizing solution of the PDE system. Furthermore, the paper provides a convergence result showing that model components learned on the basis of incomplete, noisy measurements approximate the ground truth model component in the limit. These results are possible under specific properties of the approximating neural networks and due to a dedicated choice of regularization. With this, a practical contribution of this analytic paper is to provide a class of model learning frameworks different to standard settings where uniqueness can be expected in the limit of full measurements.</description>

      <title>Backstepping Control of Continua of Linear Hyperbolic PDEs and Application to Stabilization of Large-Scale $n+m$ Coupled Hyperbolic PDE Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a backstepping control design for a class of continuum systems of linear hyperbolic PDEs, described by a coupled system of an ensemble of rightward transporting PDEs and a (finite) system of $m$ leftward transporting PDEs. The key analysis challenge of the design is to establish well-posedness of the resulting ensemble of kernel equations, since they evolve on a prismatic (3-D) domain and inherit the potential discontinuities of the kernels for the case of $n+m$ hyperbolic systems. We resolve this challenge generalizing the well-posedness analysis of Hu, Di Meglio, Vazquez, and Krstic to continua of general, heterodirectional hyperbolic PDE systems, while also constructing a proper Lyapunov functional.
  Since the motivation for addressing such PDE systems continua comes from the objective to develop computationally tractable control designs for large-scale PDE systems, we then introduce a methodology for stabilization of general $n+m$ hyperbolic systems, constructing stabilizing backstepping control kernels based on the continuum kernels derived from the continuum system counterpart. This control design procedure is enabled by establishing that, as $n$ grows, the continuum backstepping control kernels can approximate (in certain sense) the exact kernels, and thus, they remain stabilizing (as formally proven). This approach guarantees that complexity of computation of stabilizing kernels does not grow with the number $n$ of PDE systems components. We further establish that the solutions to the $n+m$ PDE system converge, as $n\to\infty$, to the solutions of the corresponding continuum PDE system.
  We also provide a numerical example in which the continuum kernels can be obtained in closed form (in contrast to the large-scale kernels), thus resulting in minimum complexity of control kernels computation, which illustrates the potential computational benefits of our approach.</description>

      <title>A Riemannian optimization method on the indefinite Stiefel manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the optimization problem with a generally quadratic matrix constraint of the form $X^TAX = J$, where $A$ is a given nonsingular, symmetric $n\times n$ matrix and $J$ is a given $k\times k$ matrix, with $k\leq n$, satisfying $J^2 = I_k$. Since the feasible set constitutes a differentiable manifold, called the indefinite Stiefel manifold, we approach this problem within the framework of Riemannian optimization. Namely, we first equip the manifold with a Riemannian metric and construct the associated geometric structures, then propose a retraction based on the Cayley transform, and finally suggest a Riemannian gradient descent method using the attained materials, whose global convergence is guaranteed. Our results not only cover the known cases, the orthogonal and generalized Stiefel manifolds, but also provide a Riemannian optimization solution for other constrained problems which has not been investigated. Numerical experiments are presented to justify the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Averaging principle for multiscale controlled jump diffusions and associated nonlocal HJB equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the averaging principle of a class of two-time scale stochastic control systems with $\alpha$-stable noise. The associated singular perturbations problem for nonlocal Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations is also considered. We construct the effective stochastic control problem and the associated effective HJB equation for the original multiscale stochastic control problem by averaging over the ergodic measure of the fast component. We prove the convergence of the value function using two methods. With the probabilistic method, we show that the value function of the original multiscale stochastic control system converges to the value function of the effective stochastic control system by proving the weak averaging principle of the controlled jump diffusions. Using the PDE method, we study the value function as the viscosity solution of the associated nonlocal HJB equation with singular perturbations. We then prove the convergence using the perturbed test function method.</description>

      <title>Exact Decomposition Branching exploiting Lattice Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strict inequalities in mixed-integer linear optimization can cause difficulties in guaranteeing convergence and exactness. Utilizing that optimal vertex solutions follow a lattice structure we propose a rounding rule for strict inequalities that guaranties exactness. The lattice used is generated by $\Delta$-regularity of the constraint matrix belonging to the continuous variables. We apply this rounding rule to Decomposition Branching by Yildiz et al., which uses strict inequalities in its branching rule. We prove that the enhanced algorithm terminates after finite many steps with an exact solution. To validate our approach, we conduct computational experiments for two different models for which $\Delta$-regularity is easily detectable. The results confirm the exactness of our enhanced algorithm and demonstrate that it typically generates smaller branch-and-bound trees.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the exponential stabilization of the linearized FitzHugh-Nagumo system using an event-triggered boundary control strategy. Employing the backstepping method, we derive a feedback control law that updates based on specific triggering rules while ensuring the exponential stability of the closed-loop system. We establish the well-posedness of the system and analyze its input-to-state stability in relation to the deviations introduced by the event-triggered control. Numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, showing that it stabilizes the system with fewer control updates compared to continuous feedback strategies while maintaining similar stabilization performance.</description>

      <title>Computing Solutions to the Polynomial-Polynomial Regulator Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the optimal regulation problem for nonlinear control-affine dynamical systems. Whereas the linear-quadratic regulator (LQR) considers optimal control of a linear system with quadratic cost function, we study polynomial systems with polynomial cost functions; we call this problem the polynomial-polynomial regulator (PPR). The resulting polynomial feedback laws provide two potential improvements over linear feedback laws: 1) they more accurately approximate the optimal control law, resulting in lower control costs, and 2) for some problems they can provide a larger region of stabilization. We derive explicit formulas -- and a scalable, general purpose software implementation -- for computing the polynomial approximation to the value function that solves the optimal control problem. The method is illustrated first on a low-dimensional aircraft stall stabilization example, for which PPR control recovers the aircraft from more severe stall conditions than LQR control. Then we demonstrate the scalability of the approach on a semidiscretization of dimension $n=129$ of a partial differential equation, for which the PPR control reduces the control cost by approximately 75% compared to LQR for the initial condition of interest.</description>

      <title>Shuffling Gradient-Based Methods for Nonconvex-Concave Minimax Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims at developing novel shuffling gradient-based methods for tackling two classes of minimax problems: nonconvex-linear and nonconvex-strongly concave settings. The first algorithm addresses the nonconvex-linear minimax model and achieves the state-of-the-art oracle complexity typically observed in nonconvex optimization. It also employs a new shuffling estimator for the "hyper-gradient", departing from standard shuffling techniques in optimization. The second method consists of two variants: semi-shuffling and full-shuffling schemes. These variants tackle the nonconvex-strongly concave minimax setting. We establish their oracle complexity bounds under standard assumptions, which, to our best knowledge, are the best-known for this specific setting. Numerical examples demonstrate the performance of our algorithms and compare them with two other methods. Our results show that the new methods achieve comparable performance with SGD, supporting the potential of incorporating shuffling strategies into minimax algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: MicroLED displays are the result of a complex manufacturing chain. Each stage of this process, if optimized, contributes to achieving the highest levels of final efficiencies. Common works carried out by Pollen Metrology, Aledia, and Universit{\'e} Clermont-Auvergne led to a generic process optimization workflow. This software solution offers a holistic approach where stages are chained together for gaining a complete optimal solution. This paper highlights key corners of the methodology, validated by the experiments and process experts: data cleaning and multi-objective optimization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove a sharp uniqueness result for the singular Schr\"odinger equation with an inverse square potential. This will be done without assuming geometrical restrictions on the observation region. The proof relies on a recent technique transforming the Schr\"odinger equation into an elliptic equation. We show that this technique is still applicable for singular equations. In our case, substantial difficulties arise when dealing with singular potentials of cylindrical type. Using the uniqueness result, we show the approximate controllability of the equation using a distributed control. The uniqueness result is also applied to prove the uniqueness for an inverse source problem.</description>

      <title>Multiple-beam Interference Spectroscopy: Instrument Analysis and Spectrum Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging systems based on multiple-beam interference (MBI), such as Fabry-Perot interferometry, are attracting interest due to their compact design, high throughput, and fine resolution. Unlike dispersive devices, which measure spectra directly, the desired spectra in interferometric systems are reconstructed from measured interferograms. Although the response of MBI devices is modeled by the Airy function, existing reconstruction techniques are often limited to Fourier-transform spectroscopy, which is tailored for two-beam interference (TBI). These methods impose limitations for MBI and are susceptible to non-idealities like irregular sampling and noise, highlighting the need for an in-depth numerical framework. To fill this gap, we propose a rigorous taxonomy of the TBI and MBI instrument description and propose a unified Bayesian formulation which both embeds the description of existing literature works and adds some of the real-world non-idealities of the acquisition process. Under this framework, we provide a comprehensive review of spectroscopy forward and inverse models. In the forward model, we propose a thorough analysis of the discretization of the continuous model and the ill-posedness of the problem. In the inverse model, we extend the range of existing solutions for spectrum reconstruction, framing them as an optimization problem. Specifically, we provide a progressive comparative analysis of reconstruction methods from more specific to more general scenarios, up to employing the proposed Bayesian framework with prior knowledge, such as sparsity constraints. Experiments on simulated and real data demonstrate the framework's flexibility and noise robustness. The code is available at https://github.com/mhmdjouni/inverspyctrometry.</description>

      <title>How Does Critical Batch Size Scale in Pre-training?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Training large-scale models under given resources requires careful design of parallelism strategies. In particular, the efficiency notion of critical batch size, concerning the compromise between time and compute, marks the threshold beyond which greater data parallelism leads to diminishing returns. To operationalize it, we propose a measure of CBS and pre-train a series of auto-regressive language models, ranging from 85 million to 1.2 billion parameters, on the C4 dataset. Through extensive hyper-parameter sweeps and careful control on factors such as batch size, momentum, and learning rate along with its scheduling, we systematically investigate the impact of scale on CBS. Then we fit scaling laws with respect to model and data sizes to decouple their effects. Overall, our results demonstrate that CBS scales primarily with data size rather than model size, a finding we justify theoretically through the analysis of infinite-width limits of neural networks and infinite-dimensional least squares regression. Of independent interest, we highlight the importance of common hyper-parameter choices and strategies for studying large-scale pre-training beyond fixed training durations.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Approximation with Unbounded Markovian Noise: A General-Purpose Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by engineering applications such as resource allocation in networks and inventory systems, we consider average-reward Reinforcement Learning with unbounded state space and reward function. Recent works studied this problem in the actor-critic framework and established finite sample bounds assuming access to a critic with certain error guarantees. We complement their work by studying Temporal Difference (TD) learning with linear function approximation and establishing finite-time bounds with the optimal $\mathcal{O}\left(1/\epsilon^2\right)$ sample complexity. These results are obtained using the following general-purpose theorem for non-linear Stochastic Approximation (SA).
  Suppose that one constructs a Lyapunov function for a non-linear SA with certain drift condition. Then, our theorem establishes finite-time bounds when this SA is driven by unbounded Markovian noise under suitable conditions. It serves as a black box tool to generalize sample guarantees on SA from i.i.d. or martingale difference case to potentially unbounded Markovian noise. The generality and the mild assumption of the setup enables broad applicability of our theorem. We illustrate its power by studying two more systems: (i) We improve upon the finite-time bounds of $Q$-learning by tightening the error bounds and also allowing for a larger class of behavior policies. (ii) We establish the first ever finite-time bounds for distributed stochastic optimization of high-dimensional smooth strongly convex function using cyclic block coordinate descent.</description>

      <title>Tensor-based empirical interpolation method,\newline and its application in model reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In general, matrix or tensor-valued functions are approximated using the method developed for vector-valued functions by transforming the matrix-valued function into vector form. This paper proposes a tensor-based interpolation method to approximate a matrix-valued function without transforming it into the vector form. The tensor-based technique has the advantage of reducing offline and online computation without sacrificing much accuracy. The proposed method is an extension of the empirical interpolation method (EIM) for tensor bases. This paper presents a necessary theoretical framework to understand the method's functioning and limitations. Our mathematical analysis establishes a key characteristic of the proposed method: it consistently generates interpolation points in the form of a rectangular grid. This observation underscores a fundamental limitation that applies to any matrix-based approach relying on widely used techniques like EIM or DEIM method. It has also been theoretically shown that the proposed method is equivalent to the DEIM method applied in each direction due to the rectangular grid structure of the interpolation points. The application of the proposed method is shown in the model reduction of the semi-linear matrix differential equation. We have compared the approximation result of our proposed method with the DEIM method used to approximate a vector-valued function. The comparison result shows that the proposed method takes less time, albeit with a minor compromise with accuracy.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Optimization for Hyperparameters Tuning in Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the application of Bayesian Optimization (BO) for the hyperparameter tuning of neural networks, specifically targeting the enhancement of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for image classification tasks. Bayesian Optimization is a derivative-free global optimization method suitable for expensive black-box functions with continuous inputs and limited evaluation budgets. The BO algorithm leverages Gaussian Process regression and acquisition functions like Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) and Expected Improvement (EI) to identify optimal configurations effectively. Using the Ax and BOTorch frameworks, this work demonstrates the efficiency of BO in reducing the number of hyperparameter tuning trials while achieving competitive model performance. Experimental outcomes reveal that BO effectively balances exploration and exploitation, converging rapidly towards optimal settings for CNN architectures. This approach underlines the potential of BO in automating neural network tuning, contributing to improved accuracy and computational efficiency in machine learning pipelines.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the effect of item arrangement on choices using a novel decision-making model based on the Markovian exploration of choice sets. This model is inspired by experimental evidence suggesting that the decision-making process involves sequential search through rapid stochastic pairwise comparisons. Our findings show that decision-makers following a reversible process are unaffected by item rearrangements, and further demonstrate that this property can be inferred from their choice behavior. Additionally, we provide a characterization of the class of Markovian models in which the agent makes all possible pairwise comparisons with positive probability. The intersection of reversible models and those allowing all pairwise comparisons is observationally equivalent to the well-known Luce model. Finally, we characterize the class of Markovian models for which the initial fixation does not impact the final choice and show that choice data reveals the existence and composition of consideration sets.</description>

      <title>Convex Formulations for Training Two-Layer ReLU Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solving non-convex, NP-hard optimization problems is crucial for training machine learning models, including neural networks. However, non-convexity often leads to black-box machine learning models with unclear inner workings. While convex formulations have been used for verifying neural network robustness, their application to training neural networks remains less explored. In response to this challenge, we reformulate the problem of training infinite-width two-layer ReLU networks as a convex completely positive program in a finite-dimensional (lifted) space. Despite the convexity, solving this problem remains NP-hard due to the complete positivity constraint. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a semidefinite relaxation that can be solved in polynomial time. We then experimentally evaluate the tightness of this relaxation, demonstrating its competitive performance in test accuracy across a range of classification tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian optimization devolves the global optimization of a costly objective function to the global optimization of a sequence of acquisition functions. This inner-loop optimization can be catastrophically difficult if it involves posterior samples, especially in higher dimensions. We introduce an efficient global optimization strategy for posterior samples based on global rootfinding. It provides gradient-based optimizers with judiciously selected starting points, designed to combine exploitation and exploration. The algorithm scales practically linearly to high dimensions. For posterior sample-based acquisition functions such as Gaussian process Thompson sampling (GP-TS) and variants of entropy search, we demonstrate remarkable improvement in both inner- and outer-loop optimization, surprisingly outperforming alternatives like EI and GP-UCB in most cases. We also propose a sample-average formulation of GP-TS, which has a parameter to explicitly control exploitation and can be computed at the cost of one posterior sample. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/UQUH/TSRoots .</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a general closed graph property for (randomized strategy) Nash equilibrium correspondence in large games. In particular, we show that for any large game with a convergent sequence of fiinite-player games, the limit of any convergent sequence of Nash equilibria of the corresponding finite-player games can be induced by a Nash equilibrium of the large game. Such a result goes beyond earlier results on the closed graph property for pure strategy Nash equilibrium correspondence in large games in multiple aspects. An application on equilibrium selection in large games is also presented.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Approximation for Nonlinear Discrete Stochastic Control: Finite-Sample Bounds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.11854v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a nonlinear discrete stochastic control system, and our goal is to design a feedback control policy in order to lead the system to a prespecified state. We adopt a stochastic approximation viewpoint of this problem. It is known that by solving the corresponding continuous-time deterministic system, and using the resulting feedback control policy, one ensures almost sure convergence to the prespecified state in the discrete system. In this paper, we adopt such a control mechanism and provide its finite-sample convergence bounds whenever a Lyapunov function is known for the continuous system. In particular, we consider four cases based on whether the Lyapunov function for the continuous system gives exponential or sub-exponential rates and based on whether it is smooth or not. We provide the finite-time bounds in all cases. Our proof relies on constructing a Lyapunov function for the discrete system based on the given Lyapunov function for the continuous system. We do this by appropriately smoothing the given function using the Moreau envelope. We present numerical experiments corresponding to the various cases, which validate the rates we establish.</description>

      <title>Normalizing flows as approximations of optimal transport maps via linear-control neural ODEs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.01404v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The term "Normalizing Flows" is related to the task of constructing invertible transport maps between probability measures by means of deep neural networks. In this paper, we consider the problem of recovering the $W_2$-optimal transport map $T$ between absolutely continuous measures $\mu,\nu\in\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ as the flow of a linear-control neural ODE, where the control depends only on the time variable and takes values in a finite-dimensional space. We first show that, under suitable assumptions on $\mu,\nu$ and on the controlled vector fields, the optimal transport map is contained in the $C^0_c$-closure of the flows generated by the system. Assuming that discrete approximations $\mu_N,\nu_N$ of the original measures $\mu,\nu$ are available, we use a discrete optimal coupling $\gamma_N$ to define an optimal control problem. With a $\Gamma$-convergence argument, we prove that its solutions correspond to flows that approximate the optimal transport map $T$. Finally, taking advantage of the Pontryagin Maximum Principle, we propose an iterative numerical scheme for the resolution of the optimal control problem, resulting in an algorithm for the practical computation of the approximated optimal transport map.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.06026v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the concept of strict proto-differentiability of subgradient mappings can play a similar role as smoothness of the gradient mapping of a function in the study of subgradient mappings of prox-regular functions. We then show that metric regularity and strong metric regularity are equivalent for a class of generalized equations when this condition is satisfied. For a class of composite functions, called C2-decomposable, we argue that strict proto-differentiability can be characterized via a simple relative interior condition. Leveraging this observation, we present a characterization of the continuous differentiability of the proximal mapping for this class of function via a certain relative interior condition. Applications to the study of strong metric regularity of the KKT system of a class of composite optimization problems are also provided.</description>

Abstract: The real-time joint optimization of inventory replenishment and vehicle routing is essential for cost-efficiently operating one-warehouse, multiple-retailer systems. This is complex, as future demand predictions should capture correlation retailer demand, and based upon such predictions, replenishment and routing decisions must be taken. Traditionally, such decisions are made by either making distributional assumptions or using machine-learning-based point forecasts. The former approach ignores nonstationary demand patterns, while the latter approach only provides a point forecast ignoring the inherent forecast error. Consequently, in practice, service levels often do not meet their targets, and truck fill rates fall short, harming the efficiency and sustainability of daily operations. We propose Scenario Predict-then-Optimize. This fully data-driven approach for online inventory routing consists of two subsequent steps at each real-time decision epoch. The scenario-predict step exploits neural networks, specifically multi-horizon quantile recurrent neural networks, to predict future demand quantiles, upon which we design a scenario sampling approach. The subsequent scenario-optimize step then solves a scenario-based stochastic programming approximation. Results show that our approach outperforms the classic Predict-then-Optimize paradigm and empirical sampling methods. We show this both on synthetic data and real-life data. Our approach is appealing to practitioners. It is fast, does not rely on distributional assumptions, and does not face the burden of single-scenario forecasts. We show it is robust for various demand and cost parameters, enhancing the efficiency and sustainability of daily replenishment and routing decisions. Finally, Scenario Predict-then-Optimize is general and can be easily extended to account for other operational constraints, making it a useful tool in practice.</description>

      <title>Learning equilibria in Cournot mean field games of controls</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01812v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider Cournot mean field games of controls, a model originally developed for the production of an exhaustible resource by a continuum of producers. We prove uniqueness of the solution under general assumptions on the price function. Then, we prove convergence of a learning algorithm which gives existence of a solution to the mean field games system. The learning algorithm is implemented with a suitable finite difference discretization to get a numerical method to the solution. We supplement our theoretical analysis with several numerical examples and illustrate the impacts of model parameters.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Ensemble Control for Stochastic Systems with Mixed Asymmetric Laplace Noises</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09973v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents an adaptive ensemble control for stochastic systems subject to asymmetric noises and outliers. Asymmetric noises skew system observations, and outliers with large amplitude deteriorate the observations even further. Such disturbances induce poor system estimation and degraded stochastic system control. In this work, we model the asymmetric noises and outliers by mixed asymmetric Laplace distributions (ALDs), and propose an optimal control for stochastic systems with mixed ALD noises. Particularly, we segregate the system disturbed by mixed ALD noises into subsystems, each of which is subject to a specific ALD noise. For each subsystem, we design an iterative quantile filter (IQF) to estimate the system parameters using system observations. With the estimated parameters by IQF, we derive the certainty equivalence (CE) control law for each subsystem. Then we use the Bayesian approach to ensemble the subsystem CE controllers, with each of the controllers weighted by their posterior probability. We finalize our control law as the weighted sum of the control signals by the sub-system CE controllers. To demonstrate our approach, we conduct numerical simulations and Monte Carlo analyses. The results show improved tracking performance by our approach for skew noises and its robustness to outliers, compared with single ALD based and RLS-based control policy.</description>

      <title>Single-Loop Stochastic Algorithms for Difference of Max-Structured Weakly Convex Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18577v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a class of non-smooth non-convex problems in the form of $\min_{x}[\max_{y\in Y}\phi(x, y) - \max_{z\in Z}\psi(x, z)]$, where both $\Phi(x) = \max_{y\in Y}\phi(x, y)$ and $\Psi(x)=\max_{z\in Z}\psi(x, z)$ are weakly convex functions, and $\phi(x, y), \psi(x, z)$ are strongly concave functions in terms of $y$ and $z$, respectively. It covers two families of problems that have been studied but are missing single-loop stochastic algorithms, i.e., difference of weakly convex functions and weakly convex strongly-concave min-max problems. We propose a stochastic Moreau envelope approximate gradient method dubbed SMAG, the first single-loop algorithm for solving these problems, and provide a state-of-the-art non-asymptotic convergence rate. The key idea of the design is to compute an approximate gradient of the Moreau envelopes of $\Phi, \Psi$ using only one step of stochastic gradient update of the primal and dual variables. Empirically, we conduct experiments on positive-unlabeled (PU) learning and partial area under ROC curve (pAUC) optimization with an adversarial fairness regularizer to validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms.</description>

      <title>Almost sure convergence of stochastic Hamiltonian descent methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16649v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gradient normalization and soft clipping are two popular techniques for tackling instability issues and improving convergence of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with momentum. In this article, we study these types of methods through the lens of dissipative Hamiltonian systems. Gradient normalization and certain types of soft clipping algorithms can be seen as (stochastic) implicit-explicit Euler discretizations of dissipative Hamiltonian systems, where the kinetic energy function determines the type of clipping that is applied. We make use of dynamical systems theory to show in a unified way that all of these schemes converge to stationary points of the objective function, almost surely, in several different settings: a) for $L-$smooth objective functions, when the variance of the stochastic gradients is possibly infinite b) under the $(L_0,L_1)-$smoothness assumption, for heavy-tailed noise with bounded variance and c) for $(L_0,L_1)-$smooth functions in the empirical risk minimization setting, when the variance is possibly infinite but the expectation is finite.</description>

      <title>The Pivoting Framework: Frank-Wolfe Algorithms with Active Set Size Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11760v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose the pivoting meta algorithm (PM) to enhance optimization algorithms that generate iterates as convex combinations of vertices of a feasible region $C\subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$, including Frank-Wolfe (FW) variants. PM guarantees that the active set (the set of vertices in the convex combination) of the modified algorithm remains as small as $\mathrm{dim}(C)+1$ as stipulated by Carath\'eodory's theorem. PM achieves this by reformulating the active set expansion task into an equivalent linear program, which can be efficiently solved using a single pivot step akin to the primal simplex algorithm; the convergence rate of the original algorithms are maintained. Furthermore, we establish the connection between PM and active set identification, in particular showing under mild assumptions that PM applied to the away-step Frank-Wolfe algorithm or the blended pairwise Frank-Wolfe algorithm bounds the active set size by the dimension of the optimal face plus $1$. We provide numerical experiments to illustrate practicality and efficacy on active set size reduction.</description>

      <title>Constrained Optimization with Compressed Gradients: A Dynamical Systems Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18469v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gradient compression is of growing interests for solving constrained optimization problems including compressed sensing, noisy recovery and matrix completion under limited communication resources and storage costs. Convergence analysis of these methods from the dynamical systems viewpoint has attracted considerable attention because it provides a geometric demonstration towards the shadowing trajectory of a numerical scheme. In this work, we establish a tight connection between a continuous-time nonsmooth dynamical system called a perturbed sweeping process (PSP) and a projected scheme with compressed gradients. Theoretical results are obtained by analyzing the asymptotic pseudo trajectory of a PSP. We show that under mild assumptions a projected scheme converges to an internally chain transitive invariant set of the corresponding PSP. Furthermore, given the existence of a Lyapunov function $V$ with respect to a set $\Lambda$, convergence to $\Lambda$ can be established if $V(\Lambda)$ has an empty interior. Based on these theoretical results, we are able to provide a useful framework for convergence analysis of projected methods with compressed gradients. Moreover, we propose a provably convergent distributed compressed gradient descent algorithm for distributed nonconvex optimization. Finally, numerical simulations are conducted to confirm the validity of theoretical analysis and the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Efficient Digital Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization Solvers for SAT Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03757v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Boolean satisfiability (SAT) is a propositional logic problem of determining whether an assignment of variables satisfies a Boolean formula. Many combinatorial optimization problems can be formulated in Boolean SAT logic -- either as k-SAT decision problems or Max k-SAT optimization problems, with conflict-driven (CDCL) solvers being the most prominent. Despite their ability to handle large instances, CDCL-based solvers have fundamental scalability limitations. In light of this, we propose recently-developed quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) solvers as an alternative platform for 3-SAT problems. To utilize them, we implement a 2-step [3-SAT]-[Max 2-SAT]-[QUBO] conversion procedure and present a rigorous proof to explicitly calculate the number of both satisfied and violated clauses of the original 3-SAT instance from the transformed Max 2-SAT formulation. We then demonstrate, through numerical simulations on several benchmark instances, that digital QUBO solvers can achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on 78-variable 3-SAT benchmark problems. Our work facilitates the broader use of quantum annealers on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices, as well as their quantum-inspired digital counterparts, for solving 3-SAT problems.</description>

Abstract: We consider distributed optimization in the client-server setting. By use of Douglas-Rachford splitting to the dual of the sum problem, we design a BFGS method that requires minimal communication (sending/receiving one vector per round for each client). Our method is line search free and achieves superlinear convergence. Experiments are also used to demonstrate the merits in decreasing communication and computation costs.</description>

      <title>On NP-Hardness of $L_1/L_2$ Minimization and Bound Theory of Nonzero Entries in Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18748v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The \(L_1/L_2\) norm ratio has gained significant attention as a measure of sparsity due to three merits: sharper approximation to the \(L_0\) norm compared to the \(L_1\) norm, being parameter-free and scale-invariant, and exceptional performance with highly coherent matrices. These properties have led to its successful application across a wide range of fields. While several efficient algorithms have been proposed to compute stationary points for \(L_1/L_2\) minimization problems, their computational complexity has remained open. In this paper, we prove that finding the global minimum of both constrained and unconstrained \(L_1/L_2\) models is strongly NP-hard.
  In addition, we establish uniform upper bounds on the \(L_2\) norm for any local minimizer of both constrained and unconstrained \(L_1/L_2\) minimization models. We also derive upper and lower bounds on the magnitudes of the nonzero entries in any local minimizer of the unconstrained model, aiding in classifying nonzero entries. Finally, we extend our analysis to demonstrate that the constrained and unconstrained \(L_p/L_q\) (\(0 &lt; p \leq 1, 1 &lt; q &lt; +\infty\)) models are also strongly NP-hard.</description>

      <title>Does Worst-Performing Agent Lead the Pack? Analyzing Agent Dynamics in Unified Distributed SGD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17499v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Distributed learning is essential to train machine learning algorithms across heterogeneous agents while maintaining data privacy. We conduct an asymptotic analysis of Unified Distributed SGD (UD-SGD), exploring a variety of communication patterns, including decentralized SGD and local SGD within Federated Learning (FL), as well as the increasing communication interval in the FL setting. In this study, we assess how different sampling strategies, such as i.i.d. sampling, shuffling, and Markovian sampling, affect the convergence speed of UD-SGD by considering the impact of agent dynamics on the limiting covariance matrix as described in the Central Limit Theorem (CLT). Our findings not only support existing theories on linear speedup and asymptotic network independence, but also theoretically and empirically show how efficient sampling strategies employed by individual agents contribute to overall convergence in UD-SGD. Simulations reveal that a few agents using highly efficient sampling can achieve or surpass the performance of the majority employing moderately improved strategies, providing new insights beyond traditional analyses focusing on the worst-performing agent.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11976v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The in vitro transcription (IVT) process is a critical step in RNA production. To ensure the efficiency of RNA manufacturing, it is essential to optimize and identify its key influencing factors. In this study, multiple Gaussian Process (GP) models are used to perform efficient optimization and global sensitivity analysis (GSA). Firstly, multiple GP models were constructed using the data from multiple experimental replicates, accurately capturing the complexities of the IVT process. Then GSA was conducted to determine the dominant reaction factors, specifically the concentrations of reactants NTP and Mg across all data-driven models. Concurrently, a multi-start optimization algorithm was applied to these GP models to identify optimal operational conditions that maximize RNA yields across all surrogate models. These optimized conditions are subsequently validated through additional experimental data.</description>
