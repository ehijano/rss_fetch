      <title>York's Cavity Formalism and Quantum Modified Thermodynamics of (2+1)D Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamic behavior of $(2+1)$ dimensional BTZ black holes using York's cavity formalism, in which the black hole is enclosed within a finite-radius boundary held at a fixed temperature. This canonical ensemble construction enables the precise derivation of thermodynamic quantities such as temperature, energy, entropy, pressure, and heat capacity via the integral Euclidean path approach. Extending this analysis, we incorporate quantum corrections through Barrow entropy, a modified entropy law motivated by possible quantum-gravitational effects. The Barrow entropy is given by $S_B = (A_+/4)^{1+\Delta}$, where $\Delta \in [0,1]$ represents the degree of fractalization of the horizon. For $\Delta &gt; 0$, we derive the corresponding generalized free energy $F_B$, which reveals that the thermodynamic phase structure changes with increasing $\Delta$.The modified heat capacity of Barrow $C_B$ is also computed, which decreases with larger $\Delta$, indicating suppressed thermal stability. Moreover, we study the influence of quantum effects on the thermal response, by calculating the corrected Joule Thomson coefficient $\mu_B$ . We identify a well defined range $r_+ \leq r \leq 1.154\,r_+$ within which a stable black hole configuration can spontaneously nucleate from a background of hot flat space. Together, our results highlight York's cavity method as a robust tool to investigate black hole thermodynamics in lower dimensional gravity and show that Barrow's entropy introduces physically significant corrections that could signal the influence of quantum gravity near the horizon.</description>

      <title>A viable wormhole model in a five-dimensional spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper generalizes two of the author's earlier wormhole solutions that are characterized by an extra spatial dimension. This paper adds the assumption that the components of the line element are functions not only of the radial coordinate $r$ but of the extra coordinate $l$ as well, resulting in a significant generalization. It is shown that the throat of the wormhole can be threaded with ordinary matter and that the unavoidable violation of the null energy condition can be attributed to the extra dimension. To be consistent with string theory, we also assume that this extra dimension has a small magnitude.</description>

      <title>Neutron Star Radial Perturbations for Causal, Viscous, Relativistic Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Which of the multiple models of causal and stable relativistic viscous fluids that have been developed is best suited to describe neutron stars? The modeling of out-of-equilibrium effects in these relativistic, astrophysical objects must be one with care, as simple Newtonian intuition fails to remain causal. Radial stability of neutron stars is one of the primary conditions for the viability of such out-of-equilibrium models. In this paper, we study radial perturbations of neutron stars for the Eckart, the Bemfica-Disconzi-Noronha-Kovtun, and the M\"uller-Israel-Stewart fluid models of relativistic viscous fluids. We find that for small viscosity, the three models have the same stability properties: they are always stable to bulk and shear viscosity, but they can be unstable to heat conductivity if certain thermodynamic conditions are violated. For the latter case, we derive a necessary criterion for stability to heat conductivity that applies to all three fluids. Moreover, we show that the additional degrees of freedom introduced by the Bemfica-Disconzi-Noronha-Kovtun and the M\"uller-Israel-Stewart models force the perturbations to evolve on fast timescales. Specifically, the Bemfica-Disconzi-Noronha-Kovtun model has additional oscillatory perturbations that propagate with the speed of second sound, while the M\"uller-Israel-Stewart model MIS only exhibits decaying behavior on the fast timescale. This work therefore establishes the first formal results and criteria for radial stability of these three out-of-equiblirium fluid models on the non-trivial, relativistic background of neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Lower dimensional black holes in nonlinear electrodynamics: causal structure and scalar perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the charged black hole solutions of a 2+1 nonlinear electrodynamical theory with cosmological constant. Considered as a one-parameter group of theories (the exponent of the squared Maxwell tensor) the causal structure of all possible black holes is scrutinized. We analyze the singularity character that each theory delivers together with their horizons and the plausible limitations in the black hole charges. The investigation demonstrates a rich structure of three different groups of theories, according to the qualitative behavior of the singularity, horizons and limitations in the geometric charges. For such groups we study the effect of a scalar field propagating in the fixed black holes spacetime. All geometries analyzed were stable to such linear perturbations, these evolving as usual quasinormal spectra of the black holes that we calculate in different cases.</description>

      <title>Wormhole Solutions and pre-inflationary in $F(R, T)$ Gravity with Axion Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate wormhole solutions and inflationary initial conditions in the coupled axion-inflaton/scalar field system within $F(R,T)$ gravity. Notably, the Euclidean action is reduced by approximately $10^5$ compared with the GR case. In Euclidean AdS spacetime, we construct Euclidean (semi-)wormhole geometries that naturally set inflationary initial conditions. To enhance the probability of sustained inflation and address the short inflation duration issue in the no-boundary proposal, we constrain $\lambda$ to $\lambda &lt; -\kappa$ by analyzing the properties of the Euclidean action. This constraint causes the probability weight $ P \propto e^{-S_E} $ to favor high-potential regions, achieving sufficient inflation while maintaining a nearly Gaussian perturbation spectrum. The results suggest that matter-geometry coupling in $F(R,T)$ gravity provides a novel mechanism for reconciling quantum cosmology with observational requirements.</description>

      <title>QuGrav: Bringing gravitational waves to light with Qumodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose using qumodes, quantum bosonic modes, for detecting high-frequency gravitational waves via the inverse Gertsenshtein effect, where a gravitational wave resonantly converts into a single photon in a magnetized cavity. For an occupation number $n$ of the photon field in a qumode, the conversion probability is enhanced by a factor of $n+1$ due to Bose-Einstein statistics. Unlocking this increased sensitivity entails the ability to continuously prepare the qumode and perform non-demolition measurement on the qumode-qubit system within the qumode coherence time. Our results indicate that, at microwave frequencies and with existing technology, the proposed setup can attain sensitivities within 1.7 orders of magnitude of the cosmological bound. With anticipated near-future improvements, it has the potential to surpass this limit and pave the way for the first exploration of high-frequency cosmological gravitational wave backgrounds. At optical frequencies, it can enhance the sensitivity of current detectors by one order of magnitude. That further enhances their potential in reaching the single-graviton level.</description>

      <title>The Fast and the Frame-Dragging: Efficient waveforms for asymmetric-mass eccentric equatorial inspirals into rapidly-spinning black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations of gravitational-wave signals emitted by compact binary inspirals provide unique insights into their properties, but their analysis requires accurate and efficient waveform models. Intermediate- and extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (I/EMRIs), with mass ratios $q \gtrsim 10^2$, are promising sources for future detectors such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). Modelling waveforms for these asymmetric-mass binaries is challenging, entailing the tracking of many harmonic modes over thousands to millions of cycles. The FastEMRIWaveforms (FEW) modelling framework addresses this need, leveraging precomputation of mode data and interpolation to rapidly compute adiabatic waveforms for eccentric inspirals into zero-spin black holes. In this work, we extend FEW to model eccentric equatorial inspirals into black holes with spin magnitudes $|a| \leq 0.999$. Our model supports eccentricities $e &lt; 0.9$ and semi-latus recta $p &lt; 200$, enabling the generation of long-duration IMRI waveforms, and produces waveforms in $\sim 100$ ms with hardware acceleration. Characterising systematic errors, we estimate that our model attains mismatches of $\sim 10^{-5}$ (for LISA sensitivity) with respect to error-free adiabatic waveforms over most of parameter space. We find that kludge models introduce errors in signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) as great as $^{+60\%}_{-40\%}$ and induce marginal biases of up to $\sim 1\sigma$ in parameter estimation. We show LISA's horizon redshift for I/EMRI signals varies significantly with $a$, reaching a redshift of $3$ ($15$) for EMRIs (IMRIs) with only minor $(\sim10\%)$ dependence on $e$ for an SNR threshold of 20. For signals with SNR $\sim 50$, spin and eccentricity-at-plunge are measured with uncertainties of $\delta a \sim 10^{-7}$ and $\delta e_f \sim 10^{-5}$. This work advances the state-of-the-art in waveform generation for asymmetric-mass binaries.</description>

      <title>Covariant dynamics from static spherically symmetric geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that any one-parameter family of static, spherically symmetric spacetime metrics can be embedded as the unique vacuum solution set of a generally covariant theory of pure gravity. These theories, involving at most second-order derivatives of metrics, are uniquely specified up to two arbitrary functions that leave the metric unchanged, by a recently derived covariance condition in the Hamiltonian framework. This result solves the inverse problem of Birkhoff's theorem in full generality and establishes a systematic approach for reconstructing covariant dynamics from a given geometry. The framework applies broadly to quantum-gravity-inspired metrics, including regular black hole models, and provides a new tool for probing their dynamical and observational foundations.</description>

      <title>Late time behavior in $f(R,\mathcal{L}_{m})$ gravity through Gaussian reconstruction and dynamical stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore modified gravity in the framework of $f(R, \mathcal{L}_m)$ theories by reconstructing the function $f(\mathcal{L}_m)$, where $\mathcal{L}_m = \rho$ is the matter Lagrangian, under the assumption of a pressureless, matter-dominated Universe. Using a non-parametric Gaussian process reconstruction technique applied to Hubble data, we obtain two viable models of $f(\mathcal{L}_m)$ : (i) a power-law model $f_1(\mathcal{L}_m) = \alpha \mathcal{L}_m^{b_1}$ with $b_1 \in [0.018, 0.025]$ and (ii) an exponential model $f_2(\mathcal{L}_m) = \alpha \mathcal{L}_{m0} \left(1 - e^{-b_2 \sqrt{\mathcal{L}_m/\mathcal{L}_{m0}}} \right)$ with $b_2 \in [2.3, 3.0]$. We then fix the parameter values within these reconstructed ranges and analyze the corresponding dynamical systems within the matter-dominated epoch by constructing autonomous equations. Phase-space analysis reveals the presence of stable critical points in both models, suggesting viable cosmic evolution within their domains of validity. Both the models exhibit stable attractor solution at late time, reinforcing their viability in explaining the late time cosmic acceleration without explicitly invoking a cosmological constant. Our results indicate that $f(R, \mathcal{L}_m)$ gravity with data-driven matter-sector modifications can offer a compelling alternative description of cosmic dynamics during the matter-dominated era.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proper oscillation frequencies of black holes (quasinormal modes) of asymptotically de Sitter black holes were extensively studied, yet the non-oscillatory (purely imaginary) branch of modes of gravitational perturbations of the four-dimensional Reissner-Nordstr\"om-de Sitter solution was omitted in the literature. This branch of modes appears as deformations of the modes of empty de Sitter space. Here we find accurate numerical values of this branch of quasinormal modes and show that they are responsible for the exponential asymptotic tails.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal spectra of a wormhole family: overtone features and a parameter-controlled redshift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Though investigated extensively in the past, we take a detailed relook at the study of quasinormal modes (QNM) in a known family of wormholes (ultrastatic ($g_{00}=-1$), as well as spacetimes with different, non-constant $g_{00}$), which includes the familiar Bronnikov-Ellis spacetime as a special case. Our focus here is to go beyond the fundamental mode and obtain some of the QNM overtones using a suitable numerical scheme. Scalar and axial gravitational QNMs including two or three overtones are obtained for the family of ultrastatic geometries and their parameter dependencies are shown explicitly. Further, we comment on how (a) the overtones may influence the time-domain profile in a perturbation and (b) in what sense, the use of overtones may help in distinguishing between different geometries within the family.
  Finally, we show how an effect somewhat similar to the so-called `environment induced redshift' of QNMs, introduced recently (arXiv:2412.18651), may be obtained for spacetimes with non-constant $g_{00}$, via an appropriate tuning of available metric parameters which systematically modify the shapes of the effective potentials arising in the perturbation equations.</description>

      <title>Black hole photon ring beyond General Relativity: an integrable parametrization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the shape of the photon ring in black holes images has been argued to provide a sharp test of the Kerr hypothesis for future black hole imaging missions. In this work, we confront this proposal to beyond Kerr geometries and investigate the degeneracy in the estimations of the black hole parameters using the circlipse shape proposed by Gralla and Lupsasca. To that end, we consider a model-independent parametrization of the deviations to the Kerr black hole geometry, dubbed Kerr off shell (KOS), which preserves the fundamental symmetry structure of Kerr known as the Killing tower. Besides exhibiting a Killing tensor and thus a Carter-like constant, all the representants of this family also possess a Killing-Yano tensor and are of Petrov type D. The allowed deviations to Kerr, selected by the symmetry, are encoded in two free functions which depend respectively on the radial and polar angle coordinates. Using the symmetries, we provide an analytic study of the radial and polar motion of photon trajectories generating the critical curve, to which the subrings composing the photon ring converge. This allows us to derive a ready-to-use closed formula for the parametric critical curve in term of the free functions parametrizing the deviations to Kerr. Using this result, we confront the circlipse fitting function to four examples of Kerr-like objects and we show that it admits a high degree of degeneracy. At a given inclination, the same circlipse can fit both a Kerr black hole of a given mass and spin $(M,a)$ or a modified rotating black hole with different mass and spin parameters $(M,a)$ and a new parameter $\alpha$. Therefore, future tests of the Kerr hypothesis could be achieved only provided one can measure independently the mass and spin of the black hole to break this degeneracy.</description>

      <title>A class of charged and charged-Taub-NUT metrics in the presence of a massless scalar field and some of their astrophysical aspects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a class of exact solutions to the Einstein equations in the presence of a scalar field, recently introduced in [arXiv:2307.09328, arXiv:2307.13588], and derive their generalized form with dyonic charges using Harrison transformations. For specific parameter values, this class of metrics includes the charged Fisher Janis Newman Winicour (FJNW) and gamma metrics. We then investigate the motion of neutral particles in the background of these metrics and derive the corresponding effective potential.
  Next, by applying Ehlers transformations, we introduce the NUT parameter into the Reissner Nordstrom metric in the presence of the scalar field. We also examine gravitational lensing, focusing on the effects of dyonic and NUT charges, as well as the scalar field, on the deflection angle of light. Finally, we explore the quasi normal modes associated with this class of metrics.</description>

      <title>Dissecting environmental effects with eccentric gravitational wave sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We model the effect of resonances between time-varying perturbative forces and the epi-cyclical motion of eccentric binaries in the gravitational wave (GW) driven regime. These induce secular drifts in the orbital elements which are reflected in a dephasing of the binary's GW signal, derived here systematically. The resulting dephasing prescriptions showcase a much richer phenomenology with respect to typically adopted power-laws, and are better able to model realistic environmental effects (EE). The most important consequences are for gas embedded binaries, which we analyse in detail with a series of analytical calculations, numerical experiments and a curated set of hydrodynamical simulations. Even in these simplified tests, we find the surprising result that dephasing caused by epi-cyclical resonances dominate over expectations based on smoothed or orbit averaged gas drag models in GW signals that retain mild eccentricity in the detector band ($e&gt; 0.05$). We discuss how dissecting GW dephasing in its component Fourier modes can be used to probe the coupling of binaries with their surrounding environment in unprecedented detail.</description>

      <title>Mitigating antenna gain errors with HyFoReS in CHIME simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hybrid Foreground Residual Subtraction (HyFoReS) is a new family of algorithms designed to remove systematics-induced foreground contamination for 21-cm intensity mapping data. Previously, the algorithm was shown to be effective in mitigating beam perturbations in sky maps from the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME). In this study, we apply HyFoReS to CHIME simulations and test the algorithm's ability to mitigate antenna gain-type systematics in polarized visibilities. Simulating a two-cylinder telescope similar to the CHIME pathfinder, we find that HyFoReS reduces foreground bias caused by bandpass perturbations to a level below the thermal noise, provided that the RMS value of the perturbations is on the order of $10^{-4}$ or lower. When tested with complex antenna-dependent gain errors, HyFoReS can reduce residual foreground bias in the power spectrum by up to three orders of magnitude. While noise bias and second-order perturbations are currently the limiting factors for the algorithm, we have demonstrated that HyFoReS can suppress gain-induced foreground leakage in polarized data from 21-cm telescopes, aiding in the detection of the 21-cm auto-power spectrum for hydrogen intensity mapping experiments.</description>

      <title>$w_{dm}$-$w_{de}$ cosmological model with new data samples of cosmological observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit a cosmological model where dark matter (DM) and dark energy (DE) follow barotropic equations of state, allowing deviations from the standard $\Lambda$CDM framework (i.e. $w_{dm} \neq 0$, $w_{de} \neq -1$) considering both, flat and non-flat curvature. Using a dynamical system approach, we identify equilibrium states that govern stability, expansion, and contraction. Expansion occurs when $H&gt;0$, while contraction is linked to $H &lt; 0$. Accelerated expansion arises from DE dominance, whereas radiation- and matter-dominated phases lead to deceleration. Some solutions are unphysical, because of density constraints, but viable cases offer insights into cosmic transitions, including the Einstein static universe, which allows shifts between accelerating and decelerating phases. We perform a Bayesian analysis with updated datasets, including observational Hubble data, Pantheon+ Type Ia supernovae, strong lensing systems, and baryon acoustic oscillations, to constrain the parameters $w_{dm}$ and $w_{de}$. Our results from the data joint analysis show consistency with $\Lambda$CDM within $3\sigma$, but none of the cases reproduce $w_{dm} = 0$ and $w_{de} = -1$. Nevertheless, the comparison with the standard model using the Akaike and Bayesian information criteria indicates that only the non-flat scenario has the potential to be competitive. This suggests that a non-dust-like DM may impact structure formation, while DE could shift toward quintessence fluid. While $\Lambda$CDM remains a strong model, our findings indicate that alternative dark sector models with non-standard EoS could be viable and offer new insights into cosmic evolution.</description>

      <title>JT de Sitter Gravity as a Model of Coleman-de Luccia Tunneling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We interpret the Euclidean solution of JT de Sitter gravity as the Coleman-de Luccia instanton for the decay of the low-entropy horizon of its static patch solution into either a Big Crunch or an infinite-entropy Lorentzian de Sitter cosmology. As in previous work by one of the authors, the Big Crunch is interpreted as bounding the entropy of the static state. The principle of detailed balance then guarantees it will transition back to a higher entropy causal diamond in the expanding cosmology. We then construct a family of explicit quantum mechanical models and appropriate metastable states, with transition probabilities well approximated by the semi-classical calculations in JT de Sitter gravity.</description>

      <title>Fullshape power spectrum for the Symmetron modified gravity model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We make use of the perturbation theory for modified gravity models that we developed in previous works and apply it to construct the fullshape galaxy power spectrum for the Symmetron modified gravity model. First, we study the growth rate, that is a scale dependent quantity, and compare our results with those of the $n=1 $ Hu-Sawcki (HS) model, finding that the Symmetron has a growth quite similar to the HS F6 in the wavenumber interval $0.01 \leq k \leq 0.1 $ and for redshifts where Symmetron model is viable. We also propose a growth parametrization that turns to be a good approximation for the HS and Symmetron models, with a deviation less than $0.6 \%$. To compute the RSD multipoles we employ an expansion of the velocity moments generating function that is suitable for general modified gravity models. Later, we apply the fk-Perturbation Theory (fkPT) approximation to reduce the computation time of nonlinear kernels, to find the fullshape galaxy power spectrum for the Symmetron, and study the differences with HS model. The RSD multipoles of the Symmetron result similar to those of the HS F6 model. Next, we integrate this theory to an MCMC sampler and validate our results by fitting our parameters to EZMocks to recover the parameters that bring the model to GR. We found a similar agreement in the model validation between Symmetron and F6 model, recovering the simulation cosmological parameters, and concluding that our pipeline is ready to make cosmological parameters' inference with real data.</description>

      <title>Self-gravitating strings and quantum effects in two-dimensional gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is expected that when the string coupling is taken to be sufficiently small, a black hole turns into a bound state of self-gravitating fundamental strings. This state would be described by winding strings wrapping around the Euclidean time circle, known as the Horowitz-Polchinski solution. In this paper, we study such a self-gravitating string configuration in two-dimensional dilaton gravity theories. We first derive an analytic expression of the solution describing a winding string in two-dimensions and investigate in detail the geometry of this solution. Our winding string solution in two dimensions describes the geometry near the surface of the bound state of self-gravitating strings in the large-dimension limit, much like a two-dimensional black hole describes the near horizon geometry of the Schwarzschild black hole in the large-dimension limit. To study quantum effects around self-gravitating strings, we also obtain an analytic solution of winding strings in the RST model. In a similar fashion to the Hartle-Hawking vacuum around a black hole, our string solution in the RST model contains the background radiation, whose temperature is the same as that of the winding strings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore a potential connection between the black hole information paradox and the double descent phenomenon in quantum machine learning. Information retrieval from Hawking radiation can be viewed through the lens of quantum linear regression over black hole microstates, with the Page time corresponding to the interpolation threshold, beyond which test error decreases despite overparameterization. Using the Marchenko-Pastur law, we derive the variance in test error for the quantum linear regression problem and show that the transition across the Page time is associated with a change in the rank structure of subsystems. This observation suggests a conceptual parallel between black hole physics and machine learning that may provide new perspectives for both fields.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing Monochromatic Signals in LISA and Taiji: Ultralight Dark Matter versus Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultralight dark matter (ULDM) is an attractive candidate for cold dark matter, one of the main mysterious components of the Universe. Recent studies suggest that gravitational-wave (GW) laser interferometers can also detect bosonic ULDM fields, which would produce monochromatic signals resembling those from gravitational waves (GWs). Distinguishing between these potential origins therefore would be essential. In this work, we develop a method to address this challenge for space-based GW interferometers (such as LISA and Taiji) by utilizing the null-response channel (NRC) in interferometric combinations, a channel constructed to have zero response to a specific type of source from a given direction. We find that while the GW NRC remains blind to GWs from a specific direction, it still responds to ULDM, particularly at frequencies above the interferometer's critical frequency. The ULDM NRC exhibits similar behavior. Based on these observations, we outline a test procedure to discriminate between signal origins. Our method provides a new diagnostic tool for analyzing monochromatic signals in space-based GW interferometers, potentially expanding the scientific scope of future missions.</description>

Abstract: In this contribution, we describe the status of our experiment aimed at measuring the gravitationally induced phase shift on path-entangled photons. We use a kilometer-scale fiber interferometer whose arms are vertically displaced in the Earth gravitational potential, allowing photons propagating at different heights to accumulate different phases. To date, this is the first experiment to measure this effect on massless particles, thereby experimentally combining general relativity and quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Is non-zero equation of state of dark matter favored by DESI DR2?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nature of dark matter remains one of the most fundamental and unresolved questions in modern cosmology. In most cosmological models, dark matter is typically modeled as pressureless dust with an equation of state (EoS) parameter $w_{\rm dm} = 0$. However, there is no fundamental theoretical reason to exclude the possibility of a non-zero dark matter EoS parameter. In this work, we explore the possibility of a non-zero dark matter EoS within the phenomenologically emergent dark energy (PEDE) model, given its simplicity and proven ability to alleviate the Hubble tension. We perform observational constraints by using the latest baryon acoustic oscillation data from DESI DR2, the cosmic microwave background (CMB) data from Planck, and the type Ia supernova data from DESY5 and PantheonPlus. From our analysis, we observe that a negative dark matter EoS parameter is preferred in all scenarios. Specifically, the CMB+DESI+DESY5 data yields $w_{\mathrm{dm}} = -0.00093 \pm 0.00032$, deviating from zero at approximately the $3\sigma$ level. However, this deviation is likely driven by unidentified systematics or inconsistencies in the DESY5 data, with the deviation decreasing to $2\sigma$ when using PantheonPlus data. Meanwhile, a negative $w_{\rm dm}$ would increase the Hubble tension due to the positive degeneracy between $w_{\rm dm}$ and $H_0$. Furthermore, Bayesian evidence suggests that the $\Lambda$CDM model is strongly preferred over the PEDE+$w_{\rm dm}$ model. These analyses illustrate that it is not possible to both support a non-cold dark matter component within the PEDE model and alleviate the Hubble tension simultaneously.</description>

      <title>Collapse Scenario and Final State of Evaporation for Schwarzschild Black Hole in Dimensionally-Reduced Model of Dilaton Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a model of (1+1)-dimensional dilaton gravity derived from the four-dimensional Einstein-Hilbert action by dimensional reduction in a semiclassical approximation including back-reaction. The reduced action involves the cosmological constant and admits black hole solutions; among these, the solutions of interest are the evaporating black holes. We solve the equations of motion perturbatively by demanding that the initial state geometry is a Minkowski space-time. When the infalling matter intersects the space-time boundary, the black hole forms and begins to evaporate. We find that as the black hole evaporates, its horizon shrinks and at a finite space-time point, it meets the singularity and a shockwave occurs. Along this hypersurface, the metric can be continuously matched to a static end-state geometry. This end-state geometry is Minkowski space-time within the first-order of perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>General theory of swimming in curved spacetimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.04654v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Swimming in curved spacetimes is a phenomenon whereby free bodies in curved spacetimes are able to propel themselves by performing cyclic internal motions. When originally proposed, it was further suggested that, in the limit of fast internal cycles, the net motion would display a simple geometric-phase character, in which the displacement per cycle would not depend on the time progression of the internal motions but only on the sequence of shapes assumed by the body, like a swimmer in a non-turbulent viscous fluid (low Reynolds number). In this paper we develop a general, covariant theory of swimming in curved spacetimes, describing a technique to study the motion of free, small, light, articulated bodies in general relativity by mapping the problem to an analogue in special relativity. We give considerable attention to the limit of fast cycles and investigate the conditions in which the overall motion could display such geometric-phase behavior. The conclusion, however, is that this simple behavior is only realized in very specific circumstances, depending on the structure of the body, characteristics of internal motions, initial conditions, and symmetries of the spacetime; whereas, in general, our formulas predict a more complicated dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14157v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two classes of stationary axisymmetric solutions of Einstein's equations for isolated differentially rotating matter sources are presented. The asymptotic regime is extracted, with attention to quasilocal gravitational energy, shear and angular momentum related by the Raychaudhuri equation. At outer boundaries the quasilocal angular momentum and energy densities vanish, defining novel geometric structures - the vortex surface and the rotosurface. Solutions with a rotosurface present a new notion of asymptotic flatness: vorticity, shear and Kretschmann scalars vanish at a finite radial distance from the symmetry centre. Synthetic rotation curves for the Milky Way are presented, fit to GAIA-DR3 data, and potential astrophysical signatures are suggested. Whether or not abundant collisionless dark matter exists, the new solutions very strongly support suggestions that the phenomenology of galactic rotation curves be fundamentally reconsidered, for consistency with general relativity.</description>

      <title>DeepExtractor: Time-domain reconstruction of signals and glitches in gravitational wave data with deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18423v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) detectors, such as LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA, detect faint signals from distant astrophysical events. However, their high sensitivity also makes them susceptible to background noise, which can obscure these signals. This noise often includes transient artifacts called 'glitches', that can mimic genuine astrophysical signals or mask their true characteristics. In this study, we present DeepExtractor, a deep learning framework that is designed to reconstruct signals and glitches with power exceeding interferometer noise, regardless of their source. We design DeepExtractor to model the inherent noise distribution of GW detectors, following conventional assumptions that the noise is Gaussian and stationary over short time scales. It operates by predicting and subtracting the noise component of the data, retaining only the clean reconstruction of signal or glitch. We focus on applications related to glitches and validate DeepExtractor's effectiveness through three experiments: (1) reconstructing simulated glitches injected into simulated detector noise, (2) comparing its performance with the state-of-the-art BayesWave algorithm, and (3) analyzing real data from the Gravity Spy dataset to demonstrate effective glitch subtraction from LIGO strain data. We further demonstrate its potential by reconstructing three real GW events from LIGO's third observing run, without being trained on GW waveforms. Our proposed model achieves a median mismatch of only 0.9% for simulated glitches, outperforming several deep learning baselines. Additionally, DeepExtractor surpasses BayesWave in glitch recovery, offering a dramatic computational speedup by reconstructing one glitch sample in approximately 0.1 seconds on a CPU, compared to BayesWave's processing time of approximately one hour per glitch.</description>

      <title>The ringdown of a black hole surrounded by a thin shell of matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00367v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies have shown that far-field perturbations to the curvature potential of a black hole spacetime may destabilize its quasinormal mode (QNM) spectrum while only mildly affecting time-domain ringdown signals. In this work, we study the QNM spectrum and ringdown behavior of a Schwarzschild black hole with a far-field perturbation to its physical environment -- a thin matter shell with finite surface tension. After accounting for the dynamics of the interaction between GWs and the shell, we find that the fundamental mode can migrate perturbatively or be destabilized by the appearance of new modes with no analogue in the vacuum case, much like studies of ``bumps" in the curvature potential. However, unlike these previous works, we find that the coupling between metric perturbations and oscillations of the shell also sources weakly-damped QNMs which are exclusive to the polar sector. We then study whether the analysis tools of least-squares QNM fits and the full and rational ringdown filters can clearly identify the signatures of the shell in representative ringdown waveforms. We conclude that ringdown at sufficiently early times is insensitive to the shell; weakly-damped QNMs (in the polar sector) and echoes, which may enable the analysis methods considered here to infer the presence of a shell, only appear at late times and are generally weak.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by the first detection of gravitational waves, this dissertation develops analytical, numerical, and data analysis techniques to address persistent blind spots in our understanding of gravity. Beginning with asymptotically flat spacetimes and the geometry of null geodesic congruences, the derivation of the shear tensor--encoding gravitational radiation--is revisited. The covariant phase space formulation of General Relativity is then employed to derive a non-conservation law associated with the symmetry group at null infinity, generalizing prior constructions of radiative phase space and yielding consistent results. These flux laws are used to derive constraint equations that enable the evaluation and comparison of state-of-the-art numerical waveform models, leading to new insights and a robust algorithm for benchmarking future improvements. These flux laws are further applied to compute quantum corrections to gravitational waveforms arising from the gravitational wave echo effect. Two leading phenomenological scenarios involving echoes from binary black hole mergers are analyzed. The structure of both the primary echo signal and its induced corrections to nonlinear features of the waveform are studied for observability by the upcoming LISA mission. The results indicate that LISA could detect such signals, potentially probing black hole area quantization. Finally, motivated by recent hints of a stochastic gravitational wave background from Pulsar Timing Array data, this work reviews its theoretical basis and studies several astrophysical and cosmological source scenarios. A forecast for detection prospects with LISA is presented using a modern data analysis pipeline. The results suggest LISA will constrain the extra-galactic stochastic background to a spectral energy density below $ \Omega_\text{GW} \lesssim 10^{-8}$.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Hysteresis in $f(R)$ Gravity: A Thermodynamic Perspective on Cyclic Bouncing Universes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08109</link>

Abstract: We investigate the emergence of cosmic hysteresis in cyclic bouncing cosmologies within the framework of $f(R)$ modified gravity theories. Building upon previous studies that explored hysteresis phenomena in braneworld and Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity, we analyze how scalar field dynamics coupled to a modified gravitational background generates asymmetric pressure evolution during expansion and contraction phases. This asymmetry manifests as a non-vanishing work integral over complete cosmic cycles, $\oint p\,dV \neq 0$, which we interpret as a fundamental thermodynamic signature of irreversible cyclic evolution. We derive the modified Friedmann equations for a representative $f(R) = R + \alpha R^2$ model, establish analytical conditions for bounce and turnaround events, and quantify the thermodynamic work performed during each cycle through comprehensive numerical analysis. Our findings demonstrate that hysteresis effects are generic features of scalar-tensor dynamics in higher-curvature gravity theories and can drive cumulative evolution of the cosmic scale factor across multiple cycles, potentially providing new insights into the resolution of cosmological singularities and the thermodynamic arrow of time in modified gravity frameworks.</description>

      <title>The reverse Burnett conjecture for null dusts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17530v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a regular solution $\mathbf{g}_0$ of the Einstein-null dusts system without restriction on the number of dusts, we construct families of solutions $(\mathbf{g}_\lambda)_{\lambda\in(0,1]}$ of the Einstein vacuum equations such that $\mathbf{g}_\lambda-\mathbf{g}_0$ and $\partial(\mathbf{g}_\lambda-\mathbf{g}_0)$ converges respectively strongly and weakly to 0 when $\lambda\to0$. Our construction, based on a multiphase geometric optics ansatz, thus extends the validity of the reverse Burnett conjecture without symmetry to a large class of massless kinetic spacetimes. In order to deal with the finite but arbitrary number of direction of oscillations we work in a generalised wave gauge and control precisely the self-interaction of each wave but also the interaction of waves propagating in different null directions, relying crucially on the non-linear structure of the Einstein vacuum equations. We also provide the construction of oscillating initial data solving the vacuum constraint equations and which are consistent with the spacetime ansatz.</description>

      <title>The effect of pressure anisotropy on quark stars structure in the Starobinsky model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06170v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The structure and stability of quark stars (QSs) made of interacting quark matter are discussed in this study, taking color superconductivity and perturbative QCD corrections into account. By combining this EoS with the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations, we explore the mass-radius ($M-R$) relations of QSs. The analysis is conducted within the framework of $R^2$ gravity, where the gravity model is described by $f(R) = R + a R^2$. Our primary goal is to investigate how variations in the $R^2$ gravity parameter $a$ affect the mass-radius and mass-central density ($M-\rho_c$) relationships of QSs. Furthermore, we study the dynamical stability of these stars by analyzing the impact of anisotropy parameters $\beta$ and the interaction parameter $\lambda$ derived from the EoS, on their stability. Our results demonstrate that the presence of pressure anisotropy plays a significant role in increasing the maximum mass of QSs, with potential implications for the existence of super-massive pulsars. These findings are in agreement with recent astronomical observations, which suggest the possibility of neutron stars exceeding $2M_{\odot}$.</description>

      <title>Role of the counterterms in the conservation of superhorizon curvature perturbations at one loop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12112v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, several papers have claimed that superhorizon curvature perturbations are not conserved at the one-loop level in single-field inflation models if there is a transient ultra-slow-roll period. In this work, we point out that the contributions from the counterterms were overlooked in the recent papers. We show that the counterterm contributions play a crucial role in canceling the one-loop power spectrum of superhorizon curvature perturbations in the comoving gauge.</description>

      <title>What solves the Hubble tension in phenomenological dark energy models at background level?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24743v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Few phenomenological models tend to favour higher values of the Hubble parameter, often at the expense of invoking phantom transitions. These models achieve this without introducing additional parameters, akin to the simplicity of the concordance $\Lambda$CDM model. In this work, we investigate two such models -- Phenomenologically Emergent Dark Energy (PEDE) and Granda-Oliveros Holographic Dark Energy (GOHDE) -- to assess how correlations between $H_0$ and $\Omega_m$, as well as the choice of datasets, influence conclusions regarding their potential to address the Hubble tension at the background level. We find that minimally extended versions of these models favour notably low values for the Hubble parameter, with the perceived preference for higher values driven by the associated prior. Excluding BAO Ly$\alpha$-$H(z)$ data points at a redshift of $\sim 2.3$ results in a Hubble parameter that remains in significant tension with SH0ES measurements. In contrast, including these data points favours a higher $H_0$, as they suggest a relatively lower matter density within the framework of the assumed fiducial cosmology. Additionally, recent DESI DR1 and DR2 data exhibit mild tension with BAO-$H(z)$ estimates from SDSS. We demonstrate that the inclusion of stringent constraints, such as the CMB shift-parameter along with Pantheon$^+$, on the effective pressure less matter density significantly impacts the estimation of the Hubble parameter. Finally, reinterpreting these models in terms of interacting dark sectors with $Q = 3H\gamma_{\Lambda}\tilde{\rho}_{m}$ reveals that addressing the Hubble tension necessitates a varying $\gamma_{\Lambda}$ characterised by a singular sign-switch behaviour. This phantom behaviour, or equivalently, the onset of violation of the null energy condition in the future, is crucial for minimal models to solve the Hubble tension.</description>
