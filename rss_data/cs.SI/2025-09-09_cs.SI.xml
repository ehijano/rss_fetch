      <title>Language Model Perplexity Predicts Scientific Surprise and Transformative Impact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scientific breakthroughs typically emerge through the surprising violation of established research ideas, yet quantifying surprise has remained elusive because it requires a coherent model of all contemporary scientific worldviews. Deep neural networks like large language models (LLMs) are arbitrary function approximators tuned to consistently expect the expressions and ideas on which they were trained and those semantically nearby. This suggests that as LLMs improve at generating plausible text, so the perplexity or improbability a text sequence would be generated by them should come to better predict scientific surprise and disruptive importance. Analyzing over 2 million papers across multiple disciplines published immediately following the training of 5 prominent open LLMs, here we show that higher perplexity scores systematically predict papers that receive more variable review ratings, longer editorial delays, and greater reviewer uncertainty. The most perplexing papers exhibit bimodal outcomes: disproportionately represented among the most celebrated scientific achievements and also the most discounted. High-perplexity papers tend to be published in journals with more variable impact factors and receive fewer short-term citations but in prestigious venues that bet on long-term impact. They also generate more interdisciplinary engagement portending long-term influence, and are more likely to have been supported by speculative funders like DARPA versus the NIH. Interestingly, we find the opposite pattern for humanities research, where the least surprising work is the most celebrated and cited. Our findings reveal that computational measures of corpus-wide linguistic surprise can forecast the reception and ultimate influence of scientific ideas, offering a scalable approach to recognize and generate potentially transformative research that challenge conventional scientific thinking.</description>

      <title>A Spatiotemporal Adaptive Local Search Method for Tracking Congestion Propagation in Dynamic Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traffic congestion propagation poses significant challenges to urban sustainability, disrupting spatial accessibility. The cascading effect of traffic congestion propagation can cause large-scale disruptions to networks. Existing studies have laid a solid foundation for characterizing the cascading effects. However, they typically rely on predefined graph structures and lack adaptability to diverse data granularities. To address these limitations, we propose a spatiotemporal adaptive local search (STALS) method, which feeds the dynamically adaptive adjacency matrices into the local search algorithm to learn propagation rules. Specifically, the STALS is composed of two data-driven modules. One is a dynamic adjacency matrix learning module, which learns the spatiotemporal relationship from congestion graphs by fusing four node features. The other one is the local search module, which introduces local dominance to identify multi-scale congestion bottlenecks and search their propagation pathways. We test our method on the four benchmark networks with an average of 15,000 nodes. The STALS remains a Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) score at 0.97 and an average execution time of 27.66s, outperforming six state-of-the-art methods in robustness and efficiency. We also apply the STALS to three large-scale traffic networks in New York City, the United States, Shanghai, China, and Urumqi, China. The ablation study reveals an average modularity of 0.78 across three cities, demonstrating the spatiotemporal-scale invariance of frequencytransformed features and the spatial heterogeneity of geometric topological features. By integrating dynamic graph learning with Geo-driven spatial analytics, STALS provides a scalable tool for congestion mitigation.</description>

      <title>No Such Thing as Free Brain Time: For a Pigouvian Tax on Attention Capture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In our age of digital platforms, human attention has become a scarce and highly valuable resource, rivalrous, tradable, and increasingly subject to market dynamics. This article explores the commodification of attention within the framework of the attention economy, arguing that attention should be understood as a common good threatened by over-exploitation. Drawing from philosophical, economic, and legal perspectives, we first conceptualize attention not only as an individual cognitive process but as a collective and infrastructural phenomenon susceptible to enclosure by digital intermediaries. We then identify and analyze negative externalities of the attention economy, particularly those stemming from excessive screen time: diminished individual agency, adverse health outcomes, and societal and political harms, including democratic erosion and inequality. These harms are largely unpriced by market actors and constitute a significant market failure. In response, among a spectrum of public policy tools ranging from informational campaigns to outright restrictions, we propose a Pigouvian tax on attention capture as a promising regulatory instrument to internalize the externalities and, in particular, the social cost of compulsive digital engagement. Such a tax would incentivize structural changes in platform design while preserving user autonomy. By reclaiming attention as a shared resource vital to human agency, health, and democracy, this article contributes a novel economic and policy lens to the debate on digital regulation. Ultimately, this article advocates for a paradigm shift: from treating attention as a private, monetizable asset to protecting it as a collective resource vital for humanity.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Listener Structure Underlying K-pop's Global Success: A Large-Scale Listening Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From the mid-2000s to the 2010s, K-pop moved beyond its status as a regionally popular genre in Asia and established itself as a global music genre with enthusiastic fans around the world. However, little is known about how the vast number of music listeners across the globe have listened to and perceived K-pop. This study addresses this question by analyzing a large-scale listening dataset from Last.fm. An analysis of the distribution of play counts reveals that K-pop experienced a significant increase in plays between 2005 and 2019, largely supported by a small group of heavy listeners. The Gini coefficient in play counts is notably greater than that of existing mainstream genres and other growing niche genres. Furthermore, an analysis based on user-assigned genre tags quantitatively demonstrates that between 2005 and 2010, K-pop shed its status as a local Asian genre and established itself as a distinct music genre in its own right.</description>

      <title>How candidates evoke identity and issues on TikTok</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social media platforms are increasingly central to campaign communication, with both paid (advertising) and earned (organic) posts used for fundraising, mobilization, and persuasion. TikTok, and other short-form video platforms, with its short-video format and content-driven algorithms, demand unique content. We examine the final six months before the 2024 US Presidential Election to understand how major campaigns used TikTok. We frame our analysis around two political science theories. The first is the expressive (identity) model, where voters are motivated by their group memberships and candidates appeal to those identities. Alternatively, the instrumental (issues) model argues voters align with politicians advocating their key issues. We also examine how often candidates attacked opponents, reflecting literature showing attacks are common in politics. We combine two datasets: posts from the Harris and Trump campaigns on TikTok (July-November 2024) and a two-wave 2022 survey of around 1,000 respondents. Results show Trump more often disparaged Harris and emphasized identities and issues distinguishing Republicans, while Harris more often highlighted Democratic identities and valued issues. Although issues predict party ID, both candidates referenced identities more (34 percent of posts) than issues (25 percent), with most posts mentioning neither (55 percent).</description>

      <title>Application of discrete Ricci curvature in pruning randomly wired neural networks: A case study with chest x-ray classification of COVID-19</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Randomly Wired Neural Networks (RWNNs) serve as a valuable testbed for investigating the impact of network topology in deep learning by capturing how different connectivity patterns impact both learning efficiency and model performance. At the same time, they provide a natural framework for exploring edge-centric network measures as tools for pruning and optimization. In this study, we investigate three edge-centric network measures: Forman-Ricci curvature (FRC), Ollivier-Ricci curvature (ORC), and edge betweenness centrality (EBC), to compress RWNNs by selectively retaining important synapses (or edges) while pruning the rest. As a baseline, RWNNs are trained for COVID-19 chest x-ray image classification, aiming to reduce network complexity while preserving performance in terms of accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity. We extend prior work on pruning RWNN using ORC by incorporating two additional edge-centric measures, FRC and EBC, across three network generators: Erd\"{o}s-R\'{e}nyi (ER) model, Watts-Strogatz (WS) model, and Barab\'{a}si-Albert (BA) model. We provide a comparative analysis of the pruning performance of the three measures in terms of compression ratio and theoretical speedup. A central focus of our study is to evaluate whether FRC, which is computationally more efficient than ORC, can achieve comparable pruning effectiveness. Along with performance evaluation, we further investigate the structural properties of the pruned networks through modularity and global efficiency, offering insights into the trade-off between modular segregation and network efficiency in compressed RWNNs. Our results provide initial evidence that FRC-based pruning can effectively simplify RWNNs, offering significant computational advantages while maintaining performance comparable to ORC.</description>

      <title>AI-in-the-Loop: Privacy Preserving Real-Time Scam Detection and Conversational Scambaiting by Leveraging LLMs and Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scams exploiting real-time social engineering -- such as phishing, impersonation, and phone fraud -- remain a persistent and evolving threat across digital platforms. Existing defenses are largely reactive, offering limited protection during active interactions. We propose a privacy-preserving, AI-in-the-loop framework that proactively detects and disrupts scam conversations in real time. The system combines instruction-tuned artificial intelligence with a safety-aware utility function that balances engagement with harm minimization, and employs federated learning to enable continual model updates without raw data sharing. Experimental evaluations show that the system produces fluent and engaging responses (perplexity as low as 22.3, engagement $\approx$0.80), while human studies confirm significant gains in realism, safety, and effectiveness over strong baselines. In federated settings, models trained with FedAvg sustain up to 30 rounds while preserving high engagement ($\approx$0.80), strong relevance ($\approx$0.74), and low PII leakage ($\leq$0.0085). Even with differential privacy, novelty and safety remain stable, indicating that robust privacy can be achieved without sacrificing performance. The evaluation of guard models (LlamaGuard, LlamaGuard2/3, MD-Judge) shows a straightforward pattern: stricter moderation settings reduce the chance of exposing personal information, but they also limit how much the model engages in conversation. In contrast, more relaxed settings allow longer and richer interactions, which improve scam detection, but at the cost of higher privacy risk. To our knowledge, this is the first framework to unify real-time scam-baiting, federated privacy preservation, and calibrated safety moderation into a proactive defense paradigm.</description>

      <title>Recursive Hierarchical Networks and the Law of Functional Evolution: A Universal Framework for Complex Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding and predicting the evolution of across complex systems remains a fundamental challenge due to the absence of unified and computationally testable frameworks. Here we propose the Recursive Hierarchical Network(RHN), conceptualizing evolution as recursive encapsulation along a trajectory of node $\to$ module $\to$ system $\to$ new node, governed by gradual accumulation and abrupt transition. Theoretically, we formalize and prove the law of functional evolution, revealing an irreversible progression from structure-dominated to regulation-dominated to intelligence-dominated stages. Empirically, we operationalize functional levels and align life, cosmic, informational, and social systems onto this scale. The resulting trajectories are strictly monotonic and exhibit strong cross-system similarity, with high pairwise cosine similarities and robust stage resonance. We locate current system states and project future transitions. RHN provides a mathematically rigorous, multi-scale framework for reconstructing and predicting system evolution, offering theoretical guidance for designing next-generation intelligent systems.</description>

      <title>Stack Overflow Is Not Dead Yet: Crowd Answers Still Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Millions of users visit Stack Overflow regularly to ask community for answers to their programming questions. However, like many other platforms, Stack Overflow consistently struggles with low user retention and declining levels of user contributions to the platform. With the introduction of ChatGPT in November 2022, these ongoing difficulties on Stack Overflow were further magnified, as many users moved toward ChatGPT for programming help. In this paper, we build upon recent research on this phenomenon by analyzing the transformation of user-generated content on Stack Overflow during the post-ChatGPT period. Specifically, we analyze two years of Stack Overflow data and fit multiple causal regression models to estimate the effect of ChatGPT on the length and difficulty of user questions and code examples. We confirm an acceleration of decline in user contributions but find that ChatGPT had a significant positive effect on question and answer length, code length, and question difficulty on Stack Overflow across programming languages. Our results suggest that ChatGPT has effectively raised the bar for questions on Stack Overflow, as users increasingly turn to crowdsourced platforms for help with more complex and challenging problems. With our work we contribute to the ongoing discussion on the impact of tools such as ChatGPT on help-seeking in programming and, more broadly, on collaborative knowledge creation. Our results provide actionable insights for platform operators to support information management and user retention in the aftermath of ChatGPT's launch.</description>

      <title>Beyond Productivity Gaps: Temporal Patterns of Gender Differences in Scientific Knowledge Creation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gender inequality in scientific careers has been extensively documented through aggregate measures such as total publications and cumulative citations, yet the temporal dynamics underlying these disparities remain largely unexplored. Here we developed a multi-dimensional framework to examine gender differences in scientific knowledge creation through three complementary temporal dimensions: stability (consistency of performance over time), volatility (degree of year-to-year fluctuation), and persistence (ability to maintain high performance for extended periods). Using comprehensive bibliometric data from SciSciNet covering 62.5 million authors whose careers began between 1960-2010, we constructed knowledge creation capability measures that captured how scientists absorb knowledge from diverse sources and contribute to field advancement. We found that female scientists demonstrated significantly higher knowledge production stability (0.170 vs. 0.119 for males) while simultaneously exhibiting greater year-to-year volatility (6.606 vs. 6.228), revealing a striking paradox in career dynamics. Female scientists showed persistence advantages under moderate performance requirements but faced disadvantages under extreme criteria demanding sustained peak performance. However, these patterns varied substantially across disciplines, with female advantages strongest in humanities and social sciences while STEM fields show mixed results.</description>

      <title>Synergy, not size: How collaboration architecture shapes scientific disruption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mechanisms driving different types of scientific innovation through collaboration remain poorly understood. Here we develop a comprehensive framework analyzing over 14 million papers across 19 disciplines from 1960 to 2020 to unpack how collaborative synergy shapes research disruption. We introduce the synergy factor to quantify collaboration cost-benefit dynamics, revealing discipline-specific architectures where Physics peaks at medium team sizes while humanities achieve maximal synergy through individual scholarship. Our mediation analysis demonstrates that collaborative synergy, not team size alone, mediates 75% of the relationship between team composition and disruption. Key authors play a catalytic role, with papers featuring exceptional researchers showing 561% higher disruption indices. Surprisingly, high-citation authors reduce disruptive potential while those with breakthrough track records enhance it, challenging traditional evaluation metrics. We identify four distinct knowledge production modes: elite-driven, baseline, heterogeneity-driven, and low-cost. These findings reveal substantial heterogeneity in optimal collaboration strategies across disciplines and provide evidence-based guidance for research organization, with implications for science policy and the design of research institutions in an increasingly collaborative scientific landscape.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-driven Community Resilience Rating based on Intertwined Socio-Technical Systems Features</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.01661v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Community resilience is a complex and muti-faceted phenomenon that emerges from complex and nonlinear interactions among different socio-technical systems and their resilience properties. However, present studies on community resilience focus primarily on vulnerability assessment and utilize index-based approaches, with limited ability to capture heterogeneous features within community socio-technical systems and their nonlinear interactions in shaping robustness, redundancy, and resourcefulness components of resilience. To address this gap, this paper presents an integrated three-layer deep learning model for community resilience rating (called Resili-Net). Twelve measurable resilience features are specified and computed within community socio-technical systems (i.e., facilities, infrastructures, and society) related to three resilience components of robustness, redundancy, and resourcefulness. Using publicly accessible data from multiple metropolitan statistical areas in the United States, Resili-Net characterizes the resilience levels of spatial areas into five distinct levels. The interpretability of the model outcomes enables feature analysis for specifying the determinants of resilience in areas within each resilience level, allowing for the identification of specific resilience enhancement strategies. Changes in community resilience profiles under urban development patterns are further examined by changing the value of related socio-technical systems features. Accordingly, the outcomes provide novel perspectives for community resilience assessment by harnessing machine intelligence and heterogeneous urban big data.</description>

      <title>Destabilizing a Social Network Model via Intrinsic Feedback Vulnerabilities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10868v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Social influence plays a significant role in shaping individual sentiments and actions, particularly in a world of ubiquitous digital interconnection. The rapid development of generative AI has engendered well-founded concerns regarding the potential scalable implementation of radicalization techniques in social media. Motivated by these developments, we present a case study investigating the effects of small but intentional perturbations on a simple social network. We employ Taylor's classic model of social influence and tools from robust control theory (most notably the Dynamical Structure Function (DSF)), to identify perturbations that qualitatively alter the system's behavior while remaining as unobtrusive as possible. We examine two such scenarios: perturbations to an existing link and perturbations that introduce a new link to the network. In each case, we identify destabilizing perturbations of minimal norm and simulate their effects. Remarkably, we find that small but targeted alterations to network structure may lead to the radicalization of all agents, exhibiting the potential for large-scale shifts in collective behavior to be triggered by comparatively minuscule adjustments in social influence. Given that this method of identifying perturbations that are innocuous yet destabilizing applies to any suitable dynamical system, our findings emphasize a need for similar analyses to be carried out on real systems (e.g., real social networks), to identify the places where such dynamics may already exist.</description>

      <title>The Right to Hide: Masking Community Affiliation via Minimal Graph Rewiring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00432v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Protecting privacy in social graphs may require obscuring nodes' membership in sensitive communities. However, doing so without significantly disrupting the underlying graph topology remains a key challenge. In this work, we address the community membership hiding problem, which involves strategically modifying the graph structure to conceal a target node's affiliation with a community, regardless of the detection algorithm used. We reformulate the original discrete, counterfactual graph search objective as a differentiable constrained optimisation task. To this end, we introduce $\nabla$-CMH, a new gradient-based method that operates within a feasible modification budget to minimise structural changes while effectively hiding a node's community membership. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and community detection methods demonstrate that our technique outperforms existing baselines, achieving the best balance between node hiding effectiveness and graph rewiring cost, while preserving computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Estimating Hourly Neighborhood Population Using Mobile Phone Data in the United States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01170v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional population estimation techniques often fail to capture the dynamic fluctuations inherent in urban and rural population movements. Recognizing the need for a high spatiotemporal dynamic population dataset, we propose a method using smartphone-based human mobility data to reconstruct the hourly population for each neighborhood across the US. We quantify population fluctuations on an hourly, diurnal, daily, and seasonal basis, and compare these with static population data to highlight the limitations of traditional models in capturing temporal dynamics. This study is one of the first hourly population products at a large geographic extent (US), contributing to various studies that involve dynamic populations with high spatiotemporal resolution, such as air pollution exposure analysis and emergency response.</description>

      <title>dyGRASS: Dynamic Spectral Graph Sparsification via Localized Random Walks on GPUs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02741v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents dyGRASS, an efficient dynamic algorithm for spectral sparsification of large undirected graphs that undergo streaming edge insertions and deletions. At its core, dyGRASS employs a random-walk-based method to efficiently estimate node-to-node distances in both the original graph (for decremental update) and its sparsifier (for incremental update). For incremental updates, dyGRASS enables the identification of spectrally critical edges among the updates to capture the latest structural changes. For decremental updates, dyGRASS facilitates the recovery of important edges from the original graph back into the sparsifier. To further enhance computational efficiency, dyGRASS employs a GPU-based non-backtracking random walk scheme that allows multiple walkers to operate simultaneously across various target updates. This parallelization significantly improves both the performance and scalability of the proposed dyGRASS framework. Our comprehensive experimental evaluations reveal that dyGRASS achieves approximately a 10x speedup compared to the state-of-the-art incremental sparsification (inGRASS) algorithm while eliminating the setup overhead and improving solution quality in incremental spectral sparsification tasks. Moreover, dyGRASS delivers high efficiency and superior solution quality for fully dynamic graph sparsification, accommodating both edge insertions and deletions across a diverse range of graph instances originating from integrated circuit simulations, finite element analysis, and social networks.</description>

      <title>Towards a general diffusion-based information quality assessment model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13927v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid and unregulated dissemination of information in the digital era has amplified the global "infodemic," complicating the identification of high quality information. We present a lightweight, interpretable and non-invasive framework for assessing information quality based solely on diffusion dynamics, demonstrated here in the context of academic publications. Using a heterogeneous dataset of 29,264 sciences, technology, engineering, mathematics (STEM) and social science papers from ArnetMiner and OpenAlex, we model the diffusion network of each paper as a set of three theoretically motivated features: diversity, timeliness, and salience. A Generalized Additive Model (GAM) trained on these features achieved Pearson correlations of 0.834 for next-year citation gain and up to 95.62% accuracy in predicting high-impact papers. Feature relevance studies reveal timeliness and salience as the most robust predictors, while diversity offers less stable benefits in the academic setting but may be more informative in social media contexts. The framework's transparency, domain-agnostic design, and minimal feature requirements position it as a scalable tool for global information quality assessment, opening new avenues for moving beyond binary credibility labels toward richer, diffusion-informed evaluation metrics.</description>

      <title>Gravity Well Echo Chamber Modeling With An LLM-Based Confirmation Bias Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03832v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Social media echo chambers play a central role in the spread of misinformation, yet existing models often overlook the influence of individual confirmation bias. An existing model of echo chambers is the "gravity well" model, which creates an analog between echo chambers and spatial gravity wells. We extend this established model by introducing a dynamic confirmation bias variable that adjusts the strength of pull based on a user's susceptibility to belief-reinforcing content. This variable is calculated for each user through comparisons between their posting history and their responses to posts of a wide range of viewpoints.
  Incorporating this factor produces a confirmation-bias-integrated gravity well model that more accurately identifies echo chambers and reveals community-level markers of information health. We validated the approach on nineteen Reddit communities, demonstrating improved detection of echo chambers.
  Our contribution is a framework for systematically capturing the role of confirmation bias in online group dynamics, enabling more effective identification of echo chambers. By flagging these high-risk environments, the model supports efforts to curb the spread of misinformation at its most common points of amplification.</description>

      <title>Uncovering complementary information sharing in spider monkey collective foraging using higher-order spatial networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01167v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Collectives are often able to process information in a distributed fashion, surpassing each individual member's processing capacity. In fission-fusion dynamics, where group members come together and split from others often, sharing complementary information about uniquely known foraging areas could allow a group to track a heterogenous foraging environment better than any group member on its own. We analyse the partial overlaps between individual spider monkey core ranges, which we assume represent the knowledge of an individual during a given season. Sets of individuals with complementary overlaps are identified, showing a balance between redundantly and uniquely known portions, and we use simplicial complexes to represent these higher-order interactions. The structure of the simplicial complexes shows holes in various dimensions, revealing complementarity in the foraging information that is being shared. We propose that the complex spatial networks arising from fission-fusion dynamics allow for adaptive, collective processing of foraging information in dynamic environments.</description>
