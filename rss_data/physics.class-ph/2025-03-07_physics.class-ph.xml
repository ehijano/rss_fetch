      <title>Dispersion equation for H modes of a strip line with a circular cylindrical shield</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate the dispersion equation for H modes of a circular waveguide with a perfectly conducting strip of zero thickness placed symmetrically in its diametral plane. The wave number of the lowest mode is calculated with high accuracy for various strip widths. Simple asymptotic formulas are derived for the two extreme cases in which the width of the strip is either small or nearly equal to the diameter of the waveguide.</description>

      <title>The mechanics of the squash nick shot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Squash is a widely popular racket sport, practiced by millions of people worldwide, played inside a walled court. When played well, players can last for several minutes before the ball bounces twice on the floor. There is, however, an unanswerable shot. When the ball hits the nick between a vertical wall and the floor, under certain conditions, it rolls without any vertical bounce. We study this process experimentally. We determined that the ball must hit the vertical wall first at a narrow range of heights above the floor, but most importantly, it must touch the floor before finishing its rolling time on the vertical wall. When the rolling time is shorter than the contact time, the vertical momentum is canceled due to a mechanical frustration condition. This behavior is explained considering a contact model, which agrees with the experimental observations. We argue that this concept could be relevant to the design of rolling shock dampers with many possible practical applications.</description>

      <title>Refraction of light and conservation laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The refraction of light by dispersion-free dielectric media can be modeled using well-localized macroscopic wave packets, enabling a description in terms of pseudo-particles. This approach is often used in thought experiments to illustrate aspects of the Abraham-Minkowski debate. This work uses the particle picture to show at an elementary level how different types of momenta come into play, and how light refraction can be explained at the level of particles. A special exactly solvable microscopic model is used to illustrate the interplay and tension between microscopic physics and the conventional effective-medium Maxwell equations.</description>

      <title>Influence of elastic deformations on body-wave velocity in solids: a case study considering shear deformations in concrete</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the influence of elastic deformation on the velocity of body waves in compressible isotropic materials making use of the framework of acoustoelasticity. Specifically, it examines body waves propagating at an angle to the principal deformation axes, where both shear and normal deformations are present in the coordinate system defined by the wave propagation direction. While numerous efforts have addressed this topic, the theoretical derivations have not yet to provide definitive conclusions about the response of wave velocity to applied shear stresses and strains. To derive more specific conclusions for body waves in concrete, we analyzed three examples using concrete as the medium. The key findings are that, in case of concrete materials when body waves propagate on the shear deformation plane, variations in longitudinal wave velocity are predominantly attributed to changes in normal strains, whereas transverse wave velocity is significantly influenced by both normal and shear strains. This finding can enhance the use of acoustoelasticity for detecting the magnitudes and directions of principal stresses in plane stress state applications.</description>
