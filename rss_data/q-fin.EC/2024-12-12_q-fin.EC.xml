      <title>A Global Minimum Tax for Large Firms Only: Implications for Tax Competition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14302v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Global Minimum Tax (GMT) is applied only to firms above a certain size threshold, permitting countries to set differential tax rates for small and large firms. We analyze tax competition among multiple tax havens and a non-haven country for heterogeneous multinationals to evaluate the effects of this partial coverage of GMT. Upon the introduction of a moderately low GMT rate, the havens commit to the single uniform GMT rate for all multinationals. However, gradual increases in the GMT rate induce the havens, and subsequently the non-haven, to adopt discriminatory, lower tax rates for small multinationals. Our calibration exercise shows that the implementation of a 15% GMT rate results in a regime where only the havens adopt split tax rates. Upon GMT introduction, welfare and tax revenues fall in the tax havens but rise in the non-haven, yielding a positive net gain worldwide.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Company Similarity with Sparse Autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02605v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Determining company similarity is a vital task in finance, underpinning hedging, risk management, portfolio diversification, and more. Practitioners often rely on sector and industry classifications to gauge similarity, such as SIC-codes and GICS-codes - the former being used by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and the latter widely used by the investment community. Since these classifications can lack granularity and often need to be updated, using clusters of embeddings of company descriptions has been proposed as a potential alternative, but the lack of interpretability in token embeddings poses a significant barrier to adoption in high-stakes contexts. Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have shown promise in enhancing the interpretability of Large Language Models (LLMs) by decomposing LLM activations into interpretable features. We apply SAEs to company descriptions, obtaining meaningful clusters of equities in the process. We benchmark SAE features against SIC-codes, Major Group codes, and Embeddings. Our results demonstrate that SAE features not only replicate but often surpass sector classifications and embeddings in capturing fundamental company characteristics. This is evidenced by their superior performance in correlating monthly returns - a proxy for similarity - and generating higher Sharpe ratio co-integration strategies, which underscores deeper fundamental similarities among companies.</description>
