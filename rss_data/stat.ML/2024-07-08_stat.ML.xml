      <title>Feature-Specific Coefficients of Determination in Tree Ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tree ensemble methods provide promising predictions with models difficult to interpret. Recent introduction of Shapley values for individualized feature contributions, accompanied with several fast computing algorithms for predicted values, shows intriguing results. However, individualizing coefficients of determination, aka $R^2$, for each feature is challenged by the underlying quadratic losses, although these coefficients allow us to comparatively assess single feature's contribution to tree ensembles. Here we propose an efficient algorithm, Q-SHAP, that reduces the computational complexity to polynomial time when calculating Shapley values related to quadratic losses. Our extensive simulation studies demonstrate that this approach not only enhances computational efficiency but also improves estimation accuracy of feature-specific coefficients of determination.</description>

      <title>Optimal thresholds and algorithms for a model of multi-modal learning in high dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work explores multi-modal inference in a high-dimensional simplified model, analytically quantifying the performance gain of multi-modal inference over that of analyzing modalities in isolation. We present the Bayes-optimal performance and weak recovery thresholds in a model where the objective is to recover the latent structures from two noisy data matrices with correlated spikes. The paper derives the approximate message passing (AMP) algorithm for this model and characterizes its performance in the high-dimensional limit via the associated state evolution. The analysis holds for a broad range of priors and noise channels, which can differ across modalities. The linearization of AMP is compared numerically to the widely used partial least squares (PLS) and canonical correlation analysis (CCA) methods, which are both observed to suffer from a sub-optimal recovery threshold.</description>

      <title>An Axiomatic Definition of Hierarchical Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we take an axiomatic approach to defining a population hierarchical clustering for piecewise constant densities, and in a similar manner to Lebesgue integration, extend this definition to more general densities. When the density satisfies some mild conditions, e.g., when it has connected support, is continuous, and vanishes only at infinity, or when the connected components of the density satisfy these conditions, our axiomatic definition results in Hartigan's definition of cluster tree.</description>

      <title>Geodesic Optimization for Predictive Shift Adaptation on EEG data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) data is often collected from diverse contexts involving different populations and EEG devices. This variability can induce distribution shifts in the data $X$ and in the biomedical variables of interest $y$, thus limiting the application of supervised machine learning (ML) algorithms. While domain adaptation (DA) methods have been developed to mitigate the impact of these shifts, such methods struggle when distribution shifts occur simultaneously in $X$ and $y$. As state-of-the-art ML models for EEG represent the data by spatial covariance matrices, which lie on the Riemannian manifold of Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrices, it is appealing to study DA techniques operating on the SPD manifold. This paper proposes a novel method termed Geodesic Optimization for Predictive Shift Adaptation (GOPSA) to address test-time multi-source DA for situations in which source domains have distinct $y$ distributions. GOPSA exploits the geodesic structure of the Riemannian manifold to jointly learn a domain-specific re-centering operator representing site-specific intercepts and the regression model. We performed empirical benchmarks on the cross-site generalization of age-prediction models with resting-state EEG data from a large multi-national dataset (HarMNqEEG), which included $14$ recording sites and more than $1500$ human participants. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, our results showed that GOPSA achieved significantly higher performance on three regression metrics ($R^2$, MAE, and Spearman's $\rho$) for several source-target site combinations, highlighting its effectiveness in tackling multi-source DA with predictive shifts in EEG data analysis. Our method has the potential to combine the advantages of mixed-effects modeling with machine learning for biomedical applications of EEG, such as multicenter clinical trials.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning for Complex Systems with Abnormal Pattern by Exception Maximization Outlier Detection Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel fast online methodology for outlier detection called the exception maximization outlier detection method(EMODM), which employs probabilistic models and statistical algorithms to detect abnormal patterns from the outputs of complex systems. The EMODM is based on a two-state Gaussian mixture model and demonstrates strong performance in probability anomaly detection working on real-time raw data rather than using special prior distribution information. We confirm this using the synthetic data from two numerical cases. For the real-world data, we have detected the short circuit pattern of the circuit system using EMODM by the current and voltage output of a three-phase inverter. The EMODM also found an abnormal period due to COVID-19 in the insured unemployment data of 53 regions in the United States from 2000 to 2024. The application of EMODM to these two real-life datasets demonstrated the effectiveness and accuracy of our algorithm.</description>

      <title>Linear causal disentanglement via higher-order cumulants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linear causal disentanglement is a recent method in causal representation learning to describe a collection of observed variables via latent variables with causal dependencies between them. It can be viewed as a generalization of both independent component analysis and linear structural equation models. We study the identifiability of linear causal disentanglement, assuming access to data under multiple contexts, each given by an intervention on a latent variable. We show that one perfect intervention on each latent variable is sufficient and in the worst case necessary to recover parameters under perfect interventions, generalizing previous work to allow more latent than observed variables. We give a constructive proof that computes parameters via a coupled tensor decomposition. For soft interventions, we find the equivalence class of latent graphs and parameters that are consistent with observed data, via the study of a system of polynomial equations. Our results hold assuming the existence of non-zero higher-order cumulants, which implies non-Gaussianity of variables.</description>

      <title>missForestPredict -- Missing data imputation for prediction settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Prediction models are used to predict an outcome based on input variables. Missing data in input variables often occurs at model development and at prediction time. The missForestPredict R package proposes an adaptation of the missForest imputation algorithm that is fast, user-friendly and tailored for prediction settings. The algorithm iteratively imputes variables using random forests until a convergence criterion (unified for continuous and categorical variables and based on the out-of-bag error) is met. The imputation models are saved for each variable and iteration and can be applied later to new observations at prediction time. The missForestPredict package offers extended error monitoring, control over variables used in the imputation and custom initialization. This allows users to tailor the imputation to their specific needs. The missForestPredict algorithm is compared to mean/mode imputation, linear regression imputation, mice, k-nearest neighbours, bagging, miceRanger and IterativeImputer on eight simulated datasets with simulated missingness (48 scenarios) and eight large public datasets using different prediction models. missForestPredict provides competitive results in prediction settings within short computation times.</description>

      <title>Continuous Optimization for Offline Change Point Detection and Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work explores use of novel advances in best subset selection for regression modelling via continuous optimization for offline change point detection and estimation in univariate Gaussian data sequences. The approach exploits reformulating the normal mean multiple change point model into a regularized statistical inverse problem enforcing sparsity. After introducing the problem statement, criteria and previous investigations via Lasso-regularization, the recently developed framework of continuous optimization for best subset selection (COMBSS) is briefly introduced and related to the problem at hand. Supervised and unsupervised perspectives are explored with the latter testing different approaches for the choice of regularization penalty parameters via the discrepancy principle and a confidence bound. The main result is an adaptation and evaluation of the COMBSS approach for offline normal mean multiple change-point detection via experimental results on simulated data for different choices of regularisation parameters. Results and future directions are discussed.</description>

      <title>A Deterministic Information Bottleneck Method for Clustering Mixed-Type Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an information-theoretic method for clustering mixed-type data, that is, data consisting of both continuous and categorical variables. The method is a variant of the Deterministic Information Bottleneck algorithm which optimally compresses the data while retaining relevant information about the underlying structure. We compare the performance of the proposed method to that of three well-established clustering methods (KAMILA, K-Prototypes, and Partitioning Around Medoids with Gower's dissimilarity) on simulated and real-world datasets. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach represents a competitive alternative to conventional clustering techniques under specific conditions.</description>

      <title>Decision-Focused Evaluation of Worst-Case Distribution Shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Distribution shift is a key challenge for predictive models in practice, creating the need to identify potentially harmful shifts in advance of deployment. Existing work typically defines these worst-case shifts as ones that most degrade the individual-level accuracy of the model. However, when models are used to make a downstream population-level decision like the allocation of a scarce resource, individual-level accuracy may be a poor proxy for performance on the task at hand. We introduce a novel framework that employs a hierarchical model structure to identify worst-case distribution shifts in predictive resource allocation settings by capturing shifts both within and across instances of the decision problem. This task is more difficult than in standard distribution shift settings due to combinatorial interactions, where decisions depend on the joint presence of individuals in the allocation task. We show that the problem can be reformulated as a submodular optimization problem, enabling efficient approximations of worst-case loss. Applying our framework to real data, we find empirical evidence that worst-case shifts identified by one metric often significantly diverge from worst-case distributions identified by other metrics.</description>

      <title>A Fully Parameter-Free Second-Order Algorithm for Convex-Concave Minimax Problems with Optimal Iteration Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study second-order algorithms for the convex-concave minimax problem, which has attracted much attention in many fields such as machine learning in recent years. We propose a Lipschitz-free cubic regularization (LF-CR) algorithm for solving the convex-concave minimax optimization problem without knowing the Lipschitz constant. It can be shown that the iteration complexity of the LF-CR algorithm to obtain an $\epsilon$-optimal solution with respect to the restricted primal-dual gap is upper bounded by $\mathcal{O}(\frac{\rho\|z^0-z^*\|^3}{\epsilon})^{\frac{2}{3}}$, where $z^0=(x^0,y^0)$ is a pair of initial points, $z^*=(x^*,y^*)$ is a pair of optimal solutions, and $\rho$ is the Lipschitz constant. We further propose a fully parameter-free cubic regularization (FF-CR) algorithm that does not require any parameters of the problem, including the Lipschitz constant and the upper bound of the distance from the initial point to the optimal solution. We also prove that the iteration complexity of the FF-CR algorithm to obtain an $\epsilon$-optimal solution with respect to the gradient norm is upper bounded by $\mathcal{O}(\frac{\rho\|z^0-z^*\|^2}{\epsilon})^{\frac{2}{3}}$. Numerical experiments show the efficiency of both algorithms. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed FF-CR algorithm is the first completely parameter-free second-order algorithm for solving convex-concave minimax optimization problems, and its iteration complexity is consistent with the optimal iteration complexity lower bound of existing second-order algorithms with parameters for solving convex-concave minimax problems.</description>

      <title>When can weak latent factors be statistically inferred?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article establishes a new and comprehensive estimation and inference theory for principal component analysis (PCA) under the weak factor model that allow for cross-sectional dependent idiosyncratic components under nearly minimal the factor strength relative to the noise level or signal-to-noise ratio. Our theory is applicable regardless of the relative growth rate between the cross-sectional dimension $N$ and temporal dimension $T$. This more realistic assumption and noticeable result requires completely new technical device, as the commonly-used leave-one-out trick is no longer applicable to the case with cross-sectional dependence. Another notable advancement of our theory is on PCA inference $ - $ for example, under the regime where $N\asymp T$, we show that the asymptotic normality for the PCA-based estimator holds as long as the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) grows faster than a polynomial rate of $\log N$. This finding significantly surpasses prior work that required a polynomial rate of $N$. Our theory is entirely non-asymptotic, offering finite-sample characterizations for both the estimation error and the uncertainty level of statistical inference. A notable technical innovation is our closed-form first-order approximation of PCA-based estimator, which paves the way for various statistical tests. Furthermore, we apply our theories to design easy-to-implement statistics for validating whether given factors fall in the linear spans of unknown latent factors, testing structural breaks in the factor loadings for an individual unit, checking whether two units have the same risk exposures, and constructing confidence intervals for systematic risks. Our empirical studies uncover insightful correlations between our test results and economic cycles.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous Hypergraph Embedding for Recommendation Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in recommender systems have focused on integrating knowledge graphs (KGs) to leverage their auxiliary information. The core idea of KG-enhanced recommenders is to incorporate rich semantic information for more accurate recommendations. However, two main challenges persist: i) Neglecting complex higher-order interactions in the KG-based user-item network, potentially leading to sub-optimal recommendations, and ii) Dealing with the heterogeneous modalities of input sources, such as user-item bipartite graphs and KGs, which may introduce noise and inaccuracies. To address these issues, we present a novel Knowledge-enhanced Heterogeneous Hypergraph Recommender System (KHGRec). KHGRec captures group-wise characteristics of both the interaction network and the KG, modeling complex connections in the KG. Using a collaborative knowledge heterogeneous hypergraph (CKHG), it employs two hypergraph encoders to model group-wise interdependencies and ensure explainability. Additionally, it fuses signals from the input graphs with cross-view self-supervised learning and attention mechanisms. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets show our model's superiority over various state-of-the-art baselines, with an average 5.18\% relative improvement. Additional tests on noise resilience, missing data, and cold-start problems demonstrate the robustness of our KHGRec framework. Our model and evaluation datasets are publicly available at \url{https://github.com/viethungvu1998/KHGRec}.</description>

      <title>Robust CATE Estimation Using Novel Ensemble Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03690v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The estimation of Conditional Average Treatment Effects (CATE) is crucial for understanding the heterogeneity of treatment effects in clinical trials. We evaluate the performance of common methods, including causal forests and various meta-learners, across a diverse set of scenarios revealing that each of the methods fails in one or more of the tested scenarios. Given the inherent uncertainty of the data-generating process in real-life scenarios, the robustness of a CATE estimator to various scenarios is critical for its reliability.
  To address this limitation of existing methods, we propose two new ensemble methods that integrate multiple estimators to enhance prediction stability and performance - Stacked X-Learner which uses the X-Learner with model stacking for estimating the nuisance functions, and Consensus Based Averaging (CBA), which averages only the models with highest internal agreement. We show that these models achieve good performance across a wide range of scenarios varying in complexity, sample size and structure of the underlying-mechanism, including a biologically driven model for PD-L1 inhibition pathway for cancer treatment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A core objective of physical design is to minimize wirelength (WL) when placing chip components on a canvas. Computing the minimal WL of a placement requires finding rectilinear Steiner minimum trees (RSMTs), an NP-hard problem. We propose NeuroSteiner, a neural model that distills GeoSteiner, an optimal RSMT solver, to navigate the cost--accuracy frontier of WL estimation. NeuroSteiner is trained on synthesized nets labeled by GeoSteiner, alleviating the need to train on real chip designs. Moreover, NeuroSteiner's differentiability allows to place by minimizing WL through gradient descent. On ISPD 2005 and 2019, NeuroSteiner can obtain 0.3% WL error while being 60% faster than GeoSteiner, or 0.2% and 30%.</description>

Abstract: Given the ubiquity of modularity in biological systems, module-level regulation analysis is vital for understanding biological systems across various levels and their dynamics. Current statistical analysis on biological modules predominantly focuses on either detecting the functional modules in biological networks or sub-group regression on the biological features without using the network data. This paper proposes a novel network-based neighborhood regression framework whose regression functions depend on both the global community-level information and local connectivity structures among entities. An efficient community-wise least square optimization approach is developed to uncover the strength of regulation among the network modules while enabling asymptotic inference. With random graph theory, we derive non-asymptotic estimation error bounds for the proposed estimator, achieving exact minimax optimality. Unlike the root-n consistency typical in canonical linear regression, our model exhibits linear consistency in the number of nodes n, highlighting the advantage of incorporating neighborhood information. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is further supported by extensive numerical experiments. Application to whole-exome sequencing and RNA-sequencing Autism datasets demonstrates the usage of the proposed method in identifying the association between the gene modules of genetic variations and the gene modules of genomic differential expressions.</description>

      <title>Predictive Coding Networks and Inference Learning: Tutorial and Survey</title>

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed a growing call for renewed emphasis on neuroscience-inspired approaches in artificial intelligence research, under the banner of $\textit{NeuroAI}$. This is exemplified by recent attention gained by predictive coding networks (PCNs) within machine learning (ML). PCNs are based on the neuroscientific framework of predictive coding (PC), which views the brain as a hierarchical Bayesian inference model that minimizes prediction errors from feedback connections. PCNs trained with inference learning (IL) have potential advantages to traditional feedforward neural networks (FNNs) trained with backpropagation. While historically more computationally intensive, recent improvements in IL have shown that it can be more efficient than backpropagation with sufficient parallelization, making PCNs promising alternatives for large-scale applications and neuromorphic hardware. Moreover, PCNs can be mathematically considered as a superset of traditional FNNs, which substantially extends the range of possible architectures for both supervised and unsupervised learning. In this work, we provide a comprehensive review as well as a formal specification of PCNs, in particular placing them in the context of modern ML methods, and positioning PC as a versatile and promising framework worthy of further study by the ML community.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Prediction Consistency Under Model Multiplicity in Tabular LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on limited tabular data for classification tasks can lead to \textit{fine-tuning multiplicity}, where equally well-performing models make conflicting predictions on the same inputs due to variations in the training process (i.e., seed, random weight initialization, retraining on additional or deleted samples). This raises critical concerns about the robustness and reliability of Tabular LLMs, particularly when deployed for high-stakes decision-making, such as finance, hiring, education, healthcare, etc. This work formalizes the challenge of fine-tuning multiplicity in Tabular LLMs and proposes a novel metric to quantify the robustness of individual predictions without expensive model retraining. Our metric quantifies a prediction's stability by analyzing (sampling) the model's local behavior around the input in the embedding space. Interestingly, we show that sampling in the local neighborhood can be leveraged to provide probabilistic robustness guarantees against a broad class of fine-tuned models. By leveraging Bernstein's Inequality, we show that predictions with sufficiently high robustness (as defined by our measure) will remain consistent with high probability. We also provide empirical evaluation on real-world datasets to support our theoretical results. Our work highlights the importance of addressing fine-tuning instabilities to enable trustworthy deployment of LLMs in high-stakes and safety-critical applications.</description>

      <title>Speed-accuracy trade-off for the diffusion models: Wisdom from nonequilibrium thermodynamics and optimal transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04495v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss a connection between a generative model, called the diffusion model, and nonequilibrium thermodynamics for the Fokker-Planck equation, called stochastic thermodynamics. Based on the techniques of stochastic thermodynamics, we derive the speed-accuracy trade-off for the diffusion models, which is a trade-off relationship between the speed and accuracy of data generation in diffusion models. Our result implies that the entropy production rate in the forward process affects the errors in data generation. From a stochastic thermodynamic perspective, our results provide quantitative insight into how best to generate data in diffusion models. The optimal learning protocol is introduced by the conservative force in stochastic thermodynamics and the geodesic of space by the 2-Wasserstein distance in optimal transport theory. We numerically illustrate the validity of the speed-accuracy trade-off for the diffusion models with different noise schedules such as the cosine schedule, the conditional optimal transport, and the optimal transport.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Gains from Repeated Self-Distillation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-Distillation is a special type of knowledge distillation where the student model has the same architecture as the teacher model. Despite using the same architecture and the same training data, self-distillation has been empirically observed to improve performance, especially when applied repeatedly. For such a process, there is a fundamental question of interest: How much gain is possible by applying multiple steps of self-distillation? To investigate this relative gain, we propose studying the simple but canonical task of linear regression. Our analysis shows that the excess risk achieved by multi-step self-distillation can significantly improve upon a single step of self-distillation, reducing the excess risk by a factor as large as $d$, where $d$ is the input dimension. Empirical results on regression tasks from the UCI repository show a reduction in the learnt model's risk (MSE) by up to 47%.</description>

      <title>Robust Validation: Confident Predictions Even When Distributions Shift</title>

      <description>arXiv:2008.04267v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While the traditional viewpoint in machine learning and statistics assumes training and testing samples come from the same population, practice belies this fiction. One strategy -- coming from robust statistics and optimization -- is thus to build a model robust to distributional perturbations. In this paper, we take a different approach to describe procedures for robust predictive inference, where a model provides uncertainty estimates on its predictions rather than point predictions. We present a method that produces prediction sets (almost exactly) giving the right coverage level for any test distribution in an $f$-divergence ball around the training population. The method, based on conformal inference, achieves (nearly) valid coverage in finite samples, under only the condition that the training data be exchangeable. An essential component of our methodology is to estimate the amount of expected future data shift and build robustness to it; we develop estimators and prove their consistency for protection and validity of uncertainty estimates under shifts. By experimenting on several large-scale benchmark datasets, including Recht et al.'s CIFAR-v4 and ImageNet-V2 datasets, we provide complementary empirical results that highlight the importance of robust predictive validity.</description>

      <title>Kernel Ridge Riesz Representers: Generalization, Mis-specification, and the Counterfactual Effective Dimension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2102.11076v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kernel balancing weights provide confidence intervals for average treatment effects, based on the idea of balancing covariates for the treated group and untreated group in feature space, often with ridge regularization. Previous works on the classical kernel ridge balancing weights have certain limitations: (i) not articulating generalization error for the balancing weights, (ii) typically requiring correct specification of features, and (iii) justifying Gaussian approximation for only average effects.
  I interpret kernel balancing weights as kernel ridge Riesz representers (KRRR) and address these limitations via a new characterization of the counterfactual effective dimension. KRRR is an exact generalization of kernel ridge regression and kernel ridge balancing weights. I prove strong properties similar to kernel ridge regression: population $L_2$ rates controlling generalization error, and a standalone closed form solution that can interpolate. The framework relaxes the stringent assumption that the underlying regression model is correctly specified by the features. It extends Gaussian approximation beyond average effects to heterogeneous effects, justifying confidence sets for causal functions. I use KRRR to quantify uncertainty for heterogeneous treatment effects, by age, of 401(k) eligibility on assets.</description>

      <title>Contrastive Neural Ratio Estimation for Simulation-based Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.06170v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Likelihood-to-evidence ratio estimation is usually cast as either a binary (NRE-A) or a multiclass (NRE-B) classification task. In contrast to the binary classification framework, the current formulation of the multiclass version has an intrinsic and unknown bias term, making otherwise informative diagnostics unreliable. We propose a multiclass framework free from the bias inherent to NRE-B at optimum, leaving us in the position to run diagnostics that practitioners depend on. It also recovers NRE-A in one corner case and NRE-B in the limiting case. For fair comparison, we benchmark the behavior of all algorithms in both familiar and novel training regimes: when jointly drawn data is unlimited, when data is fixed but prior draws are unlimited, and in the commonplace fixed data and parameters setting. Our investigations reveal that the highest performing models are distant from the competitors (NRE-A, NRE-B) in hyperparameter space. We make a recommendation for hyperparameters distinct from the previous models. We suggest two bounds on the mutual information as performance metrics for simulation-based inference methods, without the need for posterior samples, and provide experimental results. This version corrects a minor implementation error in $\gamma$, improving results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.13451v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel approach for finding multiple noisily embedded template graphs in a very large background graph. Our method builds upon the graph-matching-matched-filter technique proposed in Sussman et al., with the discovery of multiple diverse matchings being achieved by iteratively penalizing a suitable node-pair similarity matrix in the matched filter algorithm. In addition, we propose algorithmic speed-ups that greatly enhance the scalability of our matched-filter approach. We present theoretical justification of our methodology in the setting of correlated Erdos-Renyi graphs, showing its ability to sequentially discover multiple templates under mild model conditions. We additionally demonstrate our method's utility via extensive experiments both using simulated models and real-world dataset, include human brain connectomes and a large transactional knowledge base.</description>

      <title>Implicit regularization of deep residual networks towards neural ODEs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.01213v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Residual neural networks are state-of-the-art deep learning models. Their continuous-depth analog, neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs), are also widely used. Despite their success, the link between the discrete and continuous models still lacks a solid mathematical foundation. In this article, we take a step in this direction by establishing an implicit regularization of deep residual networks towards neural ODEs, for nonlinear networks trained with gradient flow. We prove that if the network is initialized as a discretization of a neural ODE, then such a discretization holds throughout training. Our results are valid for a finite training time, and also as the training time tends to infinity provided that the network satisfies a Polyak-Lojasiewicz condition. Importantly, this condition holds for a family of residual networks where the residuals are two-layer perceptrons with an overparameterization in width that is only linear, and implies the convergence of gradient flow to a global minimum. Numerical experiments illustrate our results.</description>

      <title>Convergence of flow-based generative models via proximal gradient descent in Wasserstein space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.17582v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Flow-based generative models enjoy certain advantages in computing the data generation and the likelihood, and have recently shown competitive empirical performance. Compared to the accumulating theoretical studies on related score-based diffusion models, analysis of flow-based models, which are deterministic in both forward (data-to-noise) and reverse (noise-to-data) directions, remain sparse. In this paper, we provide a theoretical guarantee of generating data distribution by a progressive flow model, the so-called JKO flow model, which implements the Jordan-Kinderleherer-Otto (JKO) scheme in a normalizing flow network. Leveraging the exponential convergence of the proximal gradient descent (GD) in Wasserstein space, we prove the Kullback-Leibler (KL) guarantee of data generation by a JKO flow model to be $O(\varepsilon^2)$ when using $N \lesssim \log (1/\varepsilon)$ many JKO steps ($N$ Residual Blocks in the flow) where $\varepsilon $ is the error in the per-step first-order condition. The assumption on data density is merely a finite second moment, and the theory extends to data distributions without density and when there are inversion errors in the reverse process where we obtain KL-$W_2$ mixed error guarantees. The non-asymptotic convergence rate of the JKO-type $W_2$-proximal GD is proved for a general class of convex objective functionals that includes the KL divergence as a special case, which can be of independent interest. The analysis framework can extend to other first-order Wasserstein optimization schemes applied to flow-based generative models.</description>

      <title>Deep Copula-Based Survival Analysis for Dependent Censoring with Identifiability Guarantees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15566v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Censoring is the central problem in survival analysis where either the time-to-event (for instance, death), or the time-tocensoring (such as loss of follow-up) is observed for each sample. The majority of existing machine learning-based survival analysis methods assume that survival is conditionally independent of censoring given a set of covariates; an assumption that cannot be verified since only marginal distributions is available from the data. The existence of dependent censoring, along with the inherent bias in current estimators has been demonstrated in a variety of applications, accentuating the need for a more nuanced approach. However, existing methods that adjust for dependent censoring require practitioners to specify the ground truth copula. This requirement poses a significant challenge for practical applications, as model misspecification can lead to substantial bias. In this work, we propose a flexible deep learning-based survival analysis method that simultaneously accommodate for dependent censoring and eliminates the requirement for specifying the ground truth copula. We theoretically prove the identifiability of our model under a broad family of copulas and survival distributions. Experiments results from a wide range of datasets demonstrate that our approach successfully discerns the underlying dependency structure and significantly reduces survival estimation bias when compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Statistical Theory of Deep Learning: Approximation, Training Dynamics, and Generative Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07187v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we review the literature on statistical theories of neural networks from three perspectives. In the first part, results on excess risks for neural networks are reviewed in the nonparametric framework of regression or classification. These results rely on explicit constructions of neural networks, leading to fast convergence rates of excess risks, in that tools from the approximation theory are adopted. Through these constructions, the width and depth of the networks can be expressed in terms of sample size, data dimension, and function smoothness. Nonetheless, their underlying analysis only applies to the global minimizer in the highly non-convex landscape of deep neural networks. This motivates us to review the training dynamics of neural networks in the second part. Specifically, we review papers that attempt to answer ``how the neural network trained via gradient-based methods finds the solution that can generalize well on unseen data.'' In particular, two well-known paradigms are reviewed: the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) paradigm, and Mean-Field (MF) paradigm. In the last part, we review the most recent theoretical advancements in generative models including Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), diffusion models, and in-context learning (ICL) in the Large Language Models (LLMs). The former two models are known to be the main pillars of the modern generative AI era, while ICL is a strong capability of LLMs in learning from a few examples in the context. Finally, we conclude the paper by suggesting several promising directions for deep learning theory.</description>

      <title>The $s$-value: evaluating stability with respect to distributional shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.03067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.03067v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Common statistical measures of uncertainty such as $p$-values and confidence intervals quantify the uncertainty due to sampling, that is, the uncertainty due to not observing the full population. However, sampling is not the only source of uncertainty. In practice, distributions change between locations and across time. This makes it difficult to gather knowledge that transfers across data sets. We propose a measure of instability that quantifies the distributional instability of a statistical parameter with respect to Kullback-Leibler divergence, that is, the sensitivity of the parameter under general distributional perturbations within a Kullback-Leibler divergence ball. In addition, we quantify the instability of parameters with respect to directional or variable-specific shifts. Measuring instability with respect to directional shifts can be used to detect the type of shifts a parameter is sensitive to. We discuss how such knowledge can inform data collection for improved estimation of statistical parameters under shifted distributions. We evaluate the performance of the proposed measure on real data and show that it can elucidate the distributional instability of a parameter with respect to certain shifts and can be used to improve estimation accuracy under shifted distributions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2205.06297v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an algorithm for next query recommendation in interactive data exploration settings, like knowledge discovery for information gathering. The state-of-the-art query recommendation algorithms are based on sequence-to-sequence learning approaches that exploit historical interaction data. Due to the supervision involved in the learning process, such approaches fail to adapt to immediate user feedback. We propose to augment the transformer-based causal language models for query recommendations to adapt to the immediate user feedback using multi-armed bandit (MAB) framework. We conduct a large-scale experimental study using log files from a popular online literature discovery service and demonstrate that our algorithm improves the per-round regret substantially, with respect to the state-of-the-art transformer-based query recommendation models, which do not make use of immediate user feedback.

      <description>arXiv:2206.03441v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of high-dimensional sparse mean estimation in the presence of an $\epsilon$-fraction of adversarial outliers. Prior work obtained sample and computationally efficient algorithms for this task for identity-covariance subgaussian distributions. In this work, we develop the first efficient algorithms for robust sparse mean estimation without a priori knowledge of the covariance. For distributions on $\mathbb R^d$ with "certifiably bounded" $t$-th moments and sufficiently light tails, our algorithm achieves error of $O(\epsilon^{1-1/t})$ with sample complexity $m = (k\log(d))^{O(t)}/\epsilon^{2-2/t}$. For the special case of the Gaussian distribution, our algorithm achieves near-optimal error of $\tilde O(\epsilon)$ with sample complexity $m = O(k^4 \mathrm{polylog}(d))/\epsilon^2$. Our algorithms follow the Sum-of-Squares based, proofs to algorithms approach. We complement our upper bounds with Statistical Query and low-degree polynomial testing lower bounds, providing evidence that the sample-time-error tradeoffs achieved by our algorithms are qualitatively the best possible.</description>

      <title>List-Decodable Sparse Mean Estimation via Difference-of-Pairs Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.05245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.05245v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of list-decodable sparse mean estimation. Specifically, for a parameter $\alpha \in (0, 1/2)$, we are given $m$ points in $\mathbb{R}^n$, $\lfloor \alpha m \rfloor$ of which are i.i.d. samples from a distribution $D$ with unknown $k$-sparse mean $\mu$. No assumptions are made on the remaining points, which form the majority of the dataset. The goal is to return a small list of candidates containing a vector $\widehat \mu$ such that $\| \widehat \mu - \mu \|_2$ is small. Prior work had studied the problem of list-decodable mean estimation in the dense setting. In this work, we develop a novel, conceptually simpler technique for list-decodable mean estimation. As the main application of our approach, we provide the first sample and computationally efficient algorithm for list-decodable sparse mean estimation. In particular, for distributions with "certifiably bounded" $t$-th moments in $k$-sparse directions and sufficiently light tails, our algorithm achieves error of $(1/\alpha)^{O(1/t)}$ with sample complexity $m = (k\log(n))^{O(t)}/\alpha$ and running time $\mathrm{poly}(mn^t)$. For the special case of Gaussian inliers, our algorithm achieves the optimal error guarantee of $\Theta (\sqrt{\log(1/\alpha)})$ with quasi-polynomial sample and computational complexity. We complement our upper bounds with nearly-matching statistical query and low-degree polynomial testing lower bounds.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Rank and Reward: A Scalable Model for Slate Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.06263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.06263v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Probabilistic Rank and Reward (PRR), a scalable probabilistic model for personalized slate recommendation. Our approach allows off-policy estimation of the reward in the scenario where the user interacts with at most one item from a slate of K items. We show that the probability of a slate being successful can be learned efficiently by combining the reward, whether the user successfully interacted with the slate, and the rank, the item that was selected within the slate. PRR outperforms existing off-policy reward optimizing methods and is far more scalable to large action spaces. Moreover, PRR allows fast delivery of recommendations powered by maximum inner product search (MIPS), making it suitable in low latency domains such as computational advertising.</description>

      <title>High-dimensional variable clustering based on maxima of a weakly dependent random process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.00934v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new class of models for variable clustering called Asymptotic Independent block (AI-block) models, which defines population-level clusters based on the independence of the maxima of a multivariate stationary mixing random process among clusters. This class of models is identifiable, meaning that there exists a maximal element with a partial order between partitions, allowing for statistical inference. We also present an algorithm depending on a tuning parameter that recovers the clusters of variables without specifying the number of clusters \emph{a priori}. Our work provides some theoretical insights into the consistency of our algorithm, demonstrating that under certain conditions it can effectively identify clusters in the data with a computational complexity that is polynomial in the dimension. A data-driven selection method for the tuning parameter is also proposed. To further illustrate the significance of our work, we applied our method to neuroscience and environmental real-datasets. These applications highlight the potential and versatility of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Engression: Extrapolation through the Lens of Distributional Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.00835v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Distributional regression aims to estimate the full conditional distribution of a target variable, given covariates. Popular methods include linear and tree-ensemble based quantile regression. We propose a neural network-based distributional regression methodology called `engression'. An engression model is generative in the sense that we can sample from the fitted conditional distribution and is also suitable for high-dimensional outcomes. Furthermore, we find that modelling the conditional distribution on training data can constrain the fitted function outside of the training support, which offers a new perspective to the challenging extrapolation problem in nonlinear regression. In particular, for `pre-additive noise' models, where noise is added to the covariates before applying a nonlinear transformation, we show that engression can successfully perform extrapolation under some assumptions such as monotonicity, whereas traditional regression approaches such as least-squares or quantile regression fall short under the same assumptions. Our empirical results, from both simulated and real data, validate the effectiveness of the engression method and indicate that the pre-additive noise model is typically suitable for many real-world scenarios. The software implementations of engression are available in both R and Python.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10923v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses second-order stochastic optimization for estimating the minimizer of a convex function written as an expectation. A direct recursive estimation technique for the inverse Hessian matrix using a Robbins-Monro procedure is introduced. This approach enables to drastically reduces computational complexity. Above all, it allows to develop universal stochastic Newton methods and investigate the asymptotic efficiency of the proposed approach. This work so expands the application scope of secondorder algorithms in stochastic optimization.</description>

      <title>On Temperature Scaling and Conformal Prediction of Deep Classifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05806v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In many classification applications, the prediction of a deep neural network (DNN) based classifier needs to be accompanied by some confidence indication. Two popular approaches for that aim are: 1) Calibration: modifies the classifier's softmax values such that the maximal value better estimates the correctness probability; and 2) Conformal Prediction (CP): produces a prediction set of candidate labels that contains the true label with a user-specified probability, guaranteeing marginal coverage, rather than, e.g., per class coverage. In practice, both types of indications are desirable, yet, so far the interplay between them has not been investigated. We start this paper with an extensive empirical study of the effect of the popular Temperature Scaling (TS) calibration on prominent CP methods and reveal that while it improves the class-conditional coverage of adaptive CP methods, surprisingly, it negatively affects their prediction set sizes. Subsequently, we explore the effect of TS beyond its calibration application and offer simple guidelines for practitioners to trade prediction set size and conditional coverage of adaptive CP methods while effectively combining them with calibration. Finally, we present a theoretical analysis of the effect of TS on the prediction set sizes, revealing several mathematical properties of the procedure, according to which we provide reasoning for this unintuitive phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Sampling from the Mean-Field Stationary Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07355v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the complexity of sampling from the stationary distribution of a mean-field SDE, or equivalently, the complexity of minimizing a functional over the space of probability measures which includes an interaction term. Our main insight is to decouple the two key aspects of this problem: (1) approximation of the mean-field SDE via a finite-particle system, via uniform-in-time propagation of chaos, and (2) sampling from the finite-particle stationary distribution, via standard log-concave samplers. Our approach is conceptually simpler and its flexibility allows for incorporating the state-of-the-art for both algorithms and theory. This leads to improved guarantees in numerous settings, including better guarantees for optimizing certain two-layer neural networks in the mean-field regime. A key technical contribution is to establish a new uniform-in-$N$ log-Sobolev inequality for the stationary distribution of the mean-field Langevin dynamics.</description>

      <title>LoRA+: Efficient Low Rank Adaptation of Large Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12354v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) as originally introduced in Hu et al. (2021) leads to suboptimal finetuning of models with large width (embedding dimension). This is due to the fact that adapter matrices A and B in LoRA are updated with the same learning rate. Using scaling arguments for large width networks, we demonstrate that using the same learning rate for A and B does not allow efficient feature learning. We then show that this suboptimality of LoRA can be corrected simply by setting different learning rates for the LoRA adapter matrices A and B with a well-chosen ratio. We call this proposed algorithm LoRA$+$. In our extensive experiments, LoRA$+$ improves performance (1-2 $\%$ improvements) and finetuning speed (up to $\sim$ 2X SpeedUp), at the same computational cost as LoRA.</description>

      <title>Low-Rank Bandits via Tight Two-to-Infinity Singular Subspace Recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15739v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study contextual bandits with low-rank structure where, in each round, if the (context, arm) pair $(i,j)\in [m]\times [n]$ is selected, the learner observes a noisy sample of the $(i,j)$-th entry of an unknown low-rank reward matrix. Successive contexts are generated randomly in an i.i.d. manner and are revealed to the learner. For such bandits, we present efficient algorithms for policy evaluation, best policy identification and regret minimization. For policy evaluation and best policy identification, we show that our algorithms are nearly minimax optimal. For instance, the number of samples required to return an $\varepsilon$-optimal policy with probability at least $1-\delta$ typically scales as ${r(m+n)\over \varepsilon^2}\log(1/\delta)$. Our regret minimization algorithm enjoys minimax guarantees typically scaling as $r^{7/4}(m+n)^{3/4}\sqrt{T}$, which improves over existing algorithms. All the proposed algorithms consist of two phases: they first leverage spectral methods to estimate the left and right singular subspaces of the low-rank reward matrix. We show that these estimates enjoy tight error guarantees in the two-to-infinity norm. This in turn allows us to reformulate our problems as a misspecified linear bandit problem with dimension roughly $r(m+n)$ and misspecification controlled by the subspace recovery error, as well as to design the second phase of our algorithms efficiently.</description>

      <title>Extending echo state property for quantum reservoir computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02686v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The echo state property (ESP) represents a fundamental concept in the reservoir computing (RC) framework that ensures output-only training of reservoir networks by being agnostic to the initial states and far past inputs. However, the traditional definition of ESP does not describe possible non-stationary systems in which statistical properties evolve. To address this issue, we introduce two new categories of ESP: $\textit{non-stationary ESP}$, designed for potentially non-stationary systems, and $\textit{subspace/subset ESP}$, designed for systems whose subsystems have ESP. Following the definitions, we numerically demonstrate the correspondence between non-stationary ESP in the quantum reservoir computer (QRC) framework with typical Hamiltonian dynamics and input encoding methods using non-linear autoregressive moving-average (NARMA) tasks. We also confirm the correspondence by computing linear/non-linear memory capacities that quantify input-dependent components within reservoir states. Our study presents a new understanding of the practical design of QRC and other possibly non-stationary RC systems in which non-stationary systems and subsystems are exploited.</description>

      <title>Value-Incentivized Preference Optimization: A Unified Approach to Online and Offline RLHF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19320v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has demonstrated great promise in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preference. Depending on the availability of preference data, both online and offline RLHF are active areas of investigation. A key bottleneck is understanding how to incorporate uncertainty estimation in the reward function learned from the preference data for RLHF, regardless of how the preference data is collected. While the principles of optimism or pessimism under uncertainty are well-established in standard reinforcement learning (RL), a practically-implementable and theoretically-grounded form amenable to large language models is not yet available, as standard techniques for constructing confidence intervals become intractable under arbitrary policy parameterizations.
  In this paper, we introduce a unified approach to online and offline RLHF -- value-incentivized preference optimization (VPO) -- which regularizes the maximum-likelihood estimate of the reward function with the corresponding value function, modulated by a $\textit{sign}$ to indicate whether the optimism or pessimism is chosen. VPO also directly optimizes the policy with implicit reward modeling, and therefore shares a simpler RLHF pipeline similar to direct preference optimization. Theoretical guarantees of VPO are provided for both online and offline settings, matching the rates of their standard RL counterparts. Moreover, experiments on text summarization and dialog verify the practicality and effectiveness of VPO.</description>

      <title>Planetary Causal Inference: Implications for the Geography of Poverty</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02584v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Earth observation data such as satellite imagery can, when combined with machine learning, can have far-reaching impacts on our understanding of the geography of poverty through the prediction of living conditions, especially where government-derived economic indicators are either unavailable or potentially untrustworthy. Recent work has progressed in using Earth Observation (EO) data not only to predict spatial economic outcomes but also to explore cause and effect, an understanding which is critical for downstream policy analysis. In this review, we first document the growth of interest in using satellite images together with EO data in causal analysis. We then trace the relationship between spatial statistics and machine learning methods before discussing four ways in which EO data has been used in causal machine learning pipelines -- (1.) poverty outcome imputation for downstream causal analysis, (2.) EO image deconfounding, (3.) EO-based treatment effect heterogeneity, and (4.) EO-based transportability analysis. We conclude by providing a step-by-step workflow for how researchers can incorporate EO data in causal ML analysis going forward, outlining major choices of data, models, and evaluation metrics.</description>

      <title>High-probability minimax lower bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13447v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The minimax risk is often considered as a gold standard against which we can compare specific statistical procedures. Nevertheless, as has been observed recently in robust and heavy-tailed estimation problems, the inherent reduction of the (random) loss to its expectation may entail a significant loss of information regarding its tail behaviour. In an attempt to avoid such a loss, we introduce the notion of a minimax quantile, and seek to articulate its dependence on the quantile level. To this end, we develop high-probability variants of the classical Le Cam and Fano methods, as well as a technique to convert local minimax risk lower bounds to lower bounds on minimax quantiles. To illustrate the power of our framework, we deploy our techniques on several examples, recovering recent results in robust mean estimation and stochastic convex optimisation, as well as obtaining several new results in covariance matrix estimation, sparse linear regression, nonparametric density estimation and isotonic regression. Our overall goal is to argue that minimax quantiles can provide a finer-grained understanding of the difficulty of statistical problems, and that, in wide generality, lower bounds on these quantities can be obtained via user-friendly tools.</description>

      <title>Second Maximum of a Gaussian Random Field and Exact (t-)Spacing test</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18397v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we introduce the novel concept of the second maximum of a Gaussian random field on a Riemannian submanifold. This second maximum serves as a powerful tool for characterizing the distribution of the maximum. By utilizing an ad-hoc Kac Rice formula, we derive the explicit form of the maximum's distribution, conditioned on the second maximum and some regressed component of the Riemannian Hessian. This approach results in an exact test, based on the evaluation of spacing between these maxima, which we refer to as the spacing test.
  We investigate the applicability of this test in detecting sparse alternatives within Gaussian symmetric tensors, continuous sparse deconvolution, and two-layered neural networks with smooth rectifiers. Our theoretical results are supported by numerical experiments, which illustrate the calibration and power of the proposed tests. More generally, this test can be applied to any Gaussian random field on a Riemannian manifold, and we provide a general framework for the application of the spacing test in continuous sparse kernel regression.
  Furthermore, when the variance-covariance function of the Gaussian random field is known up to a scaling factor, we derive an exact Studentized version of our test, coined the $t$-spacing test. This test is perfectly calibrated under the null hypothesis and has high power for detecting sparse alternatives.</description>

      <title>Learning to Mitigate Externalities: the Coase Theorem with Hindsight Rationality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19824v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In economic theory, the concept of externality refers to any indirect effect resulting from an interaction between players that affects the social welfare. Most of the models within which externality has been studied assume that agents have perfect knowledge of their environment and preferences. This is a major hindrance to the practical implementation of many proposed solutions. To address this issue, we consider a two-player bandit setting where the actions of one of the players affect the other player and we extend the Coase theorem [Coase, 1960]. This result shows that the optimal approach for maximizing the social welfare in the presence of externality is to establish property rights, i.e., enable transfers and bargaining between the players. Our work removes the classical assumption that bargainers possess perfect knowledge of the underlying game. We first demonstrate that in the absence of property rights, the social welfare breaks down. We then design a policy for the players which allows them to learn a bargaining strategy which maximizes the total welfare, recovering the Coase theorem under uncertainty.</description>
