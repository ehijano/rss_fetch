      <title>Movable Antenna Enhanced Downlink Multi-User Integrated Sensing and Communication System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the potential of exploiting movable antennas (MAs) to enhance the performance of a multi-user downlink integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system. Specifically, we formulate an optimization problem to maximize the transmit beampattern gain for sensing while simultaneously meeting each user's communication requirement by jointly optimizing antenna positions and beamforming design. The problem formulated is highly non-convex and involves multivariate-coupled constraints. To address these challenges, we introduce a series of auxiliary random variables and transform the original problem into an augmented Lagrangian problem. A double-loop algorithm based on a penalty dual decomposition framework is then developed to solve the problem. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed design, demonstrating its superiority over MA designs based on successive convex approximation optimization and other baseline approaches in ISAC systems. The results also highlight the advantages of MAs in achieving better sensing performance and improved beam control, especially for sparse arrays with large apertures.</description>

      <title>Architecture of Information</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper explores an approach to constructing energy landscapes of a formal neuron and multilayer artificial neural networks (ANNs). Their analysis makes it possible to determine the conceptual limitations of both classification ANNs (e.g., MLP or CNN) and generative ANN models. The study of informational and thermodynamic entropy in formal neuron and ANN models leads to the conclusion about the energetic nature of informational entropy. The application of the Gibbs free energy concept allows representing the output information of ANNs as the structured part of enthalpy. Modeling ANNs as energy systems makes it possible to interpret the structure of their internal energy as an internal model of the external world, which self-organizes based on the interaction of the system's internal energy components. The control of the self-organization and evolution process of this model is carried out through an energy function (analogous to the Lyapunov function) based on reduction operators. This makes it possible to introduce a new approach to constructing self-organizing and evolutionary ANNs with direct learning, which does not require additional external algorithms. The presented research makes it possible to formulate a formal definition of information in terms of the interaction processes between the internal and external energy of the system.</description>

      <title>DeCompress: Denoising via Neural Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning-based denoising algorithms achieve state-of-the-art performance across various denoising tasks. However, training such models relies on access to large training datasets consisting of clean and noisy image pairs. On the other hand, in many imaging applications, such as microscopy, collecting ground truth images is often infeasible. To address this challenge, researchers have recently developed algorithms that can be trained without requiring access to ground truth data. However, training such models remains computationally challenging and still requires access to large noisy training samples. In this work, inspired by compression-based denoising and recent advances in neural compression, we propose a new compression-based denoising algorithm, which we name DeCompress, that i) does not require access to ground truth images, ii) does not require access to large training dataset - only a single noisy image is sufficient, iii) is robust to overfitting, and iv) achieves superior performance compared with zero-shot or unsupervised learning-based denoisers.</description>

      <title>Information Theoretic One-Time Programs from Geometrically Local $\text{QNC}_0$ Adversaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22016v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show how to construct simulation secure one-time memories, and thus one-time programs, without computational assumptions in the presence of constraints on quantum hardware. Specifically, we build one-time memories from random linear codes and quantum random access codes (QRACs) when constrained to non-adaptive, constant depth, and $D$-dimensional geometrically-local quantum circuit for some constant $D$. We place no restrictions on the adversary's classical computational power, number of qubits it can use, or the coherence time of its qubits. Notably, our construction can still be secure even in the presence of fault tolerant quantum computation as long as the input qubits are encoded in a non-fault tolerant manner (e.g. encoded as high energy states in non-ideal hardware). Unfortunately though, our construction requires decoding random linear codes and thus does not run in polynomial time. We leave open the question of whether one can construct a polynomial time information theoretically secure one-time memory from geometrically local quantum circuits.
  Of potentially independent interest, we develop a progress bound for information leakage via collision entropy (Renyi entropy of order $2$) along with a few key technical lemmas for a "mutual information" for collision entropies. We also develop new bounds on how much information a specific $2 \mapsto 1$ QRAC can leak about its input, which may be of independent interest as well.</description>

      <title>Quantum error correction for long chains of trapped ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a model for quantum computing with long chains of trapped ions and we design quantum error correction schemes for this model. The main components of a quantum error correction scheme are the quantum code and a quantum circuit called the syndrome extraction circuit, which is executed to perform error correction with this code. In this work, we design syndrome extraction circuits tailored to our ion chain model, a syndrome extraction tuning protocol to optimize these circuits, and we construct new quantum codes that outperform the state-of-the-art for chains of about $50$ qubits. To establish a baseline under the ion chain model, we simulate the performance of surface codes and bivariate bicycle (BB) codes equipped with our optimized syndrome extraction circuits. Then, we propose a new variant of BB codes defined by weight-five measurements, that we refer to as BB5 codes, and we identify BB5 codes that achieve a better minimum distance than any BB codes with the same number of logical qubits and data qubits, such as $[[30, 4, 5]]$ and $[[48, 4, 7]]$ BB5 codes. For a physical error rate of $10^{-3}$, the $[[48, 4, 7]]$ BB5 code achieves a logical error rate per logical qubit of $5 \cdot 10^{-5}$, which is four times smaller than the best BB code in our baseline family. It also achieves the same logical error rate per logical qubit as the distance-7 surface code but using four times fewer physical qubits per logical qubit.</description>

      <title>Optimal Locality and Parameter Tradeoffs for Subsystem Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the tradeoffs between the locality and parameters of subsystem codes. We prove lower bounds on both the number and lengths of interactions in any $D$-dimensional embedding of a subsystem code. Specifically, we show that any embedding of a subsystem code with parameters $[[n,k,d]]$ into $\mathbb{R}^D$ must have at least $M^*$ interactions of length at least $\ell^*$, where
  \[ M^* = \Omega(\max(k,d)), \quad\text{and}\quad \ell^* = \Omega\bigg(\max\bigg(\frac{d}{n^\frac{D-1}{D}}, \bigg(\frac{kd^\frac{1}{D-1}}{n}\bigg)^\frac{D-1}{D}\bigg)\bigg). \] We also give tradeoffs between the locality and parameters of commuting projector codes in $D$-dimensions, generalizing a result of Dai and Li. We provide explicit constructions of embedded codes that show our bounds are optimal in both the interaction count and interaction length.</description>

      <title>Fast Fractional Programming for Multi-Cell Integrated Sensing and Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10910v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper concerns the coordinate multi-cell beamforming design for integrated sensing and communications (ISAC). In particular, we assume that each base station (BS) has massive antennas. The optimization objective is to maximize a weighted sum of the data rates (for communications) and the Fisher information (for sensing). We first show that the conventional beamforming method for the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) transmission, i.e., the weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) algorithm, works for the ISAC problem case from a fractional programming (FP) perspective. However, the WMMSE algorithm frequently requires computing the $N\times N$ matrix inverse, where $N$ is the number of transmit or receive antennas, so the algorithm becomes quite costly when antennas are massively deployed. To address this issue, we develop a nonhomogeneous bound and use it in conjunction with the FP technique to solve the ISAC beamforming problem without the need to invert any large matrices. It is further shown that the resulting new FP algorithm has an intimate connection with gradient projection, based on which we can accelerate the convergence via Nesterov's gradient extrapolation.</description>

      <title>Mutual Coupling in Holographic MIMO: Physical Modeling and Information-Theoretic Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10209v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive framework for holographic multiantenna communication, a paradigm that integrates both wide apertures and closely spaced antennas relative to the wavelength. The presented framework is physically grounded, enabling information-theoretic analyses that inherently incorporate correlation and mutual coupling among the antennas. This establishes the combined effects of correlation and coupling on the information-theoretic performance limits across SNR levels. Additionally, it reveals that, by suitably selecting the individual antenna patterns, mutual coupling can be harnessed to either reinforce or counter spatial correlations as appropriate for specific SNRs, thereby improving the performance.</description>

      <title>Neuromorphic Wireless Split Computing with Multi-Level Spikes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04728v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by biological processes, neuromorphic computing leverages spiking neural networks (SNNs) to perform inference tasks, offering significant efficiency gains for workloads involving sequential data. Recent advances in hardware and software have shown that embedding a small payload within each spike exchanged between spiking neurons can enhance inference accuracy without increasing energy consumption. To scale neuromorphic computing to larger workloads, split computing - where an SNN is partitioned across two devices - is a promising solution. In such architectures, the device hosting the initial layers must transmit information about the spikes generated by its output neurons to the second device. This establishes a trade-off between the benefits of multi-level spikes, which carry additional payload information, and the communication resources required for transmitting extra bits between devices. This paper presents the first comprehensive study of a neuromorphic wireless split computing architecture that employs multi-level SNNs. We propose digital and analog modulation schemes for an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) radio interface to enable efficient communication. Simulation and experimental results using software-defined radios reveal performance improvements achieved by multi-level SNN models and provide insights into the optimal payload size as a function of the connection quality between the transmitter and receiver.</description>
