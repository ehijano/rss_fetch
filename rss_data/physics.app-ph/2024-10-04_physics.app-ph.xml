      <title>Theory of Seamless-Scanning Periodic Leaky-Wave Antennas based on $\mathcal{PT}$-Symmetry with Time to Space Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Periodic Leaky-Wave Antennas (P-LWA) offer highly directive and space-scanning radiation. Unfortunately, they have been plagued by the ``broadside issue'', characterized by a degradation in gain when the antenna's main beam is steered across broadside. While this issue has been addressed by circuit and network approaches, a related fundamental and general electromagnetic theory has been lacking. This paper fills this gap. We first show that a P-LWA is a $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric system, whose even- and odd-mode coupling in the complex space of temporal frequencies leads to the characteristic pair of two-sheet Riemann surfaces. We observe that the branch cuts of these surfaces, which form the well-known $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric double pitchfork spectrum, correspond to the ``balanced frequency'' condition, while the branch point at the junction of the pitchforks, is an exceptional point that corresponds to the ``$Q$-balanced'' condition, two conditions that where previously shown to be the conditions for eliminating the broadside issue. In order to acquire an independent and rigorous interpretation of this spectrum, we further transform the coupled complex temporal eigenfrequencies into complex spatial eigenfrequencies. We identify the resulting spatial frequencies as coupled forward-backward modes, with frequency-independent imaginary parts (leakage factors), a condition for P-LWA equalization across broadside. Finally, we derive the scattering parameters of the P-LWA and show that matching is achieved only at one of the two ends of the P-LWA structure. This work both provides a solid foundation to the theory of P-LWAs and represents an original contribution to the field of $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry.</description>

      <title>Enhancing heat transfer in X-ray tube by van der heterostructures-based thermionic emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures have attracted much attention due to their distinctive optical, electrical, and thermal properties, demonstrating promising potential in areas such as photocatalysis, ultrafast photonics, and free electron radiation devices. Particularly, they are promising platforms for studying thermionic emission. Here, we illustrate that using vdW heterostructure-based thermionic emission can enhance heat transfer in vacuum devices. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate that this approach offers a promising solution to the long-standing overheating issue in X-ray tubes. Specifically, we show that the saturated target temperature of a 2000 W X-ray tube can be reduced from around 1200 celsius to 490 celsius. Additionally, our study demonstrates that by reducing the height of the Schottky barrier formed in the vdW heterostructures, the thermionic cooling performance can be enhanced. Our findings pave the way for the development of high-power X-ray tubes.</description>

      <title>Extremal micropolar materials for elastic wave cloaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The asymmetric transformation elasticity offers a promising method to control elastic waves. However, this method requires elastic materials that support asymmetric stresses, which is not objective within the Cauchy elasticity framework. Nevertheless, asymmetric stress tensor is a typical feature of micropolar continuum theory. Yet, possible connection between micropolar continuum theory and the asymmetric elasticity transformation has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate that extremal micropolar media, which refer to micropolar media with easy deformation modes, can be used to design elastic cloaks following the asymmetric transformation method. A metamaterial model is proposed to achieve the required extremal micropolar parameters for cloaking. We further design a two-dimensional metamaterial cloak and verify its cloaking performance numerically. An excellent agreement between the metamaterial cloak simulation and an effective-medium calculation is obtained. This study unveils a novel strategy for controlling elastic waves through micropolar media and also sheds light on interesting properties of extremal micropolar materials.</description>

      <title>Exploring diffusion bonding of niobium and its alloys with tungsten and a molybdenum alloy for high-energy particle target applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Particle-producing targets in high-energy research facilities are often made from refractory metals, and they typically require dedicated cooling systems due to the challenging thermomechanical conditions they experience. However, direct contact of water with target blocks can induce erosion, corrosion, and embrittlement, especially of tungsten (W). One approach to overcoming this problem is cladding the blocks with tantalum (Ta). Unfortunately, Ta generates high decay heat when irradiated, raising safety concerns in the event of a loss-of-cooling accident. This study explored the capacity of niobium (Nb) and its alloys to form diffusion bonds with W and TZM (a molybdenum alloy with titanium and zirconium). This is because the Beam Dump Facility (BDF), a planned new fixed-target installation in CERN's North Area, uses these target materials. The bonding quality of pure Nb, Nb1Zr, and C103 (a Nb alloy with 10% hafnium and 1% titanium) with TZM and W obtained using hot isostatic pressing (HIP) was evaluated. The effects of different HIP temperatures and the introduction of a Ta interlayer were examined. Optical microscopy indicated promising bonding interfaces, which were further characterized using tensile tests and thermal-diffusivity measurements. Their performance under high-energy beam impact was validated using thermomechanical simulations. C103 exhibited higher interface strengths and safety factors than Ta2.5W, positioning it as a potential alternative cladding material for the BDF production target. The findings highlight the viability of Nb-based materials, particularly C103, for improving operational safety and efficiency in fixed-target physics experiments; however, considerations regarding the long half-life of 94Nb require further attention.</description>

      <title>Thermal properties of SnSe nanoflakes by AFM-based Scanning Thermal Microscopy measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigated the thermal resistance of SnSe nanoflakes using scanning thermal microscopy, an extension of atomic force microscopy that allows for nanoscale thermal mapping. The nanoflakes studied ranged in thickness from 5 nm to 40 nm, enabling us to observe the thermal properties across a wide range of dimensions. Our results show a clear trend: as the thickness of the nanoflakes increases, the thermal resistance also increases. This suggests that diffusive mechanisms govern heat transport in SnSe nanoflakes and follow Fourier's law of heat conduction. The observed behavior can be attributed to the inherently short phonon mean free path in SnSe which is on the order of 5 nm at room temperature.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Electrochemical Limits Preceding Dendrite Penetration in Ceramic Electrolytes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solid-state electrolytes have the potential to stabilize lithium metal anodes, which hold the promise to increase the energy density of lithium-ion batteries. However, lithium metal dendrites that occur locally at the solid-solid interface plague the solid-state lithium metal cells during charging, limiting the cycle life, and rendering high safety risks in practical applications. While multiple explanations have been proposed, understandings of the dynamics preceding and causing the metal penetration in solid electrolytes are still not conclusive. Here, by testing many highly consistent Ta-doped Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZTO) samples and utilizing an improved operando technique on symmetrical cells, we observed a consistent and statistically significant trend of current-dependent dendrite initiation time, which coincides with the Sand's time scaling in liquid electrolytes. This new understanding offers an electrochemical origin of dendritic initiation but also provides future insight into optimal all-solid-state battery design.</description>

      <title>Fast response and highly sensitive flexible humidity sensor based on nanocomposite film of MoS2 and graphene oxide</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graphene oxide (GO)-based humidity sensors are attracting widespread attention due to their high responsivity and low cost. However, GO-based humidity sensors generally suffer from slow response and recovery as well as poor stability,etc. Here, we reported a flexible resistive humidity sensor based on a MoS2/GO composite film that was fabricated by mixing different volumes of MoS2 and GO dispersions with adjustable volume ratios. The MoS2/GO composite film has been used as a sensing layer on screen-printed interdigital electrodes. The results show that the best device performance was achieved at a dispersion volume of 0.05 mL with the MoS2/GO volume ratio of 5:1, featuring high responsivity (~98%), fast response/recovery time (1.3/12.1 s), excellent stability and low cost. Further, the humidity sensor exhibits good linearity over a wide humidity range (33% RH-98% RH) at room temperature and can be fabricated easily and feasibly. The application of the humidity sensors we prepared in human respiration detection and human fingertip proximity detection has been demonstrated. These findings indicate the great potential of the composite of MoS2/GO in developing the next generation of high-performance humidity sensors.</description>

Abstract: The advent of the 5G era means that the concepts of robot, VR/AR, UAV, smart home, smart healthcare based on IoT (Internet of Things) have gradually entered human life. Since then, intelligent life has become the dominant direction of social development. Humidity sensors, as humidity detection tools, not only convey the comfort of human living environment, but also display great significance in the fields of meteorology, medicine, agriculture and industry. Graphene-based materials exhibit tremendous potential in humidity sensing owing to their ultra-high specific surface area and excellent electron mobility under room temperature for application in humidity sensing. This review begins with the introduction of examples of various synthesis strategies of graphene, followed by the device structure and working mechanism of graphene-based humidity sensor. In addition, several different structural design methods of graphene are summarized, demonstrating the structural design of graphene can not only optimize the performance of graphene, but also bring significant advantages in humidity sensing. Finally, key challenges hindering the further development and practical application of high-performance graphene-based humidity sensors are discussed, followed by presenting the future perspectives.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, pressure sensors have been widely used as crucial technology components in industrial, healthcare, consumer electronics, and automotive safety applications. With the development of intelligent technologies, there is a growing demand for pressure sensors with higher sensitivity, smaller size, and wider detection range. Graphene and its derivatives, as novel emerging materials in recent years, have received widespread attention from researchers due to their unique mechanical and electrical properties, and are considered as promising sensing materials for the high-performance pressure sensors. In general, graphene-based pressure sensors can be classified into flexible pressure sensors and gas pressure sensors. In this paper, we firstly introduce the basic properties of graphene and its derivatives and then review the research progress of both graphene-based flexible pressure sensors and graphene-based gas pressure sensors respectively, focusing on different sensing mechanisms. Finally, the application prospects of graphene-based pressure sensors as well as future challenges are discussed.</description>

      <title>Electro-Optic Co-Simulation in High-Speed Silicon Photonics Transceiver Design Using Standard Electronic Circuit Simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing demand for high-speed optical interconnects necessitates integrated photonic and electronic solutions. Electro-optic co-simulation is key to meeting these requirements, which works by importing interoperable photonic models into industry-standard electronic circuit simulators from Synopsys, Cadence, Keysight, and others. However, current interoperable photonic models cannot accurately predict performance and do not address terabit-class transceiver designs due to inadequate modeling of complex physical effects such as optical losses, back-reflection, nonlinearity, high-frequency response, noise, and manufacturing variations. Here, we present accurate and interoperable photonic models that agree well with experiments at symbol rates exceeding 50 Gbaud. The developed models include basic optical components with losses and reflections, two types of Mach-Zehnder modulators with validated high-frequency response, and testing equipment with associated noise. We built an optical link testbench on an industry-standard electronic circuit simulator and verified the model accuracy by comparing simulation and experiment up to 64 Gbaud. The results suggest that co-simulation will be a solid basis for advancing design of transceivers and other related applications in silicon photonics.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The generation and manipulation of non-classical light states is central to emerging quantum technologies. Color centers in insulating crystals have been extensively studied for single-photon generation, but organic molecules immobilized on substrates have gained attention due to their superior scalability, large oscillator strengths, and tunable emission frequency. Here, we use first principles calculations to investigate the photoemission spectrum of organic molecules adsorbed on various 2D materials. Machine learning interatomic potentials are combined with density functional theory to accelerate the search for stable adsorption configurations. The calculated zero phonon line (ZPL) energies and emission lineshapes show excellent agreement with experiments. Our results indicate that the 2D substrate couples weakly to the molecular transitions and that emission characteristics are almost universal across different substrates. The unique effect of the 2D substrate is to introduce a sharp sideband(s) near the ZPL as a fingerprint of hindered rotational and translational modes of the molecule.</description>

      <title>Ultrathin BIC metasurfaces based on ultralow-loss Sb2Se3 phase-change material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phase-change materials (PCMs) are increasingly recognised as promising platforms for tunable photonic devices due to their ability to modulate optical properties through solid-state phase transitions. Ultrathin and low-loss PCMs are highly valued for their fast and more effective phase transitions and applications in reconfigurable photonic chips, metasurfaces, optical modulators, sensors, photonic memories, and neuromorphic computing. However, conventional PCMs such as GST, GSST, VO2, and In3SbTe2, despite optimisation for tunable meta-optics, suffer from high intrinsic losses in the near-infrared (NIR) region, limiting their potential for high quality factor (Q-factor) resonant metasurfaces. Here we present the design and fabrication of tunable bound states in the continuum (BIC) metasurfaces using the ultralow-loss PCM Sb2Se3. Our BIC metasurfaces, only 25 nm thick, achieve high modulation depth and broad resonance tuning in the NIR with high Q-factors up to 130, without the need for additional materials. Experimentally, we employ these BIC metasurfaces to modulate photoluminescence in rare earth-doped upconversion nanoparticles, reducing the excitation power for multiphoton photoluminescence and enabling emission polarisation manipulation. This work offers a promising platform for developing active resonant metasurfaces in the NIR region, with broad applications including super resolution imaging, optical modulation, ultrafast switches, harmonic generation, colour filtering, and optical sensing.</description>

      <title>Performance of a radio-frequency two-photon atomic magnetometer in different magnetic induction measurement geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17935v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Measurements monitoring the inductive coupling between oscillating radio-frequency magnetic fields and objects of interest create versatile platforms for non-destructive testing. The benefits of ultra low frequency measurements, i.e., below 3 kHz, are sometimes outweighed by the fundamental and technical difficulties related to operating pick-up coils or other field sensors in this frequency range. Inductive measurements with the detection based on a two-photon interaction in rf atomic magnetometers address some of these issues, as the sensor gains an uplift in its operational frequency. The developments reported here integrate the fundamental and applied aspects of the two-photon process in magnetic induction measurements. In this paper, all spectral components of the two-photon process are identified, which result from the non-linear interactions between the rf fields and atoms. A method for the retrieval of the two-photon phase information, which is critical for inductive measurements, is also demonstrated. Furthermore, a self-compensation configuration is introduced, whereby high contrast measurements of defects can be obtained due to the sensor's insensitivity to the primary field, including using simplified instrumentation for this configuration by producing two rf fields with a single rf coil.</description>

Abstract: The effects of an electrostatic logarithmic trap (ELT) on an ionic gas confined in a cylindric chamber are studied in detail, with special reference to the effects of the ion-ion Coulombic interactions and the resulting low-temperature thermodynamics. The collapse of the ions in radially localized states, about the axial cathode, is shown to cause an abrupt (but not critical) transition from non degeneration to strong degeneration, at a special temperature $T_c$. This transition could actually involve both Bosons and Fermions and is not to be confused with a Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC), which is excluded in principle. However, while for Bosons the resulting effects on the pressure are observable in the ultra high vacuum (UHV) regime, the Fermions' density should fall well below UHV, for the pressure change to be observable. This is because the ion-ion \emph{exchange} interactions increase the kinetic energy along the axial cathode, which makes the Fermi level and the non degeneration threshold temperature increase accordingly.</description>

Abstract: Organic electro-optic materials have demonstrated promising performance in developing electro-optic phase shifters. Their integration with other silicon photonic processes, nanofabrication complexities, and durability remain to be developed. While the required poling step in electro-optic polymers limits their potential and utilization on a large scale, devices made of paraelectric nematic liquid crystals suffer from slow bandwidth. In ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals, we report an additional GHz-fast phase shift that ultimately allows for significant second-order nonlinear optical coefficients and the related Pockels effect. It avoids poling issues and can pave the way for hybrid silicon-organic systems with CMOS-foundry compatibility. We report DC and AC modulation efficiencies of $\approx$0.25 V$\cdot$mm and $\approx$25.7 V$\cdot$mm, respectively, an on-chip insertion loss of $\approx$2.1 dB, and an electro-optic bandwidth of $f_{-6dB}$&gt;4.18 GHz, employing improved light-matter interaction in a waveguide architecture that calls for only one lithography step.</description>

      <title>Anchor-Controlled Generative Adversarial Network for High-Fidelity Electromagnetic and Structurally Diverse Metasurface Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16231</link>

Abstract: Metasurfaces, capable of manipulating light at subwavelength scales, hold great potential for advancing optoelectronic applications. Generative models, particularly Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), offer a promising approach for metasurface inverse design by efficiently navigating complex design spaces and capturing underlying data patterns. However, existing generative models struggle to achieve high electromagnetic fidelity and structural diversity. These challenges arise from the lack of explicit electromagnetic constraints during training, which hinders accurate structure-to-electromagnetic response mapping, and the absence of mechanisms to handle one-to-many mappings dilemma, resulting in insufficient structural diversity. To address these issues, we propose the Anchor-controlled Generative Adversarial Network (AcGAN), a novel framework that improves both electromagnetic fidelity and structural diversity. To achieve high electromagnetic fidelity, AcGAN proposes the Spectral Overlap Coefficient (SOC) for precise spectral fidelity assessment and develops AnchorNet, which provides real-time feedback on electromagnetic performance to refine the structure-to-electromagnetic mapping. To enhance structural diversity, AcGAN incorporates a cluster-guided controller that refines input processing and ensures multi-level spectral integration, guiding the generation process to explore multiple configurations for the same spectral target. Additionally, a dynamic loss function progressively shifts the focus from data-driven learning to optimizing both spectral fidelity and structural diversity. Empirical analysis shows that AcGAN reduces the Mean Squared Error (MSE) by 73% compared to current state-of-the-art GANs methods and significantly expands the design space to generate diverse metasurface architectures that meet precise spectral demands.</description>
