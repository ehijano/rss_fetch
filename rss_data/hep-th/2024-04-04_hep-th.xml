      <title>Coulomb branch surgery: Holonomy saddles, S-folds and discrete symmetry gaugings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetries of Seiberg-Witten (SW) geometries capture intricate physical aspects of the underlying 4d $\mathcal{N} = 2$ field theories. For rank-one theories, these geometries are rational elliptic surfaces whose automorphism group is a semi-direct product between the Coulomb branch (CB) symmetries and the Mordell-Weil group. We study quotients of the SW geometry by subgroups of its automorphism group, which most naturally become gaugings of discrete 0- and 1-form symmetries. Yet, new interpretations of these surgeries become evident when considering 5d $\mathcal{N}=1$ superconformal field theories. There, certain CB symmetries are related to symmetries of the corresponding $(p,q)$-brane web and, as a result, CB surgeries can give rise to (fractional) S-folds. Another novel interpretation of these quotients is the folding across dimensions: circle compactifications of the 5d $E_{2N_f + 1}$ Seiberg theories lead in the infrared to two copies of locally indistinguishable 4d SU(2) SQCD theories with $N_f$ fundamental flavours. This extends earlier results on holonomy saddles, while also reproducing detailed computations of 5d BPS spectra and predicting new 5d and 6d BPS quivers. Finally, we argue that the semi-direct product structure of the automorphism group of the SW geometry includes mixed 't Hooft anomalies between the 0- and 1-form symmetries, and we also present some new results on non-cyclic CB symmetries.</description>

      <title>The cosmological constant and the weak gravity conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the descent via membrane nucleation through a landscape of vacua where the cosmological constant is given by a combination of four-form fluxes. It has been shown that this descent can be slowed exponentially for very low curvature vacua close to Minkowski space in a wide class of models satisfying certain parametric conditions, providing a possible solution to the cosmological constant problem. We explore in detail whether or not those parametric conditions are compatible with the membrane weak gravity conjecture. Whilst it is true that there is often tension, we show that this is not always the case and present an explicit model where Minkowski space is absolutely stable and the weak gravity conjecture is satisfied. This corresponds to an extension of the Bousso-Polchinski model into a generalised DBI action for four-forms. We also clarify how the landscape should be populated in a consistent model.</description>

      <title>A novel strategy to prove chiral symmetry breaking in QCD-like theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that chiral symmetry breaking occurs in the confining phase of QCD-like theories with $N_c$ colors and $N_f$ flavors. Our proof is based on a novel strategy, called `downlifting', by which solutions of the 't Hooft anomaly matching and persistent mass conditions for a theory with $N_f-1$ flavors are constructed from those of a theory with $N_f$ flavors, while $N_c$ is fixed. By induction, chiral symmetry breaking is proven for any $N_f\geq p_{min}$, where $p_{min}$ is the smallest prime factor of $N_c$. The proof can be extended to $N_f &lt;p_{min}$ under the additional assumption on the absence of phase transitions when quark masses are sent to infinity. Our results do not rely on ad-hoc assumptions on the spectrum of massless bound states.</description>

      <title>On the Proof of Chiral Symmetry Breaking through Anomaly Matching in QCD-like Theories: An Exemplification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our recent works revisit the proof of chiral symmetry breaking in the confining phase of four-dimensional QCD-like theories, i.e. $SU(N_c)$ gauge theories with $N_f$ flavors of vectorlike quarks in the fundamental representation. The analysis relies on the structure of 't Hooft anomaly matching and persistent mass conditions for theories with same $N_c$ and different $N_f$. In this paper, we work out concrete examples with $N_c=3$ and $N_c=5$ to support and elucidate the results in the companion papers. Within the same examples, we also test some claims made in earlier works.</description>

      <title>Superradiant Instability of Charged Extremal Black Holes in Einstein-Born-Infeld Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study charged scalar perturbations of charged extremal black holes in Einstein-Born-Infeld theory. Our numerical results indicate that these black holes all suffer from superradiant instability by the unstable quasi-bound states, regardless how small the coupling constant is. We therefore provide a new example that the superradiant stability of the Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole is a fine-tuned result, as in the case when it is embedded in the STU supergravity model. The work is also motivated by the weak gravity conjecture since at the linear coupling constant level, the theory belongs to a subsect of four-derivative corrections in the effective field theory. Our results appear to support the notion that the black holes do decay when gravity is weaker by the correction, but the decaying halftime requires nonlinear effects and cannot be seen at the level of linear coupling constant. The full nonlinear effects also indicate that the black holes can decay even when gravity is stronger.</description>

      <title>Falsifying Anthropics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose using fuzzy axion dark matter to test the anthropic principle. A very light axion can be directly detectable, at least by black hole superradiance effects. The idea then is that gravitational and astrophysical observations can discover a light axion in the regime where it must be all of dark matter with abundance which must be set up by the anthropic principle, due to excessive primordial misalignment induced by inflation. Yet it may turn out that dark matter is something else instead of this axion. Since axion misalignment must be induced by Brownian drift in (quasi)de Sitter space, this could invalidate anthropic prediction of dark matter abundance.</description>

      <title>The off-shell expansion relation of the Yang-Mills scalar theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the off-shell expansion relation of the Yang-Mills scalar theory. We have showed explicitly that the single-trace Berends-Giele current in YMS theory can be decomposed into a term expressed by a linear combination of bi-adjoint scalar Berends-Giele currents and one that vanishes under the on-shell limit. We proved that the bi-adjoint scalar currents, as well as the corresponding coefficients, can be characterized by a graphic approach that was originally studied in Einstein-Yang-Mills expansion. Furthermore, we generalized the decomposition to the multi-trace case through unifying relations and established the connection both in single-trace and multi-trace graphic descriptions. Finally, we established the relations between the Yang-Mills currents and the single-trace Yang-Mills scalar currents choosing special reference orders of the Yang-Mills graphs.</description>

      <title>On the Charge Algebra of Causal Diamonds in Three Dimensional Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Covariant phase space methods are applied to the analysis of a causal diamond in 2+1-dimensional pure Einstein gravity. It is found that the reduced phase space is parametrized by a family of charges with a dual geometrical interpretation: they are geometric observables on the corner of the diamond, and they generate diffeomorphisms. The Poisson brackets among them close into an algebra. Knowledge of the corner charges therefore permits reconstruction of the diamond geometry, which realizes a form of local holography. The results are contrasted with the literature, and the path to a quantum description of spacetime geometry is discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the possibility of a past and future eternal universe, constructing geodesically complete inflating, loitering, and bouncing spacetimes. We identify the constraints energy conditions in General Relativity place on the building of eternal cosmological models. Inflationary and bouncing behavior are shown to be essential ingredients in all significant examples. Non-trivial complete spacetimes are shown to violate the null energy condition (NEC) for at least some amount of time, although, some obey the average null energy condition. Ignoring the intractable subtleties introduced by quantum considerations, such as rare tunneling events and Boltzmann brains, we demonstrate that these universes need not have had a beginning or an end.</description>

      <title>Mapping Excited Gauged Q-balls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Properties such as the radius, charge and energy of ${U}(1)$ gauged Q-balls are analytically complicated to characterize. A mapping relation is known between the ground state of gauged Q-balls and global Q-balls that reduces the complexity of the analysis of the ground state of gauged Q-balls. Extending the map to excited states is a powerful tool to determine the properties of the rest of gauged Q-ball solution space. In this article we explore the mapping relation extension to characterize numerically and analytically excited gauged Q-balls solutions and their properties. A feature of excited gauged Q-balls is acquiring a maximum number excited states and having a maximal size, which we analytically predict via the mapping relation. We show that analytical approximations of the charge and energy, in the thin-wall limit, can be extended to excited gauged Q-balls and discuss the types of instabilities of these states.</description>

      <title>From equations in coordinate space to Picard-Fuchs and back</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We continue the development of a position space approach to equations for Feynman multi-loop integrals. The key idea of the approach is that unintegrated products of Greens functions in position space are still loop integral in momentum space. The natural place to start are the famous banana diagrams, which we explore in this paper. In position space, these are just products of $n$ propagators. Firstly, we explain that these functions satisfy an equation of order $2^n$. These should be compared with Picard-Fuchs equations derived for the momentum space integral. We find that the Fourier transform of the position space operator contains the Picard-Fuchs one as a rightmost factor. The order of these operators is a special issue, especially since the order in momentum space is governed by degree in $x$ in position space. For the generic mass case this factorization pattern is complicated and it seems like the order of the Fourier transformed position space operators is much bigger than that of the Picard-Fuchs. Furthermore, one may ask what happens if after factorization we take the Picard-Fuchs operators back into position space. We discover that the result is again factorized, with the rightmost factor being the original position space equation. We demonstrate how this works in examples and discuss implications for more sophisticated Feynman integrals.</description>

      <title>On type-II Spacetimes and the Double Copy for Fluids Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In our previous paper (arXiv:2005.04242) we discussed type-D and type-N fluid-dual spacetimes and provided their associated single copies in the context of the Weyl double copy. In this work we extend our analysis to more general fluids thereby requiring the application of the double copy picture to type-II space-times. By combining our previous type-D and type-N fluids via their associated stream functions we demonstrate an example of a viable type-II double copy. Further we use an explicitly perturbative approach in the near horizon expansion to generalize the type II double copy for the fluid-dual space-times. We show a Maxwell spinor ansatz containing a heterogeneous bi-spinor component is necessary to provide a viable type-II double copy at the lowest order.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The AdS/CFT correspondence has significantly impacted the study of strongly coupled systems, providing insights into various condensed matter phenomena through its holographic duality. This paper introduces an alternative approach to the breaking of the global $U(1)$ symmetry in the bulk in two asymptotically AdS spacetimes: AdS plus hard wall and AdS Blackbrane. We explore a $(3+1)$-dimensional bulk $U(1)$ symmetry-breaking phase vacuum within a global $U(1)$ $\phi^4$ field theory, without the gauge field present in prior models. We find the symmetry-breaking vacuum requires that the mass squared is proportional to the quartic coupling. We also investigate numerical solutions of topologically stable vortex strings extending into the bulk. We find evidence that the full UV expansion is dual to a point-like boundary excitation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We argue that on-shell excitations with large negative energies are created rapidly when the string coupling increases with time. This does not indicate an inconsistency in string theory since the negative energy on-shell excitation is always entangled with an on-shell excitation with a positive energy. The total energy of this energy-EPR state vanishes. We discuss the reason the energy-EPR states appear in string theory and the role they might play in black hole physics.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider linear superpositions of single particle excitations in a scalar field theory on $AdS_3$ and evaluate their contribution to the bulk entanglement entropy across the Ryu-Takayanagi surface. We compare the entanglement entropy of these excitations obtained using the Faulkner-Lewkowycz-Maldacena formula to the entanglement entropy of linear superposition of global descendants of a conformal primary in a large $c$ CFT obtained using the replica trick. We show that the closed from expressions for the entanglement entropy in the small interval expansion both in gravity and the CFT precisely agree. The agreement serves as a non-trivial check of the FLM formula for the quantum corrections to holographic entropy which also involves a contribution from the back reacted minimal area. Our checks includes an example in which the state is time dependent and spatially in-homogenous as well another example involving a coherent state with a Ba\~{n}ados geometry as its holographic dual.</description>

      <title>Restricted Phase Space Thermodynamics of NED-AdS Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Restricted Phase Space Thermodynamics (RPST) of magnetically charged by nonlinear electrodynamics (NED)-AdS black holes. The first law and the corresponding Euler relation is examined using the scaling properties. The Euler relation is found to hold automatically. We observe that the first order homogeneity of mass and the zeroth order homogeneity of the intensive variables is intact. We use numerical and graphical techniques to find the critical points of the thermodynamic quantities $S, Q, T, F$. By utilizing the re-scaling properties of the equation of states, we study the thermodynamic processes using different pairs of variables. We also analyze the phase transition behavior of free energy and other thermodynamic variables. It is observed that the thermodynamics in the RPS formalism of our concerned black hole system is similar to RN-AdS, Kerr AdS and Kerr-Sen AdS black hole. This suggests that there should be some underlying universality in the RPST formalism. However, one particular $\mu-C$ process is found to differ from the earlier studied black holes, calling for further studies on the $\mu-C$ processes to comment on their universality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Requiring physical consistency in a classical flat spacetime geometrisation of fermions is shown to suggest the introduction of torsion. A resulting simple model for that torsion produces a localised quantum-like particle as a solution of a spinor identity that closely resembles the Dirac equation of quantum electrodynamics. All relevant integrals involving solutions of the spinor identity converge and require that the spin, which is no longer intrinsic but arises from circulating currents, be 1/2 whilst the magnetic moment takes the quantum value of 1 magneton, characteristic of an isolated Dirac particle. The underlying torsion associates the otherwise strictly localised particle with an extended spacetime structure that may be relevant to wider quantum phenomena.</description>

      <title>Signed eigenvalue/vector distribution of complex order-three random tensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the signed distribution of the eigenvalues/vectors of the complex order-three random tensor by computing a partition function of a four-fermi theory, where signs are from a Hessian determinant associated to each eigenvector. The issue of the presence of a continuous degeneracy of the eigenvectors is properly treated by a gauge-fixing. The final expression is compactly represented by a generating function, which has an expansion whose powers are the dimensions of the tensor index spaces. A crosscheck is performed by Monte Carlo simulations. By taking the large-$N$ limit we obtain a critical point where the behavior of the signed distribution qualitatively changes, and also the end of the signed distribution. The expected agreement of the end of the signed distribution with that of the genuine distribution provides a few applications, such as computing the largest eigenvalue, the geometric measure of entanglement, and the best rank-one approximation in the large-$N$ limit.</description>

      <title>Non-trivial bundles and defect operators in $n$-form gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In $(d+1)$-dimensional $1$-form non-Abelian gauge theories, we classify non-trivial $0$-form bundles in $ \mathbb{R}^{d} $, which yield configurations of $D(d-2j)$-branes wrapping $(d-2j)$-cycles $c_{d-2j} $ in $Dd$-branes. We construct the related defect operators $ U^{(2j-1)} ( c_{d-2j} ) $, which are disorder operators carrying the $D(d-2j)$ charge. We compute the commutation relations between the defect operators and Chern-Simons operators on odd-dimensional closed manifolds, and derive the generalized Witten effect for $U^{(2j-1)} ( c_{d-2j} ) $. When $c_{d-2j}$ is not exact, $ U^{(2j-1)} ( c_{d-2j} ) $ and $ U^{(2j-1)} (- c_{d-2j} ) $ can also combine into an electric $(2j-1)$-form global symmetry operator, where the $(2j-1)$-form is the Chern-Simons form. The dual magnetic $(d-2j)$-form global symmetry is generated by the $D(d-2j)$ charge. We also study non-trivial $1$-form bundles in $(d+1)$-dimensional $2$-form non-Abelian gauge theories, where the defect operators are $\mathcal{U}^{(2j)} ( c_{d-2j-1} ) $. With the field strength of the $1$-form taken as the flat connection of the $2$-form, we classify the topological sectors in $2$-form theories.</description>

      <title>Charting the Complex Structure Landscape of F-theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the landscape of F-theory compactifications on Calabi--Yau fourfolds whose complex structure moduli space is the thrice-punctured sphere. As a first part, we enumerate all such Calabi--Yau fourfolds under the additional requirement that it has a large complex structure and conifold point at two of the punctures. We find 14 monodromy tuples by demanding the monodromy around infinity to be quasi-unipotent. As second part, we study the four different types of phases arising at infinity. For each we consider a working example where we determine the leading periods and other physical couplings. We also included a notebook that sets up the period vectors for any of these models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the $4d$ $\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal quiver gauge theory obtained by a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ orbifold of $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills (SYM). By exploiting supersymmetric localization, we study the integrated correlator of two Coulomb branch and two moment map operators and the integrated correlator of four moment map operators, determining exact expressions valid for any value of the 't Hooft coupling in the planar limit. Additionally, for the second correlator, we obtain an exact expression also for the next-to-planar contribution. Then, we derive the leading terms of their strong-coupling expansions and outline the differences with respect to the $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linear confinement with Casimir scaling of the string tension in confining gauge theories is a consequence of a certain property of the Polyakov loop related to random matrices. This mechanism does not depend on the details of the theories (neither the gauge group nor dimensions) and explains approximate Casimir scaling below string-breaking length. In this paper, we study 3d SU(2) pure Yang-Mills theory numerically and find the same random-matrix behavior for rectangular Wilson loops. We conjecture that this is a universal feature of strongly coupled confining gauge theories.</description>

      <title>The dilaton gravity hologram of double-scaled SYK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We work out a precise holographic duality between sine dilaton gravity, and DSSYK. More precisely, canonical quantization of sine dilaton gravity reproduces q-Schwarzian quantum mechanics, which is the auxiliary system that arises from the chord diagrams of DSSYK. The role of the chord number in DSSYK is played by the (Weyl rescaled) geodesic length in the bulk. The most puzzling aspect of reconciling DSSYK with a simple gravitational dual at the classical level is the distinction between temperature and "fake temperature". At the q-Schwarzian level, we clarify how this arises from the constraint that the chord number is positive. The on-shell q-Schwarzian action with the constraint reproduces the thermodynamics of DSSYK. Semi-classically, in sine dilaton gravity this translates to the insertion of a defect, from which we deduce that fake temperature is the Hawking temperature of a smooth Lorentzian black hole. We comment on several relations with dS space. One remarkable feature is that in sine dilaton gravity quantization discretizes spacetime, therefore the Hilbert space is discrete.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Feynman integrals appropriately generalized are $\mathsf A$-hypergeometric functions. Among the properties of $\mathsf A$-hypergeometric functions are symmetries associated with the Newton polytope. In ordinary hypergeometric functions these symmetries lead to linear transformations. Combining tools of $\mathsf A$-hypergeometric systems and the computation of symmetries of polytopes, we consider the associated symmetries of Feynman integrals in the Lee-Pomeransky representation. We compute the symmetries of $\mathtt n$-gon integrals up to $\mathtt n=8$, massive banana integrals up to 5-loop, and on-shell ladders up to 3-loop. We apply these symmetries to study finite on-shell ladder integrals up to 3-loop.</description>

      <title>Lie-algebraic K\"ahler sigma models with the U(1) isotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss various questions which emerge in connection with the Lie-algebraic deformation of $\mathbb{CP}^1$ sigma model in two dimensions. First we supersymmetrize the original model endowing it with the minimal ${\cal N}=(0,2)$ and extended ${\cal N}=(2,2)$ supersymmetries. Then we derive the general hypercurrent anomaly in the both cases. In the latter case this anomaly is one-loop but is somewhat different from the standard expressions one can find in the literature because the target manifold is non-symmetric. We also show how to introduce the twisted masses and the $\theta$ term, and study the BPS equation for instantons, in particular the value of the topological charge. Then we demonstrate that the second loop in the $\beta$ function of the non-supersymmetric Lie-algebraic sigma model is due to an infrared effect. To this end we use a supersymmetric regularization. We also conjecture that the above statement is valid for higher loops too, similar to the parallel phenomenon in four-dimensional ${\cal N}=1$ super-Yang-Mills. In the second part of the paper we develop a special dimensional reduction -- namely, starting from the two-dimensional Lie-algebraic model we arrive at a quasi-exactly solvable quantum-mechanical problem of the Lam\'e type.</description>

      <title>Multipartite edge modes and tensor networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Holographic tensor networks model AdS/CFT, but so far they have been limited by involving only systems that are very different from gravity. Unfortunately, we cannot straightforwardly discretize gravity to incorporate it, because that would break diffeomorphism invariance. In this note, we explore a resolution. In low dimensions gravity can be written as a topological gauge theory, which can be discretized without breaking gauge-invariance. However, new problems arise. Foremost, we now need a qualitatively new kind of "area operator," which has no relation to the number of links along the cut and is instead topological. Secondly, the inclusion of matter becomes trickier. We successfully construct a tensor network both including matter and with this new type of area. Notably, while this area is still related to the entanglement in "edge mode" degrees of freedom, the edge modes are no longer bipartite entangled pairs. Instead they are highly multipartite. Along the way, we calculate the entropy of novel subalgebras in a particular topological gauge theory. We also show that the multipartite nature of the edge modes gives rise to non-commuting area operators, a property that other tensor networks do not exhibit.</description>

      <title>Chiral symmetry restoration at finite temperature in a model with manifest confinement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiple lattice evidences support the existence of a confining but chirally symmetric regime of QCD above the chiral symmetry restoration crossover at Tch ~ 155 MeV. This regime is characterised by an approximate chiral spin symmetry of the partition function, which is a symmetry of the colour charge and the confining electric part of the QCD Lagrangian. It is traditionally believed that confinement should automatically induce spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry, which would preclude the existence of a confining but chirally symmetric regime of QCD at high temperatures. We employ a well-known solvable quark model for QCD in 3+1 dimensions that is chirally symmetric and manifestly confining and argue that while confinement indeed induces dynamical breaking of chiral symmetry at T=0, a chiral restoration phase transition takes place at some critical temperature Tch. Above this temperature, the spectrum of the model consists of chirally symmetric hadrons with approximate chiral spin symmetry.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the exotic Landau problem at the classical level where two conserved quantities are derived. At the quantum level, the corresponding quantum operators of the conserved quantities provide two oscillator representations from which we derive two Boson Fock spaces. Using the normalized coherent states which are the minimum uncertainty states on non-commutative configuration space isomorphic to each of the boson Fock space, we form entangled coherent states which are Bell-like states labeled quasi-Bell states. The effect of non-maximality of a quasi-Bell state based quantum channel is investigated in the context of a teleportation of a qubit</description>

      <title>The Magic Number Conjecture for the $m=2$ amplituhedron and Parke-Taylor identities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The amplituhedron $\mathcal{A}_{n,k,m}$ is a geometric object introduced in the context of scattering amplitudes in $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang Mills. It generalizes the positive Grassmannian (when $n=k+m$), cyclic polytopes (when $k=1$), and the bounded complex of the cyclic hyperplane arrangement (when $m=1$). Of substantial interest are the tilings of the amplituhedron, which are analogous to triangulations of a polytope. Karp, Williams and Zhang (2020) observed that the known tilings of $\mathcal{A}_{n,k,2}$ have cardinality ${n-2 \choose k}$ and the known tilings of $\mathcal{A}_{n,k,4}$ have cardinality the Narayana number $\frac{1}{n-3}{n-3 \choose k+1}{n-3 \choose k}$; generalizing these observations, they conjectured that for even $m$ the tilings of $\mathcal{A}_{n, k,m}$ have cardinality the MacMahon number, the number of plane partitions which fit inside a $k \times (n-k-m) \times \frac{m}{2}$ box. We refer to this prediction as the `Magic Number Conjecture'. In this paper we prove the Magic Number Conjecture for the $m=2$ amplituhedron: that is, we show that each tiling of $\mathcal{A}_{n,k,2}$ has cardinality ${n-2 \choose k}$. We prove this by showing that all positroid tilings of the hypersimplex $\Delta_{k+1,n}$ have cardinality ${n-2 \choose k}$, then applying T-duality. In addition, we give combinatorial necessary conditions for tiles to form a tiling of $\mathcal{A}_{n,k,2}$; we give volume formulas for Parke-Taylor polytopes and certain positroid polytopes in terms of circular extensions of cyclic partial orders; and we prove new variants of the classical Parke-Taylor identities.</description>

      <title>Glue in hadrons at medium resolution and the QCD instanton vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss a general framework for the evaluation of the gluonic form factors in light hadrons at low momentum transfer, in the QCD instanton vacuum. At medium resolution of the order of the inverse mean instanton size, the glue is mostly localized in single or pair of pseudoparticles, and globally constrained by the fluctuations of their topological charges. These pseudoparticles trap light quarks, giving rise to emerging multiflavor 't Hooft interactions. We explicitly evaluate the gluonic scalar, pseudoscalar, energy-momentum tensor (EMT), and the leading C-odd and C-even three gluons hadronic form factors, at next to leading order (NLO) in the instanton density, including molecular clusters of like and unlike instantons. We use the results for the EMT to address the contribution of the gluons in Ji$^\prime$s mass and spin sum rules, at low resolution. When evolved, our results for the mass and spin composition of the nucleon, are shown to be in good agreement with the recently reported lattice results at higher resolution.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate how table-top settings combining hyperbolic lattices with nonlinear dynamics universally lead to a genuine realization of the bulk-boundary-correspondence between gravity in anti-de-Sitter (AdS) space and conformal field theory (CFT). Our concrete and broadly applicable holographic toy model simulates gravitational self-interactions in the bulk and features an emergent CFT with nontrivial correlations on the boundary. We measure the CFT data contained in the two- and three-point functions and clarify how a thermal CFT is simulated through an effective black hole geometry. As a concrete example, we propose and simulate an experimentally feasible protocol to measure the holographic CFT using electrical circuits.</description>

      <title>On bipartite and tripartite entanglement at present and future particle colliders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entanglement, rooted in the non-deterministic, non-local nature of quantum mechanics, serves as a fundamental correlation. High-energy particle colliders offer a unique platform for exploring entanglement in the relativistic regime. The recent observation of entanglement in $t\bar{t}$ production by ATLAS has sparked significant interest in investigating entanglement phenomena at colliders. While bipartite entanglement receives extensive attention, tripartite entanglement remains relatively uncharted. We investigate tripartite entanglement in $t\bar{t}Z$ production at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) within the Standard Model and with a dimension-$8$ effective operator. Additionally, we explore bipartite entanglement in $t\bar{t}$, $tW^-$, and di-boson production processes, namely $W^+W^-$, $ZZ$, and $W^+Z$, at the LHC and future $e^+e^-$ collider. We numerically compute various measures of entanglement through Monte Carlo events based on the spin density matrix, with its elements (polarization and spin correlation) obtained by analyzing the angular distribution of the final decayed leptons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider head-on collisions of two particles near the event horizon. Particle 1 is outgoing, particle 2 is ingoing. We elucidate, in which case the energy $E_{c.m.}$ in the center of mass frame can grow unbounded. If the proper time between the horizon and an arbitrary point outside it for particle 1 is finite, we deal with a white hole. If it is infinite, we deal with a black hole. Particles can be either free or experience the action of a finite force. Our results are complementary to those for the standard BSW effect when particles move in the same direction. The results rely on classification of particles developed in our previous work H.V. Ovcharenko, O.B. Zaslavskii, Phys. Rev. D 108, 064029 (2023).</description>

Abstract: The Riemann-Hilbert approach, in conjunction with the canonical Wiener-Hopf factorisation of certain matrix functions called monodromy matrices, enables one to obtain explicit solutions to the non-linear field equations of some gravitational theories. These solutions are encoded in the elements of a matrix $M$ depending on the Weyl coordinates $\rho$ and $v$, determined by that factorisation. We address here, for the first time, the underlying question of what happens when a canonical Wiener-Hopf factorisation does not exist, using the close connection of Wiener-Hopf factorisation with Toeplitz operators to study this question. For the case of rational monodromy matrices, we prove that the non-existence of a canonical Wiener-Hopf factorisation determines curves in the $(\rho,v)$ plane on which some elements of $M(\rho,v)$ tend to infinity, but where the space-time metric may still be well behaved. In the case of uncharged rotating black holes in four space-time dimensions and, for certain choices of coordinates, in five space-time dimensions, we show that these curves correspond to their ergosurfaces.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial Dyson-Schwinger Equations of Quartic Matrix Field Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Matrix field theory is a combinatorially non-local field theory which has recently been found to be a non-trivial but solvable QFT example. To generalize such non-perturbative structures to other models, a more combinatorial understanding of Dyson-Schwinger equations and their solutions is of high interest. To this end we consider combinatorial Dyson-Schwinger equations manifestly relying on the Hopf-algebraic structure of perturbative renormalization. We find that these equations are fully compatible with renormalization, relying only on the superficially divergent diagrams which are planar ribbon graphs, i.e. decompleted dual combinatorial maps. Still, they are of a similar kind as in realistic models of local QFT, featuring in particular an infinite number of primitive diagrams as well as graph-dependent combinatorial factors.</description>

      <title>Quantum querying based on multicontrolled Toffoli gates for causal Feynman loop configurations and directed acyclic graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum algorithms are a promising framework for a proper treatment of Feynman loop integrals due to the existence of a manifestly causal representation scenario. Particularly, unfolding causal configurations of multiloop Feynman diagrams is understood as querying \textit{directed acyclic graph} (DAG) configurations of undirected graphs in graph theory. In this paper we present a quantum algorithm for querying causality of multiloop Feynman diagrams using an ingenious change in the logic of the design of the oracle operator. The construction of the quantum oracle is surprisingly based exclusively on multicontrolled Toffoli gates and XNOT gates. The efficiency of the algorithm is evaluated performing a comparison with a quantum algorithm based on binary clauses. Additionally, we explicitly analise several three-, four- and five-eloop topologies, which have not been previously explored due to their higher complexity.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the Dirac spectrum from chiral symmetry restoration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I derive constraints on the Dirac spectrum in the chirally symmetric phase of a gauge theory with two massless fermion flavors. Using only general properties of correlation functions of scalar and pseudoscalar bilinears, I prove that in the chiral limit of vanishing quark mass $m$ all the corresponding susceptibilities must be power series in $m^2$ with finite coefficients, from which spectral constraints follow. I then use them to show that effective breaking of the anomalous $\mathrm{U}(1)_A$ symmetry is allowed in the $\mathrm{SU}(2)_A$ symmetric phase in the chiral limit, and leads to distinctive spectral features: (i) the spectral density must develop a singular $m^4/\lambda$ peak as $m\to 0$, (ii) the two-point eigenvalue correlator of near-zero modes must be singular, and (iii) near-zero modes cannot be localized. Moreover, in the symmetric phase the topological charge distribution must be indistinguishable from that of an ideal gas of instantons and anti-instantons of vanishing density, to leading order in the fermion mass.</description>

      <title>Deformation-induced CPT violation in entangled pairs of neutral kaons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider description of kaon -- anti-kaon interference in the context of a theory with deformed $\cal CPT$ symmetry. In the case of such theoretical models, deviations from the standard $\cal CPT$ invariance is related to the momentum carried by the particles; in particular the rest masses of particles and antiparticles are equal. We find that the decay intensity of kaon -- anti-kaon pair has three contributing terms: the correct-parity, the wrong-parity, and the interference between them, all of which are affected by deformation. Using the fact that the presence of such terms were not observed we estimate the magnitude of deformation parameter $\kappa \gtrsim 10^{18}$ GeV, very close to the expected Planck mass scale. This raises hopes that the effect, if exists, could be detected in a near future accelerator experiments. An uncertainty of the energy measurement is crucial for accuracy of these predictions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.08850v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the recently proposed equations for holomorphic sector of higher-spin theory in $d=4$, also known as chiral, can be naturally extended to describe interacting symmetric higher-spin gauge fields in any dimension. This is achieved with the aid of Vasiliev's off shell higher-spin algebra. The latter contains ideal associated to traces that has to be factored out in order to set the equations on shell. To identify the ideal in interactions we observe the global $sp(2)$ that underlies it to all orders. The $sp(2)$ field dependent generators are found in closed form and appear to be remarkably simple. The traceful higher-spin vertices are analyzed against locality and shown to be all-order space-time spin-local in the gauge sector, as well as spin-local in the Weyl sector. The vertices are found manifestly in the form of curious integrals over hypersimplices. We also extend to any $d$ the earlier observed in $d=4$ higher-spin shift symmetry known to be tightly related to spin-locality.</description>

      <title>Parisi's hypercube, Fock-space fluxes, and the microscopics of near-AdS$_2$/near-CFT$_1$ duality</title>

Abstract: Parisi's hypercube model describes a charged particle hopping on a $d$-dimensional hypercube with disordered background fluxes in the large $d$ limit. It was noted previously [Jia and Verbaarschot, J. High Energy Phys. 11 (2020) 154] that the hypercube model at leading order in $1/d$ has the same spectral density as the double-scaled Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (DS-SYK) model. In this work we identify the set of observables that have the same correlation functions as the DS-SYK model, demonstrating that the hypercube model is an equally good microscopic model for near-AdS$_2$/near-CFT$_1$ holography. Unlike the SYK model, the hypercube model is not $p$-local. Rather, we note that the shared feature between the two models is that they both have a large amount of disordered but uniform fluxes on their Fock-space graphs, and we propose this is a broader characterization of near-CFT$_1$ microscopics. Moreover, we suggest that the hypercube model can be viewed as the operator growth model of the DS-SYK model. We explain some universality in subleading corrections and relate them to bulk vertices. Finally, we revise a claim made the aforementioned reference about the existence of a spectral gap.</description>

Abstract: The solution of Bethe ansatz equations for XXZ spin chain with the parameter $q$ being a root of unity is infamously subtle. In this work, we develop the rational $Q$-system for this case, which offers a systematic way to find all physical solutions of the Bethe ansatz equations at root of unity. The construction contains two parts. In the first part, we impose additional constraints to the rational $Q$-system. These constraints eliminate the so-called Fabricius-McCoy (FM) string solutions, yielding all primitive solutions. In the second part, we give a simple procedure to construct the descendant tower of any given primitive state. The primitive solutions together with their descendant towers constitute the complete Hilbert space. We test our proposal by extensive numerical checks and apply it to compute the torus partition function of the 6-vertex model at root of unity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17558v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In two-dimensional critical loop models, including the $O(n)$ and Potts models, the spectrum is exactly known, as are a few structure constants or ratios thereof. Using numerical conformal bootstrap methods, we study $235$ of the simplest 4-point structure constants. For each structure constant, we find an analytic expression as a product of two factors: 1) a universal function of conformal dimensions, built from Barnes' double Gamma function, and 2) a polynomial function of loop weights, whose degree obeys a simple upper bound. We conjecture that all structure constants are of this form.
  For a few 4-point functions, we build corresponding observables in a lattice loop model. From numerical lattice results, we extract amplitude ratios that depend neither on the lattice size nor on the lattice coupling. These ratios agree with the corresponding ratios of 4-point structure constants.</description>

      <title>On the IR Divergences in de Sitter Space: loops, resummation and the semi-classical wavefunction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17990v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we revisit the infrared (IR) divergences in de Sitter (dS) space using the wavefunction method, and explicitly explore how the resummation of higher-order loops leads to the stochastic formalism. In light of recent developments of the cosmological bootstrap, we track the behaviour of these nontrivial IR effects from perturbation theory to the non-perturbative regime. Specifically, we first examine the perturbative computation of wavefunction coefficients, and show that there is a clear distinction between classical components from tree-level diagrams and quantum ones from loop processes. Cosmological correlators at loop level receive contributions from tree-level wavefunction coefficients, which we dub classical loops. This distinction significantly simplifies the analysis of loop-level IR divergences, as we find the leading contributions always come from these classical loops. Then we compare with correlators from the perturbative stochastic computation, and find the results there are essentially the ones from classical loops, while quantum loops are only present as subleading corrections. This demonstrates that the leading IR effects are contained in the semi-classical wavefunction which is a resummation of all the tree-level diagrams. With this insight, we go beyond perturbation theory and present a new derivation of the stochastic formalism using the saddle-point approximation. We show that the Fokker-Planck equation follows as a consequence of two effects: the drift from the Schr\"odinger equation that describes the bulk time evolution, and the diffusion from the Polchinski's equation which corresponds to the exact renormalization group flow of the coarse-grained theory on the boundary. Our analysis highlights the precise and simple link between the stochastic formalism and the semi-classical wavefunction.</description>

      <title>Generalized Freudenthal duality for rotating extremal black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10767v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Freudenthal duality (FD) is a non-linear symmetry of the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of extremal dyonic black holes (BHs) in Maxwell-Einstein-scalar theories in four space-time dimensions realized as an anti-involutive map in the symplectic space of electric-magnetic BH charges. In this paper, we generalize FD to the class of rotating (stationary) extremal BHs, both in the under- and over-rotating regime, defining a (generalized) rotating FD (generally, non-anti-involutive) map (RFD), which also acts on the BH angular momentum. We prove that the RFD map is unique, and we compute the explicit expression of its non-linear action on the angular momentum itself. Interestingly, in the non-rotating limit, RFD bifurcates into the usual, non-rotating FD branch and into a spurious branch, named "golden" branch, mapping a non-rotating (static) extremal BH to an under-rotating (stationary) extremal BH, in which the ratio between the angular momentum and the non-rotating entropy is the square root of the golden ratio. Finally, we investigate the possibility of inducing transitions between the under- and over-rotating regimes by means of RFD, obtaining a no-go result.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11238v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the scaling limit of a statistical system, which is a special case of the integrable inhomogeneous six-vertex model. It possesses $U_q\big(\mathfrak{sl}(2)\big)$ invariance due to the choice of open boundary conditions imposed. An interesting feature of the lattice theory is that the spectrum of scaling dimensions contains a continuous component. By applying the ODE/IQFT correspondence and the method of the Baxter $Q$ operator the corresponding density of states is obtained. In addition, the partition function appearing in the scaling limit of the lattice model is computed, which may be of interest for the study of nonrational CFTs in the presence of boundaries. As a side result of the research, a simple formula for the matrix elements of the $Q$ operator for the general, integrable, inhomogeneous six-vertex model was discovered, that has not yet appeared in the literature. It is valid for a certain one parameter family of diagonal open boundary conditions in the sector with the $z\,$-projection of the total spin operator being equal to zero.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11133v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been shown that by using a Lagrange multiplier field to ensure that the classical equations of motion are satisfied, radiative effects beyond one-loop order are eliminated. It has also been shown that through the contribution of some additional ghost fields, the effective action becomes form invariant under a redefinition of field variables, and furthermore, the usual one-loop results coincide with the quantum corrections obtained from this effective action. In this paper, we consider the consequences of a gauge invariance being present in the classical action. The resulting gauge transformations for the Lagrange multiplier field as well as for the additional ghost fields are found. These gauge transformations result in a set of Faddeev-Popov ghost fields arising in the effective action. If the gauge algebra is closed, we find the Becci-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) transformations that leave the effective action invariant.</description>

Abstract: We study closed universes in simple models of two dimensional gravity, such as Jackiw-Teiteilboim (JT) gravity coupled to matter, and a toy topological model that captures the key features of the former. We find there is a stark contrast, as well as some connections, between the perturbative and non-perturbative aspects of the theory. We find rich semi-classical physics. However, when non-perturbative effects are included there is a unique closed universe state in each theory. We discuss possible meanings and interpretations of this observation.</description>

      <title>New Well-Posed Boundary Conditions for Semi-Classical Euclidean Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04308v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider four-dimensional Euclidean gravity in a finite cavity. Dirichlet conditions do not yield a well-posed elliptic system, and Anderson has suggested boundary conditions that do. Here we point out that there exists a one-parameter family of boundary conditions, parameterized by a constant $p$, where a suitably Weyl rescaled boundary metric is fixed, and all give a well-posed elliptic system. Anderson and Dirichlet boundary conditions can be seen as the limits $p \to 0$ and $\infty$ of these. Focussing on static Euclidean solutions, we derive a thermodynamic first law. Restricting to a spherical spatial boundary, the infillings are flat space or the Schwarzschild solution, and have similar thermodynamics to the Dirichlet case. We consider smooth Euclidean fluctuations about the flat space saddle; for $p &gt; 1/6$ the spectrum of the Lichnerowicz operator is stable -- its eigenvalues have positive real part. Thus we may regard large $p$ as a regularization of the ill-posed Dirichlet boundary conditions. However for $p &lt; 1/6$ there are unstable modes, even in the spherically symmetric and static sector. We then turn to Lorentzian signature. For $p &lt; 1/6$ we may understand this spherical Euclidean instability as being paired with a Lorentzian instability associated with the dynamics of the boundary itself. However, a mystery emerges when we consider perturbations that break spherical symmetry. Here we find a plethora of dynamically unstable modes even for $p &gt; 1/6$, contrasting starkly with the Euclidean stability we found. Thus we seemingly obtain a system with stable thermodynamics, but unstable dynamics, calling into question the standard assumption of smoothness that we have implemented when discussing the Euclidean theory.</description>

Abstract: In this short review we present the key definitions, ideas and techniques involved in the study of symmetry resolved entanglement measures, with a focus on the symmetry resolved entanglement entropy. In order to be able to define such entanglement measures, it is essential that the theory under study possess an internal symmetry. Then, symmetry resolved entanglement measures quantify the contribution to a particular entanglement measure that can be associated to a chosen symmetry sector. Our review focuses on conformal (gapless/massless/critical) and integrable (gapped/massive) quantum field theories, where the leading computational technique employs symmetry fields known as (composite) branch point twist fields.</description>

      <title>Particle-Soliton Degeneracies from Spontaneously Broken Non-Invertible Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08883v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study non-invertible topological symmetry operators in massive quantum field theories in (1+1) dimensions. In phases where this symmetry is spontaneously broken we show that the particle spectrum often has degeneracies dictated by the non-invertible symmetry and we deduce a procedure to determine the allowed multiplets. These degeneracies are robust predictions and do not require integrability or other special features of renormalization group flows. We exhibit these conclusions in examples where the spectrum is known, recovering soliton and particle degeneracies. For instance, the Tricritical Ising model deformed by the subleading Z2 odd operator flows to a gapped phase with two degenerate vacua. This flow enjoys a Fibonacci fusion category symmetry which implies a threefold degeneracy of its particle states, relating the mass of solitons interpolating between vacua and particles supported in a single vacuum.</description>

      <title>Trivalent Feynman Diagrams as a Flag</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19290v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We exploit the flag and Orlik-Solomon algebra to reconstruct the intersection number of twisted cocycles and obtain the bi-adjoint amplitude. By studying the pairing of the special flag, we find that it results to Cachao-He-Yuan representation of the bi-adjoint amplitude. Through identifying each standard flag with Feynman trivalent diagram, in which the propagatoris bilinear form of the flag $S^{(a)(F_m,F_m)}$, we also find the geometry interpretation of Bern-Carrasco-Johansson duality discovered by Mizera as the identity of flag with a gap. According to the definition of flag simplex, we also construct the Z-amplitude in the $\alpha^{\prime} \rightarrow 0 $ limit.</description>

      <title>On AdS$_3$/ICFT$_2$ with a dynamical scalar field located on the brane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20102v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We exploit holographic duality to study the system of a one-dimensional interface contacting two semi-infinite two-dimensional CFTs. Central to our investigation is the introduction of a dynamical scalar field located on the bulk interface brane which breaks the scaling symmetry of the dual interface field theory, along with its consequential backreaction on the system. We define an interface entropy from holographic entanglement entropy. At zero temperature we construct several illustrative examples and observe that the $g$-theorem is always satisfied. These examples also reveal distinct features of the interface entropy that are intricately linked to the scalar potential profiles. At finite temperature we find that the dynamical scalar field enables the bulk theory to have new configurations which would be infeasible solely with a tension term on the interface brane.</description>

      <title>Nonabelian Hodge theory for stacks and a stacky P=W conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.10830v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a version of the P=W conjecture relating the Borel-Moore homology of the stack of representations of the fundamental group of a genus g Riemann surface with the Borel-Moore homology of the stack of degree zero semistable Higgs bundles on a smooth projective complex curve of genus $g$. In order to state the conjecture we propose a construction of a canonical isomorphism between these Borel-Moore homology groups. We relate the stacky P=W conjecture with the original P=W conjecture concerning the cohomology of smooth moduli spaces of twisted objects, and the PI=WI conjecture concerning the intersection cohomology groups of singular moduli spaces of untwisted objects. In genus zero and one, we prove the conjectures that we introduce in this paper.</description>

      <title>Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev invariants and homological blocks for plumbed homology spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.01282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.01282v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove a conjecture by Gukov-Pei-Putrov-Vafa for a wide class of plumbed 3-manifolds. Their conjecture states that Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev (WRT) invariants are radial limits of homological blocks, which are $ q $-series introduced by them for plumbed 3-manifolds with negative definite linking matrices. The most difficult point in our proof is to prove the vanishing of weighted Gauss sums that appear in coefficients of negative degree in asymptotic expansions of homological blocks. To deal with it, we develop a new technique for asymptotic expansions, which enables us to compare asymptotic expansions of rational functions and false theta functions related to WRT invariants and homological blocks, respectively. In our technique, our vanishing results follow from holomorphy of such rational functions.</description>

      <title>Left-Right Symmetry Breaking and Gravitational Waves : A Tale of Two Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.05829v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study possible ways gravitational waves (GW) are sourced in a theory with minimal left-right symmetry breaking. Generically first order phase transitions (FOPT) lead to gravitational waves sourced by bubble collisions, while second order phase transitions (SOPT) do not. However, due the presence of two degenerate fields, we obtain domain walls in the putative SOPT case, giving rise to GW via decaying domain walls, testable at experiments such as IPTA, DECIGO, and LISA. On the other hand, for the case of FOPT, we get the usual signal from spontaneously created bubbles, but also a late forming domain wall structure separating the two types of vacua. Thus the traditional FOPT case gives rise to two distinct peaks in the spectrum of GW, verifiable for the low symmetry breaking scales $10^4 - 10^6$ GeV, but beyond the reach of currently planned experiments for a high scale $\sim10^{10}$ GeV. Finally, we point out that a version of the left-right symmetric model which separates parity breaking from gauge symmetry breaking is also subject to domain wall formation and amenable to GW observations.</description>

      <title>The Possibility of Tachyons as Soliton Solutions in 3+1 Dimensions via k-field Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.14380v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tachyons or hypothetical faster-than-light (FTL) particles would fail the principle of causality. Such particles may only be imagined when they have no energy and momentum and, thus, no observable interaction. In this paper, we show that the classical relativistic field theory with non-standard Lagrangian densities (k-field models) does not rule out the existence of FTL particle-like solutions (solitons) with zero energy and momentum in 3+1 dimensions. However, contrary to our expectation, we show that it is possible to have k-field models that lead to energetic FTL soliton solutions in 3+1 dimensions.</description>

      <title>Diagnosing non-Hermitian Many-Body Localization and Quantum Chaos via Singular Value Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16229v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strong local disorder in interacting quantum spin chains can turn delocalized eigenmodes into localized eigenstates, giving rise to many-body localized (MBL) phases. This is accompanied by distinct spectral statistics: chaotic for the delocalized phase and integrable for the localized phase. In isolated systems, localization and chaos are defined through a web of relations among eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and real-time dynamics. These may change as the system is made open. We ask whether random dissipation (without random disorder) can induce chaotic or localized behavior in an otherwise integrable system. The dissipation is described using non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, which can effectively be obtained from Markovian dynamics conditioned on null measurement. Through the use of the singular value decomposition and the introduction of new diagnostic tools complementing the singular-value statistics, namely, the singular form factor, the inverse participation ratio, and entanglement entropy for singular vectors, we provide a positive answer. Our method is illustrated in an XXZ Hamiltonian with random local dissipation.</description>

      <title>Comment on "The Tully-Fisher law and dark matter effects derived via modified symmetries" by Arraut Ivan</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00081v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been claimed in I. Arraut, 2023 EPL 144 29003 [arXiv:2311.05652] that General Relativity can generate effects equivalent to dark matter, based on a "new modified symmetry that emerges at galactic scale". We show that (i) the spacetime considered is unphysical, violating energy conditions everywhere; (ii) actually no new symmetry emerges, which results from incorrect definitions of angular momentum, velocity, and arclength in the proposed geometry; (iii) no Tully-Fisher law, or flat rotation curves are obtained either, they simply result from a series of errors in the equations.</description>

      <title>The split 5-Casimir operator and the structure of $\wedge \mathfrak{ad}^{\otimes 5}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01038v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the present paper, using the split Casimir operators we have found the decomposition of the antisymmetric part of $\mathfrak{ad}^{\otimes 5}$. This decomposition contains the representations that appeared in the decomposition of $\mathfrak{ad}^{\otimes 4}$ and only one new representation $X_5$. The dimension of this representation has been proposed in [A.J.Macfarlane, H.Pfeiffer, J.Phys.A: Math. Gen. 36 (2003) 2305]. Our decomposition is valid for all Lie algebras.</description>
