      <title>Non-obvious manipulability in division problems with general preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In problems involving the allocation of a single non-disposable commodity, we study rules defined on a general domain of preferences requiring only that each preference exhibit a unique global maximum. Our focus is on rules that satisfy a relaxed form of strategy-proofness, known as non-obvious manipulability. We show that the combination of efficiency and non-obvious manipulability leads to impossibility results, whereas weakening efficiency to unanimity gives rise to a large family of well-behaved non-obviously manipulable rules.</description>

      <title>Continue the Analogy of Physics and Economics. Self-induced Transparency Mechanism as an Invisible Hand of Market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a unified framework in which economic dynamics is treated as evolutionary process analogous to those studied in natural sciences, including physics. Using methods from gauge field theory and plasticity, we show that the traditionally elusive influence of the invisible hand in economic markets can be made explicit and mathematically tractable. Derived equations demonstrate that market adaptation proceeds through localized nonlinear waves processes, closely resembling self-induced transparency in electrodynamics. Taken together, the results provide a physically grounded interpretation of the invisible hand as a real, dynamically operating field mechanism governed by choice, competition, and profit.</description>

      <title>The comparative statics of dominance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In finite problems comprising objects, situations, and an object- and situation-contingent payoff function, we study the comparative statics of the set of undominated objects, meaning those for which there exists no mixture over objects that is superior whatever the situation. We consider both weak and strict dominance (corresponding to different degrees of 'strictness' in the definition of superiority). Our main theorem characterises those payoff transformations which robustly expand the not-weakly-dominated and not-strictly-dominated sets: the necessary and sufficient condition is that payoffs be transformed separately across situations, in either a monotone-concave or a constant manner. We apply our results to Pareto frontiers and games.</description>

      <title>Differences and Connections Between Individual (Leontief Type) Activities and Aggregate (Cobb-Douglas Type) Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Each production establishment is assumed to have, at any given time, a unique combination of capital and labor (a Leontief function), but the aggregate output at that same time must still be modeled with a Cobb-Douglas function (or a CES, although the latter yields less efficiency). This has two implications: 1) the total factor productivity variable of the macroeconomic function is endogenous: It depends primarily on the technical factors of the individual establishments and, secondarily, on their levels of capital and labor.; 2) the optimization processes of any establishment cannot be instantaneous, even in the absence of (monetary) adjustment costs; they are processes occurring over several time stages and depending on expectations. However, these implications do not substantially contradict what would correspond to the optimization of a hypothetical firm described by a Cobb-Douglas (or CES) function.</description>

      <title>Satisficing Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00832v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce satisficing equilibrium, where each agent chooses one of her top $k_i$ actions. The concept unifies models of bounded rationality and yields predictions that differ from canonical solution concepts. We study its precision, existence, epistemic and dynamic foundations, as well as its empirical content.</description>

      <title>Spatial-Network Treatment Effects: A Continuous Functional Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12653v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a continuous functional framework for treatment effects that propagate through geographic space and economic networks. We derive a master equation governing propagation from three economic foundations -- heterogeneous agent aggregation, market equilibrium, and cost minimization -- establishing that the framework rests on fundamental principles rather than ad hoc specifications. A key result shows that the spatial-network interaction coefficient equals the mutual information between geographic and market coordinates. The Feynman-Kac representation decomposes effects into inherited and accumulated components along stochastic paths representing economic linkages. The framework nests the no-spillover case as a testable restriction. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that conventional estimators -- two-way fixed effects, difference-in-differences, and generalized propensity score -- exhibit 25-38% bias and severe undercoverage when spillovers exist, while our estimator maintains correct inference regardless of whether spillovers are present. Applying the framework to U.S. minimum wage policy, we reject the no-spillover null and find total effects at state borders four times larger than direct effects -- conventional methods capture only one-quarter of policy impact. Structural estimates reveal spatial diffusion consistent with commuting-distance labor mobility, network diffusion consistent with quarterly supply chain adjustment, and significant spatial-network interaction reflecting geographic clustering of industries.</description>
