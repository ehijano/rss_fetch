      <title>PT and anti-PT symmetries for astrophysical waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context: Discrete symmetries have found numerous applications in photonics and quantum mechanics, but remain little studied in fluid mechanics, particularly in astrophysics. Aims: We aim to show how PT and anti-PT symmetries determine the behaviour of linear perturbations in a wide class of astrophysical problems. They set the location of Exceptional Points in the parameter space and the associated transitions to instability, and are associated to the conservation of quadratic quantities that can be determined explicitly. Methods: We study several classical local problems: the gravitational instability of isothermal spheres and thin discs, the Schwarzschild instability, the Rayleigh-B\'enard instability and acoustic waves in dust-gas mixtures. We calculate the locations and the order of the Exceptional Points with a method of resultant, as well as the conserved quantities in the different regions of the parameter space using Krein theory. Results: All problems studied here exhibit discrete symmetries, even though Hermiticity is broken by different physical processes (self-gravity, buoyancy, diffusion, drag). This analysis provides genuine explanations for certain instabilities, and for the existence of regions in the parameter space where waves do not propagate. Those correspond to breaking of PT and anti-PT symmetries respectively. Not all instabilities are associated to symmetry breaking (e.g. the Rayleigh-Benard instability).</description>

      <title>Two dimensional potential theory with a view towards vortex motion: Energy, capacity and Green functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper reviews some parts of classical potential theory with applications to two dimensional fluid dynamics, in particular vortex motion. Energy and forces within a system of point vortices are similar to those for point charges when the vortices are kept fixed, but the dynamics is different in the case of free vortices. Starting from Bernoulli's equation we derive these laws. Letting the number of vortices tend to infinity leads in the limit to considerations of capacity, harmonic measure and many other notions in potential theory. In particular various kinds of Green functions have a central role in the paper, where we make a difference between electrostatic and hydrodynamic Green function.
  We also consider the corresponding concepts in the case of closed Riemann surfaces provided with a metric. From a canonically defined monopole Green function we rederive much of the classical theory of harmonic and analytic forms. In the final section of the paper we return to the planar case, then reappearing in form of a symmetric Riemann surface, the Schottky double. Bergman kernels, electrostatic and hydrodynamic, come up naturally, and associated to the Green function the is a certain Robin function which is important for vortex motion and which also relates to capacity functions in classical potential theory.</description>

      <title>Homogenized Lattice Boltzmann Model for Simulating Multi-Phase Flows in Heterogeneous Porous Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.11524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.11524v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new homogenization approach for the simulation of multi-phase flows in heterogeneous porous media is presented. It is based on the lattice Boltzmann method and combines the grayscale with the multi-component Shan-Chen method. Thus, it mimics fluid-fluid and solid-fluid interactions also within pores that are smaller than the numerical discretization. The model is successfully tested for a broad variety of single- and two-phase flow problems. Additionally, its application to multi-scale and multi-phase flow problems in porous media is demonstrated using the electrolyte filling process of realistic 3D lithium-ion battery electrode microstructures as an example. The new method shows advantages over comparable methods from literature. The interfacial tension and wetting conditions are independent and not affected by the homogenization. Moreover, all physical properties studied here are continuous even across interfaces of porous media. The method is consistent with the original multi-component Shan-Chen method. It is accurate, efficient, easy to implement, and can be applied to many research fields, especially where multi-phase fluid flow occurs in heterogeneous and multi-scale porous media.</description>

      <title>A one-dimensional mathematical model for shear-induced droplet formation in co-flowing fluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.01308v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Shear-induced droplet formation is important in many industrial applications, primarily focusing on droplet sizes and pinch-off frequency. We propose a one-dimensional mathematical model that describes the effect of shear forces on the droplet interface evolution. The aim of this paper is to simulate paraffin wax droplets in a co-flowing fluid using the proposed model to estimate the droplet volume rate for different flow velocities. Thus, the study focuses only on the dripping regime. This one-dimensional model has a single parameter that arises from the force balance on the interface. We use PETSc, an open-source solver toolkit, to implement our model using a mixed finite element discretization. The parameter is defined by cross-validation from previous computational and experimental data. We present the simulation results for liquid paraffin wax under fast-moving airflow with a range of velocities.</description>

      <title>General hydrodynamic features of elastoviscoplastic fluid flows through randomised porous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.07435v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A numerical study of yield-stress fluids flowing in porous media is presented. The porous media is randomly constructed by non-overlapping mono-dispersed circular obstacles. Two class of rheological models are investigated: elastoviscoplastic fluids (i.e. Saramito model) and viscoplastic fluids (i.e. Bingham model). A wide range of practical Weissenberg and Bingham numbers is studied at three different levels of porosities of the media. The emphasis is on revealing some physical transport mechanisms of yield-stress fluids in porous media when the elastic behaviour of this kind of fluids is incorporated. Thus, computations of elastoviscoplastic fluids are performed and are compared with the viscoplastic fluid flow properties. At a constant Weissenberg number, the pressure drop increases both with the Bingham number and the solid volume fraction of obstacles. However, the effect of elasticity is less trivial. At low Bingham numbers, the pressure drop of an elastoviscoplastic fluid increases compared to a viscoplastic fluid, while at high Bingham numbers we observe drag reduction by elasticity. At the yield limit (i.e. infinitely large Bingham numbers), elasticity of the fluid systematically promotes yielding: elastic stresses help the fluid to overcome the yield stress resistance at smaller pressure gradients. We observe that elastic effects increase with both Weissenberg and Bingham numbers. In both cases, elastic effects finally make the elastoviscoplastic flow unsteady, which consequently can result in chaos and turbulence.

      <title>Mixing as a correlated aggregation process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.14040v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mixing describes the process by which solutes evolve from an initial heterogeneous state to uniformity under the stirring action of a fluid flow. Fluid stretching forms thin scalar lamellae which coalesce due to molecular diffusion. Owing to the linearity of the advection-diffusion equation, coalescence can be envisioned as an aggregation process. Here, we demonstrate that in smooth two-dimensional chaotic flows, mixing obeys a correlated aggregation process, where the spatial distribution of the number of lamellae in aggregates is highly correlated with their elongation and is set by the fractal properties of the advected material lines. We show that the presence of correlations makes mixing less efficient than a completely random aggregation process because lamellae with similar elongations and scalar levels tend to remain isolated from each other. We show that correlated aggregation is uniquely determined by a single exponent which quantifies the effective number of random aggregation events. These findings expand aggregation theories to a larger class of systems, which have relevance to various fundamental and applied mixing problems.</description>

      <title>Variational assimilation of sparse time-averaged data for efficient adjoint-based optimization of unsteady RANS simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12635v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data assimilation (DA) plays a crucial role in extracting valuable information from flow measurements in fluid dynamics problems. Often only time-averaged data is available, which poses challenges for DA in the context of unsteady flow problems. Recent works have shown promising results in optimizing Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations of stationary flows using sparse data through variational data assimilation, enabling the reconstruction of mean flow profiles.
  In this study we perform three-dimensional variational data assimilation of sparse time-averaged data into an unsteady RANS (URANS) simulation by means of a stationary divergence-free forcing term in the URANS equations. Efficiency and speed of our method are enhanced by employing coarse URANS simulations and leveraging the stationary discrete adjoint method for the time-averaged URANS equations. The data assimilation codes were developed in-house using OpenFOAM for the URANS simulations as well as for the solution of the adjoint problem, and Python for the gradient-based optimization.
  Our results demonstrate that data assimilation of sparse time-averaged velocity measurements not only enables accurate mean flow reconstruction, but also improves the flow dynamics, specifically the vortex shedding frequency. To validate the efficacy of our approach, we applied it to turbulent flows around cylinders of various shapes at Reynolds numbers ranging from 3000 to 22000. Our findings indicate that data points near the cylinder play a crucial role in improving the vortex shedding frequency, while additional data points further downstream are necessary to also reconstruct the time-averaged velocity field in the wake region.</description>

      <title>A hyperbolic-elliptic PDE model and conservative numerical method for gravity-dominated variably-saturated groundwater flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.04724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.04724v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Richards equation is often used to represent two-phase fluid flow in an unsaturated porous medium when one phase is much heavier and more viscous than the other. However, it cannot describe the fully saturated flow for some capillary functions without specialized treatment due to degeneracy in the capillary pressure term. Mathematically, gravity-dominated variably saturated flows are interesting because their governing partial differential equation switches from hyperbolic in the unsaturated region to elliptic in the saturated region. Moreover, the presence of wetting fronts introduces strong spatial gradients often leading to numerical instability. In this work, we develop a robust, multidimensional mathematical model and implement a well-known efficient and conservative numerical method for such variably saturated flow in the limit of negligible capillary forces. The elliptic problem in saturated regions is integrated efficiently into our framework by solving a reduced system corresponding only to the saturated cells using fixed head boundary conditions in the unsaturated cells. In summary, this coupled hyperbolic-elliptic PDE framework provides an efficient, physics-based extension of the hyperbolic Richards equation to simulate fully saturated regions. Finally, we provide a suite of easy-to-implement yet challenging benchmark test problems involving saturated flows in one and two dimensions. These simple problems, accompanied by their corresponding analytical solutions, can prove to be pivotal for the code verification, model validation (V&amp;V) and performance comparison of simulators for variably saturated flow. Our numerical solutions show an excellent comparison with the analytical results for the proposed problems. The last test problem on two-dimensional infiltration in a stratified, heterogeneous soil shows the formation and evolution of multiple disconnected saturated regions.</description>

      <title>Boundary Treatment for Variational Quantum Simulations of Partial Differential Equations on Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18619v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The paper presents a variational quantum algorithm to solve initial-boundary value problems described by second-order partial differential equations. The approach uses hybrid classical/quantum hardware that is well suited for quantum computers of the current noisy intermediate-scale quantum era. The partial differential equation is initially translated into an optimal control problem with a modular control-to-state operator (ansatz). The objective function and its derivatives required by the optimizer can efficiently be evaluated on a quantum computer by measuring an ancilla qubit, while the optimization procedure employs classical hardware. The focal aspect of the study is the treatment of boundary conditions, which is tailored to the properties of the quantum hardware using a correction technique. For this purpose, the boundary conditions and the discretized terms of the partial differential equation are decomposed into a sequence of unitary operations and subsequently compiled into quantum gates. The accuracy and gate complexity of the approach are assessed for second-order partial differential equations by classically emulating the quantum hardware. The examples include steady and unsteady diffusive transport equations for a scalar property in combination with various Dirichlet, Neumann, or Robin conditions. The results of this flexible approach display a robust behavior and a strong predictive accuracy in combination with a remarkable polylog complexity scaling in the number of qubits of the involved quantum circuits. Remaining challenges refer to adaptive ansatz strategies that speed up the optimization procedure.</description>
