      <title>DeepBioisostere: Discovering Bioisosteres with Deep Learning for a Fine Control of Multiple Molecular Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimizing molecules to improve their properties is a fundamental challenge in drug design. For a fine-tuning of molecular properties without losing bio-activity validated in advance, the concept of bioisosterism has emerged. Many in silico methods have been proposed for discovering bioisosteres, but they require expert knowledge for their applications or are restricted to known databases. Here, we introduce DeepBioisostere, a deep generative model to design suitable bioisosteric replacements. Our model allows an end-to-end chemical replacement by intelligently selecting fragments for removal and insertion along with their attachment orientation. Through various scenarios of multiple property control, we showcase the model's capability to modulate specific properties, addressing the challenge in molecular optimization. Our model's innovation lies in its capacity to design a bioisosteric replacement reflecting the compatibility with the surroundings of the modification site, facilitating the control of sophisticated properties like drug-likeness. DeepBioisostere can also provide previously unseen bioisosteric replacements, highlighting its capability for exploring diverse chemical modifications rather than just mining them from known databases. Lastly, we employed DeepBioisostere to improve the sensitivity of a known SARS-CoV-2 main protease inhibitor to the E166V mutant that exhibits drug resistance to the inhibitor, demonstrating its potential application in lead optimization.</description>

      <title>G4-Attention: Deep Learning Model with Attention for predicting DNA G-Quadruplexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: G-Quadruplexes are the four-stranded non-canonical nucleic acid secondary structures, formed by the stacking arrangement of the guanine tetramers. They are involved in a wide range of biological roles because of their exceptionally unique and distinct structural characteristics. After the completion of the human genome sequencing project, a lot of bioinformatic algorithms were introduced to predict the active G4s regions \textit{in vitro} based on the canonical G4 sequence elements, G-\textit{richness}, and G-\textit{skewness}, as well as the non-canonical sequence features. Recently, sequencing techniques like G4-seq and G4-ChIP-seq were developed to map the G4s \textit{in vitro}, and \textit{in vivo} respectively at a few hundred base resolution. Subsequently, several machine learning approaches were developed for predicting the G4 regions using the existing databases. However, their prediction models were simplistic, and the prediction accuracy was notably poor. In response, here, we propose a novel convolutional neural network with Bi-LSTM and attention layers, named G4-attention, to predict the G4 forming sequences with improved accuracy. G4-attention achieves high accuracy and attains state-of-the-art results in the G4 prediction task. Our model also predicts the G4 regions accurately in the highly class-imbalanced datasets. In addition, the developed model trained on the human genome dataset can be applied to any non-human genome DNA sequences to predict the G4 formation propensities.</description>

      <title>Transfer Learning across Different Chemical Domains: Virtual Screening of Organic Materials with Deep Learning Models Pretrained on Small Molecule and Chemical Reaction Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18377v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning is becoming a preferred method for the virtual screening of organic materials due to its cost-effectiveness over traditional computationally demanding techniques. However, the scarcity of labeled data for organic materials poses a significant challenge for training advanced machine learning models. This study showcases the potential of utilizing databases of drug-like small molecules and chemical reactions to pretrain the BERT model, enhancing its performance in the virtual screening of organic materials. By fine-tuning the BERT models with data from five virtual screening tasks, the version pretrained with the USPTO-SMILES dataset achieved R2 scores exceeding 0.94 for three tasks and over 0.81 for two others. This performance surpasses that of models pretrained on the small molecule or organic materials databases and outperforms three traditional machine learning models trained directly on virtual screening data. The success of the USPTO-SMILES pretrained BERT model can be attributed to the diverse array of organic building blocks in the USPTO database, offering a broader exploration of the chemical space. The study further suggests that accessing a reaction database with a wider range of reactions than the USPTO could further enhance model performance. Overall, this research validates the feasibility of applying transfer learning across different chemical domains for the efficient virtual screening of organic materials.</description>

      <title>Correlating fluorescence microscopy, optical and magnetic tweezers to study single chiral biopolymers such as DNA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10087v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Biopolymer topology is critical for determining interactions inside cell environments, exemplified by DNA where its response to mechanical perturbation is as important as biochemical properties to its cellular roles. The dynamic structures of chiral biopolymers exhibit complex dependence with extension and torsion, however the physical mechanisms underpinning the emergence of structural motifs upon physiological twisting and stretching are poorly understood due to technological limitations in correlating force, torque and spatial localization information. We present COMBI-Tweez (Combined Optical and Magnetic BIomolecule TWEEZers), a transformative tool that overcomes these challenges by integrating optical trapping, time-resolved electromagnetic tweezers, and fluorescence microscopy, demonstrated on single DNA molecules, that can controllably form and visualise higher order structural motifs including plectonemes. This technology combined with cutting-edge MD simulations provides quantitative insight into complex dynamic structures relevant to DNA cellular processes and can be adapted to study a range of filamentous biopolymers.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Biomolecule and Natural Language through Multi-Modal Learning: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01528v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The integration of biomolecular modeling with natural language (BL) has emerged as a promising interdisciplinary area at the intersection of artificial intelligence, chemistry and biology. This approach leverages the rich, multifaceted descriptions of biomolecules contained within textual data sources to enhance our fundamental understanding and enable downstream computational tasks such as biomolecule property prediction. The fusion of the nuanced narratives expressed through natural language with the structural and functional specifics of biomolecules described via various molecular modeling techniques opens new avenues for comprehensively representing and analyzing biomolecules. By incorporating the contextual language data that surrounds biomolecules into their modeling, BL aims to capture a holistic view encompassing both the symbolic qualities conveyed through language as well as quantitative structural characteristics. In this review, we provide an extensive analysis of recent advancements achieved through cross modeling of biomolecules and natural language. (1) We begin by outlining the technical representations of biomolecules employed, including sequences, 2D graphs, and 3D structures. (2) We then examine in depth the rationale and key objectives underlying effective multi-modal integration of language and molecular data sources. (3) We subsequently survey the practical applications enabled to date in this developing research area. (4) We also compile and summarize the available resources and datasets to facilitate future work. (5) Looking ahead, we identify several promising research directions worthy of further exploration and investment to continue advancing the field.
