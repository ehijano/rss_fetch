      <title>Measure solutions, smoothing effect, and deterministic particle approximation for a conservation law with nonlocal flux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a class of nonlocal conservation laws with an interaction kernel supported on the negative real half-line and featuring a decreasing jump at the origin. We provide, for the first time, an existence and uniqueness theory for said model with initial data in the space of probability measures. Our concept of solution allows to sort a lack of uniqueness problem which we exhibit in a specific example. Our approach uses the so-called \emph{quantile}, or \emph{pseudo-inverse} formulation of the PDE, which has been largely used for similar types of nonlocal transport equations in one-space dimension. Partly related to said approach, we then provide a deterministic particle approximation theorem for the equation under consideration, which works for general initial data in the space of probability measures with compact support. As a crucial step in both results, we use that our concept of solution (which we call \emph{dissipative measure solution}) implies an instantaneous \emph{measure-to-$L^\infty$} smoothing effect, a property which is known to be featured as well by local conservation laws with genuinely nonlinear fluxes.</description>

      <title>Blow-up of cylindrically symmetric solutions for Fractional NLS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider blow-up of solutions to the Cauchy problem for the following fractional NLS, $$ \textnormal{i} \, \partial_t u=(-\Delta)^s u-|u|^{2 \sigma} u \quad \text{in} \,\, \R \times \R^N, $$ where $N \geq 2$, $1/2 &lt;s&lt;1$ and $0&lt;\sigma&lt;2s/(N-2s)$. In the mass critical and supercritical cases, we establish a criterion for blow-up of solutions to the problem for cylindrically symmetric data. And we establish the existence of finite time blow-up solutions in the mass supercritical case. The results extend the known ones with respect to blow-up of solutions to the problem for radially symmetric data.</description>

      <title>Steady supersonic combustion flows with a contact discontinuity in two-dimensional finitely long nozzles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we are concerned with the two-dimensional steady supersonic combustion flows with a contact discontinuity moving through a nozzle of finite length. Mathematically, it can be formulated as a free boundary value problem governed by the two -dimensional steady combustion Euler equations with a contact discontinuity as the free boundary. The main mathematical difficulties are that the contact discontinuity is a characteristic free boundary and the equations for all states are coupled with each other due to the combustion process. We first employ the Lagrangian coordinate transformation to fix the free boundary. Then by introducing the flow slope and Bernoulli function, we further reduce the fixed boundary value problem into an initial boundary value problem for a first order hyperbolic system coupled with several ordinary differential equations. A new iteration scheme is developed near the background states by employing the intrinsic structure of the equation for the mass fraction of the non-combustion gas. We show that there is a fixed point for the iteration by deriving some novel $C^{1,\alpha}$-estimates of the solutions and applying the fixed point theorem, and then the uniqueness of the fixed point is proved by a contraction argument. On the other hand, a quasi-one-dimensional approximate system is often used to simplify the two-dimensional steady supersonic combustion model. The error between these two systems is estimated. Finally, given a piece-wise $C^{1,\alpha}$-solution containing a contact discontinuity with piece-wise constant states on the entrance of the nozzle, we can show that the solution is the piece-wise constant states with a straight contact discontinuity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the Harnack inequality of nonnegative weak solutions to the doubly nonlinear mixed local and nonlocal parabolic equations. This result is obtained by combining a related comparison principle, a local boundedness estimate, and an integral Harnack-type inequality. Our proof is based on the expansion of positivity together with a comparison argument.</description>

Abstract: We look for traveling wave solutions to the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with a subsonic speed, covering several physical models with Sobolev subcritical nonlinear effects. Our approach is based on a variant of Sobolev-type inequality involving the momentum and we show the existence of its minimizers solving the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that if the Cauchy problem $\dot{u}=Au$ in a Banach space is hyperbolic, then the problem has the L-shadowing property. Conversely, if the space is finite-dimensional and the L-shadowing property is satisfied, then the problem is hyperbolic. This generalizes a previous result by Ombach \cite{o, o1} for linear homeomorphisms. Some short applications are given.</description>

      <title>Stability of equilibria and bifurcations for a fluid-solid interaction problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study certain significant properties of the equilibrium configurations of a rigid body subject to an undamped elastic restoring force, in the stream of a viscous liquid in an unbounded 3D domain. The motion of the coupled system is driven by a uniform flow at spatial infinity, with constant dimensionless velocity $\lambda$. We show that if $\lambda$ is below a critical value, $\lambda_c$ (say), there is a unique and stable time-independent configuration, where the body is in equilibrium and the flow is steady. We also prove that, if $\lambda&lt;\lambda_c$, no oscillatory flow may occur. Successively, we investigate possible loss of uniqueness by providing necessary and sufficient conditions for the occurrence of a steady bifurcation at some $\lambda_s\ge \lambda_c$.</description>

      <title>Flow-induced Oscillations via Hopf Bifurcation in a Fluid-Solid Interaction Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We furnish necessary and sufficient conditions for the occurrence of a Hopf bifurcation in a particularly significant fluid-structure problem, where a Navier-Stokes liquid interacts with a rigid body that is subject to an undamped elastic restoring force. The motion of the coupled system is driven by a uniform flow at spatial infinity, with constant dimensionless velocity $\lambda&gt;0$. In particular, if the relevant linearized operator meets suitable spectral properties, there exists a threshold $\lambda_o&gt;0$ above which a bifurcating time-periodic branch stems out of the branch of steady-state solutions. The most remarkable feature of our result is that no restriction is imposed on the frequency $\omega$ of the bifurcating solution, which may thus coincide with one of the natural structural frequencies $\omega_{\sf n}$ of the body. Therefore, resonance cannot occur as a result of this bifurcation. However, when $\omega\to\omega_{\sf n}$, the amplitude of oscillations may become very large when the fluid density is negligible compared to the mass of the body. To our knowledge, our result is the first {\it rigorous} investigation of the existence of a Hopf bifurcation in a fluid-structure interaction problem.</description>

      <title>Homology of spectral minimal partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A spectral minimal partition of a manifold is its decomposition into disjoint open sets that minimizes a spectral energy functional. It is known that bipartite spectral minimal partitions coincide with nodal partitions of Courant-sharp Laplacian eigenfunctions. However, almost all minimal partitions are non-bipartite. To study those, we define a modified Laplacian operator and prove that the nodal partitions of its Courant-sharp eigenfunctions are minimal within a certain topological class of partitions. This yields new results in the non-bipartite case and recovers the above known result in the bipartite case. Our approach is based on tools from algebraic topology, which we illustrate by a number of examples where the topological types of partitions are characterized by relative homology.</description>

      <title>Multidimensional Stability of Planar Travelling Waves for Stochastically Perturbed Reaction-Diffusion Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider reaction-diffusion systems with multiplicative noise on a spatial domain of dimension two or higher. The noise process is white in time, coloured in space, and invariant under translations. In the deterministic setting, multidimensional stability of planar waves on the whole space $\mathbb R^d$ has been studied by many. Inspired by previous works on the real line, we establish the multidimensional stability of planar waves on a cylindrical domain on time scales that are exponentially long with respect to the noise strength. This is achieved by means of a stochastic phase tracking mechanism that can be maintained over such long time scales. The corresponding mild formulation of our problem features stochastic integrals with respect to anticipating integrands, which hence cannot be understood within the well-established setting of It\^o-integrals. To circumvent this problem, we exploit and extend recently developed theory concerning forward integrals.</description>

      <title>An FIO-based approach to $L^p$-bounds for the wave equation on $2$-step Carnot groups: the case of M\'etivier groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{L}$ be a homogeneous left-invariant sub-Laplacian on a $2$-step Carnot group. We devise a new geometric approach to sharp fixed-time $L^p$-bounds with loss of derivatives for the wave equation driven by $\mathcal{L}$, based on microlocal analysis and highlighting the role of the underlying sub-Riemannian geodesic flow. A major challenge here stems from the fact that, differently from the Riemannian case, the conjugate locus of a point on a sub-Riemannian manifold may cluster at the point itself, thus making it indispensable to deal with caustics even when studying small-time wave propagation.
  Our analysis of the wave propagator on a $2$-step Carnot group allows us to reduce microlocally to two conic regions in frequency space: an anti-FIO region, which seems not amenable to FIO techniques, and an FIO region. For the latter, we construct a parametrix by means of FIOs with complex phase, by adapting a construction from the elliptic setting due to Laptev, Safarov and Vassiliev, which remains valid beyond caustics. A substantial problem arising here is that, after a natural decomposition and scalings, one must deal with the long-time behaviour and control of $L^1$-norms of the corresponding contributions to the wave propagator, a new phenomenon that is specific to sub-elliptic settings.
  For the class of M\'etivier groups, we show how our approach, in combination with a variation of the key method of Seeger, Sogge and Stein for proving $L^p$-estimates for FIOs, yields $L^p$-bounds for the wave equation, which are sharp up to the endpoint regularity. In particular, we extend previously known results for distinguished sub-Laplacians on groups of Heisenberg type, by means of a more general and robust approach. The study of the wave equation on wider classes of $2$-step Carnot groups via this approach will pose further challenges that we plan to address in subsequent works.</description>

      <title>On dispersive quantization and fractalization for the Kawahara equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.06901v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the dichotomous behavior of solutions to the Kawahara equation with bounded variation initial data, analogous to the Talbot effect. Specifically, we observe that the solution is quantized at rational times, whereas at irrational times, it is a nowhere continuous differentiable function with a fractal profile. This phenomenon, however, has not been explored for the Kawahara equation, which is a fifth-order KdV type equation. To achieve this, we derive smoothing estimates for the nonlinear Duhamel solution, which, when combined with the known results on the linear solution, provides a mathematical description of the Talbot effect.</description>

      <title>Homogenization of peristaltic flows in piezoelectric porous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.05393v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper presents a new type of weakly nonlinear two-scale model of controllable periodic porous piezoelectric structures saturated by Newtonian fluids. The flow is propelled by peristaltic deformation of microchannels which is induced due to piezoelectric segments embedded in the microstructure and locally actuated by voltage waves. The homogenization is employed to derive a macroscopic model of the poroelastic medium with effective parameters modified by piezoelectric properties of the skeleton. To capture the peristaltic pumping, the nonlinearity associated with deforming configuration must be respected. In the macroscopic model, this nonlinearity is introduced through homogenized coefficients depending on the deforming micro-configurations. For this, linear expansions based on the sensitivity analysis of the homogenized coefficients with respect to deformation induced by the macroscopic quantities are employed. This enables to avoid the two-scale tight coupling of the macro- and microproblems otherwise needed in nonlinear problems. The derived reduced-order model is implemented and verified using direct numerical simulations of the periodic heterogeneous medium. Numerical results demonstrate the peristaltic driven fluid propulsion in response to the electric actuation and the efficiency of the proposed treatment of the nonlinearity. The paper shows new perspectives in homogenization-based computationally efficient modelling of weakly nonlinear problems where continuum microstructures are perturbed by coupled fields.</description>

Abstract: We discuss the Lugiato-Lefever equation and its variant with third-order dispersion, which are mathematical models used to describe how a light beam forms patterns within an optical cavity. It is mathematically demonstrated that the solutions of these equations follow the Talbot effect, which is a phenomenon of periodic self-imaging of an object under certain conditions of diffraction. The Talbot effect is regarded as the underlying cause of pattern formation in optical cavities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.07697v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the Gibbs measure for the focusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation on the one-dimensional torus $\mathbb T$, that was introduced in a seminal paper by Lebowitz, Rose and Speer (1988). We show that in the large torus limit, the measure exhibits a phase transition, depending on the size of the nonlinearity. This phase transition was originally conjectured on the basis of numerical simulation by Lebowitz, Rose and Speer (1988). Its existence is however striking in view of a series of negative results by McKean (1995) and Rider (2002).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.02935v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is focused on the Monotonicity Principle (MP) for nonlinear materials with piecewise growth exponent. This results are relevant because enables the use of a fast imaging method based on MP, to the wide class of problems with two or more materials, where at least one is nonlinear.
  The treatment is very general and allows to model a wide variety of practical configurations such as, for instance, Superconducting (SC) or Perfect Electrical Conducting (PEC) or Perfect Electrical Insulating (PEI) materials.
  A key role is played by the average Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator, introduced in [Corbo Esposito et. al, Inverse Problems 2021], where the MP for a single type of nonlinearity was treated.
  Realistic numerical examples confirm the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Poroelastic plate model obtained by simultaneous homogenization and dimension reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16220v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, the starting point of our analysis is a coupled system of linear elasticity and Stokes equation. We consider two small parameters: the thickness $h$ of the thin plate and the pore scale $\varepsilon(h)$ which depends on $h$. We will focus specifically on the case when the pore size is comparatively small relative to the thickness of the plate. The main goal here is derive a model of a poroelastic plate, starting from the $3D$ problem as $h$ goes to zero, using simultaneous homogenization and dimension reduction techniques. The obtained model generalizes the poroelastic plate model derived by A. Mikeli\'c et. al. in 2015 using dimension reduction techniques from $3D$ Biot's equations in the sense that it also covers the case of contacts of poroelastic and (poro)elastic plate as well as the evolution equation with inertial term.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we prove a global bifurcation result for the existence of non-radial branches of solutions to the paramterized family of $\Gamma$-symmetric problems $-\Delta u=f(\alpha,z,u)$, $u|_{\partial D}=0$ on the unit disc $D:=\{z\in \mathbb{C} : |z|&lt;1\}$ with $u(z)\in \mathbb{R}^k$, where $\mathbb{R}^k$ is an orthogonal $\Gamma$-representation, $f: \mathbb{R} \times \overline{D} \times \mathbb{R}^k\to \mathbb{R}^k$ is a sub-linear $\Gamma$-equivariant continuous function, differentiable with respect to $u$ at zero and satisfying the conditions $f(\alpha, e^{i\theta}z,u)=f(\alpha, z,u)$ for all $\theta\in \mathbb{R}$ and $f(z,-u)=-f(z,u)$.</description>

      <title>Equivalence between validity of the $p$-Poincar\'e inequality and finiteness of the strict $p$-capacitary inradius</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19207v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is shown that the $p$-Poincar\'e inequality holds on an open set $\Omega$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ if and only if the strict $p$-capacitary inradius of $\Omega$ is finite. To that end, new upper and lower bounds for the infimum for the associated nonlinear Rayleigh quotients are derived.</description>

      <title>Starshaped compact hypersurfaces in warped product manifolds I: prescribed curvature equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19562v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive global curvature estimates for closed strictly star-shaped (n-2)-convex hypersurfaces in warped product spaces, satisfying the prescribed (n-2)-curvature equation with a general right-hand side. The proof is influenced by the recent breakthrough of [Guan-Ren-Wang CPAM 2015] and it can be readily adapted to establish curvature estimates for semi-convex solutions to the general k-curvature equation. Furthermore, it can also be used to prove the same estimates for prescribed curvature measure type equations.</description>

      <title>Singular velocity of the Stokes and Navier-Stokes equations near boundary in the half space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00369v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Local behaviors near boundary are analyzed for solutions of the Stokes and Navier-Stoke equations in the half space with localized non-smooth boundary data. We construct solutions of Stokes equations whose velocity field is not bounded near boundary away from the support of boundary data, although velocity and gradient velocity of solutions are locally square integrable. This is an improvement compared to known results in the sense that velocity field is unbounded itself, since previously constructed solutions were bounded near boundary, although their normal derivatives are singular. We also establish singular solutions and their derivatives that do not belong to $L^q_{\rm{loc}}$ near boundary with $q&gt; 1$. For such examples, there corresponding pressures turn out not to be locally integrable. Similar construction via a perturbation argument is available to the Navier-Stokes equations near boundary as well.</description>

      <title>Time-asymptotics of a heated string</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04310v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present paper, we study a model of a thermoelastic string that is initially heated. We classify all the possible asymptotic states when time tends to infinity of such a model. Actually, we show that whatever the initial data is, a heated string must converge to a flat, steady string with uniformly distributed heat. The latter distribution is calculated from the energy conservation. In order to obtain the result, we need to take a few steps. In the first two steps, time-independent bounds from above and from below (by a positive constant) of the temperature are obtained. This is done via the Moser-like iteration. The lower bound is obtained via the Moser iteration on the negative part of the logarithm of temperature. In the third step, we obtain a time-independent higher-order estimate, which yields compactness of a sequence of the values of the solution when time tends to infinity. Here, an estimate involving the Fisher information of temperature, together with a recent functional inequality from \cite{CFHS} and an $L^2(L^2)$ estimate of the gradient of entropy, enable us to arrive at a tricky Gr\"{o}nwall type inequality. Finally, in the last steps, we define the dynamical system on a proper functional phase space and study its $\omega$-limit set. To this end, we use, in particular, the quantitative version of the second principle of thermodynamics. Also, the entropy dissipation term and the bound of the entropy from below are useful when identifying the structure of the $\omega$-limit set.</description>

      <title>Existence-Uniqueness Theory and Small-Data Decay for a Reaction-Diffusion Model of Wildfire Spread</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00575v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I examine some analytical properties of a nonlinear reaction-diffusion system that has been used to model the propagation of a wildfire. I establish global-in-time existence and uniqueness of bounded mild solutions to the Cauchy problem for this system given bounded initial data. In particular, this shows that the model does not allow for thermal blow-up. If the initial temperature and fuel density also satisfy certain integrability conditions, the $L^2$-norms of these global solutions are uniformly bounded in time. Additionally, I use a bootstrap argument to show that small initial temperatures give rise to solutions that decay to zero as time goes to infinity, proving the existence of initial states that do not develop into travelling combustion waves.</description>

      <title>Smoothness of conformal heat flow of harmonic maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.03444v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The conformal heat flow for harmonic maps is a system of evolution equations combined with harmonic map flow with metric evolution in conformal direction. It is known that global weak solution of the flow exists and smooth except at mostly finitely many singular points. In this paper, we show that no finite time singularity occurs, unlike the usual harmonic map flow. And if the initial energy is small, we can obtain the uniform convergence of the map and the conformal factor. Also, under the assumption that energy concentration is uniform in time, we show that there exists a sequence of time $t_n \to \infty$ such that $f(\cdot,t_n)$ converges to a harmonic map in $C^1$ on any compact set away from at most finitely many points.</description>
