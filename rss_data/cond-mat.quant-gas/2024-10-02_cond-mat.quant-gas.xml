      <title>Two-dimensional bosonic droplets in a harmonic trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a system of bosons in a two-dimensional harmonic trap. In the limit of strong attractive interactions, the bosons make a droplet insensitive to external confinement. For weak interactions, in contrast, the ground state is given by the harmonic trap. In this work, we conduct a variational study of the transition between these two limits. We find that this transition occurs abruptly at the critical interaction strength whose value is universal if scaled appropriately with the number of particles. To connect the abrupt change in the properties of the system to the classical description of phase transitions, we analyze the static response of the Bose gas related to the isothermal compressibility. Finally, we perform numerically exact calculations for a few particles to demonstrate the effects of finite range interactions on this transition. We conclude that finite range effects wash out the point of transition.</description>

      <title>Orbital atomic sensor for gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational wave science transforms research beyond general relativity and gravity. The signals detected not only reveal the nature of cataclysmic events and exotic objects in galaxies, but also test the models for the equation of state and color superconducting vortex alignment in neutron stars, as well as for the distribution of cosmological dark matter and their characteristic coupling with ordinary matter as new physics beyond the standard model of elementary particles. Measurement sensitivity is crucial to advance along those lines. One of the rapidly developing frontiers is quantum enhanced interferometry applied into the gravitational wave detectors. Progress achieved by LIGO, Virgo and KAGRA detectors brings exciting prospects. Here, we introduce an orbital atomic sensor using a squeezed $p$-orbital Bose-Einstein condensate in an ultracold atomic optical lattice to project the gravitational wave signal received by a usual LIGO setup into a phase-sensitive entangled state. Simulation data show the detection sensitivity improves over the quantum noise of LIGO by approximately one order of magnitude in key frequency ranges. This advance enables about three-order-of-magnitude increase in detection volume, significantly advancing the potential of using gravitational waves to detect dark matter and black holes.</description>

      <title>Precision Thermodynamics of the Fermi polaron at strong coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Fermi polaron problem, which describes a mobile impurity that interacts with a spin-polarized Fermi sea, is a paradigmatic system in quantum many-body physics and has been challenging to address quantitatively in its strong coupling regime. We present the first controlled thermodynamic calculations for the Fermi polaron at strong coupling using finite-temperature auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFMC) methods in the framework of the canonical ensemble. Modeled as a spin-imbalanced system, the Fermi polaron has a Monte Carlo sign problem, but we show that it is moderate over a wide range of temperatures and coupling strengths beyond the unitary limit of the BCS-BEC crossover. We calculate the contact, a quantity which measures the strength of the short-range correlations, as a function of temperature at unitarity and as a function of the coupling strength at fixed temperature and find good agreement with a variational approach based on one particle-hole excitation of the Fermi sea. We compare our results for the contact with recent experiments and find good agreement at unitarity (within error bars) but discrepancies away from unitarity on the BEC side of the crossover. We also calculate the thermal energy gap at unitarity as a function of temperature.</description>

      <title>Kinetic magnetism and stripe order in the doped AFM bosonic ${t-J}$ model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unraveling the microscopic mechanisms governing the physics of doped quantum magnets is a central challenge in strongly correlated many-body physics. Quantum simulation platforms, e.g. ultracold atoms trapped in optical lattices or tweezer arrays, offer an exciting pathway to investigate the interplay between spin and charge motion, thereby providing an avenue to addressing longstanding questions such as the nature of charge pairing in high-temperature superconductors. Here, in a new twist, we seek to disentangle the role of particle statistics in the physics of strongly correlated systems by exploring the strong coupling limit of doped bosonic quantum magnets, specifically the antiferromagnetic (AFM) bosonic $t-J$ model. We perform large-scale density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations to map out the phase diagram of the AFM bosonic $t-J$ model on the 2D square lattice at finite doping. We find that in the low doping regime, bosonic holes tend to form partially-filled stripes, akin to those observed in high-$T_c$ cuprates. As doping increases beyond a critical value $\delta \gtrsim \delta^*_\mathrm{PP} (\delta^*_\mathrm{FM})$, a transition occurs between AFM and ferromagnetic (FM) ground states, driven by the competition between Heisenberg-type AFM and Nagaoka-type FM mediated by the motion of mobile bosonic holes. In the high doping or large $t/J$ limit, the system evolves into a fully-polarized SU(2) ferromagnet, consistent with a phase transition linked to Nagaoka polarons. Our findings shed light on the role of particle statistics in strongly correlated quantum matter and connect to phases in the 2D Fermi-Hubbard and $t-J$ models. Our results may be realized in state-of-the-art quantum simulation experiments with bosonic quantum gas microscopes, paving the way for further exploration of doped bosonic quantum magnets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to review the properties of a Rule 60 cellular automaton on a ring with a Mersenne number circumference and to use this knowledge to explicitly construct all the ground state configurations of the classical Newman-Moore model (a particular two-dimensional spin lattice model with a specific three-spin interaction) on a square lattice of the same size. In this particular case, the number of ground states is equal to half of the available spin configurations in any given row of the lattice.</description>

      <title>Anyonic phase transitions in the 1D extended Hubbard model with fractional statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study one-dimensional (1D) lattice anyons with extended Hubbard interactions at unit filling using bosonization and numerical simulations. The behavior can be continuously tuned from Bosonic to Fermionic behavior by adjusting the topological exchange angle $\theta$, which leads to a competition of different instabilities. We present the bosonization theory in presence of dynamic gauge fields, which predicts a phase diagrams of four different gapped phases with distinct dominant correlations. Advanced numerical simulations determine and analyze the exact phase transitions between Mott insulator, charge density wave, dimerized state, and Haldane insulator, all of which meet at a multi-critical line in the parameter space of anyonic angle $\theta$, onsite interaction $U$, and nearest neighbor repulsion $V$. Superfluid and pair-superfluid phases are stable in a region of small $V$.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves and Black Hole perturbations in Acoustic Analogues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phonons in Bose-Einstein condensates propagate as massless scalar particles on top of an emergent acoustic metric. This hydrodynamics/gravity analogy can be exploited to realize acoustic black holes, featuring an event horizon that traps phonons. We show that by appropriately perturbing the background fluid, gravitational wave-like fluctuations of the acoustic metric can be produced. Such fluctuations can be used to excite an acoustic black hole, which should then relax by phonon emission.</description>

      <title>Robust stripes in the mixed-dimensional $t-J$ model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.07366v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Microscopically understanding competing orders in strongly correlated systems is a key challenge in modern quantum many-body physics. For example, the origin of stripe order and its relation to pairing in the Fermi-Hubbard model remains one of the central questions, and may help to understand the origin of high-temperature superconductivity in cuprates. Here, we analyze stripe formation in the doped mixed-dimensional (mixD) variant of the $t-J$ model, where charge carriers are restricted to move only in one direction, whereas magnetic SU(2) interactions are two-dimensional. Using the density matrix renormalization group at finite temperature, we find a stable vertical stripe phase in the absence of pairing, featuring incommensurate magnetic order and long-range charge density wave profiles over a wide range of dopings. We find high critical temperatures on the order of the magnetic coupling $\sim J/2$, hence being within reach of current quantum simulators. Snapshots of the many-body state, accessible to quantum simulators, reveal hidden spin correlations in the mixD setting, whereby antiferromagnetic correlations are enhanced when considering purely the magnetic background. The proposed model can be viewed as realizing a parent Hamiltonian of the stripe phase, whose hidden spin correlations lead to the predicted resilience against quantum and thermal fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Quantifying hole-motion-induced frustration in doped antiferromagnets by Hamiltonian reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.02440v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unveiling the microscopic origins of quantum phases dominated by the interplay of spin and motional degrees of freedom constitutes one of the central challenges in strongly correlated many-body physics. When holes move through an antiferromagnetic spin background, they displace the positions of spins, which induces effective frustration in the magnetic environment. However, a concrete characterization of this effect in a quantum many-body system is still an unsolved problem. Here we present a Hamiltonian reconstruction scheme that allows for a precise quantification of hole-motion-induced frustration. We access non-local correlation functions through projective measurements of the many-body state, from which effective spin-Hamiltonians can be recovered after detaching the magnetic background from dominant charge fluctuations. The scheme is applied to systems of mixed dimensionality, where holes are restricted to move in one dimension, but SU(2) superexchange is two-dimensional. We demonstrate that hole motion drives the spin background into a highly frustrated regime, which can quantitatively be described by an effective $J_1-J_2-$type spin model. We exemplify the applicability of the reconstruction scheme to ultracold atom experiments by recovering effective spin-Hamiltonians of experimentally obtained 1D Fermi-Hubbard snapshots. Our method can be generalized to fully 2D systems, enabling promising microscopic perspectives on the doped Hubbard model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05460v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the observation of the melting of a vortex lattice in a fast rotating quasi-two dimensional Bose gas, under the influence of thermal fluctuations. We image the vortex lattice after a time-of-flight expansion, for increasing rotation frequency at constant atom number and temperature. We detect the vortex positions and study the order of the lattice using the pair correlation function and the orientational correlation function. We evidence the melting transition by an abrupt change in the decay of orientational correlations, associated to a proliferation of dislocations. Our findings are consistent with the hexatic to liquid transition in the KTHNY scenario for two-dimensional melting.</description>

      <title>Local control and mixed dimensions: Exploring high-temperature superconductivity in optical lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02551v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The simulation of high-temperature superconducting materials by implementing strongly correlated fermionic models in optical lattices is one of the major objectives in the field of analog quantum simulation. Here we show that local control and optical bilayer capabilities combined with spatially resolved measurements create a versatile toolbox to study fundamental properties of both nickelate and cuprate high-temperature superconductors. On the one hand, we present a scheme to implement a mixed-dimensional (mixD) bilayer model that has been proposed to capture the essential pairing physics of pressurized bilayer nickelates. This allows for the long-sought realization of a state with long-range superconducting order in current lattice quantum simulation machines. In particular, we show how coherent pairing correlations can be accessed in a partially particle-hole transformed and rotated basis. On the other hand, we demonstrate that control of local gates enables the observation of $d$-wave pairing order in the two-dimensional (single-layer) repulsive Fermi-Hubbard model through the simulation of a system with attractive interactions. Lastly, we introduce a scheme to measure momentum-resolved dopant densities, providing access to observables complementary to solid-state experiments -- which is of particular interest for future studies of the enigmatic pseudogap phase appearing in cuprates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.02597v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a comprehensive theoretical model for the interaction strength between a pair of exciton-polaritons in microcavity devices. Ab initio numerical calculations for dipolar polaritons in one dimension are used as a starting point to build a Born-Oppenheimer theory that generally applies to generic -- dipolar or non-dipolar polaritons -- in both one and two dimensions. This theory anticipates that the strong coupling to the cavity mode leads to a drastic enhancement of the polariton interactions as compared to bare excitons, and predicts unexpected scaling laws in the interaction strength as a function of system parameters. Comparisons with available experimental data are drawn, and specific suggestions to validate it with new experiments are made. Promising strategies towards the observation of a strong polariton blockade regime are finally sketched.</description>

      <title>Kinetic-to-magnetic frustration crossover and linear confinement in the doped triangular $t-J$ model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.02342v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Microscopically understanding competing orders in strongly correlated systems is a key challenge in modern quantum many-body physics. For example, the study of magnetic polarons and their relation to pairing in the Fermi-Hubbard model in different geometries remains one of the central questions, and may help to understand the mechanism underlying unconventional superconductivity in cuprates or transition metal dichalcogenides. With recent advances in analog quantum simulation of the Fermi-Hubbard model on non-bipartite lattices, frustrated physics can now be explored experimentally in systems lacking particle-hole symmetry. Here, we study the singly doped $t-J$ model on the triangular lattice, focusing on the competition between kinetic and magnetic frustration as a function of temperature. In doublon doped systems, we uncover a crossover between Nagaoka-type ferromagnetic (FM) correlations at high temperature and exchange mediated antiferromagnetic (AFM) order around the doublon at low temperature. For hole doped systems, kinetic Haerter-Shastry-type AFM at high temperature as well as exchange interactions at low temperature favor $120^{\circ}$ order, strengthening magnetic correlations compared to the undoped system. In the ground state, the presence of AFM correlations throughout a wide range of interactions indicates confinement of both types of dopants. In this regime we firmly establish the presence of linear confining potentials via energy scaling arguments, supporting the picture of geometric strings in the frustrated triangular $t-J$ model.</description>

      <title>An energy-dependent broadening of Rashba-like spin splitting in Au2Sb surface alloy with periodic structural defect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.06183v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Here, we report a novel AuSb 2D superstructure on Au(111) that shows agreements and discrepancies to the expected electronic features of the ideal 2D surface alloys with $\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}$ periodicity. Using spin- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we find a spin splitting of the alloy bands with antiparallel spin polarization, stemming from Rashba spin-orbit coupling. However, the observed Rashba bands are significantly broadened. Taking advantage of the good agreement between the experimental results and DFT calculations, we determine that the broadening of the Rashba band is due to the perturbations from the 3-pointed-star-shaped defects acting as nonresonant impurities in the Au2Sb superstructure. These periodic defects can shift the energy position of the Rashba band without breaking the in-plane rotational symmetry and mirror symmetry, which suggests that introducing periodic defects into a Rashba SOC system possesses a great potential in engineering the spin-dependent properties of spintronic devices.</description>

Abstract: Ever since the discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in cuprates, gaining microscopic insights into the nature of pairing in strongly correlated, repulsively interacting fermionic systems has remained one of the greatest challenges in modern condensed matter physics. Following recent experiments reporting superconductivity in the bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ (LNO) with remarkably high critical temperatures of $T_c = 80$ K, it has been argued that the low-energy physics of LNO can be described by the strongly correlated, mixed-dimensional bilayer $t-J$ model. Here we investigate this bilayer system and utilize density matrix renormalization group techniques to establish a thorough understanding of the model and the magnetically induced pairing through comparison to the perturbative limit of dominating inter-layer spin couplings. In particular, this allows us to explain appearing finite-size effects, firmly establishing the existence of long-range superconducting order in the thermodynamic limit that is described by the XXZ universality class of hard-core bosons constituted by $s$-wave singlet pairs. As the effective model in the perturbative limit is known to show linear resistivity above the superconducting transition temperature, we propose a pair-based interpretation of the extended strange metal phase observed in LNO. By analyzing binding energies, we predict a BEC-BCS crossover as a function of the Hamiltonian parameters, whereas LNO is anticipated to lie on the BCS side in vicinity of the transition. We find large binding energies of the order of the inter-layer coupling that suggest strikingly high critical temperatures of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition, raising the question whether (mixD) bilayer superconductors possibly facilitate critical temperatures above room temperature.</description>

      <title>Sub-dimensional magnetic polarons in the one-hole doped SU(3) $t$-$J$ model</title>

Abstract: The physics of doped Mott insulators is at the heart of strongly correlated materials and is believed to constitute an essential ingredient for high-temperature superconductivity. In systems with higher SU(N) spin symmetries, even richer magnetic ground states appear at a filling of one particle per site compared to the case of SU(2) spins, but their fate upon doping remains largely unexplored. Here we address this question by studying a single hole in the SU(3) $t$-$J$ model, whose undoped ground state features long-range, diagonal spin stripes. By analyzing both ground state and dynamical properties utilizing the density matrix renormalization group, we establish the appearence of magnetic polarons consisting of chargons and flavor defects, whose dynamics is constrained to a single effective dimension along the ordered diagonal. We semi-analytically describe the system using geometric string theory, where paths of hole motion are the fundamental degrees of freedom. With recent advances in the realization and control of SU(N) Fermi-Hubbard models with ultracold atoms in optical lattices, our results can directly be observed in quantum gas microscopes with single-site resolution. Our work suggests the appearance of intricate ground states at finite doping constituted by emergent, coupled Luttinger liquids along diagonals, and is a first step towards exploring a wealth of physics in doped SU(N) Fermi-Hubbard models on various geometries.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic origin of the phonon Hall effect in a honeycomb antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13306</link>

Abstract: The underlying mechanism of the thermal Hall effect (THE) generated by phonons in a variety of insulators is yet to be identified. Here, we report on a sizeable thermal Hall conductivity in NiPS$_3$, a van der Waals stack of honeycomb layers with a zigzag antiferromagnetic order below $T_N$ = 155 K. The longitudinal ($\kappa_{aa}$) and the transverse ($\kappa_{ab}$) thermal conductivities peak at the same temperature and the thermal Hall angle, at this peak, respects a previously identified bound. The amplitude of $\kappa_{ab}$ is extremely sensitive to the amplitude of magnetization along the $b$-axis, in contrast to the phonon mean free path, which is not at all. We show that the magnon and acoustic phonon bands cross each other along the $b^\ast$ orientation in the momentum space. The relevance of a thermodynamic property, combined with the irrelevance of the mean free path, points to an intrinsic origin.</description>
