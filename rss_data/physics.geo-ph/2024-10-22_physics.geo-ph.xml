      <title>Machine Learning Aided Modeling of Granular Materials: A Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has become a buzz word since Google's AlphaGo beat a world champion in 2017. In the past five years, machine learning as a subset of the broader category of AI has obtained considerable attention in the research community of granular materials. This work offers a detailed review of the recent advances in machine learning-aided studies of granular materials from the particle-particle interaction at the grain level to the macroscopic simulations of granular flow. This work will start with the application of machine learning in the microscopic particle-particle interaction and associated contact models. Then, different neural networks for learning the constitutive behaviour of granular materials will be reviewed and compared. Finally, the macroscopic simulations of practical engineering or boundary value problems based on the combination of neural networks and numerical methods are discussed. We hope readers will have a clear idea of the development of machine learning-aided modelling of granular materials via this comprehensive review work.</description>

      <title>Extracting Geodetic Data from GNSS-VLBI Co-Observation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have been developing a novel interferometer formed directly between a Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) radio telescope and a Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) antenna/receiver. This interferometer is enabled by the High Rate Tracking Receiver (HRTR), a high-performance GNSS software-defined receiver that records baseband data similar to a VLBI receiving system. Of particular interest is the potential of the technique to produce precise local tie vectors directly between the geodetic reference points of VLBI and GNSS antennas for use in the determination of combination terrestrial reference frames. In this paper, we will describe the unique setup of this interferometer before discussing current developmental work in estimating local tie vectors from experimental data collected using this technique. In particular, much recent work has been in exploring the possibility of direct comparison of the GNSS and VLBI processing techniques. A significant advantage of GNSS-VLBI co-observation of GNSS satellites comes from the ability to cross-check position and clock estimates derived from differential measurements in VLBI-style processing with differential GNSS processing and absolute GNSS positioning with Precise Point Positioning (PPP). We show a preliminary VLBI analysis of interferometric data including a differential positioning solution using phase delays.</description>

      <title>2D Basement Relief Inversion using Sparse Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Basement relief gravimetry is crucial in geophysics, especially for oil exploration and mineral prospecting. It involves solving an inverse problem to infer geological model parameters from observed data. The model represents basement relief with constant-density prisms, and the data reflect gravitational anomalies from these prisms. Inverse problems are often ill-posed, meaning small data changes can lead to large solution variations. To mitigate this, regularization techniques like Tikhonov's are used to stabilize solutions. This study compares regularization methods applied to gravimetric inversion, including Smoothness Constraints, Total Variation, Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), and Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) using Daubechies D4 wavelets. Optimization, particularly with Genetic Algorithms (GA), is used to find prism depths that best match observed anomalies. GA, inspired by natural selection, selects the best solutions to minimize the objective function. The results, evaluated through fit metrics and error analysis, show the effectiveness of all regularization methods and GA, with the Smoothness constraint performing best in synthetic models. For the real data model, all methods performed similarly.</description>

      <title>Physically Guided Deep Unsupervised Inversion for 1D Magnetotelluric Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The global demand for unconventional energy sources such as geothermal energy and white hydrogen requires new exploration techniques for precise subsurface structure characterization and potential reservoir identification. Magnetotelluric (MT) inversion is crucial for these tasks, providing critical information on the distribution of subsurface electrical resistivity at depths ranging from hundreds to thousands of meters. However, traditional iterative algorithm-based inversion methods require the adjustment of multiple parameters, demanding time-consuming and exhaustive tuning processes to achieve proper cost function minimization. Although recent advances have incorporated deep learning algorithms for MT inversion, these have been primarily based on supervised learning, which needs large labeled datasets for training. Therefore, it causes issues in generalization and model characteristics that are restricted to the neural network's features. This work utilizes TensorFlow operations to create a differentiable forward MT operator, leveraging its automatic differentiation capability. Moreover, instead of solving for the subsurface model directly, as classical algorithms perform, this paper presents a new deep unsupervised inversion algorithm guided by physics to estimate 1D MT models. Instead of using datasets with the observed data and their respective model as labels during training, our method employs a differentiable modeling operator that physically guides the cost function minimization, making the proposed method solely dependent on observed data. Therefore, the optimization problem is updating the network weights to minimize the data misfit. We test the proposed method with field and synthetic data at different acquisition frequencies, demonstrating that the resistivity models are more accurate than other results using state-of-the-art techniques.</description>

      <title>SeisLM: a Foundation Model for Seismic Waveforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the Seismic Language Model (SeisLM), a foundational model designed to analyze seismic waveforms -- signals generated by Earth's vibrations such as the ones originating from earthquakes. SeisLM is pretrained on a large collection of open-source seismic datasets using a self-supervised contrastive loss, akin to BERT in language modeling. This approach allows the model to learn general seismic waveform patterns from unlabeled data without being tied to specific downstream tasks. When fine-tuned, SeisLM excels in seismological tasks like event detection, phase-picking, onset time regression, and foreshock-aftershock classification. The code has been made publicly available on https://github.com/liutianlin0121/seisLM.</description>

      <title>Seismic Phase Picking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Seismic phase picking, which aims to determine the arrival time of P- and S-waves according to seismic waveforms, is fundamental to earthquake monitoring. Generally, manual phase picking is trustworthy, but with the increasing number of worldwide stations and seismic monitors, it becomes more challenging for human to complete the task comprehensively. In this work, we explore multiple ways to do automatic phase picking, including traditional and learning-based methods.</description>

      <title>The Typicality of Regimes Associated with Northern Hemisphere Heatwaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the hemispheric to continental scale regimes that lead to summertime heatwaves in the Northern Hemisphere. By using a powerful data mining methodology - archetype analysis - we identify characteristic spatial patterns consisting of a blocking high pressure systems embedded within a meandering upper atmosphere circulation that is longitudinally modulated by coherent Rossby Wave Packets. Periods when these atmospheric regimes are strongly expressed correspond to large increases in the likelihood of extreme surface temperature. Most strikingly, these regimes are shown to be typical of surface extremes and frequently reoccur. Three well publicised heatwaves are studied in detail - the June-July 2003 western European heatwave, the August 2010 "Russian" heatwave, and the June 2021 "Heatdome" event across western North America, and are shown to be driven by blocking high pressure systems linked to stalled Rossby Wave Packets. We discuss the implications of our work for long-range prediction or early warning, climate model assessment and post-event diagnosis.</description>

      <title>Likelihood-Free Inference and Hierarchical Data Assimilation for Geological Carbon Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data assimilation will be essential for the management and expansion of geological carbon storage operations. In traditional data assimilation approaches a fixed set of geological hyperparameters, such as mean and standard deviation of log-permeability, is often assumed. Such hyperparameters, however, may be highly uncertain in practical CO2 storage applications. In this study, we develop a hierarchical data assimilation framework for carbon storage that treats hyperparameters as uncertain variables characterized by hyperprior distributions. To deal with the computationally intractable likelihood function in hyperparameter estimation, we apply a likelihood-free (or simulation-based) inference algorithm, specifically sequential Monte Carlo-based approximate Bayesian computation (SMC-ABC), to draw independent posterior samples of hyperparameters given dynamic monitoring-well data. In the second step we use an ensemble smoother with multiple data assimilation (ESMDA) procedure to provide posterior realizations of grid-block permeability. To reduce computational costs, a 3D recurrent R-U-Net deep-learning surrogate model is applied for forward function evaluations. The accuracy of the surrogate model is established through comparisons to high-fidelity simulation results. A rejection sampling (RS) procedure for data assimilation is applied to provide reference posterior results. Detailed data assimilation results from SMC-ABC-ESMDA are compared to those from the reference RS method. These include marginal posterior distributions of hyperparameters, pairwise posterior samples, and history matching results for pressure and saturation at the monitoring location. Close agreement is achieved with 'converged' RS results, for two synthetic true models, in all quantities considered. Importantly, the SMC-ABC-ESMDA procedure provides speedup of 1-2 orders of magnitude relative to RS for the two cases.</description>

      <title>An analytical model of tornado generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new analytical model for the generation of axisymmetric tornado-type vortices has been developed. A solution to the nonlinear equation for the stream function in an unstable stratified atmosphere is obtained and analyzed within the framework of ideal hydrodynamics. The solution is sought by smooth connecting continuous solutions for the internal region ("eye"), the central region ("wall" with maximum velocities) and the external region of the tornado. Expressions describing radial dependences for the radial and vertical velocity components include combinations of Bessel functions. The vortex is spatially localized by radius and height. Convective instability of a stratified atmosphere leads to an increase in the radial and vertical components of velocities according to the hyperbolic sine law. A downward flow is observed near the tornado axis. The maximum speed of the upward flow is achieved at a certain radial distance at a certain height. Below this height, radial flows converge towards the central part of the tornado, and above this height there is an outflow from the "wall" to the axis and to the periphery. The radial structure of the azimuthal velocity is determined by the structure of the initial disturbance and can change with height. Maximum rotation is achieved in the tornado "wall" at a certain height. The increase in azimuthal velocity can occur according to a superexponential law. Possible structures of movements, scenarios for the development of a tornado and its dynamics are discussed.</description>

      <title>Thermal tides on rocky planets through a novel fully analytical solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermal tides are atmospheric tides caused by variations in day-night insolation, similar to gravitational tides but with key differences. While both result in delayed mass redistribution, energy dissipation, and angular momentum exchanges between the planet and its host star, thermal tides can drive a planet's dynamics away from the rotational equilibrium states predicted by classical tidal theory. In this work, we present a novel closed-form solution for the thermotidal response of rocky planets. This general solution is derived from first principles, assuming either dry or moist adiabatic temperature profiles for the planet's atmosphere, and can be readily applied to study the long-term evolution of exoplanets in the habitable zones of their host stars. Despite relying on a small number of parameters, the model successfully captures the key features of the thermotidal torque predicted by General Circulation Models (GCMs). It also accurately predicts Earth's current semidiurnal thermotidal response and provides new insights into the evolution of the length of day during the Precambrian era.</description>

      <title>Depth Dependence of Coseismic Off-Fault Damage and its Effects on Rupture Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18408v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Faults are complex systems embedded in an evolving medium fractured by seismic ruptures. This off-fault damage zone is shown to be thermo-hydro-mechano-chemically coupled to the main fault plane by a growing number of studies. Yet, off-fault medium is still, for the most part, modelled as a purely elastic -- hence passive -- medium. Using a micromechanical model that accounts for dynamic changes of elastic moduli and inelastic strains related to crack growth, we investigate the depth variation of dynamically triggered off-fault damage and its counter-impact on earthquake slip dynamics. We show that the damage zone, while narrowing with depth, also becomes denser and contrary to prevailing assumptions continues to act as an energy sink, significantly influencing rupture dynamics by stabilizing slip rates. Furthermore, we observe that damage formation markedly reduces rupture velocity and delays, or even prevents, the transition to supershear speeds even for a narrow damage zone. This underscores the critical need to incorporate the complex interplay between the main fault plane and its surrounding medium across the entire seismogenic zone. As a proof of concept, we introduce a 1D spring-slider model that captures bulk elastic variations, by modulating spring stiffness, and normal stress variations that emulate changes in bulk load. This simple model demonstrates the occurrence of slow slip events alongside conventional earthquakes, driven by the dynamic interaction between bulk temporal evolution and fault slip dynamics, without necessitating any changes to frictional properties.</description>

      <title>Calibration of the strain amplitude recorded with DAS using a strainmeter array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01151v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The power of distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) lies in its ability to sample deformation signals along an optical fiber at hundreds of locations with only one interrogation unit (IU). While the IU is calibrated to record 'fiber strain', the properties of the cable and its coupling to the rock control the 'strain transfer rate' and hence how much of 'rock strain' is represented in the recorded signal. We use DAS recordings in an underground installation near an array of strainmeters in order to calibrate the 'strain transfer rate' in situ, using earthquake signals between 0.05 Hz and 0.1 Hz. A tight-buffered cable and a standard loose-tube telecommunication cable (running in parallel) are used, where a section of both cables loaded down by loose sand and sand bags is compared to a section, where cables are just unreeled on the floor. The 'strain transfer rate' varies between 0.13 and 0.53 depending on cable and installation type. The sandbags show no obvious effect and the tight-buffered cable generally provides a larger 'strain transfer rate'. Calibration of the 'strain transfer rate' with respect to the strainmeter does not depend on wave propagation parameters. Hence it is applicable to the large amplitude surface wave signal in a strain component almost perpendicular to the great-circle direction for which a waveform comparison with seismometer data does not work. The noise background for 'rock strain' in the investigated band is found at about an rms-amplitude of 0.1 nstrain in 1/6 decade for the tight-buffered cable. This allows a detection of marine microseisms at times of high microseism amplitude.</description>

      <title>Detecting and Attributing Change in Climate and Complex Systems: Foundations, Green's Functions, and Nonlinear Fingerprints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.02628v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Detection and attribution (D&amp;A) studies are cornerstones of climate science, providing crucial evidence for policy decisions. Their goal is to link observed climate change patterns to anthropogenic and natural drivers via the optimal fingerprinting method (OFM). We show that response theory for nonequilibrium systems offers the physical and dynamical basis for OFM, including the concept of causality used for attribution. Our framework clarifies the method's assumptions, advantages, and potential weaknesses. We use our theory to perform D&amp;A for prototypical climate change experiments performed on an energy balance model and on a low-resolution coupled climate model. We also explain the underpinnings of degenerate fingerprinting, which offers early warning indicators for tipping points. Finally, we extend the OFM to the nonlinear response regime. Our analysis shows that OFM has broad applicability across diverse stochastic systems influenced by time-dependent forcings, with potential relevance to ecosystems, quantitative social sciences, and finance, among others.</description>

      <title>Toward Routing River Water in Land Surface Models with Recurrent Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14212v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning is playing an increasing role in hydrology, supplementing or replacing physics-based models. One notable example is the use of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for forecasting streamflow given observed precipitation and geographic characteristics. Training of such a model over the continental United States (CONUS) demonstrated that a single set of model parameters can be used across independent catchments, and that RNNs can outperform physics-based models. In this work, we take a next step and study the performance of RNNs for river routing in land surface models (LSMs). Instead of observed precipitation, the LSM-RNN uses instantaneous runoff calculated from physics-based models as an input. We train the model with data from river basins spanning the globe and test using historical streamflow measurements. The model demonstrates skill at generalization across basins (predicting streamflow in catchments not used in training) and across time (predicting streamflow during years not used in training). We compare the predictions from the LSM-RNN to an existing physics-based model calibrated with a similar dataset and find that the LSM-RNN outperforms the physics-based model. Our results show that RNNs are effective for global streamflow prediction from runoff inputs and motivate the development of complete routing models that can capture nested sub-basis connections.</description>

Abstract: Aerosol interactions with clouds represent a significant uncertainty in our understanding of the Earth system. Deep convective clouds may respond to aerosol perturbations in several ways that have proven difficult to elucidate with observations. Here, we leverage the two busiest maritime shipping lanes in the world, which emit aerosol particles and their precursors into an otherwise relatively clean tropical marine boundary layer, to make headway on the influence of aerosol on deep convective clouds. The recent seven-fold change in allowable fuel sulfur by the International Maritime Organization allows us to test the sensitivity of the lightning to changes in ship plume aerosol size distributions. We find that, across a range of atmospheric thermodynamic conditions, the previously documented enhancement of lightning over the shipping lanes has fallen by over 40%. The enhancement is therefore at least partially aerosol-mediated, a conclusion that is supported by observations of droplet number at cloud base, which show a similar decline over the shipping lane. These results have fundamental implications for our understanding of aerosol-cloud interactions, suggesting that deep convective clouds are impacted by the aerosol number distribution in the remote marine environment.</description>
