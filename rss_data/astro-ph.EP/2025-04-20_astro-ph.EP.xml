      <title>Turbulence Inhibits Planetesimal Formation in Class 0/I Disks Subject to Infall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is growing evidence that planet formation begins early, within the $\lesssim 1$Myr Class 0/I phase, when infall dominates disk dynamics. Our goal is to determine if Class 0/I disks reach the conditions needed to form planetesimals ($\sim 100$km planet building blocks) by the streaming instability (SI). We focus on a recent suggestion that early infall causes an ``inflationary'' phase in which dust grains are advected outward. We modified the \texttt{DustPy} code to build a 1D disk that includes dust evolution, infall, and heating and cooling sources. We ran six models and examined the implications for the SI, taking into account recent works on how the SI responds to external turbulence. In line with other works, we find that grains are advected outward, which leads to ``advection-condensation-drift'' loop that greatly enhances the dust density at the water snowline. However, we do not see this process at the silicate line. Instead, we find a new pile up at the edge of the expanding disk. However, despite these localized enhancements, even a modest amount of turbulence ($\alpha = 10^{-3}$) leaves planetesimal formation far out of reach. The midplane dust-to-gas ratio is at least an order of magnitude below the SI threshold, even taking into account recent results on how dust coagulation boosts the SI. For planetesimals to form in the Class 0/I phase may require a way to transport angular momentum without turbulence (e.g., disk winds) or a non-SI mechanism to form planetesimals.</description>

      <title>JWST's sharper view of EX Lup: cold water from ice sublimation during accretion outbursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The unstable accretion phases during pre-main-sequence evolution of T Tauri stars produce variable irradiation and heating of planet-forming regions. A strong accretion outburst was observed with Spitzer-IRS in 2008 in EX Lup, the prototype of EXor variables, and found to increase the mid-infrared water and OH emission and decrease organic emission, suggesting large chemical changes. We present here two JWST-MIRI epochs of quiescent EX Lup in 2022 and 2023 obtained over a decade after the 2008 outburst and several months after a moderate burst in 2022. With JWST's sharper spectral view, we can now analyze water emission as a function of temperature in the two MIRI epochs and, approximately, also in the previous Spitzer epochs. This new analysis shows a strong cold water vapor ``burst" in low-energy lines during the 2008 outburst, which we consider clear evidence for enhanced ice sublimation due to a recession of the snowline, as found in protostellar envelopes. JWST shows that EX Lup still has an unusually strong emission from cold water in comparison to other T Tauri disks, suggesting &gt; 10-yr-long freeze-out timescales in the inner disk surface. EX Lup demonstrates that outbursts can significantly change the observed organic-to-water ratios and increase the cold water reservoir, providing chemical signatures to study the recent accretion history of disks. This study provides an unprecedented demonstration of the chemical evolution triggered by accretion outbursts in the Class II phase and of the high potential of time-domain experiments to reveal processes that may have fundamental implications on planet-forming bodies near the snowline.</description>

      <title>MIRI-JWST mid-infrared direct imaging of the debris disk of HD106906</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report MIRI-JWST coronagraphic observations at 11.3 and 15.5 mic of the debris disk around the young star HD 106906. The observations were made to characterize the structure, temperature and mass of the disk through the thermal emission of the dust heated by the central star. Another goal was also to constrain the size distribution of the grains. The data were reduced and calibrated using the JWST pipeline. The analysis was based on a forward-modeling of the images using a multiparameter radiative transfer model coupled to an optical code for coronagraphy processing. The disk is clearly detected at both wavelengths. The slight asymmetry is geometrically consistent with the asymmetry observed in the near-IR, but it is inconsistent the brightness distribution. The observed structure is well reproduced with a model of a disk (or belt) with a critical radius 70 au, a mildly inward-increasing density (index 2) and a steeper decrease outward (index -6). This indication of a filled disk inside the critical radius is inconsistent with sculpting from an inner massive planet. The size distribution of the grains that cause the mid-IR emission is well constrained by the flux ratio at the two wavelengths : 0.45 10 mic and 0.65 10 mic for silicate and graphite grains, respectively. The minimum size is consistent with predictions of blowout through radiative pressure. We derive a mass of the dust that causes the mid-IR emission of 3.3 5.0 E3 Mearth. When the larger grains (up to 1 cm) that cause the millimeter emission are included, we extrapolate this mass to 0.10 0.16 Mearth. We point out to that this is fully consistent with ALMA observations of the disk in terms of dust mass and of its millimeter flux. We estimate the average dust temperature in the planetesimal belt to be 74 K, and a temperature range within the whole disk from 40 to 130 K.</description>

      <title>Exoplaneteers Keep Calling Plots "Allan Variance" Plots When They Aren't</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I highlight that there is a substantial number of papers (at least 11 published since 2024) which all refer to a specific type of plot as an "Allan variance" plot, when in fact they seem to be plotting the standard deviation of the residuals versus bin size. The Allan variance quantifies the stability of a time series by calculating the average squared difference between successive time-averaged segments over a specified interval; it is not equivalent to the standard deviation. This misattribution seems particularly prolific in the exoplanet transit spectroscopy community. However, I emphasize that it does not impact the scientific analyses presented in those works. I discuss where this confusion seems to stem from and encourage the community to ensure statistical measures are named correctly to avoid confusion.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Limits of TESS Stellar Rotation Measurements with the K2-TESS Overlap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) has provided stellar rotation periods across much of the sky through high-precision light curves, but the reliability and completeness of these measurements require careful evaluation. We assess the accuracy of TESS-derived rotation periods by leveraging a cross-matched sample of ~23,000 stars observed by both TESS and the K2 mission, treating K2 periods as a benchmark. Using causal pixel models to extract light curves and the Lomb-Scargle (LS) periodogram to identify rotation signals, we quantify the empirical uncertainties, reliability, and completeness of TESS rotation period measurements. We find that uncertainties on TESS-derived rotation periods are typically below 3% for stars with periods &lt; 10 days. Rotation periods are generally reliable out to 10 days, with &gt;80% of measurements matching the K2 benchmark. Completeness and reliability drop dramatically for periods beyond ~12 days due to the 27-day sector limitation. Stricter cuts on TESS magnitude and LS power improve reliability; the highest LS power tested (&gt;0.2) ensures &gt;90% reliability below 10 days but removes over half of potential detections. Stitching consecutive-sector light curves reduces period uncertainties but does not improve overall reliability or completeness due to persistent systematics. Our findings and code provide a framework for interpreting TESS-derived rotation periods and inform the selection of quality cuts to optimize studies of stellar rotation, young associations, and gyrochronology.</description>

      <title>Disentangling the Effects of Temperature, Clouds, and Gravity on K I doublet in L dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of surface gravity, effective temperature, and cloudiness on the potassium doublet (\ion{K}{1}) at 1.17 {\mu}m in brown dwarf spectra. Using pseudo-Voigt profiles to fit the \ion{K}{1} doublet in Sonora Diamondback atmospheric model spectra, we find that gravity and cloudiness affect the spectra differently in mid to late-L dwarfs. The full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) is strongly correlated with surface gravity, while the maximum depth strongly correlates with cloudiness. This method allows us to separate the effects of clouds and surface gravity on the \ion{K}{1} 1.17 {\mu}m doublet. We also find that the FWHM and maximum depth of the doublet can help to estimate the effective temperature and surface gravity in early to mid-L dwarfs.</description>

      <title>The chaotic history of the retrograde multi-planet system in K2-290A driven by distant stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.03586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.03586v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The equator of star K2-290A was recently found to be inclined by 124+/-6 degrees relative to the orbits of both its known transiting planets. The presence of a companion star B at ~100 au suggested that the birth protoplanetary disk could have tilted, thus providing an explanation for the peculiar retrograde state of this multi-planet system. In this work, we show that a primordial misalignment is not required and that the observed retrograde state is a natural consequence of the chaotic stellar obliquity evolution driven by a wider-orbit companion C at ~2000 au long after the disk disperses. The star C drives eccentricity and/or inclination oscillations on the inner binary orbit, leading to widespread chaos from the periodic resonance passages between the stellar spin and planetary secular modes. Based on a population synthesis study, we find that the observed stellar obliquity is reached in ~40-70% of the systems, making this mechanism a robust outcome of the secular dynamics,regardless of the spin-down history of the central star. This work highlights the unusual role that very distant companions can have on the orbits of close-in planets and the host star's spin evolution, connecting four orders of magnitude in distance scale over billions of orbits. We finally comment on the application to other exoplanet systems, including multi-planet systems in wide binaries.</description>

      <title>De-jittering Ariel: an optimized algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12907v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The European Space Agency's Ariel mission, scheduled for launch in 2029, aims to conduct the first large-scale survey of atmospheric spectra of transiting exoplanets. Ariel achieves the high photometric stability on transit timescales required to detect the spectroscopic signatures of chemical elements with a payload design optimized for transit photometry that either eliminates known systematics or allows for their removal during data processing without significantly degrading or biasing the detection. Jitter in the spacecraft's line of sight is a source of disturbance when measuring the spectra of exoplanet atmospheres. We describe an improved algorithm for de-jittering Ariel observations simulated in the time domain. We opt for an approach based on the spatial information on the Point Spread Function (PSF) distortion from jitter to detrend the optical signals. The jitter model is based on representative simulations from Airbus Defence and Space, the prime contractor for the Ariel service module. We investigate the precision and biases of the retrieved atmospheric spectra from the jitter-detrended observations. At long wavelengths, the photometric stability of the Ariel spectrometer is already dominated by photon noise. Our algorithm effectively de-jitters both photometric and spectroscopic data, ensuring that the performance remains photon noise-limited across the entire Ariel spectrum, fully compliant with mission requirements. This work contributes to the development of the data reduction pipeline for Ariel, aligning with its scientific goals, and may also benefit other astronomical telescopes and instrumentation.</description>
