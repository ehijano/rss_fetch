      <title>Factor risk measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces and studies factor risk measures. While risk measures only rely on the distribution of a loss random variable, in many cases risk needs to be measured relative to some major factors. In this paper, we introduce a double-argument mapping as a risk measure to assess the risk relative to a vector of factors, called factor risk measure. The factor risk measure only depends on the joint distribution of the risk and the factors. A set of natural axioms are discussed, and particularly distortion, quantile, linear and coherent factor risk measures are introduced and characterized. Moreover, we introduce a large set of concrete factor risk measures and many of them are new to the literature, which are interpreted in the context of regulatory capital requirement. Finally, the distortion factor risk measures are applied in the risk-sharing problem and some numerical examples are presented to show the difference between the Value-at-Risk and the quantile factor risk measures.</description>

      <title>Analytic Pricing of SOFR Futures Contracts with Smile and Skew</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15728v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a perturbative formalism to solve the backward-looking futures pricing problem. The formalism is based on a time-ordered exponential series which allows to derive the functional form of the integral kernel associated to the backward-Kolmogorov diffusion PDE. We present an analytic pricing formula for SOFR futures contracts under an extension of the Hull-White model which incorporates not only the intrinsic convexity adjustments captured by Mercurio [2018], but also the skew and smile observed in options markets as done in Turfus and Romero-Berm\'udez [2023].</description>
