      <title>The $S_3$-symmetric $q$-Onsager algebra and its Lusztig automorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $q$-Onsager algebra $O_q$ is defined by two generators and two relations, called the $q$-Dolan/Grady relations. In 2019, Baseilhac and Kolb introduced two automorphisms of $O_q$, now called the Lusztig automorphisms. Recently, we introduced a generalization of $O_q$ called the $S_3$-symmetric $q$-Onsager algebra $\mathbb O_q$. The algebra $\mathbb O_q$ has six distinguished generators, said to be standard. The standard $\mathbb O_q$-generators can be identified with the vertices of a regular hexagon, such that nonadjacent generators commute and adjacent generators satisfy the $q$-Dolan/Grady relations. In the present paper we do the following: (i) for each standard $\mathbb O_q$-generator we construct an automorphism of $\mathbb O_q$ called a Lusztig automorphism; (ii) we describe how the six Lusztig automorphisms of $\mathbb O_q$ are related to each other; (iii) we describe what happens if a
  finite-dimensional irreducible $\mathbb O_q$-module is twisted by a Lusztig automorphism; (iv) we give a detailed example involving an irreducible
  $\mathbb O_q$-module with dimension 5.</description>

      <title>Hopf algebras with the dual Chevalley property of discrete corepresentation type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We try to classify Hopf algebras with the dual Chevalley property of discrete corepresentation type over an algebraically closed field $\Bbb{k}$ with characteristic 0. For such Hopf algebra $H$, we characterize the link quiver of $H$ and determine the structures of the link-indecomposable component $H_{(1)}$ containing $\Bbb{k}1$. Besides, we construct an infinite-dimensional non-pointed non-cosemisimple link-indecomposable Hopf algebra $H(e_{\pm 1}, f_{\pm 1}, u, v)$ with the dual Chevalley property of discrete corepresentation type.</description>

      <title>Classification of dynamical Lie algebras generated by spin interactions on undirected graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a classification of all dynamical Lie algebras generated by 2-local spin interactions on undirected graphs. Building on our previous work where we provided such a classification for spin chains, here we consider the more general case of undirected graphs. As it turns out, the one-dimensional case is special; for any other graph, the dynamical Lie algebra solely depends on whether the graph is bipartite or not. An important consequence of this result is that the cases where the dynamical Lie algebra is polynomial in size are special and restricted to one dimension.</description>

      <title>Self-distributive structures, braces &amp; the Yang-Baxter equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The theory of the set-theoretic Yang-Baxter equation is reviewed from a purely algebraic point of view. We recall certain algebraic structures called shelves, racks and quandles. These objects satisfy a self-distributivity condition and lead to solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation. We also recall that non-involutive solutions of the braid equation are obtained from shelf and rack solutions by a suitable parametric twist, whereas all involutive set-theoretic solutions are reduced to the flip map via a parametric twist. The notion of braces is also presented as the suitable algebraic structure associated to involutive set-theoretic solutions. The quantum algebra as well as the integrability of Baxterized involutive set-theoretic solutions is also discussed. The explicit form of the Drinfel'd twist is presented allowing the derivation of general set-theoretic solutions.</description>

      <title>On certain noncommutative geometries via categories of sheaves of (graded) PI-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose to study noncommutative geometry using the language of categories of sheaves of algebras with polynomial identities and their properties, introducing new (graded) noncommutative geometries, which include, for example, the following algebras: superalgebras, $\mathbb{Z}_2^n$-graded superalgebras, Azumaya algebras, Clifford and quaternion algebras, the algebra of upper triangular matrices, quantum groups at roots of unity, and also some NC-schemes. More precisely, fix a group $G$, a $G$-graded associative algebra $A$ over a field $F$ of characteristic 0 and a topological space $X$; we construct a locally $G$-graded ringed space structure on $X$, where the sheaf structure belongs to the $G$-graded variety $\text{G-var}(A)$ of algebras generated by $A$, which classify all geometric spaces that belong to $\text{G-var}(A)$. We study conditions to compare two geometries in a (graded) Morita context, as well as their corresponding differential calculi.</description>

      <title>The $q$-immanants and higher quantum Capelli identities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09855v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct polynomials ${\mathbb{S}}_{\mu}(z)$ parameterized by Young diagrams $\mu$, whose coefficients are central elements of the quantized enveloping algebra ${\rm U}_q({\mathfrak{gl}}_n)$. Their constant terms coincide with the central elements provided by the general construction of Drinfeld and Reshetikhin. For another special value of $z$, we get $q$-analogues of Okounkov's quantum immanants for ${\mathfrak{gl}}_n$. We show that the Harish-Chandra image of ${\mathbb{S}}_{\mu}(z)$ is a factorial Schur polynomial. We also prove quantum analogues of the higher Capelli identities and derive Newton-type identities.</description>

      <title>Semisimplicity of module categories of certain affine vertex operator superalgebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11797v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we show Kazhdan-Lusztig categories, that is, the categories of lower bounded generalized weight modules for certain affine vertex operator superalgebras that are locally finite modules of the underlying finite dimensional Lie superalgebra, are semisimple. Those are all representation categories of affine vertex operator superalgebras at conformal but non admissible levels. As a consequence, the categories of finite length generalized modules for these affine vertex operator superalgebras have braided tensor category structures.</description>

      <title>Non-Perturbative Schwinger-Dyson Equations for 3d ${\cal N} = 4$ Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.08989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2009.08989v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze symmetries corresponding to separated topological sectors of 3d ${\cal} N=4$ gauge theories with Higgs vacua, compactified on a circle. The symmetries are encoded in Schwinger-Dyson identities satisfied by correlation functions of a certain gauge-invariant operator, the "vortex character." Such a character observable is realized as the vortex partition function of the 3d gauge theory, in the presence of a 1/2-BPS line defect. The character enjoys a double refinement, interpreted as a deformation of the usual characters of finite-dimensional representations of quantum affine algebras. We derive and interpret the Schwinger-Dyson identities for the 3d theory from various physical perspectives: in the 3d gauge theory itself, in a 1d gauged quantum mechanics, in 2d $q$-Toda theory, and in 6d little string theory. We establish the dictionary between all approaches. Lastly, we comment on the transformation properties of the vortex character under the action of three-dimensional Seiberg duality.</description>

      <title>Categorification of DAHA and Macdonald polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.10009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2103.10009v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe a categorification of the Double Affine Hecke Algebra (${\mathcal{H}\kern -.4em\mathcal{H}}$) associated with an affine Lie algebra $\widehat{\mathfrak{g}}$, including a categorification of the polynomial representation and Macdonald polynomials.
  Our categorification results are presented in the derived setting, focusing on the derived category of graded modules over the Lie superalgebra ${\mathfrak I}[\xi]$, where ${\mathfrak I} \subset \widehat{\mathfrak{g}}$ is the Iwahori subalgebra of the affine Lie algebra and $\xi$ is a formal odd variable.
  First, we show that the compositions of induction and restriction functors associated with minimal parabolic subalgebras ${\mathfrak{p}}_{i}$ categorify the Demazure operators $T_i + 1 \in {\mathcal{H}\kern -.4em\mathcal{H}}$, ensuring that all algebraic relations of $T_i$ have categorical interpretations. Second, for each dominant weight $\lambda$ we introduce a complex ${\mathbb{EM}}_{\lambda}$ of ${\mathfrak{I}}[\xi]$-modules and a complex ${\mathbb{PM}}_{\lambda}$ of ${\mathfrak{g}}[z,\xi]$-modules, whose Euler characteristics are equal to nonsymmetric $E_{\lambda}$ and symmetric $P_{\lambda}$ Macdonald polynomials respectively.
  We illustrate our theory with the example $\mathfrak{g}=\mathfrak{sl}_2$ where we construct the cyclic representations of Lie superalgebra ${\mathfrak{I}}[\xi]$ such that their supercharacters coincide with certain normalizations of nonsymmetric Macdonald polynomials.</description>

      <title>Hecke and Artin monoids and their homomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18821v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The aim of the present work is to systematically study homomorphisms of Hecke and Artin monoids and thus to develop their comprehensive theory. Our original motivation was the striking observation that parabolic projections of Hecke monoids respect all parabolic elements. We found other classes of homomorphisms of Hecke monoids with the same property and discovered that many of them lift to homomorphisms of covering Artin monoids with a similar property. It turned out that they belong to a much larger class (in fact, a category) of homomorphisms of Artin monoids, most of which appear to be new.</description>
