      <title>Radiogenomic biomarkers for immunotherapy in glioblastoma: A systematic review of magnetic resonance imaging studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Immunotherapy is an effective precision medicine treatment for several cancers. Imaging signatures of the underlying genome (radiogenomics) in glioblastoma patients may serve as preoperative biomarkers of the tumor-host immune apparatus. Validated biomarkers would have the potential to stratify patients during immunotherapy clinical trials, and if trials are beneficial, facilitate personalized neo-adjuvant treatment. The increased use of whole genome sequencing data, and the advances in bioinformatics and machine learning make such developments plausible. We performed a systematic review to determine the extent of development and validation of immune-related radiogenomic biomarkers for glioblastoma. A systematic review was performed following PRISMA guidelines using the PubMed, Medline, and Embase databases. Qualitative analysis was performed by incorporating the QUADAS 2 tool and CLAIM checklist. PROSPERO registered CRD42022340968. Extracted data were insufficiently homogenous to perform a meta-analysis. Results Nine studies, all retrospective, were included. Biomarkers extracted from magnetic resonance imaging volumes of interest included apparent diffusion coefficient values, relative cerebral blood volume values, and image-derived features. These biomarkers correlated with genomic markers from tumor cells or immune cells or with patient survival. The majority of studies had a high risk of bias and applicability concerns regarding the index test performed. Radiogenomic immune biomarkers have the potential to provide early treatment options to patients with glioblastoma. Targeted immunotherapy, stratified by these biomarkers, has the potential to allow individualized neo-adjuvant precision treatment options in clinical trials. However, there are no prospective studies validating these biomarkers, and interpretation is limited due to study bias with little evidence of generalizability.</description>

      <title>SpatialVisVR: An Immersive, Multiplexed Medical Image Viewer With Contextual Similar-Patient Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.02882v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In contemporary pathology, multiplexed immunofluorescence (mIF) and multiplex immunohistochemistry (mIHC) present both significant opportunities and challenges. These methodologies shed light on intricate tumor microenvironment interactions, emphasizing the need for intuitive visualization tools to analyze vast biological datasets effectively. As electronic health records (EHR) proliferate and physicians face increasing information overload, the integration of advanced technologies becomes imperative. SpatialVisVR emerges as a versatile VR platform tailored for comparing medical images, with adaptability for data privacy on embedded hardware. Clinicians can capture pathology slides in real-time via mobile devices, leveraging SpatialVisVR's deep learning algorithm to match and display similar mIF images. This interface supports the manipulation of up to 100 multiplexed protein channels, thereby assisting in immuno-oncology decision-making. Ultimately, SpatialVisVR aims to streamline diagnostic processes, advocating for a comprehensive and efficient approach to immuno-oncology research and treatment.</description>
