      <title>Production and magnetic self-confinement of $e^-e^+$ plasma by an extremely intense laser pulse incident on a structured solid target</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an all-optical, single-laser-pulse scheme for generating dense, relativistic, strongly-magnetized electron-positron pair plasma. The scheme involves the interaction of an extremely intense ($I \gtrsim \SI{e24}{\watt/\cm^2}$) circularly polarized laser pulse with a solid-density target containing a conical cavity. Through full-scale three-dimensional particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations that account for quantum electrodynamical effects, it is shown that this interaction results in two significant outcomes: first, the generation of quasi-static axial magnetic fields reaching tens of gigagauss due to the inverse Faraday effect; and second, the production of large quantities of electron-positron pairs (up to $\num{e13}$) via the Breit-Wheeler process. The $e^-e^+$ plasma becomes trapped in the magnetic field and remains confined for hundreds of femtoseconds, far exceeding the laser timescale. The dependency of pair plasma parameters, as well as the efficiency of plasma production and confinement, is discussed in relation to the properties of the laser pulse and the target. Realizing this scheme experimentally would enable the investigation of physical processes relevant to extreme astrophysical environments.</description>

      <title>Dephasing of ion beams as Magnetic Vortex Acceleration regime transitions into a bubble-like field structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction of an ultra-intense laser pulse with a near critical density target results in the formation of a plasma channel, a strong azimuthal magnetic field and moving vortices. An application of this is the generation of energetic and collimated ion beams via Magnetic Vortex Acceleration. The optimized regime of Magnetic Vortex Acceleration is becoming experimentally accessible with new high intensity laser beamlines coming online and advances made in near critical density target fabrication. The robustness of the acceleration mechanism with realistic experimental conditions is examined with three-dimensional simulations. Of particular interest is the acceleration performance with different laser temporal contrast conditions, in some cases leading to pre-expanded target profiles prior to the arrival of the main pulse. Preplasma effects on the structure of the accelerating fields is explored, including a detailed analysis of the ion beam properties and the efficiency of the process. Improved scaling laws for the MVA mechanism, including the laser focal spot size effects, are presented.</description>

      <title>High-Fidelity Data-Driven Dynamics Model for Reinforcement Learning-based Magnetic Control in HL-3 Tokamak</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The drive to control tokamaks, a prominent technology in nuclear fusion, is essential due to its potential to provide a virtually unlimited source of clean energy. Reinforcement learning (RL) promises improved flexibility to manage the intricate and non-linear dynamics of the plasma encapsulated in a tokamak. However, RL typically requires substantial interaction with a simulator capable of accurately evolving the high-dimensional plasma state. Compared to first-principle-based simulators, whose intense computations lead to sluggish RL training, we devise an effective method to acquire a fully data-driven simulator, by mitigating the arising compounding error issue due to the underlying autoregressive nature. With high accuracy and appealing extrapolation capability, this high-fidelity dynamics model subsequently enables the rapid training of a qualified RL agent to directly generate engineering-reasonable magnetic coil commands, aiming at the desired long-term targets of plasma current and last closed flux surface. Together with a surrogate magnetic equilibrium reconstruction model EFITNN, the RL agent successfully maintains a $100$-ms, $1$ kHz trajectory control with accurate waveform tracking on the HL-3 tokamak. Furthermore, it also demonstrates the feasibility of zero-shot adaptation to changed triangularity targets, confirming the robustness of the developed data-driven dynamics model. Our work underscores the advantage of fully data-driven dynamics models in yielding RL-based trajectory control policies at a sufficiently fast pace, an anticipated engineering requirement in daily discharge practices for the upcoming ITER device.</description>

      <title>General relaxation model for a homogeneous plasma with spherically symmetric velocity space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A kinetic moment-closed model, derived from the Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equation for homogeneous plasma with spherically symmetric velocity space, is introduced as a general relaxation model. The closed form of this nonlinear model is presented by introducing a set new functions called R function and R integration. This model, based on the finitely distinguishable independent features hypothesis, allows for capturing the nature of equilibrium state. From this relaxation model, a general temperature relaxation model is derived and the general characteristic frequency of temperature relaxation when velocity space exhibits spherical symmetry is presented.</description>

      <title>Numerical simulations of temperature anisotropy instabilities stimulated by suprathermal protons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The new in situ measurements of the Solar Orbiter mission contribute to the knowledge of the suprathermal populations in the solar wind, especially of ions and protons whose characterization, although still in the early phase, seems to suggest a major involvement in the interaction with plasma wave fluctuations. Recent studies point to the stimulating effect of suprathermal populations on temperature anisotropy instabilities in the case of electrons already being demonstrated in theory and numerical simulations. Here, we investigate anisotropic protons, addressing the electromagnetic ion-cyclotron (EMIC) and the proton firehose (PFH) instabilities. Suprathermal populations enhance the high-energy tails of the Kappa velocity (or energy) distributions measured in situ, enabling characterization by contrasting to the quasi-thermal population in the low-energy (bi-)Maxwellian core. We use hybrid simulations to investigate the two instabilities (with ions or protons as particles and electrons as fluid) for various configurations relevant to the solar wind and terrestrial magnetosphere. The new simulation results confirm the linear theory and its predictions. In the presence of suprathermal protons, the wave fluctuations reach increased energy density levels for both instabilities and cause faster and/or deeper relaxation of temperature anisotropy. The magnitude of suprathermal effects also depends on each instability's specific (initial) parametric regimes. These results further strengthen the belief that wave-particle interactions govern space plasmas. These provide valuable clues for understanding their dynamics, particularly the involvement of suprathermal particles behind the quasi-stationary non-equilibrium states reported by in situ observations.</description>

      <title>The Structure and Kinetic Ion Behavior of Low Mach Number Shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low Mach number collisionless shocks are routinely observed in the solar wind and upstream of planetary bodies. However, most in situ observations have lacked the necessary temporal resolution to directly study the kinetic behavior of ions across these shocks. We investigate a series of five low Mach number bow shock crossings observed by the Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission. The five shocks had comparable Mach numbers, but varying shock-normal angles ($66^{\circ} \lesssim \theta_{Bn} \lesssim 89^{\circ}$) and ramp widths ($5~\mathrm{km} \lesssim l \lesssim 100~\mathrm{km}$). The shock width is shown to be crucial in determining the fraction of protons reflected and energized by the shock, with proton reflection increasing with decreasing shock width. As the shock width increases proton reflection is arrested entirely. For nearly perpendicular shocks, reflected protons exhibit quasi-periodic structures, which persist far downstream of the shock. As the shock-normal angle becomes more oblique these periodic proton structures broaden to form an energetic halo population. Periodic fluctuations in the magnetic field downstream of the shocks are generated by fluctuations in dynamic pressure of alpha particles, which are decelerated by the cross-shock potential and subsequently undergo gyrophase bunching. These results demonstrate that complex kinetic-scale ion dynamics occur in low Mach number shocks, which depend significantly on the shock profile.</description>

      <title>Variation of Whistler-Mode Wave Characteristics Along Magnetic Field Lines: Comparison of Near-Equatorial THEMIS and Middle-Latitude ERG Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The latitudinal distribution of whistler-mode wave intensity plays a crucial role in determining the efficiency and energy of electrons scattered by these waves in the outer radiation belt. Traditionally, this wave property has mostly been derived from statistical measurements of off-equatorial spacecraft, which collect intensity data at various latitudes under different geomagnetic conditions and at different times. In this study we examine a set of events captured by both the near-equatorial THEMIS spacecraft and the off-equatorial ERG spacecraft. Specifically, we compare the whistler-mode wave intensity from THEMIS and ERG measurements at the same MLT and time sectors. Similar wave spectrum characteristics confirm that THEMIS and ERG indeed observed the same wave activity. However, upon closer examination of the wave intensity variations, we identify two distinct categories of events: those that follow the statistically predicted variations in wave intensity along magnetic latitudes, and those that exhibit rapid wave intensity decay away from the equatorial plane. We analyze main characteristics of events from both categories and discuss possible implications of our analysis for radiation belt models.</description>

      <title>Continuum damping of topologically-protected edge modes at the boundary of a magnetized plasma</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.06693v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent extension of the topological ideas to continuous systems with broken time-reversal symmetry, such as magnetized plasmas, provides new insights into the nature of scattering-free topologically-protected surface plasma waves (TSPWs). We demonstrate a unique characteristic of TSPWs propagating above the electron cyclotron frequency: their collisionless damping via coupling to the continuum of resonant modes localized inside a smooth plasma-vacuum interface. Damped TSPWs retain their unidirectional nature and robustness against backscattering. When sheared magnetic field creates a boundary between damped and undamped TSPWs, the two refract into each other without reflections</description>

      <title>Thermal fluid closures and pressure anisotropies in numerical simulations of plasma wakefield acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19635v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of plasma-based acceleration processes with collisionless particle dynamics and non negligible thermal effects. We aim at assessing the applicability of fluid-like models, obtained by suitable closure assumptions applied to the relativistic kinetic equations, thus not suffering of statistical noise, even in presence of a finite temperature. The work here presented focuses on the characterization of pressure anisotropies, which crucially depend on the adopted closure scheme, and hence are useful to discern the appropriate thermal fluid model. To this aim, simulation results of spatially resolved fluid models with different thermal closure assumptions are compared with the results of particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations at changing temperature and amplitude of plasma oscillations.</description>

      <title>Exploring the operational limits of Mirnov coil arrays in stellarators by means of a synthetic diagnostic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04221v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A synthetic Mirnov coils diagnostic is presented and used to study the capabilities of the poloidal array of single-axis coils and the two helical arrays of tri-axial coils installed in the TJ-II stellarator. This tool integrates the plasma currents induced by Alfv\'en-like perturbations of the electric potential inside the plasma and provides the induced magnetic field oscillations anywhere outside of it. The simulated signals can then be analyzed in the same manner as the experimental ones, and a scan on the radial position and width of the potential perturbation is conducted to find the limiting values that produce identifiable signals. We find, not surprisingly, that core-localized modes are indistinguishable from one another; and that the identification of low-n, low-m modes is often subject to off-by-one errors. We also determine the optimal polarization basis in which to analyze the tri-axial coils signals and address the diagnostic performance when resolving components of gap modes such as HAEs. Additionally, selected cases have been analyzed with a simplified plasma response model, showing that plasma shielding of the mode currents may further deteriorate the accuracy of the mode identification method. We conclude with the analysis of an experimental case taken from the TJ-II database to illustrate the usefulness of the diagnostic. The code for this synthetic diagnostic, that can be easily used to conduct similar analysis for other devices, is publicly available in http://github.com/pponsv/synth_mirnov .</description>

      <title>Electron-ion heating partition in imbalanced solar-wind turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.13048v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A likely candidate mechanism to heat the solar corona and solar wind is low-frequency "Alfv\'enic" turbulence sourced by magnetic fluctuations near the solar surface. Depending on its properties, such turbulence can heat different species via different mechanisms, and the comparison of theoretical predictions to observed temperatures, wind speeds, anisotropies, and their variation with heliocentric radius provides a sensitive test of this physics. Here we explore the importance of normalized cross helicity, or imbalance, for controlling solar-wind heating, since it is a key parameter of magnetized turbulence and varies systematically with wind speed and radius. Based on a hybrid-kinetic simulation in which the forcing's imbalance decreases with time -- a crude model for a plasma parcel entrained in the outflowing wind -- we demonstrate how significant changes to the turbulence and heating result from the "helicity barrier" effect. Its dissolution at low imbalance causes its characteristic features -- strong perpendicular ion heating with a steep "transition-range" drop in electromagnetic fluctuation spectra -- to disappear, driving more energy into electrons and parallel ion heat, and halting the emission of ion-scale waves. These predictions seem to agree with a diverse array of solar-wind observations, offering to explain a variety of complex correlations and features within a single theoretical framework.</description>

      <title>Spectrotemporal shaping of attosecond x-ray pulses with a fresh-slice free-electron laser</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02189v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a scheme for coherently shaping attosecond x-ray pulses at free-electron lasers. We show that by seeding an FEL with a short coherent seed that overfills the amplification bandwidth, one can shape the wigner function of the pulse by controlling the undulator taper profile. The examples of controllable coherent pulse pairs and trains, as well as isolated spectrotemporally shaped pulses with very broad coherent bandwidths are examined in detail. Existing attosecond XFELs can achieve these experimental conditions in a two-stage cascade, in which the coherent seed is generated by a short current spike in an electron bunch and shaped in an unspoiled region within the same bunch. We experimentally demonstrate the production of pulse pairs using this method at the Linac Coherent Light Source.</description>

      <title>On the shifts of orbits and periodic orbits under perturbation and the change of Poincar\'e map Jacobian of periodic orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08079v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Periodic orbits and cycles resp. play a significant role in discrete- and continuous-time dynamical systems (i.e. maps and flows). To succinctly describe their shifts when the system is applied perturbation, the notions of functional and functional derivative are borrowed from functional analysis to consider the whole system as an argument of the geometric representation of the periodic orbit or cycle. The shifts of an orbit/trajectory and periodic orbit/cycle are analyzed and concluded as formulae for maps/flows, respectively. The theory shall be beneficial to the sensitivity to perturbation analysis, control and optimization of various systems.</description>

      <title>31 Lectures on Geometric Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09564v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This textbook for learning geometric mechanics is written in the format of lecture notes. These lecture notes in geometric mechanics are meant to convey insight through clear definitions and workable examples. The lecture format adopted here is intended to convey the immediacy of the taught course and to be useful as a basis for other courses. The lecture notes comprise:
  AP = Applications of Pure maths, e.g., Noether's theorem: Lie group symmetry of Hamilton's variational principle implies conservation laws for its equations of motion.\smallskip
  PA = Purifications of Applied maths, e.g., Euler fluid dynamics describes geodesic flow on the manifold of smooth invertible maps acting on the domain of flow. \smallskip
  Both AP and PA appear here, though the difference is not mentioned. It is left to the reader to decide whether it was AP or PA in each of the lectures containing well over sixty solved exercises.
  An aspect of modern applications emphasised here is the use of the composition of evolutionary maps for multi-physics, multi-timescale interactions including waves interacting with flows in the Euler--Poincar\'e framework in geophysical fluid dynamics (GFD) for ocean and atmosphere dynamics, and in magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) for applications in plasma physics such as magnetic confinement fusion (MFC) and astrophysical processes such as Alfv\'en waves and gravity waves propagating on the Solar tachocline. The topics covered in each lecture can also be gleaned from its table of contents listed at the onset of each lecture.</description>
