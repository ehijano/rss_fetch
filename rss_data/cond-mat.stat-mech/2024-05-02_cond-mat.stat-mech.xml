      <title>Quantum Entanglement In Mixed-Spin Trimmer: Effects of A Magnetic Field And Heterogeneous g-Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixed spin-(1/2,1/2,1) trimmer with two different Land\'{e} g-factors and two different exchange couplings is considered. The main feature of the model is non-conserving magnetization. The Hamiltonian of the system is diagonalized analytically. We presented a detailed analysis of the ground state properties, revealing several possible ground state phase diagrams and magnetization profiles. The main focus is on how non-conserving magnetization affects quantum entanglement. We have found that non-conserving magnetization can bring to the continuous dependence of the entanglement quantifying parameter (negativity) on magnetic field within the same eigenstate, while for the case of uniform $g$-factors it is a constant. The main result is an essential enhancement of the entanglement in case of uniform couplings for one pair of spins caused by an arbitrary small difference in the values of $g$-factors. This enhancement is robust and brings to almost 7-fold increasing of the negativity. We have also found weakening of entanglement for other cases. Thus, non-conserving magnetization offers a broad opportunity to manipulate the entanglement by means of magnetic field.</description>

      <title>$1/f^{\alpha}$ noise in the Robin Hood model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Robin Hood dynamics, a one-dimensional extremal self-organized critical model that describes the evolution of low-temperature creep. One of the key quantities is the time evolution of the state variable (force noise). To understand the temporal correlations, we compute the power spectra of the local force fluctuations and apply finite-size scaling to get scaling functions and critical exponents. We find a signature of the $1/f^{\alpha}$ noise for the local force with a nontrivial value of the spectral exponent $0&lt; \alpha &lt; 2$. We also examine temporal fluctuations in the position of the extremal site and a local activity signal. We present results for different local interaction rules of the model.</description>

      <title>To restart, or not to restart, that is the question</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mean time taken by a Brownian particle to cover a distance $L$ is $L^2/2D$, with $D$ being its diffusion coefficient. We find that restarts increase this mean time. This is because restarts naturally introduce time overheads which need to be taken into account while addressing the escape properties. In addition, restarts impose a constraint on allowed overhead functions if they are to provide an advantage, that is, a reduced mean escape time. We explicitly study these constraints for Poisson and sharp restarts. Implementing an overhead function to control escape times means that the physical properties of the Brownian particle need to be appropriately modified. When restarts are non-instantaneous, an additional delay is introduced increasing the mean escape time further. Can restarts overcome the delays incurred due to finite return times? To restart, or not to restart, should be the question.</description>

      <title>Spin-spin correlators on the $\beta$/$\beta^{\star}$ boundaries in 2D Ising-like models: non-universality in the scaling region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate quantitative properties of correlation functions on the boundaries between two 2D Ising-like models with dual parameters $\beta$ and $\beta^{\star}$. Spin-spin correlators in such constructions without reflection symmetry with respect to transnational-invariant directions are usually represented as $2\times 2$ block Toeplitz determinants which are normally significantly harder than the scalar ($1\times 1$-blocked) versions. Nevertheless, we show that for the specific $\beta/\beta^{\star}$ boundaries considered in this work, the symbol matrices allow explicit commutative Wiener-Hopf factorizations. However, the Wiener-Hopf factors at different $z$ do not commute. We will show that due to this non-commutativity, "logarithmic divergences" and non-universal short distance contributions in the Wiener-Hopf factors fail to factorize out completely in the re-scaled correlators. This leads to non-universality of the leading large $r$ asymptotics at the order $\frac {e^{-r}}{r^{\frac{3}{2}}}$, even when the constant terms are re-scaled to be the same.</description>

      <title>Large deviations of current for the symmetric simple exclusion process on a semi-infinite line and on an infinite line with slow bonds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two of the most influential exact results for classical one-dimensional diffusive transport are the exact results of current statistics for the symmetric simple exclusion process in the stationary state on a finite line coupled with two unequal reservoirs at the boundary and in the non-stationary state on an infinite line. We present the corresponding result for the intermediate geometry of a semi-infinite line coupled with a single reservoir. These results are obtained using the fluctuating hydrodynamics framework of the macroscopic fluctuation theory and confirmed by rare event simulations using a cloning algorithm. Our exact result enables us to address the corresponding problem on an infinite line in the presence of a slow region and several related problems.</description>

      <title>A theory of best choice selection through objective arguments grounded in Linear Response Theory concepts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose how to use objective arguments grounded in statistical mechanics concepts in order to obtain a single number, obtained after aggregation, which would allow to rank "agents", "opinions", ..., all defined in a very broad sense. We aim toward any process which should a priori demand or lead to some consensus in order to attain the presumably best choice among many possibilities. In order to precise the framework, we discuss previous attempts, recalling trivial "means of scores", - weighted or not, Condorcet paradox, TOPSIS, etc. We demonstrate through geometrical arguments on a toy example, with 4 criteria, that the pre-selected order of criteria in previous attempts makes a difference on the final result. However, it might be unjustified. Thus, we base our "best choice theory" on the linear response theory in statistical mechanics: we indicate that one should be calculating correlations functions between all possible choice evaluations, thereby avoiding an arbitrarily ordered set of criteria. We justify the point through an example with 6 possible criteria. Applications in many fields are suggested. Beside, two toy models serving as practical examples and illustrative arguments are given in an Appendix.</description>

      <title>Quantum thermodynamics of the Caldeira-Leggett model with non-equilibrium Gaussian reservoirs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a non-equilibrium version of the Caldeira-Leggett model in which a quantum particle is strongly coupled to a set of engineered reservoirs. The reservoirs are composed by collections of squeezed and displaced thermal modes, in contrast to the standard case in which the modes are assumed to be at equilibrium. The model proves to be very versatile. Strongly displaced/squeezed reservoirs can be used to generate an effective time dependence in the system Hamiltonian and can be identified as sources of pure work. In the case of squeezing, the time dependence is stochastic and breaks the fluctuation-dissipation relation, this can be reconciled with the second law of thermodynamics by correctly accounting for the energy used to generate the initial non-equilibrium conditions. To go beyond the average description and compute the full heat statistics, we treat squeezing and displacement as generalized Hamiltonians on a modified Keldysh contour. As an application of this technique, we show the quantum-classical correspondence between the heat statistics in the non-equilibrium Caldeira-Leggett model and the statistics of a classical Langevin particle under the action of squeezed and displaced colored noises. Finally, we discuss thermodynamic symmetries of the heat generating function, proving a fluctuation theorem for the energy balance and showing that the conservation of energy at the trajectory level emerges in the classical limit.</description>

      <title>Heat capacity and quantum compressibility of dynamical spacetimes with thermal particle creation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work continues the investigation in two recent papers on the quantum thermodynamics of spacetimes, 1) placing what was studied in [1] for thermal quantum fields in the context of early universe cosmology, and 2) extending the considerations of vacuum compressibility of dynamical spaces treated in [2] to dynamical spacetimes with thermal quantum fields. We begin with a warning that thermal equilibrium condition is not guaranteed to exist or maintained in a dynamical setting and thus finite temperature quantum field theory in cosmological spacetimes needs more careful considerations than what is often described in textbooks. A full description requires nonequilibrium quantum field theory in dynamical spacetimes using `in-in' techniques. A more manageable subclass of dynamics is where thermal equilibrium conditions are established at both the beginning and the end of evolution are both well defined. Here we shall assume an in-vacuum state. It has been shown that if the intervening dynamics has an initial period of exponential expansion, such as in inflationary cosmology, particles created from the parametric amplification of the vacuum fluctuations in the initial vacuum will have a thermal spectrum measured at the out-state. Under these conditions finite temperature field theory can be applied to calculate the quantum thermodynamic quantities. Here we consider a massive conformal scalar field in a closed four-dimensional Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker universe based on the simple analytically solvable Bernard-Duncan model. We calculate the energy density of particles created from an in-vacuum and derive the partition function. From the free energy we then derive the heat capacity and the quantum compressibility of the spacetimes with thermal particle creation. We end with some discussions and suggestions for further work in this program of studies.</description>

      <title>Entanglement and fidelity across quantum phase transitions in locally perturbed topological codes with open boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the topological-to-non-topological quantum phase transitions (QPTs) occurring in the Kitaev code under local perturbations in the form of local magnetic field and spin-spin interactions of the Ising-type using fidelity susceptibility (FS) and entanglement as the probes. We assume the code to be embedded on the surface of a wide cylinder of height $M$ and circumference $D$ with $M\ll D$. We demonstrate a power-law divergence of FS across the QPT, and determine the quantum critical points (QCPs) via a finite-size scaling analysis. We verify these results by mapping the perturbed Kitaev code to the 2D Ising model with nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor interactions, and computing the single-site magnetization as order parameter using quantum Monte-Carlo technique. We also point out an odd-even dichotomy in the occurrence of the QPT in the Kitaev ladder with respect to the odd and even values of $D$, when the system is perturbed with only Ising interaction. Our results also indicate a higher robustness of the topological phase of the Kitaev code against local perturbations if the boundary is made open along one direction. We further consider a local entanglement witness operator designed specifically to capture a lower bound to the localizable entanglement on the vertical non-trivial loop of the code. We show that the first derivative of the expectation value of the witness operator exhibits a logarithmic divergence across the QPT, and perform the finite-size scaling analysis. We demonstrate similar behaviour of the expectation value of the appropriately constructed witness operator also in the case of locally perturbed color code with open boundaries.</description>

      <title>Bulk-Boundary Correspondence in Ergodic and Nonergodic One-Dimensional Stochastic Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bulk-boundary correspondence is a fundamental principle in topological physics. In recent years, there have been considerable efforts in extending the idea of geometry and topology to classical stochastic systems far from equilibrium. However, it has been unknown whether or not the bulk-boundary correspondence can be extended to the steady states of stochastic processes accompanied by additional constraints such as the conservation of probability. The present study reveals the general form of bulk-boundary correspondence in classical stochastic processes. Specifically, we prove a correspondence between the winding number and the number of localized steady states in both ergodic and nonergodic systems. Furthermore, we extend the argument of the bulk-boundary correspondence to a many-body stochastic model called the asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP). These results would provide a guiding principle for exploring topological origin of localization in various stochastic processes including biological systems.</description>

      <title>Spin Hamiltonians in the Modulated Momenta of Light</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photonic solvers that are able to find the ground states of different spin Hamiltonians can be used to study many interactive physical systems and combinatorial optimization problems. Here, we establish a real-and-momentum space correspondence of spin Hamiltonians by spatial light transport. The real-space spin interaction is determined by modulating the momentum-space flow of light. This principle is formulated as a generalized Plancherel theorem, allowing us to implement a simple optical simulator that can find the ground states for any displacement-dependent spin interactions. Particularly, we use this principle to reveal the exotic magnetic phase diagram from a J1-J2-J3 model, and we also observe the vortex-mediated Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless dynamics from the XY model. These experiments exhibit high calculation precision by subtly controlling spin interactions from the momentum space of light, offering a promising scheme to explore novel physical effects.</description>

      <title>Recoverable strain from reverse plasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recoverable strain is the strain recovered once a stress is removed from a body, in the direction opposite to that in which the stress had acted. To date, the phenomenon has been understood as being elastic in origin: polymer chains stretched in the direction of an imposed stress will recoil after the stress is removed, for example. Any unrecoverable strain is instead attributed to irreversible plastic deformations. Here we study theoretically recoverable and unrecoverable strain within the soft glassy rheology model, aimed at describing the rheology of elastoplastic yield stress fluids and amorphous soft solids. We consider a material subject to the switch-on of a shear stress that is held constant before later being set back to zero, after which the strain recovery is observed. After an initially fast recoil that is indeed elastic in nature, consistent with the usual intuition, we find that significant subsequent strain recovery then arises not via further recoil of elasticity but instead by `reverse plasticity', in a sense that we discuss carefully. Also unexpectedly, although in rare parameter regimes, this plastic part of the strain post switch-off does not always in fact recover in the negative direction, counter to that of the previously imposed stress, but can sometimes continue to accumulate in the forward direction. The recovery is then non-monotonic overall, reminiscent of recent observations of non-monotonic stress relaxation after straining, which have been attributed to complex material memory effects. We elucidate the mechanisms underlying these behaviours in terms of the evolution of the SGR model's population of elastoplastic elements, and suggest connections with the notion of `reversible plasticity', as discussed in the recent physics literature.</description>

      <title>Hyperuniformity in phase ordering: the roles of activity, noise, and non-constant mobility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hyperuniformity emerges generically in the coarsening regime of phase-separating fluids. Numerical studies of active and passive systems have shown that the structure factor $S(q)$ behaves as $q^\varsigma$ for $q\to 0$, with hyperuniformity exponent $\varsigma = 4$. For passive systems, this result was explained in 1991 by a qualitative scaling analysis of Tomita, exploiting isotropy at scales much larger than the coarsening length $\ell$. Here we reconsider and extend Tomita's argument to address cases of active phase separation and of non-constant mobility, again finding $\varsigma=4$. We further show that dynamical noise of variance $D$ creates a transient $\varsigma = 2$ regime for $\hat q\ll \hat{q}_\ast \sim \sqrt{D} t^{[1-(d+2)\nu]/2}$, crossing over to $\varsigma = 4$ at larger $\hat{q}$. Here, $\nu$ is the coarsening exponent, with $\ell\sim t^\nu$, and $\hat{q} \propto q \ell$ is the rescaled wavenumber. In diffusive coarsening, $\nu=1/3$, so the rescaled crossover wavevector $\hat{q}_\ast$ vanishes at large times when $d\geq 2$. The slowness of this decay suggests a natural explanation for experiments that observe a long-lived $\varsigma = 2$ scaling in phase-separating active fluids (where noise is typically large). Conversely, in $d=1$, we demonstrate that with noise the $\varsigma = 2$ regime survives as $t\to\infty$, with $\hat{q}_\ast\sim D^{5/6}$. (The structure factor is not then determined by the zero-temperature fixed point.) We confirm our analytical predictions by numerical simulations of active and passive continuum theories in the deterministic case and of Model B for the stochastic case. We also compare them with related findings for a system near an absorbing-state transition rather than undergoing phase separation. A central role is played throughout by the presence or absence of a conservation law for the centre of mass position of the order parameter field.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Poisson effect in affine semiflexible polymer networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stretching an elastic material along one axis typically induces contraction along the transverse axes, a phenomenon known as the Poisson effect. From these strains, one can compute the specific volume, which generally either increases or, in the incompressible limit, remains constant as the material is stretched. However, in networks of semiflexible or stiff polymers, which are typically highly compressible yet stiffen significantly when stretched, one instead sees a significant reduction in specific volume under finite strains. This volume reduction is accompanied by increasing alignment of filaments along the strain axis and a nonlinear elastic response, with stiffening of the apparent Young's modulus. For semiflexible networks, in which entropic bending elasticity governs the linear elastic regime, the nonlinear Poisson effect is caused by the nonlinear force-extension relationship of the constituent filaments, which produces a highly asymmetric response of the constituent polymers to stretching and compression. The details of this relationship depend on the geometric and elastic properties of the underlying filaments, which can vary greatly in experimental systems. Here, we provide a comprehensive characterization of the nonlinear Poisson effect in an affine network model and explore the influence of filament properties on essential features of the macroscopic response, including strain-driven alignment and volume reduction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a mathematical framework for symmetry-resolved entanglement entropy with a non-abelian symmetry group. To obtain a reduced density matrix that is block-diagonal in the non-abelian charges, we define subsystems operationally in terms of subalgebras of invariant observables. We derive exact formulas for the average and the variance of the typical entanglement entropy for the ensemble of random pure states with fixed non-abelian charges. We focus on compact, semisimple Lie groups. We show that, compared to the abelian case, new phenomena arise from the interplay of locality and non-abelian symmetry, such as the asymmetry of the entanglement entropy under subsystem exchange, which we show in detail by computing the Page curve of a many-body system with $SU(2)$ symmetry.</description>

      <title>From Empirical Observations to Universality: Dynamics of Deep Learning with Inputs Built on Gaussian mixture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study broadens the scope of theoretical frameworks in deep learning by delving into the dynamics of neural networks with inputs that demonstrate the structural characteristics to Gaussian Mixture (GM). We analyzed how the dynamics of neural networks under GM-structured inputs diverge from the predictions of conventional theories based on simple Gaussian structures. A revelation of our work is the observed convergence of neural network dynamics towards conventional theory even with standardized GM inputs, highlighting an unexpected universality. We found that standardization, especially in conjunction with certain nonlinear functions, plays a critical role in this phenomena. Consequently, despite the complex and varied nature of GM distributions, we demonstrate that neural networks exhibit asymptotic behaviors in line with predictions under simple Gaussian frameworks.</description>

Abstract: We develop a framework for the stochastic thermodynamics of a probe coupled to a fluctuating medium with spatio-temporal correlations, described by a scalar field. For a Brownian particle dragged by a harmonic trap through a fluctuating Gaussian field, we show that near criticality (where the field displays long-range spatial correlations) the spatially-resolved average heat flux develops a dipolar structure, where heat is absorbed in front and dissipated behind the dragged particle. Moreover, a perturbative calculation reveals that the dissipated power displays three distinct dynamical regimes depending on the drag velocity.</description>

      <title>Reduced stress propagation leads to increased mechanical failure resistance in auxetic materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.14914v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Materials with negative Poisson ratio have the counter-intuitive property of expanding laterally when they are stretched longitudinally. They are accordingly termed auxetic, from the Greek auxesis meaning to increase. Experimental studies have demonstrated auxetic materials to have superior material properties, compared with conventional ones. These include synclastic curvature, increased acoustic absorption, increased resilience to material fatigue, and increased resistance to mechanical failure. Until now, the latter observations have remained poorly understood theoretically. With this motivation, the contributions of this work are twofold. First, we elucidate analytically the way in which stress propagates spatially across a material following a localised plastic failure event, finding a significantly reduced stress propagation in auxetic materials compared with conventional ones. In this way, a plastic failure event occurring in one part of a material has a reduced tendency to trigger knock-on plastic events in neighbouring regions. Second, via the numerical simulation of a lattice elastoplastic model, we demonstrate a key consequence of this reduced stress propagation to be an increased resistance to mechanical failure. This is seen not only via an increase in the externally measured yield strain, but also via a decreased tendency for plastic damage to percolate internally across a sample in catastrophic system-spanning clusters.</description>

      <title>Effect of initial conditions on current fluctuations in non-interacting active particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16811v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of initial conditions on the fluctuations of the integrated density current across the origin ($x=0$) up to a given time $t$ in a one-dimensional system of non-interacting run-and-tumble particles. Each particle has initial probabilities $f^+$ and $f^-$ to move with an initial velocity $+v$ and $-v$ respectively, where $v&gt;0$. We derive exact results for the variance (second cumulant) of the current for quenched and annealed averages over the initial conditions for the magnetization and the density fields associated with the particles. We show that at large times, the variance displays a $\sqrt{t}$ behavior, with a prefactor contingent on the specific density initial conditions used. However, at short times, the variance displays either linear $t$ or quadratic $t^2$ behavior, which depends on the combination of magnetization and density initial conditions, along with the fraction $f^+$ of particles in the positive velocity state at $t=0$. Intriguingly, if $f^+=0$, the variance displays a short time $t^2$ behavior with the same prefactor irrespective of the initial conditions for both fields.</description>

Abstract: We analyze a two-dimensional spring network model comprising breakable and unbreakable springs. Computer simulations showed this system to exhibit intermittent stress drops in a larger strain regime, and these stress drops resulted in ductile-like behavior. The scaling analysis reveals that the avalanche size distribution demonstrates a cut-off, depending on its internal structure. This study also investigates the relationship between cluster growth and stress drop, and we show that the amount of stress drop increases in terms of power law, corresponding to crack growth. The crack length distribution also demonstrates a cut-off depending on its internal structure. The results show that both the cluster growth-stress drop relationship and the crack size distribution are scaled by the quantity related to the internal structure, and the relevance of the exponent that scales the cluster growth-stress drop relationship to the exponent that scales crack size distribution is verified.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Distinguishability of Markovian Trajectories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16544v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ability to distinguish between stochastic systems based on their trajectories is crucial in thermodynamics, chemistry, and biophysics. The Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, $D_{\text{KL}}^{AB}(0,\tau)$, quantifies the distinguishability between the two ensembles of length-$\tau$ trajectories from Markov processes A and B. However, evaluating $D_{\text{KL}}^{AB}(0,\tau)$ from histograms of trajectories faces sufficient sampling difficulties, and no theory explicitly reveals what dynamical features contribute to the distinguishability. This letter provides a general formula that decomposes $D_{\text{KL}}^{AB}(0,\tau)$ in space and time for any Markov processes, arbitrarily far from equilibrium or steady state. It circumvents the sampling difficulty of evaluating $D_{\text{KL}}^{AB}(0,\tau)$. Furthermore, it explicitly connects trajectory KL divergence with individual transition events and their waiting time statistics. The results provide insights into understanding distinguishability between Markov processes, leading to new theoretical frameworks for designing biological sensors and optimizing signal transduction.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Limits of Energy Extraction in Active Fluids</title>

Abstract: Active materials form a class of far-from-equilibrium systems that are driven internally and exhibit self-organization which can be harnessed to perform mechanical work. Inspired by experiments on synthetic active networks we examine limits of work extraction from an active viscoelastic medium by analyzing the transport of a particle. The active viscoelastic material possesses an equilibrium density where the active and passive forces are balanced out. In one dimension, a gliding activation front (AF) that converts a passive to an active medium, provides active energy at a constant rate, which is injected into the system at one end and propagates to the other. We demonstrate that there exists a maximum velocity of the AF, above which the activated region fails to deliver the transport power. We hypothesize, and intuitively argue based on the limit cases, that the feasibility and the velocity of transport can be interpreted in terms of the velocity of an equilibration Domain Wall of the field, which is set by two parameters: a measure of activity, and the viscoelastic timescale. The phase diagram comprises Transport and No-Transport sectors, namely for any pair of the two parameters, there exists a threshold velocity of the AF above which the particle transport becomes impossible. Constructing the phase diagram we find that there are regions of the phase diagram for which the threshold velocity of the AF diverges. Larger viscoelastic timescale makes the transport region more accessible, and increases the transport velocity therein. Also, we find that increasing the velocity of AF results in larger extracted power but smaller transport coefficient; the ratio of the transport velocity and that of the AF. Our model provides a framework for understanding the energetics of transport phenomena in biology, and designing efficient mechanisms of transport in synthetic active materials.</description>

      <title>Free energy and metastable states in the square-lattice $J_1$-$J_2$ Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.20385v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Free energy as a function of polarization is calculated for the square-lattice $J_1$-$J_2$ Ising model for $J_2 &lt; |J_1|/2$ using the random local field approximation (RLFA) and Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. Within RLFA, it reveals a metastable state with zero polarization in the ordered phase. In addition, the Landau free energy calculated within RLFA indicates a geometric slab-droplet phase transition at low temperature, which cannot be predicted by the mean field approximation. In turn, restricted free energy calculations for finite-size samples, exact and using MC simulations, reveal metastable states with a wide range of polarization values, but with only two domains. Taking into account the dependence of the restricted free energy on the nearest-neighbor correlations allows us to identify several more metastable states. The calculations also reveal additional slab-droplet transitions at $J_2 &gt; |J_1|/4$. These findings enrich our knowledge of the $J_1$-$J_2$ Ising model and the RLFA as a useful theoretical tool to study phase transitions in spin systems.</description>

      <title>Scalar susceptibility of a diluted classical XY model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07457v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the amplitude fluctuations in a diluted 3D classical XY model near the magnetic phase transition, motivated by the unusual localization properties of the amplitude (Higgs) mode recently found at the disordered superfluid-Mott glass quantum phase transition. We calculate the amplitude correlation function and the corresponding scalar susceptibility by means of Monte Carlo simulations. In contrast to the quantum case, in which the scalar susceptibility was found to violate naive scaling, we find that the scalar susceptibility of the classical system fulfills naive scaling (employing the clean critical exponents, as expected from the Harris criterion) as the temperature is varied across the phase transition for several dilutions. We discuss possible reasons for this discrepancy as well as the generality of our findings.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics and Kinetics of Silicate Glasses submitted to Binary Ion Exchange: Equilibrium Conditions and Interdiffusion Kinetics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10916v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ion exchange processes between an ion reservoir and a solid matrix are modeled under the assumption that near interface volumes reach equilibrium in a much faster time than the overall ion exchange process time while, in the bulk of the solid matrix, ions are transported by an interdiffusion kinetic process. Ion exchange equilibrium conditions are initially established according to classical thermodynamics. The result is defined in terms of the chemical potentials of exchanging ionic species. The proposed original derivation is performed making use of the thermodynamics of subsystems to determine near-surface equilibrium concentrations and ion exchange isotherms. Interaction energies of the exchanging ions in the glass are determined through the thermodynamic factor n, which is a parameter of the ion exchange isotherm. The kinetics of the ion exchange process in silicate glass is discussed to find connections with the near-surface equilibrium condition. The flux equation for the incoming ions in the glass is written in the form of a Fick equation with a concentration-dependent interdiffusion coefficient incorporating the thermodynamic factor n. It has been found that the thermodynamic factor of the interdiffusion coefficient is related to the interaction energy of the exchanging ions in the glass allowing a new approach to the interpretation of past experimental results. Surface concentration has been found substantially connected to the second parameter of the ion-exchange isotherm which is the equilibrium constant K and significatively influenced by the chemical composition of the ion reservoir (the molten salt bath). Further treatment of kinetics of ion-exchange within the framework of non-equilibrium thermodynamics allows the interpretation of the thermodynamic factor as a function of incoming ions concentration in the glass matrix.</description>

      <title>Three-state Opinion Dynamics for Financial Markets on Complex Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18709v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work investigates the effects of complex networks on the collective behavior of a three-state opinion formation model in economic systems. Our model considers two distinct types of investors in financial markets: noise traders and fundamentalists. Financial states evolve via probabilistic dynamics that include economic strategies with local and global influences. The local majoritarian opinion drives noise traders' market behavior, while the market index influences the financial decisions of fundamentalist agents. We introduce a level of market anxiety $q$ present in the decision-making process that influences financial action. In our investigation, nodes of a complex network represent market agents, whereas the links represent their financial interactions. We investigate the stochastic dynamics of the model on three distinct network topologies, including scale-free networks, small-world networks and Erd{\"o}s-R\'enyi random graphs. Our model mirrors various traits observed in real-world financial return series, such as heavy-tailed return distributions, volatility clustering, and short-term memory correlation of returns. The histograms of returns are fitted by coupled Gaussian distributions, quantitatively revealing transitions from a leptokurtic to a mesokurtic regime under specific economic heterogeneity. We show that the market dynamics depend mainly on the average agent connectivity, anxiety level, and market composition rather than on specific features of network topology.</description>
