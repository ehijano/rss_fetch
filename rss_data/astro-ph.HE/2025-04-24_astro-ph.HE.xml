      <title>Lensing of hot spots in Kerr spacetime: An empirical relation for black hole spin estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*) exhibits frequent flaring activity across the electromagnetic spectrum, often associated with a localized region of strong emission, known as a hot spot. We aim to establish an empirical relationship linking key parameters of this phenomenon -- emission radius, inclination, and black hole spin -- to the observed angle difference between the primary and secondary image ($\Delta PA$) that an interferometric array could resolve. Using the numerical radiative transfer code IPOLE, we generated a library of more than 900 models with varying system parameters and computed the position angle difference on the sky between the primary and secondary images of the hot spot. We find that the average $\Delta PA$ over a full period is insensitive to inclination. This result significantly simplifies potential spin measurements which might otherwise have large dependencies on inclination. Additionally, we derive a relation connecting spin to $\Delta PA$, given the period and emission radius of the hot spot, with an accuracy of less than $5^\circ$ in most cases. Finally, we present a mock observation to showcase the potential of this relation for spin inference. Our results provide a novel approach for black hole spin measurements using high-resolution observations, such as future movies of Sgr A* obtained with the Event Horizon Telescope, next-generation Event Horizon Telescope, and Black Hole Explorer.</description>

      <title>CHIME All-sky Multiday Pulsar Stacking Search (CHAMPSS): System Overview and First Discoveries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe the CHIME All-sky Multiday Pulsar Stacking Search (CHAMPSS) project. This novel radio pulsar survey revisits the full Northern Sky daily, offering unprecedented opportunity to detect highly intermittent pulsars, as well as faint sources via long-term data stacking. CHAMPSS uses the CHIME/FRB datastream, which consists of 1024 stationary beams streaming intensity data at $0.983$\,ms resolution, 16384 frequency channels across 400--800\,MHz, continuously being searched for single, dispersed bursts/pulses. In CHAMPSS, data from adjacent east-west beams are combined to form a grid of tracking beams, allowing longer exposures at fixed positions. These tracking beams are dedispersed to many trial dispersion measures (DM) to a maximum DM beyond the Milky Way's expected contribution, and Fourier transformed in time to form power spectra. Repeated observations are searched daily to find intermittent sources, and power spectra of the same sky positions are incoherently stacked, increasing sensitivity to faint persistent sources. The $0.983$\,ms time resolution limits our sensitivity to millisecond pulsars; we have full sensitivity to pulsars with $P &gt; 60\,$ms, with sensitivity gradually decreasing from $60$ ms to $2$\,ms as higher harmonics are beyond the Nyquist limit. In a commissioning survey, data covering $\sim 1/16$ of the CHIME sky was processed and searched in quasi-realtime over two months, leading to the discovery of eleven new pulsars, each with $S_{600} &gt; 0.1$\,mJy. When operating at scale, CHAMPSS will stack $&gt;$1\,year of data along each sightline, reaching a sensitivity of $\lesssim 30\, \mu$Jy for all sightlines above a declination of $10^{\circ}$, and off of the Galactic plane.</description>

      <title>Modeling of lightcurves from reconnection-powered very high energy flares from M87*</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The black hole at the center of M87 is observed to flare regularly in the very high energy (VHE) band, with photon energies $\gtrsim 100$ GeV. The rapid variability, which can be as short as $2$ days in the VHE lightcurve constrains some of the flares to originate close to the black hole. Magnetic reconnection is a promising candidate for explaining the flares, where the VHE emission comes from background soft photons that Inverse Compton (IC) scatter off of high energy electron-positron pairs in the reconnecting current sheet. In this work, we ray trace photons from a current sheet near the black hole event horizon during a flux eruption in a magnetically arrested state in a general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics simulation. We incorporate beaming of the Compton up-scattered photons, based on results from radiative kinetic simulations of relativistic reconnection. We then construct VHE lightcurves that account for the dynamics of the current sheet and lensing from general-relativistic effects. We find that most of the flux originates in the inner $5$ gravitational radii, and beaming is essential to explain the observed flux from the strongest VHE flares. The ray traced lightcurves show features resulting from the changing volume of the reconnecting current sheet on timescales that can be consistent with observations. Furthermore, we find that the amount of beaming depends strongly on two effects: the current sheet inclination with respect to the observer and the anisotropy in the direction of motion of the accelerated particles.</description>

      <title>Rotating neutron stars: anisotropy model comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We build slowly rotating anisotropic neutron stars using the Hartle-Thorne formalism, employing three distinct anisotropy models--Horvat, Bowers-Liang, and a covariant model--to characterize the relationship between radial and tangential pressure. We analyze how anisotropy influences stellar properties such as the mass-radius relation, angular momentum, moment of inertia, and binding energy. Our findings reveal that the maximum stable mass of non-rotating stars depends strongly on the anisotropy model, with some configurations supporting up to 60% more mass than their isotropic counterparts with the same central density. This mass increase is most pronounced in the models where the anisotropy grows toward the star's surface, as seen in the covariant model. Furthermore, slowly rotating anisotropic stars adhere to universal relations for the moment of inertia and binding energy, regardless of the chosen anisotropy model or equation of state.</description>

      <title>Evolution of QPO during Rising Phase of Discovery Outburst of Swift J1727.8-1613: Estimation of Mass from Spectro-Temporal Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rising phase of the 2023-24 outburst of the recently discovered bright transient black hole candidate Swift J1727.8-1613 was monitored by \textit{Insight}-HXMT. We study the evolution of hard ($4$-$150$ keV) and soft ($2$-$4$ keV) band photon count rates, the hardness ratio (HR), and QPO frequencies using daily observations from the HXMT/LE, ME, and HE instruments between August 25 and October 5, 2023. The QPO frequency is found to be strongly correlated with the soft-band X-ray count rates, and spectral photon indices. In contrast, a strong anti-correlation is observed between HR and QPO frequency, as well as between HR and photon index. Based on the evolution of the QPO frequency, the rising phase of the outburst is subdivided into six parts, with parts 1-5 fitted using the propagating oscillatory shock (POS) solution to understand the nature of the evolution from a physical perspective. The best-fitted POS model is obtained with a black hole mass of $13.34\pm0.02~M_\odot$. An inward-propagating shock with weakening strength (except in part 4) is observed during the period of our study. The POS model-fitted mass of the source is further confirmed using the QPO frequency ($\nu$)-photon index ($\Gamma$) scaling method. From this method, the estimated probable mass of Swift J1727.8-1613 is obtained to be $13.54\pm1.87~M_\odot$.</description>

      <title>Accretion Flow Properties of MAXI J1834-021 During Its Double-Outbursts In 2023</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Galactic transient black hole candidate MAXI J1834-021 exhibited `faint' outbursting activity for approximately $10$ months following its discovery on February 5, 2023. We study the evolution of both the temporal (hard and soft band photon count rates, hardness ratios, and QPO frequencies) and spectral properties of the source using NICER data between March 7 and October 4, 2023. The outburst profile and the nature of QPOs suggest that the source underwent a mini-outburst following the primary outburst. A monotonic evolution of low-frequency QPOs from higher to lower frequencies is observed during the primary outbursting phase. Both phenomenological (diskbb plus powerlaw) and physical (Two Component Advective Flow) model fitted spectral studies suggest that during the entire epoch, the source remained in harder spectral states, with a clear dominance of nonthermal emissions from the `hot' Compton cloud. The 2023 outbursting activity of MAXI J1834$-$021 can be classified as a combination of double `failed' outbursts, as no softer spectral states were observed.</description>

      <title>Detection of X-ray Polarization in the Hard State of IGR J17091-3624: Spectro-Polarimetric Study with IXPE and NuSTAR Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The class-transition Galactic X-ray binary IGR J17091--3624 was simultaneously monitored by the IXPE and NuSTAR satellites. We present a detailed spectro-polarimetric study of the source using data from both satellites covering the period from March 7-10, 2025. A polarimetric analysis in the $2$-$8$~keV band using a model-independent method reveals a significant detection of polarization degree (PD) of $(11.3\pm2.35)\%$ at a polarization angle (PA) of $82^\circ.7\pm5^\circ.96$ (significant at $&gt;4\sigma$). The model-dependent polarization analysis using the polconst and polpow models yields consistent values of PD and PA. In both methods, an energy-dependent increasing trend of PD is observed. In the $6$-$8$~keV band, a maximum PD of $(29.9\pm8.46)\%$ is detected at a PA of $88^\circ.0\pm8^\circ.15$ (significant at $&gt;3\sigma$) . The joint spectral analysis using IXPE and NuSTAR data in the $2$-$70$~keV band was performed with four different sets of phenomenological and physical models. Our results indicate a strong dominance of non-thermal photons originating from a `hot' Compton cloud, suggesting that the source was in a hard spectral state. Spectral fitting with the physical kerrbb and TCAF models provides an estimate of the black hole mass $M_{\rm BH} = 14.8^{+4.7}_{-3.4}~M_\odot$ and dimensionless spin parameter $a^* \sim 0.54$.</description>

      <title>Scattering of stellar-mass black holes and gravitational wave bremsstrahlung radiation in AGN disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamics of stellar mass black holes (sBHs) embedded in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) could produce highly eccentric orbits near the central supermassive black hole, leading to repeated close encounters that emit gravitational waves in the LIGO frequency band. Many works have focused on the mergers of sBH in the disk that produce gravitational waves; however, sBHs in hyperbolic orbits also emit gravitational-wave \bremss{} that can be detected by ground-based interferometers like LIGO. In this work, we analyze the scattering of sBHs in an AGN disk as they migrate inside the disk, focusing on gravitational-wave \bremss{} emission. We determine how the gravitational-wave emission depends on the different parameters of the scattering experiments, such as the mass of the supermassive black hole and the sBH migration rate and mass ratio. We find that scattering with detectable gravitational-wave \bremss{} is more frequent around lower mass SMBHs ($\sim 10^{5-6}$M$_\odot$). We then conduct a suite of Monte Carlo simulations and estimated the rate for ground-based gravitational-wave detections to be in the range of 0.08 - 1194 $\text{Gpc}^{-3} \text{ yr}^{-1}$, depending on migration forces and detection thresholds, with large uncertainties accounting for variations in possible AGN environments. The expected rate for our {\tt Fiducial} parameters is 3.2 $\text{Gpc}^{-3} \text{ yr}^{-1}$. Finally, we provide first-principle gravitational wave templates produced by the encounters.</description>

      <title>FAST Observation and Results for Core Collapse Globular Cluster M15 and NGC 6517</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio astronomy is part of radio science that developed rapidly in recent decades. In the research of radio astronomy, pulsars have always been an enduring popular research target. To find and observe more pulsars, large radio telescopes have been built all over the world. In this paper, we present our studies on pulsars in M15 and NGC 6517 with FAST, including monitoring pulsars in M15 and new pulsar discoveries in NGC 6517. All the previously known pulsars in M15 were detected without no new discoveries. Among them, M15C was still detectable by FAST, while it is assumed to fade out due to precession [1]. In NGC 6517, new pulsars were continues to be discovered and all of them are tend to be isolated pulsars. Currently, the number of pulsars in NGC 6517 is 17, much more than the predicted before [2].</description>

      <title>Cyclic Zoom: Multi-scale GRMHD Modeling of Black Hole Accretion and Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a ``cyclic zoom'' method to capture the dynamics of accretion flows onto black holes across a vast range of spatial and temporal scales in general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations. In this method, we cyclically zoom out (derefine) and zoom in (refine) the simulation domain while using a central mask region containing a careful treatment of the coarsened fluid variables to preserve the small-scale physics, particularly the magnetic field dynamics. The method can accelerate GRMHD simulations by $\gtrsim 10^5$ times for problems with large scale separation. We demonstrate the validity of the technique using a series of tests, including spherically symmetric Bondi accretion, the Blandford-Znajek monopole, magnetized turbulent Bondi accretion, accretion of a magnetized rotating torus, and the long-term evolution of an accreting torus about both Schwarzschild and Kerr black holes. As applications, we simulate Bondi and rotating torus accretion onto black holes from galactic scales, covering an extremely large dynamic range. In Bondi accretion, the accretion rate is suppressed relative to the Bondi rate by $\sim(10r_\mathrm{g}/r_\mathrm{B})^{1/2}$ with a feedback power of $\sim 0.01 \dot{M} c^2$ for vanishing spin, and $\sim 0.1 \dot{M} c^2$ for spin $a\approx0.9$. In the long-term evolution of a rotating torus, the accretion rate decreases with time as $\dot{M}\propto t^{-2}$ on timescales much longer than the viscous timescale, demonstrating that our method can capture not only quasi-steady problems but also secular evolution. Our new method likewise holds significant promise for applications to many other problems that need to cover vast spatial and temporal scales.</description>

      <title>The FAST Discovery of a Millisecond Pulsar Hidden in the Harmonics of PSR J2129+1210A (M15A)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of an isolated millisecond pulsar M15O (J2129+1210O) from the globular cluster M15 (NGC 7078) with a period of $\sim$11.06686 ms and a dispersion measure of $\sim$67.44 cm$^{-3}$ pc. Its spin period is so close to the $10^{\text{th}}$ harmonic of the bright pulsar M15A ($\sim$11.06647 ms) and thus missed in previous pulsar search. We suggest adding the spectrum in the pulsar candidate diagnostic plot to identify new signals near the harmonics. M15O has the first spin frequency derivative and the second spin frequency derivative,being 1.79191(5) $\times$ $10^{-14}$ Hz $s^{-2}$ and 3.3133(6)$\times$ $10^{-23}$ Hz $s^{-3}$, respectively. Its projected distance from the optical centre of M15 is the closest among all the pulsars in M15. The origin can be something from the center of the massive and core-collapsed globular cluster M15.</description>

      <title>A LOFAR-style reconstruction of cosmic-ray air showers with SKA-Low</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic-ray air shower detection with the low-frequency part of the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) radio telescope is envisioned to yield very high precision measurements of the particle composition of cosmic rays between $10^{16}$ and $10^{18}$ eV. This is made possible by the extreme antenna density of the core of SKA-Low, surpassing the current most dense radio air shower observatory LOFAR by over an order of magnitude. In order to make these measurements, the technical implementation of this observation mode and the development of reconstruction methods have to happen hand-in-hand. As a first lower limit of what is obtainable, we apply the current most precise reconstruction methods as used at LOFAR to a first complete simulation of air shower signals for the SKA-Low array. We describe this simulation setup and discuss the obtainable accuracy and resolution. A special focus is put on effects of the dynamic range of the system, beamforming methods to lower the energy threshold, as well as the limits to the mass composition accuracy given by statistical and systematic uncertainties.</description>

Abstract: Using 15 years of data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT), we performed a comprehensive analysis on the gamma-ray binary HESS J0632+057. Its spectrum in 0.1-300 GeV band is well described by a power law model with an index of $2.40\pm0.16$, leading to an energy flux of (5.5$\pm$1.6$)\times$ 10$^{-12}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. The GeV Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) of HESS J0632+057 hints for a spectral turn-over between $\sim$10-100 GeV. Orbital analysis reveals a flux enhancement during the phase range of 0.2-0.4, consistent with the X-ray and TeV light curves, indicating an origin of a common particle population. We carried out six deep radio observations on HESS J0632+057 with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST), evenly distributed across its orbit, reaching a detection sensitivity of 2$\mu$Jy. However, no radio pulsation was detected within these observations. The absence of radio pulsation may be attributed to the dense stellar wind environment of HESS J0632+057.</description>

      <title>Dynamical tides in neutron stars with first-order phase transitions: the role of the discontinuity mode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During the late stages of a binary neutron star inspiral, dynamical tides induced in each star by its companion become significant and should be included in complete gravitational-wave (GW) modeling. We investigate the coupling between the tidal field and quasi-normal modes in hybrid stars and show that the discontinuity mode ($g$-mode)--intrinsically associated with first-order phase transitions and buoyancy--can rival the contribution of the fundamental $f$-mode. We find that the $g$-mode overlap integral can reach up to $\sim 10\%$ of the $f$-mode value for hybrid star masses in the range 1.4-2.0$M_{\odot}$, with the largest values generally associated with larger density jumps. This leads to a GW phase shift due to the $g$-mode of $\Delta \phi_g \lesssim 0.1$-$1$ rad (i.e., up to $\sim$5\%-10\% of $\Delta \phi_f$), with the largest shifts occurring for masses near the phase transition. At higher masses, the shifts remain smaller and nearly constant, with $\Delta \phi_g \lesssim 0.1$ rad (roughly $\sim 1\%$ of $\Delta \phi_f$). These GW shifts may be relevant even at the design sensitivity of current second-generation GW detectors in the most optimistic cases. Moreover, if a $g$-mode is present and lies near the $f$-mode frequency, neglecting it in the GW modeling can lead to systematic biases in neutron star parameter estimation, resulting in radius errors of up to $1\%-2\%$. These results show the importance of dynamical tides to probe neutron stars' equation of state, and to test the existence of dense-matter phase transitions.</description>

      <title>The Glow of Axion Quark Nugget Dark Matter: (III) The Mysteries of the Milky Way UV Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Axion quark nuggets (AQNs) are hypothetical objects with nuclear density that would have formed during the quark-hadron transition and could make up most of the dark matter today. These objects have a mass greater than a few grams and are sub-micrometer in size. They would also help explain the matter-antimatter asymmetry and the similarity between visible and dark components of the universe, i.e. $\Omega_{\text{DM}} \sim \Omega_{\text{visible}}$. These composite objects behave as cold dark matter, interacting with ordinary matter and producing pervasive electromagnetic radiation. This work aims to calculate the FUV electromagnetic signature in a 1 kpc region surrounding the solar system, resulting from the interaction between antimatter AQNs and baryons. To this end, we use the high-resolution hydrodynamic simulation of the Milky Way, FIRE-2 Latter suite, to select solar system-like regions. From the simulated gas and dark matter distributions in these regions, we calculate the FUV background radiation generated by the AQN model. We find that the results are consistent with the FUV excess recently confirmed by the Alice spectrograph aboard New Horizons, which corroborated the FUV excess initially discovered by GALEX a decade ago. We also discuss the potential cosmological implications of our work, which suggest the existence of a new source of FUV radiation in galaxies, linked to the interaction between dark matter and baryons.</description>

      <title>Extreme mass ratio inspirals around topological stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a point scalar charge in circular orbit around a topological star, a regular, horizonless soliton emerging from dimensional compactification of Einstein-Maxwell theory in five dimensions, which could describe qualitative properties of microstate geometries for astrophysical black holes. This is the first step towards studying extreme mass-ratio inspirals around these objects. We show that when the particle probes the spacetime close to the object, the scalar-wave flux deviates significantly from the corresponding black hole case. Furthermore, as the topological star approaches the black-hole limit, the inspiral can resonantly excite its long-lived modes, resulting in sharp features in the emitted flux. Although such resonances are too narrow to produce detectable dephasing, we estimate that a year-long inspiral down to the innermost stable circular orbit could accumulate a significant dephasing for most configurations relative to the black hole case. While a full parameter-estimation analysis is needed, the generically large deviations are likely to be within the sensitivity reach of future space-based gravitational-wave detectors.</description>

      <title>MeerKAT L-band observations of the Ophiuchus galaxy cluster. Detection of synchrotron threads and jellyfish galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observations with modern radio interferometers are uncovering the intricate morphology of synchrotron sources in galaxy clusters, both those arising from the intracluster medium (ICM) and those associated with member galaxies. Moreover, in addition to the well-known radio tails from active galactic nuclei, radio continuum tails from jellyfish galaxies are being efficiently detected in nearby clusters and groups. Our goal is to investigate the radio emission from the Ophiuchus cluster, a massive, sloshing cluster in the local Universe ($z=0.0296$) that hosts a diffuse mini halo at its center. To achieve this, we analyzed a 7.25 h MeerKAT L-band observation, producing sensitive images at 1.28 GHz with multiple resolutions. A catalog of spectroscopically confirmed cluster galaxies was used to identify and study the member galaxies detected in radio. We discover thin threads of synchrotron emission embedded in the mini halo, two of which may be connected to the brightest cluster galaxy. We also report the first identification of jellyfish galaxies in Ophiuchus, detecting six galaxies with radio continuum tails, one of which extending for $\sim$64 kpc at 1.28 GHz, making it one of the longest detected at such a high frequency. Finally, we propose an alternative scenario to explain the origin of a bright amorphous radio source, previously classified as a radio phoenix, aided by the comparison with recent simulations of radio jets undergoing kink instability. In Ophiuchus thin threads have been observed within the diffuse emission; a similar result was obtained in Perseus, another nearby cluster hosting a mini halo, suggesting that these structures may be a common feature in this kind of sources. Moreover, radio continuum observations have proven effective in detecting the first jellyfish galaxies in both systems.</description>

      <title>A JVLA, GMRT, and XMM study of Abell 795: Large-scale sloshing and a candidate radio phoenix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a multiwavelength analysis of the galaxy cluster Abell 795 (z=0.1374), known for its extended (200 kpc) radio emission with a steep spectral index of unclear origin surrounding the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG), and for sloshing features observed by Chandra. We used new JVLA 1.5 GHz, archival GMRT 325 MHz, and XMM-Newton data to investigate the nature of the radio emission and the dynamical state of the intracluster medium. Our X-ray surface brightness analysis revealed an azimuthally asymmetric excess extending to 650 kpc from the center, possibly related to the sloshing spiral, although the existing data did not allow us to confirm the presence of a cold front. We also detected a previously unknown galaxy group located 1 Mpc northwest of the cluster. Its X-ray emission was well fitted by a $\beta$-model ($\beta$=0.52$\pm$0.17), and the spectral analysis revealed a thermal plasma temperature kT=1.08$\pm$0.08 keV and metallicity Z=0.13$\pm$0.06 Z$_{\odot}$. We investigated the possibility that this group acted as the perturber that triggered the sloshing in Abell 795, and we showed that the velocity distribution of member galaxies supports the dynamically unrelaxed nature of Abell 795. The analysis of JVLA 1.5 GHz and GMRT 325 MHz images confirmed the presence of extended radio emission with largest linear size 200 kpc, preferentially extended toward southwest and terminating in a sub-component ("SW blob"). We measured the spectral indices, finding $\alpha_{Ext}$=-2.24$\pm$0.13 for the diffuse extended emission, and $\alpha_{SWb}$=-2.10$\pm$0.13 for the SW blob. These ultra-steep spectral index values, coupled with the complex morphology and cospatiality with the radio-loud AGN present in the BCG, suggest that this emission could be classified as a radio phoenix, possibly arising from adiabatic compression of an ancient AGN radio lobe due to the presence of sloshing motions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the key scientific objectives for the next decade is to uncover the nature of dark matter (DM). We should continue prioritizing targets such as weakly-interacting massive particles (WIMPs), Axions, and other low-mass dark matter candidates to improve our chances of achieving it. A varied and ongoing portfolio of experiments spanning different scales and detection methods is essential to maximize our chances of discovering its composition. This report paper provides an updated overview of the Brazilian community's activities in dark matter and dark sector physics over the past years with a view for the future. It underscores the ongoing need for financial support for Brazilian groups actively engaged in experimental research to sustain the Brazilian involvement in the global search for dark matter particles</description>

      <title>Binarity at LOw Metallicity (BLOeM): Bayesian inference of natal kicks from inert black hole binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. The emerging population of inert black hole binaries (BHBs) provides a unique opportunity to constrain black hole (BH) formation physics. These systems are composed of a stellar-mass BH in a wide orbit around a non-degenerate star with no observed Xray emission. Inert BHBs allow for narrow constraints to be inferred on the natal kick and mass loss during BH-forming core-collapse events. Aims. In anticipation of the upcoming BLOeM survey, we aim to provide tight constraints on BH natal kicks by exploiting the full parameter space obtained from combined spectroscopic and astrometric data to characterize the orbits of inert BHBs. Multi-epoch spectroscopy from the BLOeM project will provide measurements of periods, eccentricities, and radial velocities for inert BHBs in the SMC, which complements Gaia astrometric observations of proper motions. Methods. We present a Bayesian parameter estimation framework to infer natal kicks and mass loss during core-collapse from inert BHBs, accounting for all available observables, including the systemic velocity and its orientation relative to the orbital plane. The framework further allows for circumstances when some of the observables are unavailable, such as for the distant BLOeM sources which preclude resolved orbits. Results. With our new framework, we are able to distinguish between BH formation channels, even in the absence of a resolved orbit. In cases when the pre-explosion orbit can be assumed to be circular, we precisely recover the parameters of the core-collapse, highlighting the importance of understanding the eccentricity landscape of pre-explosion binaries, both theoretically and observationally. Treating the near-circular, inert BHB, VFTS 243, as a representative of the anticipated BLOeM systems, we constrain the natal kick to less than 27 km/s and the mass loss to less than 2.9 Msun within a 90% credible interval.</description>

Abstract: Fast X-ray transients (FXTs) are a rare and poorly understood population of events. Previously difficult to detect in real time, the launch of the Einstein Probe with its wide field X-ray telescope has led to a rapid expansion in the sample and allowed the exploration of these transients across the electromagnetic spectrum. EP250108a is a recently detected example linked to an optical counterpart, SN 2025kg, or 'the kangaroo'. Together with a companion paper (Rastinejad et al. 2025), we present our observing campaign and analysis of this event. In this letter, we focus on the early evolution of the optical counterpart over the first six days, including our measurement of the redshift of $z=0.17641$. We find that the source is well-modelled by a rapidly expanding cooling blackbody. We show the observed X-ray and radio properties are consistent with a collapsar-powered jet that is low energy ($\lesssim10^{51}$ erg) and/or fails to break out of the dense material surrounding it. The optical emission therefore likely arises from a shocked cocoon resulting from the trapped jet; however, we also examine the possibility that it emerges from the shock produced as the supernova ejecta expand into a dense shell of circumstellar material. We compare to other supernovae and fast transients showing similar features, finding significant similarities with SN 2006aj and SN 2020bvc. This suggests trapped jets could be more common than previously thought and SN 2025kg may herald a larger sample of similar transients.</description>

      <title>The Gravitational Wave Bias Parameter from Angular Power Spectra: Bridging Between Galaxies and Binary Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11965v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study presents the modeling of the gravitational wave (GW) bias parameter by bridging a connection between simulated GW sources and galaxies in low redshift galaxy surveys 2MPZ and WISExSCOS (WISC). We study this connection by creating a mock GW catalog, populating galaxy surveys with binary black holes (BBHs) for different scenarios of the GW host-galaxy probability as a function of the galaxy stellar mass. We probe the observable consequences of this connection by exploring the spatial clustering of the GW sources in terms of the GW bias parameter. We consider a phenomenological broken power law model for the host-galaxy probability function, with a potential turnover $M_{K}$ at high stellar mass ($10^{11}$ $M_{\odot}$ in the fiducial model) where the star formation efficiency begins to drop. We vary the parameters of the GW host-galaxy probability function and find that generically the GW bias increases as $M_{K}$ increases (and gets suppressed as $M_{K}$ decreases). The change in the GW bias parameter shows a maximum change of about $30\%$ for different scenarios explored in this work in comparison to the galaxy bias. Future measurements of the GW bias can help constrain $M_{K}$ and the slopes of the host-galaxy probability function and thus offer insights into the underlying astrophysical processes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12954v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyse the stability issue of the vector and axial modes of the torsion and nonmetricity tensors around general backgrounds in the framework of cubic Metric-Affine Gravity. We show that the presence of cubic order invariants defined from the curvature, torsion and nonmetricity tensors allow the cancellation of the well-known instabilities arising in the vector and axial sectors of quadratic Metric-Affine Gravity. For the resulting theory, we also obtain Reissner-Nordstr\"om-like black hole solutions with dynamical torsion and nonmetricity, which in general include massive tensor modes for these quantities, thus avoiding further no-go theorems that potentially prevent a consistent interaction of massless higher spin fields in the quantum regime.</description>

Abstract: The recently developed nuclear effective interaction based on the so-called N3LO Skyrme pseudopotential is extended to include the hyperon-nucleon and hyperon-hyperon interactions by assuming the similar density, momentum, and isospin dependence as for the nucleon-nucleon interaction. The parameters in these interactions are determined from either experimental information if any or chiral effective field theory or lattice QCD calculations of the hyperon potentials in nuclear matter around nuclear saturation density $\rho_0$. We find that varying the high density behavior of the symmetry energy $E_{\rm sym}(\rho)$ can significantly change the critical density for hyperon appearance in the neutron stars and thus the maximum mass $M_{\rm TOV}$ of static hyperon stars. In particular, a symmetry energy which is soft around $2-3\rho_0$ but stiff above about $4\rho_0$, can lead to $M_{\rm TOV} \gtrsim 2M_\odot$ for hyperon stars and simultaneously be compatible with (1) the constraints on the equation of state of symmetric nuclear matter at suprasaturation densities obtained from flow data in heavy-ion collisions; (2) the microscopic calculations of the equation of state for pure neutron matter; (3) the star tidal deformability extracted from gravitational wave signal GW170817; (4) the mass-radius relations of PSR J0030+0451, PSR J0740+6620 and PSR J0437-4715 measured from NICER; (5) the observation of the unusually low mass and small radius in the central compact object of HESS J1731-347. Furthermore, the sound speed squared of the hyperon star matter naturally displays a strong peak structure around baryon density of $3-4\rho_0$, consistent with the model-independent analysis on the multimessenger data. Our results suggest that the high density symmetry energy could be a key to the solution of the hyperon puzzle in neutron star physics.</description>

      <title>Theory of neutrino slow flavor evolution. Part I. Homogeneous medium</title>

Abstract: Dense neutrino gases can exhibit collective flavor instabilities, triggering large flavor conversions that are driven primarily by neutrino-neutrino refraction. One broadly distinguishes between fast instabilities that exist in the limit of vanishing neutrino masses, and slow ones, that require neutrino mass splittings. In a related series of papers, we have shown that fast instabilities result from the resonant growth of flavor waves, in the same way as turbulent electric fields in an unstable plasma. Here we extend this framework to slow instabilities, focusing on the simplest case of an infinitely homogeneous medium with axisymmetric neutrino distribution. The relevant length and time scales are defined by three parameters: the vacuum oscillation frequency $\omega_E=\delta m^2/2E$, the scale of neutrino-neutrino refraction energy $\mu=\sqrt{2}G_F(n_\nu+n_{\overline\nu})$, and the ratio between lepton and particle number $\epsilon=(n_\nu-n_{\overline\nu})/(n_\nu+n_{\overline\nu})$. We distinguish between two very different regimes: (i) For $\omega_E\ll \mu \epsilon^2$, instabilities occur at small spatial scales of order $(\mu\epsilon)^{-1}$ with a time scale of order $\epsilon \omega_E^{-1}$. This novel branch of slow instability arises from resonant interactions with neutrinos moving along the axis of symmetry. (ii) For $\mu \epsilon^2\ll \omega_E\ll \mu$, the instability is strongly non-resonant, with typical time and length scales of order $1/\sqrt{\omega_E \mu}$. Unstable modes interact with all neutrino directions at once, recovering the characteristic scaling of the traditional studies of slow instabilities. In the inner regions of supernovae and neutron-star mergers, the first regime may be more likely to appear, meaning that slow instabilities in this region may have an entirely different character than usually envisaged.</description>

      <title>Geometry of a generalized uncertainty-inspired spacetime</title>

Abstract: We examine the geometry of a generalized uncertainty-inspired quantum black hole. The diagonal line element is not $t$-$r$ symmetric, i.e. $g_{00} \ne -1/g_{11}$, which leads to an interesting approach to resolving the classical curvature singularity. In this paper, we show, in Schwarzschild coordinates, the $r = 0$ coordinate location is a null surface which is not a transition surface or leads to a black bounce. We find the expansion of null geodesic congruences in the interior turn around then vanishes at $r = 0$, and the energy conditions are predominately violated indicating a repulsive gravitational core. In addition, we show that the line element admits a wormhole solution which is not traversable, and the black hole at its vanishing horizon radius could be interpreted as a remnant.</description>

      <title>Fast Flavor Pendulum: Instability Condition</title>

Abstract: Even in the absence of neutrino masses, a neutrino gas can exhibit a homogeneous flavor instability that leads to a periodic motion known as the fast flavor pendulum. A well-known necessary condition is a crossing of the angular flavor lepton distribution. In an earlier work, some of us showed that homogeneous flavor instabilities also obey a Nyquist criterion, inspired by plasma physics. This condition, while more restrictive than the angular crossing, is only sufficient if the unstable branch of the dispersion relation is bounded by critical points that both lie under the light cone (points with subluminal phase velocity). While the lepton-number angle distribution, assumed to be axially symmetric, easily allows one to determine the real-valued branch of the dispersion relation and to recognize if instead superluminal critical points exist, this graphical method does not translate into a simple instability condition. We discuss the homogeneous mode in the more general context of the dispersion relation for modes with arbitrary wave number and stress that it plays no special role on this continuum, except for its regular but fragile long-term behavior, owed to its many symmetries.</description>

      <title>Little Red Dots are Tidal Disruption Events in Runaway-Collapsing Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03309v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I hypothesize a physical explanation for the "Little Red Dots" (LRDs) discovered by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). The first star formation in the universe occurs in dense clusters, some of which may undergo runaway collapse and form an intermediate mass black hole. This process would appear as a very dense stellar system, with recurring tidal disruption events (TDEs) as stellar material is accreted by the black hole. Such a system would be compact, UV-emitting, and exhibit broad H-alpha emission. If runaway collapse is the primary mechanism for forming massive black hole seeds, this process could be fairly common and explain the large volume densities of LRDs. In order to match the predicted number density of runaway collapse clusters, the tidal disruption rate must be on the order of 10^-4 per year. A top-heavy stellar initial mass function may be required to match observations without exceeding the predicted LambdaCDM mass function. The TDE LRD hypothesis can be verified with followup JWST observations looking for TDE-like variability.</description>

      <title>Questioning Cosmic Acceleration with DESI: The Big Stall of the Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15635v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the most important discoveries in modern cosmology is cosmic acceleration. However, we find that today's universe could decelerate in the statistically preferred Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) scenario over the $\Lambda$CDM model by cosmic microwave background, type Ia supernova and DESI's new measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations. Using various datasets, at a beyond $5\,\sigma$ confidence level, we demonstrate that the universe experiences a triple deceleration during its evolution and finally reaches the state of the ``Big Stall", which predicts that: (i) the universe suddenly comes to a halt in the distant future; (ii) its eventual destiny is dominated by dark matter rather than dark energy ; (iii) it ultimately retains an extremely small fraction of dark energy but exerts an extremely large pressure. Our findings profoundly challenge the established understanding of cosmic acceleration and enrich our comprehension of cosmic evolution.</description>
