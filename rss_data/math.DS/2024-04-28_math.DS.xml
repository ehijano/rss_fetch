      <title>Thermodynamic formalism and hyperbolic Baker domains: Real-analyticity of the Hausdorff dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the family of entire maps given by $f_{\ell,c}(z)=\ell+c-(\ell-1)\log c-e^z$, where $c\in D(\ell,1)$ and $\ell\in\mathbb N$, $\ell\geq2$. By using the property of $f_{\ell,c}$ to be dynamically projected to an infinite cylinder $\mathbb C/2\pi I\mathbb Z$, where the thermodynamic formalism tools are well-defined, we prove as a main result on this work, the real-analyticity of the map $c\mapsto HD(\mathcal{J}_r(f_{\ell,c}))$, here $\mathcal{J}_r(f_{\ell,c})$ is the radial Julia set.</description>

      <title>Fractional Order Sunflower Equation: Stability, Bifurcation and Chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sunflower equation describes the motion of the tip of a plant due to the auxin transportation under the influence of gravity. This work proposes the fractional-order generalization to this delay differential equation. The equation contains two fractional orders and infinitely many equilibrium points. The coefficients in the linearized equation near the equilibrium points are delay-dependent. We provide a detailed stability analysis of each equilibrium point. We observed the following bifurcation phenomena: stable for all the delay values, a single stable region in the delayed interval, and a stability switch. We also observed a multi-scroll chaotic attractor for some values of the parameters.</description>

      <title>Phase and amplitude responses for delay equations using harmonic balance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robust delay induced oscillations, common in nature, are often modeled by delay-differential equations (DDEs). Motivated by the success of phase-amplitude reductions for ordinary differential equations with limit cycle oscillations, there is now a growing interest in the development of analogous approaches for DDEs to understand their response to external forcing. When combined with Floquet theory, the fundamental quantities for this reduction are phase and amplitude response functions. Here, we develop a framework for their construction that utilises the method of harmonic balance.</description>

      <title>Multifractal analysis of the power-2-decaying Gauss-like expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Each real number $x\in[0,1]$ admits a unique power-2-decaying Gauss-like expansion (P2GLE for short) as $x=\sum_{i\in\mathbb{N}} 2^{-(d_1(x)+d_2(x)+\cdots+d_i(x))}$, where $d_i(x)\in\mathbb{N}$. For any $x\in(0,1]$, the Khintchine exponent $\gamma(x)$ is defined by $\gamma(x):=\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{1}{n}\sum_{j=1}^nd_j(x)$ if the limit exists. We investigate the sizes of the level sets $E(\xi):=\{x\in(0,1]:\gamma(x)=\xi\}$ for $\xi\geq 1$. Utilizing the Ruelle operator theory, we obtain the Khintchine spectrum $\xi\mapsto\dim_H E(\xi)$, where $\dim_H$ denotes the Hausdorff dimension. We establish the remarkable fact that the Khintchine spectrum has exactly one inflection point, which was never proved for the corresponding spectrum in continued fractions. As a direct consequence, we also obtain the Lyapunov spectrum. Furthermore, we find the Hausdorff dimensions of the level sets $\{x\in(0,1]:\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{1}{n}\sum_{j=1}^{n}\log(d_j(x))=\xi\}$ and $\{x\in(0,1]:\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{1}{n}\sum_{j=1}^{n}2^{d_j(x)}=\xi\}$.</description>

      <title>On the integrability of generalized $N$-center problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the rational integrability of the $N$-center problem with rational weak and moderate forces. We show that the problem is not rationally integrable for all but a finite number of values $\alpha\in]0,2[$, where $\alpha$ is the order of the singularities. We identify the remaining cases and give the necessary conditions for integrability.</description>

      <title>Universal resonancelike emergence of chaos in complex networks of damped-driven nonlinear systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Characterizing the emergence of chaotic dynamics of complex networks is an essential task in nonlinear science with potential important applications in many fields such as neural control engineering, microgrid technologies, and ecological networks. Here, we solve a critical outstanding problem in this multidisciplinary research field: The emergence and persistence of spatio-temporal chaos in complex networks of damped-driven nonlinear oscillators in the significant weak-coupling regime, while they exhibit regular behavior when uncoupled. By developing a comprehensive theory with the aid of standard analytical methods, a hierarchy of lower-dimensional effective models, and extensive numerical simulations, we uncover and characterize the basic physical mechanisms concerning both heterogeneity-induced and impulse-induced emergence, enhancement, and suppression of chaos in starlike and scale-free networks of periodically driven, dissipative nonlinear oscillators.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary game dynamics with environmental feedback in a network with two communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent developments of eco-evolutionary models have shown that evolving feedbacks between behavioral strategies and the environment of game interactions, leading to changes in the underlying payoff matrix, can impact the underlying population dynamics in various manners. We propose and analyze an eco-evolutionary game dynamics model on a network with two communities such that players interact with other players in the same community and those in the opposite community at different rates. In our model, we consider two-person matrix games with pairwise interactions occurring on individual edges and assume that the environmental state depends on edges rather than on nodes or being globally shared in the population. We analytically determine the equilibria and their stability under a symmetric population structure assumption, and we also numerically study the replicator dynamics of the general model. The model shows rich dynamical behavior, such as multiple transcritical bifurcations, multistability, and anti-synchronous oscillations. Our work offers insights into understanding how the presence of community structure impacts the eco-evolutionary dynamics within and between niches.</description>

      <title>Infinite dimensional Slow Manifolds for a Linear Fast-Reaction System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this expository paper is twofold. We start with a concise overview of the theory of invariant slow manifolds for fast-slow dynamical systems starting with the work by Tikhonov and Fenichel to the most recent works on infinite-dimensional fast-slow systems. The main part focuses on a class of linear fast-reaction PDE, which are particular forms of fast-reaction systems. The first result shows the convergence of solutions of the linear system to the limit system as the time-scale parameter $\varepsilon$ goes to zero. Moreover, from the explicit solutions the slow manifold is constructed and the convergence to the critical manifold is proven. The subsequent result, then, states a generalized version of the Fenichel-Tikhonov theorem for linear fast-reaction systems.</description>

      <title>Chemotaxis-inspired PDE model for airborne infectious disease transmission: analysis and simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Partial differential equation (PDE) models for infectious disease have received renewed interest in recent years. Most models of this type extend classical compartmental formulations with additional terms accounting for spatial dynamics, with Fickian diffusion being the most common such term. However, while diffusion may be appropriate for modeling vector-borne diseases, or diseases among plants or wildlife, the spatial propagation of airborne diseases in human populations is heavily dependent on human contact and mobility patterns, which are not necessarily well-described by diffusion. By including an additional chemotaxis-inspired term, in which the infection is propagated along the positive gradient of the susceptible population (from regions of low- to high-density of susceptibles), one may provide a more suitable description of these dynamics. This article introduces and analyzes a mathematical model of infectious disease incorporating a modified chemotaxis-type term. The model is analyzed mathematically and the well-posedness of the resulting PDE system is demonstrated. A series of numerical simulations are provided, demonstrating the ability of the model to naturally capture important phenomena not easily observed in standard diffusion models, including propagation over long spatial distances over short time scales and the emergence of localized infection hotspots</description>

      <title>Decentralized State-Dependent Markov Chain Synthesis with an Application to Swarm Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.02303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2012.02303v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a decentralized state-dependent Markov chain synthesis (DSMC) algorithm for finite-state Markov chains. We present a state-dependent consensus protocol that achieves exponential convergence under mild technical conditions, without relying on any connectivity assumptions regarding the dynamic network topology. Utilizing the proposed consensus protocol, we develop the DSMC algorithm, updating the Markov matrix based on the current state while ensuring the convergence conditions of the consensus protocol. This result establishes the desired steady-state distribution for the resulting Markov chain, ensuring exponential convergence from all initial distributions while adhering to transition constraints and minimizing state transitions. The DSMC's performance is demonstrated through a probabilistic swarm guidance example, which interprets the spatial distribution of a swarm comprising a large number of mobile agents as a probability distribution and utilizes the Markov chain to compute transition probabilities between states. Simulation results demonstrate faster convergence for the DSMC based algorithm when compared to the previous Markov chain based swarm guidance algorithms.</description>

Abstract: Let $\zeta^*(s)=\sum_{n=1}^{+\infty}(-1)^n/n^s$ and $\tau$ the operator defined on the Frechet space of holomorphic functions in $\{s\in \mathbb C :1/2&lt; Re \, s&lt;1\}$ by $\tau f(s)= f(s-2i\pi/\log 2)$. We show that the Riemann Hypothesis is equivalent to the strong recurrence of $\zeta^*(s)$ for $\tau$. It follows that a sufficient condition for $RH$ would be that every sum of a series of eigenvectors with unimodular eigenvalues for an operator $u$ is strongly recurrent for $u$. But we give a counterexample showing that it is not the case.</description>

      <title>Generalisations of Thompson's group V arising from purely infinite groupoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.04078v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a class of generalisations of Thompson's group $V$ arising naturally as topological full groups of purely infinite, minimal groupoids. In the process, we show that the derived subgroup of such a group is 2-generated whenever it is finitely generated and has no proper characters in full generality. We characterise this class of groupoids through a number of group-theoretic conditions on their full groups including vigor, the existence of suitable embeddings of $V$, and compressibility. We moreover give a complete abstract characterisation of those groups that arise as either topological full groups or derived subgroups of purely infinite, minimal groupoids. As an application, we describe all proper characters of the Brin-Higman-Thompson groups.</description>

      <title>A Computational Method for $H_2$-optimal Estimator and State Feedback Controller Synthesis for PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08052v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present solvable, convex formulations of $H_2$-optimal state estimation and state-feedback control problems for a general class of linear Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) with one spatial dimension. These convex formulations are derived by using an analysis and control framework called the `Partial Integral Equation' (PIE) framework, which utilizes the PIE representation of infinite-dimensional systems. Since PIEs are parameterized by Partial Integral (PI) operators that form an algebra, $H_2$-optimal estimation and control problems for PIEs can be formulated as Linear PI Inequalities (LPIs). Furthermore, if a PDE admits a PIE representation, then the stability and $H_2$ performance of the PIE system implies that of the PDE system. Consequently, the optimal estimator and controller obtained for a PIE using LPIs provide the same stability and performance when applied to the corresponding PDE. These LPI optimization problems can be solved computationally using semi-definite programming solvers because such problems can be formulated using Linear Matrix Inequalities by using positive matrices to parameterize a cone of positive PI operators. We illustrate the application of these methods by constructing observers and controllers for some standard PDE examples.</description>
