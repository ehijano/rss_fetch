      <title>Hilbert's Tenth Problem for some Noncommutative Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider Hilbert's tenth problem for two families of noncommutative rings. Let $K$ be a field of characteristic $p$. We start by showing that Hilbert's tenth problem has a negative answer over the twisted polynomial ring $K\{\tau\}$ and its left division ring of fractions $K(\tau)$. We prove that the recursively enumerable sets and Diophantine sets of $\mathbb{F}_{q^n}\{\tau\}$ coincide. We reduce Hilbert's tenth problem over $\mathbb{F}_{q^n}\{\!\{\tau\}\!\}$ and $\mathbb{F}_{q^n}(\!(\tau)\!)$, the twisted version of the power series and Laurent series, to the commutative case. Finally, we show that the different models of $\mathbb{F}_q[T]$ in $K\{\tau\}$ we created are all equivalent in some sense which we will define. We then move on to the second family of rings, coming from differential polynomials. We show that Hilbert's tenth problem over $K[\partial]$ has a negative answer. We prove that Hilbert's tenth problem over the left division ring of fractions $K(\partial_1,\ldots,\partial_k)$ can be reduced to Hilbert's tenth problem over $C(t_1,\ldots,t_k)$ where $C$ is the field of constants of $K$. This gives a negative answer for $k \geq 2$ if the field of constants is $\mathbb{C}$ and for $k\geq 1$ if it is $\mathbb{R}$.</description>

      <title>Maximal towers and ultrafilter bases in computability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.00312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.00312v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The tower number $\mathfrak t$ and the ultrafilter number $\mathfrak u$ are cardinal characteristics from set theory. They are based on combinatorial properties of classes of subsets of~$\omega$ and the almost inclusion relation $\subseteq^*$ between such subsets. We consider analogs of these cardinal characteristics in computability theory.
  We show that the mass problem of ultrafilter bases is equivalent to the mass problem of computing a function that dominates all computable functions, and hence, by Martin's characterization, it captures highness. On the other hand, the mass problem for maximal towers is below the mass problem of computing a non-low set. We also show that some, but not all, noncomputable low sets compute maximal towers: Every noncomputable (low) c.e.\ set computes a maximal tower but no 1-generic $\Delta^0_2$-set does so.
  We finally consider the mass problems of maximal almost disjoint, and of maximal independent families. We show that they are Medvedev equivalent to maximal towers, and to ultrafilter bases, respectively.</description>

      <title>On equivalence relations induced by Polish groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.04594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.04594v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The motivation of this article is to introduce a kind of orbit equivalence relations which can well describe structures and properties of Polish groups from the perspective of Borel reducibility. Given a Polish group $G$, let $E(G)$ be the right coset equivalence relation $G^\omega/c(G)$, where $c(G)$ is the group of all convergent sequences in $G$.
  Let $G$ be a Polish group. (1) $G$ is a discrete countable group containing at least two elements iff $E(G)\sim_BE_0$; (2) if $G$ is TSI uncountable non-archimedean, then $E(G)\sim_BE_0^\omega$; (3) $G$ is non-archimedean iff $E(G)\le_B=^+$; (4) if $H$ is a CLI Polish group but $G$ is not, then $E(G)\not\le_BE(H)$; (5) if $H$ is a non-archimedean Polish group but $G$ is not, then $E(G)\not\le_BE(H)$.
  The notion of $\alpha$-l.m.-unbalanced Polish group for $\alpha&lt;\omega_1$ is introduced. Let $G,H$ be Polish groups, $0&lt;\alpha&lt;\omega_1$. If $G$ is $\alpha$-l.m.-unbalanced but $H$ is not, then $E(G)\not\le_B E(H)$.
  For TSI Polish groups, the existence of Borel reduction is transformed into the existence of a well-behaved continuous mapping between topological groups. As its applications, for any Polish group $G$, let $G_0$ be the connected component of the identity element $1_G$. Let $G$ and $H$ be two separable TSI Lie groups. If $E(G)\le_BE(H)$, then there exists a continuous locally injective map $S:G_0\to H_0$. Moreover, if $G_0,H_0$ are abelian, $S$ is a group homomorphism. In particular, for $c_0,e_0,c_1,e_1\in{\mathbb N}$, $E({\mathbb R}^{c_0}\times{\mathbb T}^{e_0})\le_BE({\mathbb R}^{c_1}\times{\mathbb T}^{e_1})$ iff $e_0\le e_1$ and $c_0+e_0\le c_1+e_1$.</description>

      <title>Pre-measure spaces and pre-integration spaces in predicative Bishop-Cheng measure theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.08684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.08684v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bishop's measure theory (BMT) is an abstraction of the measure theory of a locally compact metric space $X$, and the use of an informal notion of a set-indexed family of complemented subsets is crucial to its predicative character. The more general Bishop-Cheng measure theory (BCMT) is a constructive version of the classical Daniell approach to measure and integration, and highly impredicative, as many of its fundamental notions, such as the integration space of $p$-integrable functions $L^p$, rely on quantification over proper classes (from the constructive point of view). In this paper we introduce the notions of a pre-measure and pre-integration space, a predicative variation of the Bishop-Cheng notion of a measure space and of an integration space, respectively. Working within Bishop Set Theory (BST), and using the theory of set-indexed families of complemented subsets and set-indexed families of real-valued partial functions within BST, we apply the implicit, predicative spirit of BMT to BCMT. As a first example, we present the pre-measure space of complemented detachable subsets of a set $X$ with the Dirac-measure, concentrated at a single point. Furthermore, we translate in our predicative framework the non-trivial, Bishop-Cheng construction of an integration space from a given measure space, showing that a pre-measure space induces the pre-integration space of simple functions associated to it. Finally, a predicative construction of the canonically integrable functions $L^1$, as the completion of an integration space, is included.</description>

      <title>Weak A2 spaces, the Kastanas game and strategically Ramsey sets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00200v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of a weak A2 space (or wA2-space), which generalises spaces satisfying Todor\v{c}evi\'c's axioms A1-A4 and countable vector spaces. We show that in any Polish weak A2 space, analytic sets are Kastanas Ramsey, and discuss the relationship between Kastanas Ramsey sets and sets in the projective hierarchy. We also show that in all spaces satisfying A1-A4, every subset of $\cal{R}$ is Kastanas Ramsey iff Ramsey, generalising the recent result by Cano and Di Prisco. Finally, we show that in the setting of Gowers wA2-spaces, Kastanas Ramsey sets and strategically Ramsey sets coincide, providing a connection between the recent studies on topological Ramsey spaces and countable vector spaces.</description>

      <title>How Category Theory Works: The Elements &amp; Distinctions Analysis of the Morphisms, Duality, and Universal Constructions in Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.05733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2007.05733v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to show that the dual notions of elements &amp; distinctions are the basic analytical concepts needed to unpack and analyze morphisms, duality, and universal constructions in the Sets, the category of sets and functions. The analysis extends directly to other concrete categories (groups, rings, vector spaces, etc.) where the objects are sets with a certain type of structure and the morphisms are functions that preserve that structure. Then the elements &amp; distinctions-based definitions can be abstracted in purely arrow-theoretic way for abstract category theory. In short, the language of elements &amp; distinctions is the conceptual language in which the category of sets is written, and abstract category theory gives the abstract arrows version of those definitions.</description>

      <title>Proof Theory and Decision Procedures for Deontic STIT Logics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03148v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper provides a set of cut-free complete sequent-style calculi for deontic STIT ('See To It That') logics used to formally reason about choice-making, obligations, and norms in a multi-agent setting. We leverage these calculi to write a proof-search algorithm deciding deontic, multi-agent STIT logics with (un)limited choice and introduce a loop-checking mechanism to ensure the termination of the algorithm. Despite the acknowledged potential for deontic reasoning in the context of autonomous, multi-agent scenarios, this work is the first to provide a syntactic decision procedure for this class of logics. Our proof-search procedure is designed to provide verifiable witnesses/certificates of the (in)validity of formulae, which permits an analysis of the (non)theoremhood of formulae and act as explanations thereof. We show how the proof system and decision algorithm can be used to automate normative reasoning tasks such as duty checking (viz. determining an agent's obligations relative to a given knowledge base), compliance checking (viz. determining if a choice, considered by an agent as potential conduct, complies with the given knowledge base), and joint fulfillment checking (viz. determining whether under a specified factual context an agent can jointly fulfill all their duties).</description>

      <title>The equational theory of the Weihrauch lattice with (iterated) composition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14999v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the equational theory of the Weihrauch lattice with composition and iterations, meaning the collection of equations between terms built from variables, the lattice operations $\sqcup$, $\sqcap$, the composition operator $\star$ and its iteration $(-)^\diamond$ , which are true however we substitute (slightly extended) Weihrauch degrees for the variables. We characterize them using B\"uchi games on finite graphs and give a complete axiomatization that derives them. The term signature and the axiomatization are reminiscent of Kleene algebras, except that we additionally have meets and the lattice operations do not fully distributes over composition. The game characterization also implies that it is decidable whether an equation is universally valid. We give some complexity bounds; in particular, the problem is Pspace-hard in general and we conjecture that it is solvable in Pspace.</description>

      <title>Informed deep hierarchical classification: a non-standard analysis inspired approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16956v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work proposes a novel approach to the deep hierarchical classification task, i.e., the problem of classifying data according to multiple labels organized in a rigid parent-child structure. It consists in a multi-output deep neural network equipped with specific projection operators placed before each output layer. The design of such an architecture, called lexicographic hybrid deep neural network (LH-DNN), has been possible by combining tools from different and quite distant research fields: lexicographic multi-objective optimization, non-standard analysis, and deep learning. To assess the efficacy of the approach, the resulting network is compared against the B-CNN, a convolutional neural network tailored for hierarchical classification tasks, on the CIFAR10, CIFAR100 (where it has been originally and recently proposed before being adopted and tuned for multiple real-world applications) and Fashion-MNIST benchmarks. Evidence states that an LH-DNN can achieve comparable if not superior performance, especially in the learning of the hierarchical relations, in the face of a drastic reduction of the learning parameters, training epochs, and computational time, without the need for ad-hoc loss functions weighting values.</description>

Abstract: We study conjugacy of formal derivations on fields of generalised power series in characteristic 0. Casting the problem of Poincar\'e resonance in terms of asymptotic differential algebra, we give conditions for conjugacy of parabolic flat log-exp transseries, flat grid-based transseries, logarithmic transseries, power series with exponents and coefficients in an ordered field, and formal Puiseux series.</description>
