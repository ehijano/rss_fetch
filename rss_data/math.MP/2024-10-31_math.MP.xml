      <title>An operator algebraic approach to symmetry defects and fractionalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a superselection theory of symmetry defects in 2+1D symmetry enriched topological (SET) order in the infinite volume setting. For a finite symmetry group $G$ with a unitary on-site action, our formalism produces a $G$-crossed braided tensor category $G\mathsf{Sec}$. This superselection theory is a direct generalization of the usual superselection theory of anyons, and thus is consistent with this standard analysis in the trivially graded component $G\mathsf{Sec}_1$. This framework also gives us a completely rigorous understanding of symmetry fractionalization. To demonstrate the utility of our formalism, we compute $G\mathsf{Sec}$ explicitly in both short-range and long-range entangled spin systems with symmetry and recover the relevant skeletal data.</description>

      <title>Regularizing Calabi-Yau topological conformal field theories using cutoff heat kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we construct a family of topological conformal field theories (TCFTs) associated to a Calabi-Yau space by modifying the heat kernel and sections of the Calabi-Yau space. This is done by restricting to certain eigenspaces of the Laplacian. We then present two a-priori distinct ways to regularize the Calabi-Yau TCFT by using these modified heat kernels, and then show that they are equivalent. Finally, we relate the regularized TCFTs for different cutoffs.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the relationship between dynamical symmetries, Cartan symmetries, and dynamical similarities in contact mechanics. Using an alternative decomposition of vector fields, we provide a characterization of those symmetries and a new description in terms of tensor densities. Additionally, we show that, in certain cases, this construction enables the recovery of integrals of motion.</description>

      <title>Acoustic wave diffraction by a quadrant of sound-soft scatterers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by research in metamaterials, we consider the challenging problem of acoustic wave scattering by a doubly periodic quadrant of sound-soft scatterers arranged in a square formation, which we have dubbed the quarter lattice. This leads to a Wiener--Hopf equation in two complex variables with three unknown functions for which we can reduce and solve exactly using a new analytic method. After some suitable truncations, the resulting linear system is inverted using elementary matrix arithmetic and the solution can be numerically computed. This solution is also critically compared to a numerical least squares collocation approach and to our previous method where we decomposed the lattice into semi-infinite rows or columns.</description>

      <title>A space-adiabatic approach for bulk-defect correspondences in lattice models of topological insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In space-adiabatic approaches one can approximate Hamiltonians that are modulated slowly in space by phase-space functions that depend on position and momentum. In this paper, we establish a rigorous relation between this approach and the operator-theoretic approach for topological insulators with defects, which employs $C^*$-algebras and operator K-theory. Using such tools, we show that by quantizing phase-space functions one can construct lattice Hamiltonians which are gapped at certain spatial limits and carry protected states at defects such as boundaries, hinges, and corners. Moreover, we show that the topological invariants that protect the latter can be computed in terms of the symbol functions. This enables us to compute boundary maps in K-theory that are relevant for bulk-defect correspondences.</description>

      <title>Some informational inequalities involving generalized trigonometric functions and a new class of generalized moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we define a family of probability densities involving the generalized trigonometric functions defined by Dr\'abek and Man\'asevich, we name Generalized Trigonometric Densities. We show their relationship with the generalized stretched Gaussians and other types of laws such as logistic, hyperbolic secant, and raised cosine probability densities. We prove that, for a fixed generalized Fisher information, this family of densities is of minimal R\'enyi entropy. Moreover, we introduce generalized moments via the mean of the power of a deformed cumulative distribution. The latter is defined as a cumulative of the power of the probability density function, this second parameter tuning the tail weight of the deformed cumulative distribution. These generalized moments coincide with the usual moments of a deformed probability distribution with a regularized tail. We show that, for any bounded probability density, there exists a critical value for this second parameter below which the whole subfamily of generalized moments is finite for any positive value of the first parameter (power of the moment). In addition, we show that such generalized moments satisfy remarkable properties like order relation w.r.t. the first parameter, or adequate scaling behavior. Finally, we highlight that, if we constrain such a generalized moment, both the R\'enyi entropy and generalized Fisher information achieve respectively their maximum and minimum for the generalized trigonometric densities.</description>

      <title>2D magnetic stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article is a contribution to the proceedings of the 33rd/35th International Colloquium on Group Theoretical Methods in Physics (ICGTMP, Group33/35) held in Cotonou, Benin, July 15-19, 2024. The stability of matter is an old and mathematically difficult problem, relying both on the uncertainty principle of quantum mechanics and on the exclusion principle of quantum statistics. We consider here the stability of the self-interacting almost-bosonic anyon gas, generalizing the Gross-Pitaevskii / nonlinear Schr\"odinger energy functionals to include magnetic self interactions. We show that there is a type of supersymmetry in the model which holds only for higher values of the magnetic coupling but is broken for lower values, and that in the former case supersymmetric ground states exist precisely at even-integer quantized values of the coupling. These states constitute a manifold of explicit solitonic vortex solutions whose densities solve a generalized Liouville equation, and can be regarded as nonlinear generalizations of Landau levels. The reported work is joint with Alireza Ataei and Dinh-Thi Nguyen and makes an earlier analysis of self-dual abelian Chern-Simons-Higgs theory by Jackiw and Pi, Hagen, and others, mathematically rigorous.</description>

      <title>On computational complexity of unitary and state design properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study unitary and state $t$-designs from a computational complexity theory perspective. First, we address the problems of computing frame potentials that characterize (approximate) $t$-designs. We provide a quantum algorithm for computing the frame potential and show that 1. exact computation can be achieved by a single query to a $\# \textsf{P}$-oracle and is $\# \textsf{P}$-hard, 2. for state vectors, it is $\textsf{BQP}$-complete to decide whether the frame potential is larger than or smaller than certain values, if the promise gap between the two values is inverse-polynomial in the number of qubits, and 3. both for state vectors and unitaries, it is $\textsf{PP}$-complete if the promise gap is exponentially small. As the frame potential is closely related to the out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs), our result implies that computing the OTOCs with exponential accuracy is also hard. Second, we address promise problems to decide whether a given set is a good or bad approximation to a $t$-design and show that this problem is in $\textsf{PP}$ for any constant $t$ and is $\textsf{PP}$-hard for $t=1,2$ and $3$. Remarkably, this is the case even if a given set is promised to be either exponentially close to or worse than constant away from a $1$-design. Our results illustrate the computationally hard nature of unitary and state designs.</description>

      <title>On a Rigidity Result in Positive Scalar Curvature Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I prove a scalar curvature rigidity theorem for spheres. In particular, I prove that geodesic balls of radii strictly less than $\frac{\pi}{2}$ in $n+1~(n\geq 2)$ dimensional unit sphere are rigid under smooth perturbations that increase scalar curvature preserving the intrinsic and extrinsic geometry of the boundary, and such rigidity result fails for the hemisphere. The proof of this assertion requires the notion of a real Killing connection and solution of the boundary value problem associated with its Dirac operator. The result serves as the sharpest refinement of the now-disproven Min-Oo conjecture.</description>

      <title>Periodic orbits on 2-regular circulant digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Periodic orbits (equivalence classes of closed cycles up to cyclic shifts) play an important role in applications of graph theory. For example, they appear in the definition of the Ihara zeta function and exact trace formulae for the spectra of quantum graphs. Circulant graphs are Cayley graphs of $\mathbb{Z}_n$. Here we consider directed Cayley graphs with two generators (2-regular Cayley digraphs). We determine the number of primitive periodic orbits of a given length (total number of directed edges) in terms of the number of times edges corresponding to each generator appear in the periodic orbit (the step count). Primitive periodic orbits are those periodic orbits that cannot be written as a repetition of a shorter orbit. We describe the lattice structure of lengths and step counts for which periodic orbits exist and characterize the repetition number of a periodic orbit by its winding number (the sum of the step sequence divided by the number of vertices) and the repetition number of its step sequence. To obtain these results, we also evaluate the number of Lyndon words on an alphabet of two letters with a given length and letter count.</description>

      <title>A kneading map of chaotic switching oscillations in a Kerr cavity with two interacting light fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical systems that combine nonlinearity with coupling between various subsystems offer a flexible platform for observing a diverse range of nonlinear dynamics. Furthermore, engineering tolerances are such that the subsystems can be identical to within a fraction of the wavelength of light; hence, such coupled systems inherently have a natural symmetry that can lead to either delocalization or symmetry breaking. We consider here an optical Kerr cavity that supports two interacting electric fields, generated by two symmetric input beams. Mathematically, this system is modeled by a four-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$-equivariant vector field with the strength and detuning of the input light as control parameters. Previous research has shown that complex switching dynamics are observed both experimentally and numerically across a wide range of parameter values. Here, we show that particular switching patterns are created at specific global bifurcations through either delocalization or symmetry breaking of a chaotic attractor. We find that the system exhibits infinitely many of these global bifurcations, which are organized by $\mathbb{Z}_2$-equivariant codimension-two Belyakov transitions. We investigate these switching dynamics by means of the continuation of global bifurcations in combination with the computation of kneading invariants and Lyapunov exponents. In this way, we provide a comprehensive picture of the interplay between different switching patterns of periodic orbits and chaotic attractors.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the Chern-Simons formulation of AdS3 gravity as well as the Costello-Witten-Yamazaki (CWY) theory for quantum integrability, we construct a novel topological 4D gravity given by Eq(5.1) with observables based on gravitational gauge field holonomies. The field action $S^{grav}_{4D}$ of this gravity has a gauge symmetry $SL(2,\mathbb{C})$ and reads also as the difference $S^{CWY_{L}}_{4D}-S^{CWY_{R}}_{4D}$ with 4D Chern-Simons field actions $S^{CWY_{L/R}}_{4D}$ given by left/right CWY theory Eq(3.9). We also use this 4D gravity derivation to build observables describing gravitational topological defects and their interactions. We conclude our study with few comments regarding quantum integrability and the extension of AdS$_{3}$/CFT$_{2}$ correspondence with regard to the obtained topological 4D gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a class of line ensembles whose local structure is described by independent geometric random walk bridges, which have been conditioned to interlace with each other. The latter arise naturally in the context Schur processes, including their versions in a half-space and a finite interval with free or periodic boundary conditions. We show that under one-point tightness of the curves, these line ensembles are tight and any subsequential limit satisfies the Brownian Gibbs property. As an application of our tightness results, we show that sequences of spiked Schur processes, that were recently considered in arXiv:2408.08445, converge uniformly over compact sets to the Airy wanderer line ensembles.</description>

Abstract: We consider the relaxation time for the Glauber dynamics of infinite volume critical ferromagnetic Ising model on $\mathbb{Z}^{d}$ at $d\geq5$. In this case, using the known log-Sobolev inequality in finite volumes, and conditional on an assumption on the 1-arm exponent of critical FK-Ising percolation, we show the temporal spin correlation function decays polynomially fast in time.</description>

      <title>Nonstabilizerness Enhances Thrifty Shadow Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Shadow estimation is a powerful approach for estimating the expectation values of many observables. Thrifty shadow estimation is a simple variant that is proposed to reduce the experimental overhead by reusing random circuits repeatedly. Although this idea is so simple, its performance is quite elusive. In this work we show that thrifty shadow estimation is effective on average whenever the unitary ensemble forms a 2-design, in sharp contrast with the previous expectation. In thrifty shadow estimation based on the Clifford group, the variance is inversely correlated with the degree of nonstabilizerness of the state and observable, which is a key resource in quantum information processing. For fidelity estimation, it decreases exponentially with the stabilizer 2-R\'{e}nyi entropy of the target state, which endows the stabilizer 2-R\'{e}nyi entropy with a clear operational meaning. In addition,we propose a simple circuit to enhance the efficiency, which requires only one layer of $T$ gates and is particularly appealing in the NISQ era.</description>

      <title>Integral quantization based on the Heisenberg-Weyl group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a relativistic framework of integral quantization applied to the motion of spinless particles in the four-dimensional Minkowski spacetime. The proposed scheme is based on coherent states generated by the action of the Heisenberg-Weyl group and has been motivated by the Hamiltonian description of the geodesic motion in General Relativity. We believe that this formulation should also allow for a generalization to the motion of test particles in curved spacetimes. A key element in our construction is the use of suitably defined positive operator-valued measures. We show that this approach can be used to quantize the one-dimensional nonrelativistic harmonic oscillator, recovering the standard Hamiltonian as obtained by the canonical quantization. Our formalism is then applied to the Hamiltonian associated with the motion of a relativistic particle in the Minkowski spacetime. A direct application of our model, including a computation of transition amplitudes between states characterized by fixed positions and momenta, is postponed to a forthcoming article.</description>

      <title>Non-linear sigma models for non-Hermitian random matrices in symmetry classes AI$^{\dagger}$ and AII$^{\dagger}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetry of non-Hermitian matrices underpins many physical phenomena. In particular, chaotic open quantum systems exhibit universal bulk spectral correlations classified on the basis of time-reversal symmetry$^{\dagger}$ (TRS$^{\dagger}$), coinciding with those of non-Hermitian random matrices in the same symmetry class. Here, we analytically study the spectral correlations of non-Hermitian random matrices in the presence of TRS$^{\dagger}$ with signs $+1$ and $-1$, corresponding to symmetry classes AI$^{\dagger}$ and AII$^{\dagger}$, respectively. Using the fermionic replica non-linear sigma model approach, we derive $n$-fold integral expressions for the $n$th moment of the one-point and two-point characteristic polynomials. Performing the replica limit $n\to 0$, we qualitatively reproduce the density of states and level-level correlations of non-Hermitian random matrices with TRS$^{\dagger}$.</description>

      <title>Efficient optimization of plasma surface high harmonic generation by an improved Bayesian strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Plasma surface high-order harmonics generation (SHHG) driven by intense laser pulses on plasma targets enables a high-quality extreme ultraviolet source with high pulse energy and outstanding spatiotemporal coherence. Optimizing the performance of SHHG is important for its applications in single-shot imaging and absorption spectroscopy. In this work, we demonstrate the optimization of laser-driven SHHG by an improved Bayesian strategy in conjunction with particle-in-cell simulations. A traditional Bayesian algorithm is first employed to optimize the SHHG intensity in a two-dimensional space of parameter. Then an improved Bayesian strategy, using the Latin hypercube sampling technique and a dynamic acquisition strategy, is developed to overcome the curse of dimensionality and the risk of local optima in a high-dimensional space optimization. The improved Bayesian optimization approach is efficient and robust in three-dimensionally optimizing the harmonic ellipticity, paving the way for the upcoming SHHG experiments with a considerable repetition rate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.24109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using a renormalization-inspired perturbation expansion we show that oscillons in a generic field theory in (1+1)-dimensions arise as dressed Q-balls of a universal (up to the leading nonlinear order) complex field theory. This theory reveals a close similarity to the integrable complex sine-Gordon model which possesses exact multi-$Q$-balls. We show that excited oscillons, with characteristic modulations of their amplitude, are two-oscillons bound states generated from a two $Q$-ball solution.</description>

      <title>Quantum Groups as Global Symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.24142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study quantum field theories which have quantum groups as global internal symmetries. We show that in such theories operators are generically non-local, and should be thought as living at the ends of topological lines. We describe the general constraints of the quantum group symmetry, given by Ward identities, that correlation functions of the theory should satisfy. We also show that generators of the symmetry can be represented by topological lines with some novel properties. We then discuss a particular example of $U_q(sl_2)$ symmetric CFT, which we solve using the bootstrap techniques and relying on the symmetry. We finally show strong evidence that for a special value of $q$ a subsector of this theory reproduces the fermionic formulation of the Ising model. This suggests that a quantum group can act on local operators as well, however, it generically transforms them into non-local ones.</description>

      <title>Quantitative measure of topological protection in Floquet systems through the spectral localizer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The standard understanding of topological protection from band theory is that a system's topology cannot change without first closing the bulk band gap. However, in Floquet systems, this typical definition of topological protection is one step removed from the experimentally accessible system parameters, as the relationship between the disorder in a system's instantaneous Hamiltonian and its Floquet Hamiltonian that defines its topology is not straightforward. Here, we demonstrate that the spectral localizer framework for classifying material topology can be applied to Floquet systems and prove that its associated measure of topological protection can be understood in terms of the integrated disorder across the system's instantaneous Hamiltonians. As such, we have derived a quantitative bound on a Floquet system's topological protection in terms of the instantaneous system. Moreover, we show the utility of these bounds in both ordinary an anomalous Floquet Chern insulators.</description>

      <title>The time-dependent bivariational principle: Theoretical foundation for real-time propagation methods of coupled-cluster type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-time propagation methods for chemistry and physics are invariably formulated using variational techniques. The time-dependent bivariational principle (TD-BIVP) is known to be the proper framework for coupled-cluster type methods, and is here studied from a differential geometric point of view. It is demonstrated how two distinct classical Hamilton's equations of motion arise from considering the real and imaginary parts of the action integral. The latter is new, and can in principle be used to develop novel propagation methods. Conservation laws and Poisson brackets are introduced, completing the analogy with classical mechanics. An overview of established real-time propagation methods is given in the context of our formulation of the TD-BIVP, namely time-dependent traditional coupled-cluster theory, orbital-adaptive coupled-cluster theory, time-dependent orthogonal optimized coupled-cluster theory, and equation-of-motion coupled cluster theory.</description>

Abstract: We consider a neutral bosonic molecule in the Born-Oppenheimer approximation without spin and assume the physically obvious assertion that a neutral molecule prefers to break into smaller neutral clusters. We prove the existence of a global in space/uniform spectral gap between the ground state and first excited state energies. To do so, we improve upon previous results using a different tool, the time-independent Feshbach-Schur map.</description>

Abstract: We investigate singularly perturbed nonlinear complex differential systems of the form $\hbar \partial_x f = F (x, \hbar, f)$ where $\hbar$ is a small complex perturbation parameter. Under a geometric assumption on the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix of $F$, we prove an Existence and Uniqueness Theorem for exact perturbative solutions; i.e., holomorphic solutions with prescribed perturbative expansions in $\hbar$. In fact, these solutions are the Borel resummation of the formal perturbative solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.14506v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider resurgence for the nonconformal Bjorken flow with Fermi-Dirac and Bose-Einstein statistics on the extended relaxation-time approximation. We firstly consider full formal transseries expanded around the equilibrium and then construct the resurgent relation by looking to the structure of Borel transformed ODEs. We form a conjecture of the resurgent relation based on the considerations that Stokes constants constituting of the resurgent relation originate only from singularities of dissipative variables on the Borel plane and that the other variables such as temperature and chemical potential become Borel nonsummable through nonlinear terms with the dissipative variables. We numerically check the conjecture for fundamental variables by explicitly evaluating values of the dominant Stokes constant depending on initial conditions and a particle mass. We also make comments on some issues related to transseries structure and resurgence such as the case of broken $U(1)$ symmetry, the massless case, generalized relaxation-time, and attractor solution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.12599v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The deformed model $\tilde{\varphi}^{(6)}$ is introduced based on the $\varphi^4$ model using a deformation functional $F[\varphi]$ including a free parameter $a$. The kink solutions in different sectors and their internal modes are obtained as functions of the deformation parameter and their characteristics are evaluated as well. It is shown that the kinks of the deformed model inherit some of their dynamical properties (like internal modes) from the standard $\varphi^4$ potential and some of their characteristics from the $\varphi^6$ model. The dynamics of kink-antikink (antikink-kink) scattering is investigated in different sectors with various kink initial conditions as well as different values of deformation parameter. According to the kinks' initial velocity, colliding kinks may be bound together or scatter from each other after the interaction. These two situations are distinguished by the critical velocity, which itself depends on the deformation parameter of the model. Due to the difference in the rest mass of kink solutions related to different sectors, interesting and sometimes rare phenomena are observed during the kink scattering and their interactions.</description>

Abstract: We propose the representation principle to study physical systems with a given symmetry. In the context of symmetry enriched topological orders, we give the appropriate representation category, the category of SET orders, which include SPT orders and symmetry breaking orders as special cases. For fusion n-category symmetries, we show that the category of SET orders encodes almost all information about the interplay between symmetry and topological orders, in a natural and canonical way. These information include defects and boundaries of SET orders, symmetry charges, explicit and spontaneous symmetry breaking, stacking of SET orders, gauging of generalized symmetry, as well as quantum currents (SymTFT or symmetry TO). We also provide a detailed categorical algorithm to compute the generalized gauging. In particular, we proved that gauging is always reversible, as a special type of Morita-equivalence. The explicit data for ungauging, the inverse to gauging, is given.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.02388v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An universal approximation technique for analysis of different characteristics of states of composite infinite-dimensional quantum systems is proposed and used to prove general results concerning the properties of correlation and entanglement measures in such systems. Then these results are applied to the study of three important characteristics: the relative entropy of $\pi$-entanglement, the Rains bound (the unregularized and regularized versions of both characteristics are considered) and the conditional entanglement of mutual information.
  In particular, we analyse continuity and convexity properties of the above entanglement measures, prove several results simplifying their definitions and establish a finite-dimensional approximation property for these characteristics that allows us to generalize to the infinite-dimensional case the results proved in the finite-dimensional settings.</description>

      <title>Fluctuations of the free energy of the spherical Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model with heavy-tailed interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14295v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the 2-spin spherical Sherrington--Kirkpatrick model without external magnetic field where the interactions between the spins are given as random variables with heavy-tailed distribution. We show that the free energy exhibits a sharp phase transition depending on the location of the largest eigenvalue of the interaction matrix. We also prove the order of the limiting free energy and the limiting distribution of the fluctuation of the free energy for both regimes.</description>

      <title>New Integrable Chiral Cosmological Models with Two Scalar Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12732v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct integrable chiral cosmological models with two scalar fields and potentials represented in terms of hyperbolic functions. Using the conformal transformation of the metric and the corresponding models with induced gravity terms, we obtain the general solutions in the spatially flat, open and closed Friedmann universes and the corresponding integrals of motion. The obtained general solutions can be written in terms of the Jacobi elliptic functions of the conformal time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15053v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the Fr\'echet--Lie groups of the form $C^{\infty}(M)\rtimes \mathbb{R}$ resulting from smooth flows on compact manifolds $M$ fail to be locally exponential in several cases: when at least one non-periodic orbit is locally closed, or when the flow restricts to a linear one on an orbit closure diffeomorphic to a torus. As an application, we prove that the Bondi--Metzner--Sachs group of symmetries of an asymptotically flat space-time is not locally exponential.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16819v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generating functions of BPS indices, counting states of D4-D2-D0 black holes in Calabi-Yau compactifications of type IIA string theory and identified with rank 0 Donaldson- Thomas invariants, are examples of mock modular forms. They have a quite complicated modular anomaly expressed as a sum over three different types of trees weighted by generalized error functions and their derivatives. We show that this anomaly can be significantly simplified, which in turn simplfies finding the corresponding mock modular generating functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03235v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Through the rotational invariance of the 2-d critical bond percolation exploration path on the square lattice we express Smirnov's edge parafermionic observable as a sum of two new edge observables. With the help of these two new edge observables we can apply the discrete harmonic analysis and conformal mapping theory to prove the convergence of the 2-d critical bond percolation exploration path on the square lattice to the trace of $SLE_6$ as the mesh size of the lattice tends to zero.</description>

      <title>Efficient pseudometrics for data-driven comparisons of nonlinear dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18681v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computationally efficient solutions for pseudometrics quantifying deviation from topological conjugacy between dynamical systems are presented. Deviation from conjugacy is quantified in a Pareto optimal sense that accounts for spectral properties of Koopman operators as well as trajectory geometry. Theoretical justification is provided for computing such pseudometrics in Koopman eigenfunction space rather than observable space. Furthermore, it is shown that theoretical consistency with topological conjugacy can be maintained when restricting the search for optimal transformations between systems to the unitary group. Therefore the pseudometrics are based on analytical solutions for unitary transformations in Koopman eigenfunction space. Geometric considerations for the deviation from conjugacy Pareto optimality problem are used to develop scalar pseudometrics that account for all possible optimal solutions given just two Pareto points. The approach is demonstrated on two example problems; the first being a simple benchmarking problem and the second an engineering example comparing the dynamics of morphological computation of biological nonlinear muscle actuators to simplified mad-made (including bioinspired) approaches. The benefits of considering operator and trajectory geometry based dissimilarity measures in a unified and consistent formalism is demonstrated. Overall, the deviation from conjugacy pseudometrics provide practical advantages in terms of efficiency and scalability, while maintaining theoretical consistency.</description>

      <title>Conditional entropy and information of quantum processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01740v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: What would be a reasonable definition of the conditional entropy of bipartite quantum processes, and what novel insight would it provide? We develop this notion using four information-theoretic axioms and define the corresponding quantitative formulas. Our definitions of the conditional entropies of channels are based on the generalized state and channel divergences, for instance, quantum relative entropy. We find that the conditional entropy of quantum channels has potential to reveal insights for quantum processes that aren't already captured by the existing entropic functions, entropy or conditional entropy, of the states and channels. The von Neumann conditional entropy $S[A|B]_{\mathcal{N}}$ of the channel $\mathcal{N}_{A'B'\to AB}$ is based on the quantum relative entropy, with system pairs $A',A$ and $B',B$ being nonconditioning and conditioning systems, respectively. We identify a connection between the underlying causal structure of a bipartite channel and its conditional entropy. In particular, we provide a necessary and sufficient condition for a bipartite quantum channel $\mathcal{N}_{A'B'\to AB}$ in terms of its von Neumann conditional entropy $S[A|B]_{\mathcal{N}}$, to have no causal influence from $A'$ to $B$. As a consequence, if $S[A|B]_{\mathcal{N}}&lt; -\log|A|$ then the channel necessarily has causal influence (signaling) from $A'$ to $B$. Our definition of the conditional entropy establishes the strong subadditivity of the entropy for quantum channels. We also study the total amount of correlations possible due to quantum processes by defining the multipartite mutual information of quantum channels.</description>

      <title>Beyond the ensemble paradigm in low dimensional quantum gravity: Schwarzian density, quantum chaos and wormhole contributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02270v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Based on periodic orbit theory we address the individual-system versus ensemble interpretation of quantum gravity from a quantum chaos perspective. To this end we show that the spectrum of geodesic motion on high-dimensional hyperbolic manifolds, described by the Selberg trace formula, displays a Schwarzian ($\sinh 2\pi\sqrt{E}$) mean level density. Due to its chaotic classical limit, this quantum system also shows all universal signatures of quantum chaos. These two properties imply a possible duality to Jackiw-Teitelboim-type quantum gravity at the level of a single system instead of an ensemble of systems like matrix theories and SYK models. Beyond the universal regime we show how the full wormhole geometry on the gravity side emerges from the discreteness of the set of periodic orbits. Thereby, we take initial steps towards a duality between gravitational and mesoscopic chaotic quantum systems through the topological, respectively, periodic orbit expansions of their correlators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14051v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Higher Forms Symmetries (HFS) of a closed bosonic M2-brane theory formulated from the world-volume perspective on a compactified target space $\mathcal{M}_9 \times T^2$ are obtained. We show that the cancellation of the 't Hooft anomaly present in the theory is related to a 3-form flux with 1-gerbe structure associated to the world-volume flux quantization condition. A Wilson surface is naturally defined on the topological operator that characterize the holonomy of the M2-brane. The projection of the flux quantization condition onto the spatial part of the worldvolume, leads to a flux quantization on the M2-brane. The topological operators realise discrete symmetries associated with the winding and the flux/monopole condition. The algebra of operators is well defined.</description>
