      <title>Boundary Integral Methods for Particle Diffusion in Complex Geometries: Shielding, Confinement, and Escape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a numerical method for the solution of diffusion problems in unbounded planar regions with complex geometries of absorbing and reflecting bodies. Our numerical method applies the Laplace transform to the parabolic problem, yielding a modified Helmholtz equation which is solved with a boundary integral method. Returning to the time domain is achieved by quadrature of the inverse Laplace transform by deforming along the so-called Talbot contour. We demonstrate the method for various complex geometries formed by disjoint bodies of arbitrary shape on which either uniform Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions are applied. The use of the Laplace transform bypasses constraints with traditional time-stepping methods and allows for integration over the long equilibration timescales present in diffusion problems in unbounded domains. Using this method, we demonstrate shielding effects where the complex geometry modulates the dynamics of capture to absorbing sets. In particular, we show examples where geometry can guide diffusion processes to particular absorbing sites, obscure absorbing sites from diffusing particles, and even find the exits of confining geometries, such as mazes.</description>

      <title>Convergence Framework of Deep Learning-based Hybrid Iterative Methods and the Application to Designing a Fourier Neural Solver for Parametric PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, deep learning-based hybrid iterative methods (DL-HIM) have emerged as a promising approach for designing fast neural solvers to tackle large-scale sparse linear systems. DL-HIM combine the smoothing effect of simple iterative methods with the spectral bias of neural networks, which allows them to effectively eliminate both high-frequency and low-frequency error components. However, their efficiency may decrease if simple iterative methods can not provide effective smoothing, making it difficult for the neural network to learn mid-frequency and high-frequency components. This paper first establishes a convergence analysis framework for general DL-HIM from a spectral viewpoint, concluding that under reasonable assumptions, DL-HIM exhibit a convergence rate independent of grid size $h$ and physical parameters $\boldsymbol{\mu}$. To meet these assumptions, we design a neural network from an eigen perspective, focusing on learning the eigenvalues and eigenvectors corresponding to error components that simple iterative methods struggle to eliminate. Specifically, the eigenvalues are learned by a meta subnet, while the eigenvectors are approximated using Fourier modes with a transition matrix provided by another meta subnet. The resulting DL-HIM, termed the Fourier Neural Solver (FNS), is expected to achieve a $h, \boldsymbol{\mu}$-independent convergence rate with the guarantee of universal approximation and the discretization invariant property of the meta subnets. We verify the performance of FNS on four types of linear parametric PDEs.</description>

      <title>A polytopal discontinuous Galerkin method for the pseudo-stress formulation of the unsteady Stokes problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work aims to construct and analyze a discontinuous Galerkin method on polytopal grids (PolydG) to solve the pseudo-stress formulation of the unsteady Stokes problem. The pseudo-stress variable is introduced due to the growing interest in non-Newtonian flows and coupled interface problems, where stress assumes a fundamental role. The space-time discretization of the problem is achieved by combining the PolydG approach with the implicit theta-method time integration scheme. For both the semi- and fully-discrete problems we present a detailed stability analysis. Moreover, we derive convergence estimates for the fully discrete space-time discretization. A set of verification tests is presented to verify the theoretical estimates and the application of the method to cases of engineering interest.</description>

      <title>An Adaptive Angular Aomain Compression Scheme For Solving Multiscale Radiative Transfer Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When dealing with the steady-state multiscale radiative transfer equation (RTE) with heterogeneous coefficients, spatially localized low-rank structures are present in the angular space. This paper introduces an adaptive tailored finite point scheme (TFPS) for RTEs in heterogeneous media, which can adaptively compress the angular space. It does so by selecting reduced TFPS basis functions based on the local optical properties of the background media. These reduced basis functions capture the important local modes in the velocity domain. A detailed a posteriori error analysis is performed to quantify the discrepancy between the reduced and full TFPS solutions. Additionally, numerical experiments demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the adaptive TFPS in solving multiscale RTEs, especially in scenarios involving boundary and interface layers.</description>

      <title>ideal.II: a Galerkin Space-Time Extension to the Finite Element Library deal.II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The C++ library deal.II provides classes and functions to solve stationary problems with finite elements on one- to threedimensional domains. It also supports the typical way to solve time-dependent problems using time-stepping schemes, either with an implementation by hand or through the use of external libraries like SUNDIALS. A different approach is the usage of finite elements in time as well, which results in space-time finite element schemes. The library ideal.II (short for instationary deal.II) aims to extend deal.II to simplify implementations of the second approach.</description>

      <title>String Diagram of Optimal Transports</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a hierarchical framework of optimal transports (OTs), namely string diagrams of OTs. Our target problem is a safety problem on string diagrams of OTs, which requires proving or disproving that the minimum transportation cost in a given string diagram of OTs is above a given threshold. We reduce the safety problem on a string diagram of OTs to that on a monolithic OT by composing cost matrices. Our novel reduction exploits an algebraic structure of cost matrices equipped with two compositions: a sequential composition and a parallel composition. We provide a novel algorithm for the safety problem on string diagrams of OTs by our reduction, and we demonstrate its efficiency and performance advantage through experiments.</description>

      <title>Quantum random power method for ground state computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a quantum-classical hybrid random power method that approximates a ground state of a Hamiltonian. The quantum part of our method computes a fixed number of elements of a Hamiltonian-matrix polynomial via a quantum polynomial filtering technique. This technique can be implemented using Hamiltonian simulation or block encoding, suitable for early fault-tolerant and fault-tolerant regimes, respectively. The classical part of our method is a randomized iterative algorithm that takes as input the matrix elements computed from the quantum part and outputs an approximation of ground state of the Hamiltonian. For the per-iteration complexity of our method, the required classical time is independent of system size, and the quantum circuit complexity depends polylogarithmically on the system size. We prove that with probability one, our method converges to an approximation of a ground state of the Hamiltonian. We also show a lower bound of the fidelity of the approximate ground state with the true one. The lower bound depends linearly on the magnitude of noise occurring from quantum computation if it is smaller than a critical value. Several numerical experiments demonstrate that our method provides a good approximation of ground state in the presence of systematic and/or sampling noise.</description>

      <title>A Mean Field Ansatz for Zero-Shot Weight Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The pre-training cost of large language models (LLMs) is prohibitive. One cutting-edge approach to reduce the cost is zero-shot weight transfer, also known as model growth for some cases, which magically transfers the weights trained in a small model to a large model. However, there are still some theoretical mysteries behind the weight transfer. In this paper, inspired by prior applications of mean field theory to neural network dynamics, we introduce a mean field ansatz to provide a theoretical explanation for weight transfer. Specifically, we propose the row-column (RC) ansatz under the mean field point of view, which describes the measure structure of the weights in the neural network (NN) and admits a close measure dynamic. Thus, the weights of different sizes NN admit a common distribution under proper assumptions, and weight transfer methods can be viewed as sampling methods. We empirically validate the RC ansatz by exploring simple MLP examples and LLMs such as GPT-3 and Llama-3.1. We show the mean-field point of view is adequate under suitable assumptions which can provide theoretical support for zero-shot weight transfer.</description>

      <title>A fully explicit isogeometric collocation formulation for the dynamics of geometrically exact beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a fully explicit dynamic formulation for geometrically exact shear-deformable beams. The starting point of this work is an existing isogeometric collocation (IGA-C) formulation which is explicit in the strict sense of the time integration algorithm, but still requires a system matrix inversion due to the use of a consistent mass matrix. Moreover, in that work, the efficiency was also limited by an iterative solution scheme needed due to the presence of a nonlinear term in the time-discretized rotational balance equation. In the present paper, we address these limitations and propose a novel fully explicit formulation able to preserve high-order accuracy in space. This is done by extending a predictor--multicorrector approach, originally proposed for standard elastodynamics, to the case of the rotational dynamics of geometrically exact beams. The procedure relies on decoupling the Neumann boundary conditions and on a rearrangement and rescaling of the mass matrix. We demonstrate that an additional gain in terms of computational cost is obtained by properly removing the angular velocity-dependent nonlinear term in the rotational balance equation without any significant loss in terms of accuracy. The high-order spatial accuracy and the improved efficiency of the proposed formulation compared to the existing one are demonstrated through some numerical experiments covering different combinations of boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Unique continuation for an elliptic interface problem using unfitted isoparametric finite elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.05210v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study unique continuation over an interface using a stabilized unfitted finite element method tailored to the conditional stability of the problem. The interface is approximated using an isoparametric transformation of the background mesh and the corresponding geometrical error is included in our error analysis. To counter possible destabilizing effects caused by non-conformity of the discretization and cope with the interface conditions, we introduce adapted regularization terms. This allows to derive error estimates based on conditional stability. The necessity and effectiveness of the regularization is illustrated in numerical experiments. We also explore numerically the effect of the heterogeneity in the coefficients on the ability to reconstruct the solution outside the data domain. For Helmholtz equations we find that a jump in the flux impacts the stability of the problem significantly less than the size of the wavenumber.</description>

Abstract: We present a non-intrusive gradient and a non-intrusive BFGS algorithm for parameter estimation problems in non-stationary elasticity. To avoid multiple (and potentially expensive) solutions of the underlying partial differential equation (PDE), we approximate the PDE solver by a neural network within the algorithms. The network is trained offline for a given set of parameters. The algorithms are applied to an unsteady linear-elastic contact problem; their convergence and approximation properties are investigated numerically.</description>

Abstract: In an error estimation of finite element solutions to the Poisson equation, we usually impose the shape regularity assumption on the meshes to be used. In this paper, we show that even if the shape regularity condition is violated, the standard error estimation can be obtained if "bad" elements elements that violate the shape regularity or maximum angle condition are covered virtually by simplices that satisfy the minimum angle condition. A numerical experiment illustrates the theoretical result.</description>

      <title>A note on improvement by iteration for the approximate solutions of second kind Fredholm integral equations with Green's kernels</title>

Abstract: Consider a linear operator equation $x - Kx = f$, where $f$ is given and $K$ is a Fredholm integral operator with a Green's function type kernel defined on $C[0, 1]$. For $r \geq 0$, we employ the interpolatory projection at $2r + 1$ collocation points (not necessarily Gauss points) onto a space of piecewise polynomials of degree $\leq 2r$ with respect to a uniform partition of $[0, 1]$. Previous researchers have established that, in the case of smooth kernels with piecewise polynomials of even degree, iteration in the collocation method and its variants improves the order of convergence by projection methods. In this article, we demonstrate the improvement in order of convergence by modified collocation method when the kernel is of Green's function type.</description>

      <title>Research on Real-time Operational Status Evaluation Technology of Automobile Based on Information Data Fusion Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15033v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Automobiles have become the main means of transportation for human beings, and their failures in the process of operation are directly related to the life and property safety of drivers. Therefore, real-time operational status evaluation technology have become urgent problems in the current academic world. The premise of real-time operational status evaluation technology of automobiles is to obtain high-quality information data in real time, but the automobile operating environment is complex and changeable, resulting in the measured information data under the influence of multiple factors, such as equipment performance and signal interference. There is an unpredictable measurement error, which greatly affects the reliability of operational status evaluation systems. In this paper, on the basis of studying the structure and operation characteristics of automobiles, we design a method that can be used for real-time operational status evaluation of automobiles; through the study of fractional-order calculus theory, we establish a mathematical model of information data fusion based on fractional-order differential operators. By providing high-quality information data to automobile real-time operational status evaluation systems, real-time operational status evaluation technology for automobile faults can be realized. The feasibility and effectiveness of the method were verified through an experiment applying the technology in automobile real-time operational status evaluation systems. The research results are of great significance for promoting the development of the automobile industry and ensuring the safety of drivers' lives and property.</description>

      <title>Ensemble Kalman Methods: A Mean Field Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.11371v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ensemble Kalman methods are widely used for state estimation in the geophysical sciences. Their success stems from the fact that they take an underlying (possibly noisy) dynamical system as a black box to provide a systematic, derivative-free methodology for incorporating noisy, partial and possibly indirect observations to update estimates of the state; furthermore the ensemble approach allows for sensitivities and uncertainties to be calculated. The methodology was introduced in 1994 in the context of ocean state estimation. Soon thereafter it was adopted by the numerical weather prediction community and is now a key component of the best weather prediction systems worldwide. Furthermore the methodology is starting to be widely adopted for numerous problems in the geophysical sciences and is being developed as the basis for general purpose derivative-free inversion methods that show great promise. Despite this empirical success, analysis of the accuracy of ensemble Kalman methods, in terms of their capabilities as both state estimators and quantifiers of uncertainty, is lagging. The purpose of this paper is to provide a unifying mean field based framework for the derivation and analysis of ensemble Kalman methods. Both state estimation and parameter estimation problems (inverse problems) are considered, and formulations in both discrete and continuous time are employed. For state estimation problems, both the control and filtering approaches are considered; analogously for parameter estimation problems, the optimization and Bayesian perspectives are both studied. The mean field perspective provides an elegant framework, suitable for analysis; furthermore, a variety of methods used in practice can be derived from mean field systems by using interacting particle system approximations. The approach taken also unifies a wide-ranging literature in the field and suggests open problems.</description>

      <title>BiLO: Bilevel Local Operator Learning for PDE inverse problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17789v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new neural network based method for solving inverse problems for partial differential equations (PDEs) by formulating the PDE inverse problem as a bilevel optimization problem. At the upper level, we minimize the data loss with respect to the PDE parameters. At the lower level, we train a neural network to locally approximate the PDE solution operator in the neighborhood of a given set of PDE parameters, which enables an accurate approximation of the descent direction for the upper level optimization problem. The lower level loss function includes the L2 norms of both the residual and its derivative with respect to the PDE parameters. We apply gradient descent simultaneously on both the upper and lower level optimization problems, leading to an effective and fast algorithm. The method, which we refer to as BiLO (Bilevel Local Operator learning), is also able to efficiently infer unknown functions in the PDEs through the introduction of an auxiliary variable. Through extensive experiments over multiple PDE systems, we demonstrate that our method enforces strong PDE constraints, is robust to sparse and noisy data, and eliminates the need to balance the residual and the data loss, which is inherent to the soft PDE constraints in many existing methods.</description>

Abstract: Activation functions are non-linearities in neural networks that allow them to learn complex mapping between inputs and outputs. Typical choices for activation functions are ReLU, Tanh, Sigmoid etc., where the choice generally depends on the application domain. In this work, we propose a framework/strategy that unifies several works on activation functions and theoretically explains the performance benefits of these works. We also propose novel techniques that originate from the framework and allow us to obtain ``extensions'' (i.e. special generalizations of a given neural network) of neural networks through operations on activation functions. We theoretically and empirically show that ``extensions'' of neural networks have performance benefits compared to vanilla neural networks with insignificant space and time complexity costs on standard test functions. We also show the benefits of neural network ``extensions'' in the time-series domain on real-world datasets.</description>
