      <title>A Liouville-type theorem for Finslerian exponentially harmonic functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we investigate the exponentially harmonic equation on noncompact forward complete Finsler metric measure spaces. We demonstrate that this Finslerian equation represents a critical point of an exponential energy functional. Furthermore, we establish that any bounded solution to this equation is constant, provided that the mixed weighted Ricci curvature is nonnegative and certain additional non-Riemannian tensors are bounded.</description>

      <title>The paint group Tits Satake theory of hyperbolic symmetric spaces: the distance function, paint invariants and discrete subgroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present paper, which is partially a review, but also contains several completely new results, aims at presenting, in a unified mathematical framework, a complex and articulated lore regarding non-compact symmetric spaces, with negative curvature, whose isometry group is a non-compact, real simple Lie group. All such manifolds are Riemannian normal manifolds, according to Alekseevsky's definition, in the sense that they are metrically equivalent to a solvable Lie group manifold. This identification provides a vision in which, on one side one can derive quite explicit and challenging formulae for the unique distance function between points of the manifold, on the other one, one can organize the entire set of the available manifolds in universality classes distinguished by their common Tits Satake submanifold and, correspondingly, by their non-compact rank. The members of the class are distinguished by their different Paint Groups, the latter notion having been introduced by two of the present authors in an earlier collaboration. In relation to the construction of neural networks, these mathematical structures offer unique possibilities of replacing ad hoc activation functions with the naturally defined non-linear operations that relate Lie algebras to Lie Groups and vice-versa. The Paint Group invariants offer new tokens both to construct algorithms and inspect (hopefully to control) their working. A conspicuous part of the paper is devoted to the study and systematic construction of parabolic/elliptic discrete subgroups of the Lie groups SO(r,r+q), in view of discretization and/or tessellations of the space to which data are to be mapped. Furthermore, it is shown how the ingredients of Special K\"ahler Geometry and the c-map, well known in the supergravity literature, provide a unified classification scheme of the relevant Tits Satake universality classes with non-compact rank r&lt;5.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic conformal change of conic pseudo-Finsler surfaces, II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is a continuation of our investigation of the anisotropic conformal change of a conic pseudo-Finsler surface $(M,F)$, namely, the change $\overline{F}(x,y)=e^{\phi(x,y)}F(x,y)$ \cite{first paper}. We obtain the relationship between some important geometric objects of $F $ and their corresponding objects of $\overline{F}$, such as Berwald, Landsberg and Douglas tensors, as well as the T-tensor. In contrast to isotropic conformal transformation, under an anisotropic conformal transformation, we find out the necessary and sufficient conditions for a Riemannian surface to be anisotropically conformal transformed to Berwald or Landsberg or Douglas surfaces. Consequently, we determine under what condition the geodesic spray of a two-dimensional pseudo-Berwald metric $\overline{F}$ is Riemann metrizable by a two-dimensional pseudo-Riemannian metric $F$. We show an example of a conformal transformation of a Riemannian metric $F$ that is not geodesically equivalent to a Riemannian metric but is instead Berwaldian. Also, we determine the necessary and sufficient conditions for $F $ to be anisotropically conformally flat (i.e., $\overline{F}$ is Minkowskian). Moreover, we identify the required conditions for preserving the $T$-condition under an anisotropic conformal change. Finally, we establish the necessary conditions for a Riemannian metric to be anisotropically conformal to a Douglas metric.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove that complete noncompact constant mean curvature hypersurfaces in $\mathbb{R}^6$ with finite index must be minimal. This provides a positive answer to do Carmo's question in dimension $6$. The proof strategy is also applicable to $\mathbb{R}^4$ and $\mathbb{R}^5$, thereby providing alternative proofs for those previously resolved cases.</description>

      <title>Remarks on the Gluing Theorems for Compact Special Lagrangian Submanifolds with Isolated Conical Singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We make two improvements upon Joyce's gluing theorems of for compact special Lagrangian submanifolds with isolated conical singularities. Firstly, we get rid of a few technical hypotheses of them. Secondly, we replace another hypothesis by a weaker one and prove that the latter is a necessary condition for the gluing process to be possible.</description>

      <title>Isoperimetric and Michael-Simon inequalities on manifolds with asymptotically nonnegative curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the validity of the isoperimetric inequality (or equivalently, an $L^1$ Euclidean-type Sobolev inequality) on manifolds with asymptotically non-negative sectional curvature. Unlike previous results in the literature, our approach does not require the negative part of the curvature to be globally small. Furthermore, we derive a Michael-Simon inequality on manifolds whose curvature is non-negative outside a compact set.
  The proofs employ the ABP method for isoperimetry, initially introduced by Cabr\'e in the Euclidean setting and subsequently extended and skillfully adapted by Brendle to the challenging context of non-negatively curved manifolds. Notably, we show that this technique can be localized to appropriate regions of the manifold. Additional key elements of the argument include the geometric structure at infinity of asymptotically non-negatively curved manifolds, their spectral properties - which ensure the non-negativity of a Bakry-\'Emery Ricci tensor on a conformal deformation of each end - and a result that deduces the validity of the isoperimetric inequality on the entire manifold, provided it holds outside a compact set.</description>

      <title>Dirac Operators on Orbifold Resolutions: Uniform Elliptic Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dirac operators on Riemannian spaces play a central role in various branches of mathematics, encoding rich geometric and topological data. They appear as deformation operators in moduli problems, including those associated with special holonomy metrics, gauge theory instantons, and calibrated submanifolds. This paper investigates the behaviour of families of Dirac operators as the underlying Riemannian spaces degenerate to a Riemannian orbifold in the so called adiabatic limit. Specifically, we focus on relating the kernels and cokernels of the family of Dirac operators to adiabatic data and establish uniform bounds on their right inverse. These results provide a crucial analytic foundation for gluing problems on orbifold resolutions, without relying on the intricate iterated edge calculus developed by Mazzeo, Melrose, Schulze and others. This work paves the way for forthcoming studies, where these techniques will be used to address open problems in special holonomy geometry, for example the construction of compact $\mathrm{G}_2$- and $\mathrm{Spin}(7)$-manifolds, gauge theory, and calibrated geometry. The methods developed here have broader implications for the study of singular Riemannian spaces and their analytic properties.</description>

      <title>Higher Riemann-Hilbert correspondence for foliations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores foliated differential graded algebras (dga) and their role in extending fundamental theorems of differential geometry to foliations. We establish an $A_{\infty}$ de Rham theorem for foliations, demonstrating that the classical quasi-isomorphism between singular cochains and de Rham forms lifts to an $A_{\infty}$ quasi-isomorphism in the foliated setting. Furthermore, we investigate the Riemann-Hilbert correspondence for foliations, building upon the established higher Riemann-Hilbert correspondence for manifolds. By constructing an integration functor, we prove a higher Riemann-Hilbert correspondence for foliations, revealing an equivalence between $\infty$-representations of $L_{\infty}$-algebroids and $\infty$-representations of Lie $\infty$-groupoids within the context of foliations. This work generalizes the classical Riemann-Hilbert correspondence to foliations, providing a deeper understanding of the relationship between representations of Lie algebroids and Lie groupoids in this framework.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In their seminal 1981 article, Sacks-Uhlenbeck famously proved the existence of non-trivial harmonic 2-spheres in every closed Riemannian manifold with non-zero second homotopy group. Their arguments heavily rely on PDE techniques. The purpose of the present paper is to develop a conceptually simple metric approach to the existence of harmonic spheres. This allows us to generalize the Sacks-Uhlenbeck result to a large class of compact metric spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the first part of the paper, we study conformal groups that act properly discontinuously and cocompactly on simply connected, non-flat homogeneous plane waves. We show that proper cocompact similarity actions that are not isometric can occur, in contrast to the behavior of Riemannian and Lorentzian affine similarity actions. In the second part, we consider the Lorentzian conformal Lichnerowicz conjecture, which states that if the conformal group of a compact Lorentzian manifold acts without preserving any metric in the conformal class, then the manifold must be conformally flat. We prove the conjecture in a locally homogeneous setting.</description>

Abstract: We consider isotropic and Lagrangian embeddings of coadjoint orbits of compact Lie groups into products of coadjoint orbits. After reviewing the known facts in the case of $\mathrm{SU}(n)$ we initiate a similar study for $\mathrm{SO}$ and $\mathrm{Sp}$ cases. In the second part we apply this to the study of dynamical systems with $\mathrm{SU}(n)$ symmetry, proving equivalence between systems of two types: those describing magnetic geodesic flow on flag manifolds and classical `spin chains' of a special type.</description>

      <title>Tangentially Aligned Integrated Gradients for User-Friendly Explanations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrated gradients is prevalent within machine learning to address the black-box problem of neural networks. The explanations given by integrated gradients depend on a choice of base-point. The choice of base-point is not a priori obvious and can lead to drastically different explanations. There is a longstanding hypothesis that data lies on a low dimensional Riemannian manifold. The quality of explanations on a manifold can be measured by the extent to which an explanation for a point lies in its tangent space. In this work, we propose that the base-point should be chosen such that it maximises the tangential alignment of the explanation. We formalise the notion of tangential alignment and provide theoretical conditions under which a base-point choice will provide explanations lying in the tangent space. We demonstrate how to approximate the optimal base-point on several well-known image classification datasets. Furthermore, we compare the optimal base-point choice with common base-points and three gradient explainability models.</description>

      <title>Towards a noncommutative theory of Cowen-Douglas class of noncommuting operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The classical Cowen-Douglas class of (commuting tuples of) operators possessing an open set of (joint) eigenvalues of finite constant multiplicity was introduced by Cowen and Douglas, generalizing the backward shifts. Their unitary equivalence classes are determined by the equivalence classes of certain hermitian holomorphic vector bundles associated with them on this set.
  This article develops a free noncommutative analogue of Cowen-Douglas theory to explore the notion of vector bundles in the setting of free noncommutative function theory. We define the noncommutative Cowen-Douglas class using matricial joint eigenvalues, as envisioned by Taylor, and show via the Taylor-Taylor series that the associated joint eigenspaces naturally form such a vector bundle, what we call a noncommutative hermitian holomorphic vector bundle.
  A key result is that the unitary equivalence class of a tuple in this class is completely determined by the equivalence class of its associated noncommutative vector bundle. This work lays the groundwork of the noncommutative hermitian geometry, which investigates noncommutative analogues of complex manifolds, vector bundles, and hermitian metrics by drawing on ideas from both complex hermitian geometry and operator theory.
  We also examine noncommutative reproducing kernel Hilbert space models and introduce the noncommutative Gleason problem, showing that elements of the noncommutative Cowen-Douglas class are essentially (up to unitary equivalence) adjoints of left multiplication operators by noncommuting independent variables in a noncommutative reproducing kernel Hilbert space.</description>

      <title>Minimal Surface Equation and Bernstein Property on RCD spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02406v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that if $(X,d,m)$ is an RCD(K,N) space and $u \in W^{1,1}_{loc}(X)$ is a solution of the minimal surface equation, then $u$ is harmonic on its graph (which has a natural metric measure space structure). If K=0 this allows to obtain an Harnack inequality for $u$, which in turn implies the Bernstein property, meaning that any positive solution to the minimal surface equation must be constant. As an application, we obtain oscillation estimates and a Bernstein Theorem for minimal graphs in products $M \times \mathbb{R}$, where $M$ is a smooth manifold (possibly weighted and with boundary) with non-negative Ricci curvature</description>

      <title>CMC hypersurface with finite index in hyperbolic space $\mathbb{H}^4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10276v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove that there are no complete noncompact constant mean curvature hypersurfaces with the mean curvature $H&gt;1$ and finite index satisfying universal subexponential end growth in hyperbolic space $\mathbb{H}^4$. A more general nonexistence result can be proved in a $4$-dimensional Riemannian manifold with certain curvature conditions. We also show that $4$-manifold with $\operatorname{Ric}&gt;1$ does not contain any complete noncompact stable minimal hypersurface with universal subexponential end growth. The proof relies on the harmonic function theory developed by Li-Tam-Wang and the $\mu$-bubble initially introduced by Gromov and further developed by Chodosh-Li-Stryker in the context of stable minimal hypersurfaces.</description>

      <title>New spectral Bishop-Gromov and Bonnet-Myers theorems and applications to isoperimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08918v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show a sharp and rigid spectral generalization of the classical Bishop--Gromov volume comparison theorem: if a closed Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$ of dimension $n\geq3$ satisfies $$ \lambda_1\left(-\frac{n-1}{n-2}\Delta+\mathrm{Ric}\right)\geq n-1, $$ then $\operatorname{vol}(M)\leq\operatorname{vol}(\mathbb S^{n})$, and $\pi_1(M)$ is finite. The constant $\frac{n-1}{n-2}$ cannot be improved, and if $\mathrm{vol}(M)=\mathrm{vol}(\mathbb S^n)$ holds, then $M\cong \mathbb S^{n}$. A sharp generalization of the Bonnet--Myers theorem is also shown under the same spectral condition.
  The proofs involve the use of a new unequally weighted isoperimetric problem, and unequally warped $\mu$-bubbles. As an application, in dimensions $3\leq n\leq 5$, we infer sharp results on the isoperimetric structure at infinity of complete manifolds with nonnegative Ricci curvature and uniformly positive spectral biRicci curvature.
  Furthermore, the main result of this paper is applied in Mazet's recent solution of the stable Bernstein problem in $\mathbb R^6$.</description>

      <title>Conformal metrics with finite total Q-curvature revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09872v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a conformal metric with finite total Q-curvature, we show that the assumptions on scalar curvature sensitively control the Q-curvature integral. Meanwhile, we introduce a conformal mass on such manifolds to provide a sufficient and necessary condition for normal metric without metric completeness assumption. As applications, we derive volume comparison theorems and a positive mass type theorem on such manifolds.</description>

Abstract: For $s\in (0,1)$ we introduce a notion of fractional $s$-mass on $(n-2)$-dimensional closed, orientable surfaces in $\R^n$. Moreover, we prove its $\Gamma$-convergence, with respect to the flat topology, and pointwise convergence to the $(n-2)$-dimensional area.</description>

      <title>The Geometry of Generalised Spin$^r$ Spinors on Projective Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18337v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we adapt the characterisation of the spin representation via exterior forms to the generalised spin$^r$ context. We find new invariant spin$^r$ spinors on the projective spaces $\mathbb{CP}^n$, $\mathbb{HP}^n$, and the Cayley plane $\mathbb{OP}^2$ for all their homogeneous realisations. Specifically, for each of these realisations, we provide a complete description of the space of invariant spin$^r$ spinors for the minimum value of $r$ for which this space is non-zero. Additionally, we demonstrate some geometric implications of the existence of special spin$^r$ spinors on these spaces.</description>

      <title>Coarse extrinsic curvature of Riemannian submanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08031v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel concept of coarse extrinsic curvature for Riemannian submanifolds, inspired by Ollivier's notion of coarse Ricci curvature. This curvature is derived from the Wasserstein 1-distance between probability measures supported in the tubular neighborhood of a submanifold, providing new insights into the extrinsic curvature of isometrically embedded manifolds in Euclidean spaces. The framework also offers a method to approximate the mean curvature from statistical data, such as point clouds generated by a Poisson point process. This approach has potential applications in manifold learning and the study of metric embeddings, enabling the inference of geometric information from empirical data.</description>

      <title>Counting Rational Curves and Standard Complex Structures on HyperK\"ahler ALE 4-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18761v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: All hyperK\"ahler ALE 4-manifolds with a given non-trivial finite group $\Gamma$ in $SU(2)$ at infinity are parameterized by an open dense subset of a real linear space of dimension $3$rank$\Phi$. Here, $\Phi$ denotes the root system associated with $\Gamma$ via the McKay correspondence. Such manifolds are diffeomorphic to the minimal resolution of a Kleinian singularity. By using the period map of the twistor space, we specify those points in the parameter space at which the hyperK\"ahlerian family of complex structures includes the complex structure of the minimal resolution. Furthermore, we count the rational curves lying on each hyperK\"ahler ALE 4-manifold. For each point in the parameter space, we can assign an integer equals to the number of complex structures which contains rational curves. We show this integer function on the parameter space is lower semi-continuous. In the end, based on known results, we prove that the twistor space of any hyperK\"ahler ALE cannot be K\"ahlerian. In particular, we strengthen some results of Kronheimer (J. Differential Geom., 29(3):665--683, 1989) and provide examples of non-compact and non-K\"ahlerian twistor spaces.</description>

      <title>Vanishing theorems for Hodge numbers and the Calabi curvature operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06870v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is shown that a compact $n$-dimensional K\"ahler manifold with $\frac{n}{2}$-positive Calabi curvature operator has the rational cohomology of complex projective space. For even $n,$ this is sharp in the sense that the complex quadric with its symmetric metric has $\frac{n}{2}$-nonnegative Calabi curvature operator, yet $b_n =2.$ Furthermore, the compact K\"ahler manifolds with $\frac{n}{2}$-nonnegative Calabi curvature operator are completely classified. In addition, the previously known results for the K\"ahler curvature operator are improved when the metric is K\"ahler-Einstein.</description>

      <title>Prescribing almost constant curvatures on manifolds with boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18776v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a boundary case of the classical prescribed curvature problem. We focus on prescribing the scalar curvature function K and the boundary mean curvature H on the standard ball. Our analysis extendes previous studies by considering the scenario where the curvatures K and H are close to constants. Using a perturbative approach and leveraging the ansatz introduced by Han and Li, we establish new existence results for the conformal metric when the prescribed curvatures are near constants</description>

      <title>Compactness of the $Q$-curvature problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14237v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a complete resolution to the question of the $C^4$-compactness for the solution set of the constant $Q$-curvature problem on a smooth closed Riemannian manifold of dimension $5 \leq n \leq 24$. For dimensions $n\geq 25$, an example of an $L^{\infty}$-unbounded sequence of solutions for $n \geq 25$ has been known for over a decade (Wei-Zhao). On the other hand, Li-Xiong established compactness in dimensions $5\leq n \leq 9$ (under some conditions). Our principal observation is that the linearized equation associated with the $Q$-curvature problem can be transformed into an overdetermined linear system, which admits a nontrivial solution due to an unexpected algebraic structure of the Paneitz operator. This key insight plays a crucial role in extending the compactness result to higher dimensions.</description>
