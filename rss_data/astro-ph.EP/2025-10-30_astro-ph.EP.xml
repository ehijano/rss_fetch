      <title>Non-linear spiral waves in accretion discs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a simple, accurate, non-linear, global equation governing spiral density waves in thin, non-self-gravitating, inviscid accretion discs. These discs may have any slowly varying surface density or temperature profile. For specific 'self-similar' disc profiles, solutions to our equation match (novel) smooth non-linear exact spiral solutions derived via a separate method, which highlight that non-linear spiral waves need not shock. Indeed, at low amplitudes, we find that dispersion can overcome wave steepening, and may prevent the inner spiral wakes excited by low mass planets (below roughly 1% of a thermal mass) embedded in protoplanetary discs from shocking. At high amplitudes, we find a simple universal description of non-linear spiral waves with shocks, as well as caps on the possible amplitude and wave action flux of non-linear spirals both with and without shocks, depending on how many arms they have. We further find that highly non-linear spirals are far more loosely wound than their linear counterparts. These developments shed light on why two-armed spirals are prevalent across a range of astrophysical systems which don't necessarily possess an intrinsic twofold symmetry, and why they appear surprisingly loosely wound in observations. These results are supported by very high-resolution numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>From Underground Oceans to Continents: A Glimpse into the Water Inventory on Rocky Planets using Host Star Abundances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The amount of surface water is thought to be critical for a planet's climate stability and thus habitability. However, the probability that a rocky planet may exhibit surface water at any point its evolution is dependent on multiple factors, such as the initial water mass, geochemical evolution, and interior composition. To date, studies have examined the influence of interior composition on the water inventory of the planet or how surface oceans may be impacted by planet topography individually. Here, we provide the first exploration on the impact of interior composition, topography, and planet radius on the water inventory of rocky planets using a sample of 689 rocky planets with spectroscopically derived stellar abundances from APOGEE and GALAH. We find that the oxidation state of the mantle (FeO content) significantly impacts the mantle water storage capacity and potential for surface flooding. For an FeO ~11 wt%, the water storage capacity of a 1 M$_\oplus$ is 2 times that of Earth, indicating that the oxidation state may reduce the amount of surface water. We quantify the impact of topography on seafloor pressures, showing that flat topographies are more likely to be flooded for all planet compositions and radii. We also find that Mars-like topographies are more likely to have seafloor pressures that may form high-pressure ice, reducing seafloor weathering. Thus, for the first time, we show that the composition and topography of the mantle influence the water inventory of rocky planets.</description>

      <title>The Fate of Hydrogen and Helium: From Planetary Embryos to Earth- and Neptune-like Worlds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrogen, helium, silicates, and iron are key building blocks of rocky and gas-rich planets, yet their chemical interactions remain poorly constrained. Using first-principles molecular dynamics and thermodynamic integration, we quantify hydrogen and helium partitioning between molten silicate mantles and metallic cores for Earth-to-Neptune-mass planets. Hydrogen becomes strongly siderophilic above $\sim$25 GPa but weakens beyond $\sim$200 GPa, whereas helium remains lithophilic yet increasingly soluble in metal with pressure. Incorporating these trends into coupled structure-chemistry models suggests that majority of hydrogen and helium reside in planetary interiors, not atmospheres, with abundances strongly depending on planet mass. Such volatile exchange may influence the redox states of secondary atmospheres, longevity of primordial envelopes, predicted CHNOPS abundances, and emergence of helium-enriched atmospheres, while He 1083 nm and H Lyman-$\alpha$ lines provide potential probes of atmosphere-interior exchange. These findings link atomic-scale interactions to planetary-scale observables, providing new constraints on the origins of Earth-to-Neptune-sized worlds.</description>

      <title>Micro-Doppler signatures and object characterisation of space debris with radio telescopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a novel multi-static radar technique for space debris characterisation using micro-Doppler signatures, developed within the Southern Hemisphere Asteroid Radar Programme (SHARP). The method employs C-band continuous waveforms transmitted from NASA's Deep Space Network (DSN) Canberra station, with reflected signals captured by distributed ground-based telescopes converted from astronomical to radar operations. From March 2021 to September 2025, we conducted systematic observations of 20 distinct rocket bodies at various orbital altitudes and object sizes. Micro-Doppler analysis of axial rotation signatures enabled extraction of rotation periods, object dimensions, surface characteristics, and mass distribution parameters with enhanced accuracy in orbital refinement. We implemented advanced imaging reconstruction techniques to generate morphology data of the targets. Results demonstrate successful determination of debris rotation periods with second-level precision, dimensional estimates within 10\% accuracy compared to known specifications, and improved orbital parameter determination reducing position uncertainties by up to 30\%. The technique provides a cost-effective approach for space situational awareness, leveraging existing astronomical infrastructure to enhance Australia's sovereign capabilities in tracking both near-Earth objects and space debris. This multi-static configuration offers significant advantages over traditional monostatic radar systems for geostationary and highly elliptical orbit debris monitoring.</description>

      <title>Sculpting protoplanetary discs -- modelling circumbinary cavities at observable scales with radiation hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations of circumbinary discs reveal inner cavities, with their shape and size varying strongly between different systems. The structure of the cavity is determined by the complex interplay between spirals induced by tidal forcing from the binary and the viscous and radiative damping of the spirals at the cavity edge. To fully understand what determines the properties of observed cavities, it is therefore necessary to capture the effect of radiative processes in modelling. To this end, we run 27 simulations of circumbinary discs in 2D using the PLUTO code. These simulations include various size scales, binary eccentricities and thermodynamic models. We find that the diverse cavity shapes are a natural outcome of the radially-varying cooling timescale, as different radiative processes mediate cooling at different disc size regimes. For binaries with separation of a few au, where the cooling timescale is comparable to the orbital timescale at the cavity edge, we recover much more circular cavities than for quickly- or slowly-cooling discs. Our results show that the cavity structure around several binary systems such as Cs Cha and GG Tau can be explained with one physical model, and highlight the importance of radiative cooling in modelling the dynamical evolution of circumbinary discs.</description>

      <title>Rapid Brightening of 3I/ATLAS Ahead of Perihelion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has been approaching its 2025 October 29 perihelion while opposite the Sun from Earth, hindering ground-based optical observations over the preceding month. However, this geometry placed the comet within the fields of view of several space-based solar coronagraphs and heliospheric imagers, enabling its continued observation during its final approach toward perihelion. We report photometry from STEREO-A's SECCHI HI1 and COR2, SOHO's LASCO C3, and GOES-19's CCOR-1 instruments in 2025 September--October, which show a rapid rise in the comet's brightness scaling with heliocentric distance r as r^(-7.5+/-1.0). CCOR-1 also resolves the comet as an extended source with an apparent coma ~4' in diameter. Furthermore, LASCO color photometry shows the comet to be distinctly bluer than the Sun, consistent with gas emission contributing a substantial fraction of the visible brightness near perihelion.</description>

      <title>Ringed vs. Ringless Worlds: How Poynting-Robertson Drag Shapes Rings Across the Solar System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planetary rings are not only ubiquitous around the giant planets in the outer Solar System, but have also been discovered around several small distant bodies. In contrast, no rings have been observed around any inner Solar System objects. To constrain the dynamical origin of this ringed-versus-ringless dichotomy, we employ a numerically cross-checked analytical model of gigayear-scale Poynting-Robertson (PR) drag due to the solar flux acting on an isolated particle, expressed as a function of the host body's heliocentric distance \(\,a_{\mathrm{pla}}\) and the particle radius \(\,r_{\mathrm{par}}\). Here we show that, in the absence of additional perturbations, PR drag alone can explain the observed ring architecture of the Solar System: outer planets and Centaurs/TNOs are able to retain rings for the age of the Solar System, whereas any rings around the inner planets are removed on much shorter timescales. Because the PR-drag lifetime scales steeply with heliocentric distance \(\bigl(\tau_{\mathrm{decay}}\propto a_{\mathrm{pla}}^{2} \,r_{\mathrm{par}}\bigr)\), we predict that forthcoming surveys will reveal an ever-growing population of ring-bearing bodies in the distant Solar System.</description>

      <title>BEBOP VIII. SOPHIE radial velocities reveal an eccentric, circumbinary brown dwarf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Circumbinary configurations offer a test of planet formation in an altered environment, where the inner binary has perturbed a protoplanetary disc. Comparisons of the physical and orbital parameters between the circumbinary planet population and the population of exoplanets orbiting single stars will reveal how these disc perturbations affect the assembly of planets. Circumbinary exoplanets detected thus far typically have masses $&lt; 3 \,\rm M_{jup}$ raising the question of whether high-mass circumbinary planets are possible, and also whether population features such as the brown dwarf desert would appear in circumbinary configurations like for single star systems. Here, we report observations taken with the SOPHIE high-resolution spectrograph. These observations reveal an $m_{\rm b}\,\sin i_{\rm b} = 20.9 \,\rm M_{jup}$ outer companion, on an eccentric ($e = 0.43$), $1800\,\rm d$ orbit, which we call BEBOP-4 (AB) b. Using dynamical arguments we constrain the true mass $m_{\rm b}&lt; 26.3 \,\rm M_{jup}$. The inner binary's two eclipsing stellar components have masses $M_{\rm A} = 1.51\,\rm M_\odot$, and $M_{\rm B} = 0.46\,\rm M_\odot$. Their orbital period is $72\,\rm d$, and their eccentricity is $0.27$. This system contains the longest period binary surveyed by the BEBOP project. BEBOP-4b is expected to be detectable using Gaia DR4 single epoch astrometric measurements. Despite a large period ratio of $\sim 25:1$, the substantial eccentricities of both orbits mean that the outer orbit is on the edge of orbital stability, and located in between two destabilising secular resonances. Should the outer companion survive, the BEBOP-4 system appears like a precursor to several post-common envelope binaries exhibiting eclipse timing variations where very massive circumbinary companions have been proposed.</description>

      <title>The CARMENES search for exoplanets around M dwarfs : Understanding the wavelength dependence of radial velocity measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Current exoplanet surveys are focused on detecting small exoplanets orbiting in the liquid-water habitable zones of their host stars. Despite the recent significant advancements in instrumental developments, the current limitation in detecting these exoplanets is the intrinsic variability of the host star itself. Aims. Our aim is to use the full CARMENES guaranteed time observations (GTO) data set spanning more than 8 years of observations of over 350 stars to investigate the wavelength dependence of high-precision radial velocities (RV), as stellar activity features should exhibit a wavelength dependence while the RV variation due to an orbiting planet will be wavelength independent. Methods. We use the chromatic index (CRX) to quantify the slope of the measured RVs as a function of logarithmic wavelength. We investigate the dependence of the CRX in the full CARMENES GTO sample on 24 stellar activity indices in the visible and near-infrared channels of the CARMENES spectrograph and each star's stellar parameters. We also present an updated convective turnover time scaling for the calculation of the stellar Rossby number for M dwarfs. Results. Our results show that approximately 17\% of GTO stars show a strong or a moderate correlation between CRX and RV. We can improve the measured RVs by a factor of up to nearly 4 in rms by subtracting the RV predicted by the CRX-RV correlation from the measured RVs. Mid M dwarfs with moderate rotational velocities, moderate CRX-gradients and quasi-stable activity features have the best rms improvement factors. Conclusions. We conclude that the CRX is a powerful diagnostic in mitigation of stellar activity and the search for low mass rocky planets.</description>

      <title>Engulfment of Eccentric Planets by Giant Stars: Hydrodynamics and Light Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations suggest that planetary engulfment by a giant star may produce radiation that resembles subluminous red novae. We present three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of the interaction between an eccentric $5 \,M_J$ giant planet and its $1\,M_\odot$ red-giant host star. The planet's pericenter is initially $60\%$ of the stellar radius and is fully engulfed after tens of orbits. Once inside the stellar envelope, the planet generates pressure disturbances that steepen into shocks, ejecting material from the envelope. We use post-processing to calculate the light curves produced by planetary engulfment. We find that the hot stellar ejecta enhances the stellar luminosity by several orders of magnitude. A prolonged hydrogen recombination plateau appears when the ejecta cools to about $10^4\,\rm{K}$. The late-time rapid dimming of the light curve follows dust formation, which obscures the radiation. For planets with lower eccentricity, the orbital decay proceeds more slowly, although the observable properties remain similar.</description>

      <title>Tidal dissipation and spin-orbit alignment due to the precessional instability in convection zones in rotating giant planets and stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tidal dissipation in star-planet systems occurs through various mechanisms, including the precessional instability. This is an instability of laminar flows (``Poincar\'{e} flows") forced by axial precession of a rotating, oblate, spin-orbit misaligned fluid planet or star, which excites inertial waves in convective regions if the dimensionless precession rate (``Poincar\'{e} number" $\mathrm{Po}$) is sufficiently large. We constrain the contribution of the precessional instability to tidal dissipation and heat transport, using Cartesian hydrodynamical simulations in a small patch of a planet, and study its interaction with turbulent convection, modelled as rotating Rayleigh-B\'{e}nard convection. The precessional instability without convection results in laminar flow at low values and turbulent flow at sufficiently high values of $\mathrm{Po}$. The associated tidal dissipation rate scales as $\mathrm{Po}^2$ and $\mathrm{Po}^3$ in each regime, respectively. With convection, the Poincar\'e number at which turbulent flow is achieved shifts to lower values for stronger convective driving. Convective motions also act on large-scale tidal flows like an effective viscosity, resulting in continuous tidal dissipation (scaling as $\mathrm{Po}^2$), which obfuscates or suppresses tidal dissipation due to precessional instability. The effective viscosities obtained agree with scaling laws previously derived using (rotating) mixing-length theory. By evaluating our scaling laws using interior models of Hot Jupiters, we find that the precessional instability is significantly more efficient than the effective viscosity of convection. The former drives alignment in 1 Gyr for a Jupiter-like planet orbiting within 23 days. Linearly excited inertial waves can be even more effective for wider orbits, aligning spins for orbits within 53-142 days.</description>

      <title>Engulfment of a hot Jupiter as a possible origin of the rapid spin and internal spin misalignment of the planet-hosting red giant Kepler-56</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recent asteroseismic analysis suggests that Kepler-56 -- a planet-hosting red giant -- exhibits a unique spin structure: (1) the spin axes of the core and envelope are misaligned; and (2) the envelope rotates approximately an order of magnitude faster than typical red giants. In this paper, we investigate a feasible scenario to reproduce this spin structure by estimating the amount of the angular momentum (AM) supply from the planets through the simplified calculation of the time evolution of AM. As a result, unless the tidal efficiency is extremely high, we show that the tidal interactions between the known close-in planets (Kepler-56 b and c) are insufficient to supply the AM required to accelerate Kepler-56 from the spin rate observed in typical red giants. We also show that the engulfment of a hot Jupiter can be expected to provide sufficient AM supply for the acceleration ant that the mass and orbit of the engulfed hot Jupiter are constrained by a mass of 0.5-2 Jupiter masses and an orbital period of 1-6 days. On the other hand, if Kepler 56 was already rapidly spinning before entering the RG stage and requires no acceleration, the obliquity damping by the known close-in planets can reproduce the spin structure of Kepler-56. Even in such cases, planetary engulfment during the MS stage might be involved in achieving rapid spin before the tidal alignment. These discussions demonstrate the importance of Kepler-56 as a candidate for planetary engulfment that may leave traces of its spin structure.</description>

Abstract: The Australasian strewn field covers more than 15% of Earth's surface, consisting of tektites and microtektites. Australasian tektites from Southeast Asia and Australia, as well as microtektites recovered from deep sea sediments and Antarctica, are established to be derived from upper continental crust sediments. An expedition to retrieve remnants of bolide CNEOS 2014 January 8 (IM1), held in the Pacific Ocean, was in proximity to the known extent of the Australasian strewn field, and yielded "BeLaU"-spherules, whose compositions did not match most well-studied solar system material. We therefore report precise and comprehensive elemental data for Australasian tektites to compare their elemental abundances to those of microtektites from deep sea sediments, and BeLaU. Our findings corroborate previous studies that Australasian tektites and microtektites closely resemble the elemental abundance patterns of the upper continental crust. Meanwhile, the elemental patterns of the BeLaU-spherules are distinct from the Australasian tektite/microtektite compositions.</description>

Abstract: C-type asteroids, such as asteroid (162173) Ryugu, may have played a key role in delivering light elements to early Earth. Nitrogen (N)-bearing molecules have been chemically identified in some Ryugu grains, and based on the faint 3.06 um absorption band observed by the hyperspectral microscope MicrOmega, NH-bearing compounds appear to be globally distributed. However, the chemical forms of these NH-bearing compounds - whether organic molecules, ammonium (NH4+) salts, NH4+- or NH-organic-bearing phyllosilicates, or other forms - remain to be clarified. We report the characterization of two Ryugu particles (C0050 and C0052) using infrared spectroscopy at millimeter, micrometer, and nanometer scales, combined with NanoSIMS to constrain the nature and origin of NH-bearing components. Ryugu's C0052 particle contains rare (~1 vol.%) micrometer-sized NH-rich organic compounds with peaks at 1660 cm-1 (C=O stretching, amide I) and 1550 cm-1 (N-H bending, amide II), indicative of amides, absent in C0050. N isotopic analysis shows these amides are depleted in 15N (d15N ~ -200 permil), confirming their indigenous origin. The amides may have formed by hydrothermal alteration of carboxylic acids and amines on Ryugu's parent body or by irradiation of 15N-depleted N-bearing ice in the outer Solar System or interstellar medium. Such amides delivered by primitive small bodies may have contributed to prebiotic chemistry on early Earth.</description>

      <title>Bistability, Oscillations, and Multistability on Hycean Planets</title>

Abstract: Hycean planets are hypothetical exoplanets characterized by $H_2O$ oceans and $H_2$-rich atmospheres. These planets are high-priority targets for biosignature searches, as they combine abundant surface liquid water with easy-to-characterize $H_2$-rich atmospheres. Perhaps their most unusual climate feature is convective inhibition, which can dramatically alter a planet's temperature structure. However, so far hycean planets have mostly been investigated using 1D models that do not account for convective inhibition, and its effects are still poorly understood. This work develops pen-and-paper theory to analyze the effects of moist convective inhibition on hycean planets. The theory is tested and verified against a 1D radiative-convective model. We show that hycean planets near the onset of convective inhibition can exhibit either bistability or oscillations, due to the inhibition layer's trapping of heat and moisture. Meanwhile, hot hycean planets exhibit multistability, in which the inhibition layer and surface climate show multiple stable equilibria due to the lack of constraints on the water cycle inside the inhibition layer. The water cycle inside the inhibition layer is influenced by numerous processes that are challenging to resolve in 1D, including turbulent diffusion, convective overshoot and large-scale circulations. Our results demonstrate that hycean planets have unexpectedly rich climate dynamics. Meanwhile, previous claims about hycean planets should be treated with caution until confirmed with more self-consistent 1D and 3D models; this includes the claim that K2-18b might be habitable, and the proposal to infer $H_2O$ oceans on sub-Neptunes from JWST measurements of chemical species in their upper atmospheres.</description>

      <title>A Neural Symbolic Model for Space Physics</title>

Abstract: In this study, we unveil a new AI model, termed PhyE2E, to discover physical formulas through symbolic regression. PhyE2E simplifies symbolic regression by decomposing it into sub-problems using the second-order derivatives of an oracle neural network, and employs a transformer model to translate data into symbolic formulas in an end-to-end manner. The resulting formulas are refined through Monte-Carlo Tree Search and Genetic Programming. We leverage a large language model to synthesize extensive symbolic expressions resembling real physics, and train the model to recover these formulas directly from data. A comprehensive evaluation reveals that PhyE2E outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches, delivering superior symbolic accuracy, precision in data fitting, and consistency in physical units. We deployed PhyE2E to five applications in space physics, including the prediction of sunspot numbers, solar rotational angular velocity, emission line contribution functions, near-Earth plasma pressure, and lunar-tide plasma signals. The physical formulas generated by AI demonstrate a high degree of accuracy in fitting the experimental data from satellites and astronomical telescopes. We have successfully upgraded the formula proposed by NASA in 1993 regarding solar activity, and for the first time, provided the explanations for the long cycle of solar activity in an explicit form. We also found that the decay of near-Earth plasma pressure is proportional to r^2 to Earth, where subsequent mathematical derivations are consistent with satellite data from another independent study. Moreover, we found physical formulas that can describe the relationships between emission lines in the extreme ultraviolet spectrum of the Sun, temperatures, electron densities, and magnetic fields. The formula obtained is consistent with the properties that physicists had previously hypothesized it should possess.</description>

      <title>Hard X-ray Emission in AU Mic Flares: A Minor Contributor to Planetary Atmospheric Escape</title>

Abstract: Stellar flares are potent drivers of atmospheric evolution on orbiting exoplanets, primarily through extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and soft X-ray (XUV) irradiation. However, the contribution of hard X-rays (HXR; 3--20 keV)-which penetrate deeper into planetary atmospheres-to mass loss and particle acceleration has remained poorly understood. To quantify the HXR share of the total radiative budget, we conducted quasi-simultaneous observations of the active M-dwarf AU Mic using NuSTAR, Swift, and the Einstein Probe. Our analysis detected two major flares, and we performed an empirical check by deriving a quiescent-phase soft X-ray (SXR; 0.3--3 keV)-HXR relation and then applying it to the flares. By combining this with the quiescent coronal SXR-EUV relations conversion of J. Sanz-Forcada et al. (2011), we computed the total high-energy flux (EUV + SXR + HXR) and assessed the relative role of HXR in atmospheric escape. We find that HXR accounts for only a few percent of the total radiative energy budget during both quiescent and flaring states. While a high-energy spectral tail is detected in the second flare, time-resolved spectroscopy reveals a dominant chromospheric-evaporation signature, indicating that the flare energetics are primarily thermal.</description>
