      <title>Damage detection in an uncertain nonlinear beam based on stochastic Volterra series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The damage detection problem in mechanical systems, using vibration measurements, is commonly called Structural Health Monitoring (SHM). Many tools are able to detect damages by changes in the vibration pattern, mainly, when damages induce nonlinear behavior. However, a more difficult problem is to detect structural variation associated with damage, when the mechanical system has nonlinear behavior even in the reference condition. In these cases, more sophisticated methods are required to detect if the changes in the response are based on some structural variation or changes in the vibration regime, because both can generate nonlinearities. Among the many ways to solve this problem, the use of the Volterra series has several favorable points, because they are a generalization of the linear convolution, allowing the separation of linear and nonlinear contributions by input filtering through the Volterra kernels. On the other hand, the presence of uncertainties in mechanical systems, due to noise, geometric imperfections, manufacturing irregularities, environmental conditions, and others, can also change the responses, becoming more difficult the damage detection procedure. An approach based on a stochastic version of Volterra series is proposed to be used in the detection of a breathing crack in a beam vibrating in a nonlinear regime of motion, even in reference condition (without crack). The system uncertainties are simulated by the variation imposed in the linear stiffness and damping coefficient. The results show, that the nonlinear analysis done, considering the high order Volterra kernels, allows the approach to detect the crack with a small propagation and probability confidence, even in the presence of uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Topological and geometric characterization of synthetic aperture sonar collections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article explores the theoretical underpinnings of -- and practical results for -- topological and geometric features of data collected by synthetic aperture sonar systems. We prove a strong theoretical guarantee about the structure of the space of echos (the signature space) that is relevant for classification, and that this structure is measurable in laboratory conditions. The guarantee makes minimal assumptions about the sonar platform's trajectory, and establishes that the signature space divides neatly into topological features based upon the number of prominent echos and their placement, and geometric features that capture their corresponding sonar cross section.</description>

      <title>Investigations of effect of temperature and strain dependent material properties on thermoelastic damping -- A generalized 3-D finite element formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A comprehensive 3-D finite element formulation for the coupled thermoelastic system is proposed based on the Total Lagrangian framework to study the thermoelastic damping (TED) in small scale structures. The proposed formulation takes into account geometric nonlinearity because of large deformation and material nonlinearity where material parameters are functions of temperature and strain field. Using the proposed finite element formulation, the TED quality factor is obtained for 1-D rod undergoing longitudinal vibrations using the eigenvalue analysis. We first validate the accuracy of the finite element implementation with previously known theoretical and numerical results. Subsequently we demonstrate the utility of the proposed numerical framework to study the effect of geometric nonlinearity, temperature and strain dependent material nonlinearity on the thermoelastic damping.In addition, the effect of internal/ external heating and different thermal boundary conditions on TED is discussed</description>

      <title>NFTracer: Tracing NFT Impact Dynamics in Transaction-flow Substitutive Systems with Visual Analytics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Impact dynamics are crucial for estimating the growth patterns of NFT projects by tracking the diffusion and decay of their relative appeal among stakeholders. Machine learning methods for impact dynamics analysis are incomprehensible and rigid in terms of their interpretability and transparency, whilst stakeholders require interactive tools for informed decision-making. Nevertheless, developing such a tool is challenging due to the substantial, heterogeneous NFT transaction data and the requirements for flexible, customized interactions. To this end, we integrate intuitive visualizations to unveil the impact dynamics of NFT projects. We first conduct a formative study and summarize analysis criteria, including substitution mechanisms, impact attributes, and design requirements from stakeholders. Next, we propose the Minimal Substitution Model to simulate substitutive systems of NFT projects that can be feasibly represented as node-link graphs. Particularly, we utilize attribute-aware techniques to embed the project status and stakeholder behaviors in the layout design. Accordingly, we develop a multi-view visual analytics system, namely NFTracer, allowing interactive analysis of impact dynamics in NFT transactions. We demonstrate the informativeness, effectiveness, and usability of NFTracer by performing two case studies with domain experts and one user study with stakeholders. The studies suggest that NFT projects featuring a higher degree of similarity are more likely to substitute each other. The impact of NFT projects within substitutive systems is contingent upon the degree of stakeholders' influx and projects' freshness.</description>

      <title>RIS-aided Trajectory Optimization in Layered Urban Air Mobility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Urban Air Mobility (UAM) relies on developing aerospace industries, where safe aviation and efficient communication are critical features of aircraft. However, it is challenging for aircraft to sustain efficient air-ground communication in urban circumstances. Without continuous air-ground communication, aircraft may experience course deviation and safety accidents. To address these problems, a reconfigurable intelligent surface(RIS)-aided trajectory optimization scheme is proposed enabling efficient air-ground communication and safe aviation in UAM with a layered airspace structure. This paper first devises a dual-plane RIS communication scheme for layered airspace. It fully engages the omnidirectional and directional signal attributes to reduce the transmission delay of the air-ground communication. Based on the dual-plane RIS configuration, we jointly develop the intra- and inter-layer trajectory scheme to optimize communication and safe aviation. In the intra-layer trajectory optimization, we propose a dual-time-scale flight scheme to improve communication capacity and horizontal flight safety. Meanwhile, we propose a safe layer-switching method to ensure collision avoidance during vertical flight in the inter-layer trajectory optimization. The communication load of the proposed scheme can be improved 40% and the time of safe separation restoration can be lessened 66% compared with the benchmarks in the layered airspace.</description>

      <title>dnaGrinder: a lightweight and high-capacity genomic foundation model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The task of understanding and interpreting the complex information encoded within genomic sequences remains a grand challenge in biological research and clinical applications. In this context, recent advancements in large language model research have led to the development of both encoder-only and decoder-only foundation models designed to decode intricate information in DNA sequences. However, several issues persist, particularly regarding the efficient management of long-range dependencies inherent in genomic sequences, the effective representation of nucleotide variations, and the considerable computational costs associated with large model architectures and extensive pretraining datasets. Current genomic foundation models often face a critical tradeoff: smaller models with mediocre performance versus large models with improved performance. To address these challenges, we introduce dnaGrinder, a unique and efficient genomic foundation model. dnaGrinder excels at managing long-range dependencies within genomic sequences while minimizing computational costs without compromising performance. It achieves results that are not just comparable but often superior to leading DNA models such as Nucleotide Transformer and DNABERT-2. Furthermore, dnaGrinder is designed for easy fine-tuning on workstation-grade GPUs, accommodating input lengths exceeding 17,000 tokens. On a single high-performance GPU, it supports sequences longer than 140,000 tokens, making it a highly efficient and accessible tool for both basic biological research and clinical applications.</description>
