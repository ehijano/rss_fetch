      <title>Electromagnetic signatures of black hole clusters in the center of super-Eddington galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at the centers of active galaxies are fed by accretion disks that radiate from the infrared or optical to the X-ray bands. Several types of objects can orbit SMBHs, including massive stars, neutron stars, clouds from the broad- and narrow-line regions, and X-ray binaries. Isolated black holes with a stellar origin (BHs of $\sim10\,M_{\odot}$) should also be present in large numbers within the central parsec of the galaxies. These BHs are expected to form a cluster around the SMBH as a result of the enhanced star formation rate in the inner galactic region and the BH migration caused by gravitational dynamical friction. However, except for occasional microlensing effects on background stars or gravitational waves from binary BH mergers, the presence of a BH population is hard to verify. In this paper, we explore the possibility of detecting electromagnetic signatures of a central cluster of BHs when the accretion rate onto the central SMBH is greater than the Eddington rate. In these supercritical systems, the accretion disk launches powerful winds that interact with the objects orbiting the SMBH. Isolated BHs can capture matter from this dense wind, leading to the formation of small accretion disks around them. If jets are produced in these "single" microquasars, they could be sites of particle acceleration to relativistic energies. These particles in turn are expected to cool by various radiative processes. Therefore, the wind of the SMBH might illuminate the BHs through the production of both thermal and nonthermal radiation. We conclude that, under these circumstances, a cluster of isolated BHs could be detected at X-rays (with Chandra and XMM-Newton) and radio wavelengths (e.g., with the Very Large Array and the Square Kilometer Array) in the center of nearby super-Eddington galaxies.</description>

      <title>Resolution of (Heavy) Primaries in Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measurements of Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECR) suggest a complex composition with significant contributions from heavy nuclei at the highest energies. We systematically explore how the selection and number of primary nuclei included in the analysis impact the inferred UHECR mass composition. Introducing a distance measure in the space of $X_{\rm max}$ distribution moments, we demonstrate that limiting the analysis to a few primaries can introduce significant biases, particularly as observational data improves. We provide lists of primaries approximately equidistant in the new measure, which guaranty unbiased results at given statistical confidence. Additionally, we explore consistent inclusion of nuclei heavier than iron and up to plutonium, deriving first observational upper bounds on their contributions to UHECR with the Pierre Auger Open Data.</description>

      <title>Fermi Blazars in the Zwicky Transient Facility Survey: Properties of Large Optical Variations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the optical light-curve data, obtained with the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) survey, for 47 gamma-ray blazars monitored by the Large Area Telescope onboard {\it the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope (Fermi)}. These 47 sources are selected because they are among the Fermi blazars with the largest optical variations in the ZTF data. Two color-magnitude variation patterns are seen in them, one being redder to stable when brighter (RSWB; in 31 sources) and the other being stable when brighter (in 16 sources). The patterns fit with the results recently reported in several similar studies with different data. Moreover, we find that the colors in the stable state of the sources share similar values, which (after corrected for the Galactic extinction) of most sources are in a range of 0.4--0.55. This feature could be intrinsic and may be applied in, for example, the study of intragalactic medium. We also determine the turning points for the sources showing the RSWB pattern, after which the color changes saturate and become stable. We find a correlation between optical fluxes and gamma-ray fluxes at the turning points. The physical implications of the correlation remain to be investigated, probably better with a sample of high-quality gamma-ray flux measurements.</description>

      <title>Investigations on the equation of state of neutron star matter with density-dependent relativistic mean-field model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The compact object with a mass of $2.50-2.67~M_\odot$ observed by LIGO Scientific and Virgo collaborations in GW190814, as well as the recent report of a light compact object with a mass and radius of $M=0.77^{+0.20}_{-0.17}M_{\odot}$ and $R=10.4^{+0.86}_{-0.78}$ km within the supernova remnant HESS J1731-347, have posed a great challenge to the investigations into the supranuclear matter. In the inner core region of the neutron star, the strangeness degrees of freedom, such as the hyperons, can be present, which is also named as a hyperonic star. In this work, the neutron star consisting of nucleons and leptons, and the hyperonic star including the hyperons will be studied in the framework of the density-dependent relativistic mean-field (DDRMF) model. Some popular DDRMF parameterizations will be adopted to investigate the properties of nuclear matter and the mass, radius, tidal deformability, and other properties of neutron star and hyperonic stars. We find that the maximum masses of neutron star calculated by DD-MEX, DD-MEX1, DD-MEX2, DD-MEXY and DD-LZ1 sets can be around $2.5-2.6~M_\odot$ with quite stiff equations of state (EOSs) generated by their strong repulsive contributions from vector potentials at high densities. Moreover, by investigating the influence of the crust EOS and core EOS on the neutron stars, we find that the observational data from HESS J1731-347 suggest the requirement of a crust EOS with a higher $L$ parameter and a core EOS with a lower $L$ parameter, and the $M-R$ relations from the constructed EOSs can also be consistent with the observables of PSR J0740+6620, PSR J0030+0451 from NICER and the GW170817 event. With the inclusion of hyperons, the hyperonic star matter becomes softer compared to the neutron star matter. But the massive hyperonic star can also be obtained with DDRMF parameter sets if the vector coupling constants are strong.</description>

      <title>Cosmic-ray deuteron excess from a primary component</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent AMS-02 measurements of cosmic-ray (CR) deuteron fluxes suggest the presence of primary deuterons in quantities far exceeding predictions from Big Bang nucleosynthesis. This poses a significant challenge to modern astrophysics, as no known processes can account for such large amounts of deuterons without violating existing constraints~\cite{Epstein:1976hq}. In contrast, it is recently proposed that the AMS-02 measurements can be explained by a purely secondary origin when contributions from heavier nuclei are considered. In this study, we recalculate the secondary deuteron flux using production cross sections updated with the latest collider data. We find that some of the deuteron production cross sections are overestimated in the widely-used calculation tools for CR propagation, and a primary deuteron component is still necessary. We then propose a novel process for generating primary deuterons at CR sources through a fusion mechanism, which is naturally unique to deuterons. This model could explain the observed deuteron excess while maintaining consistency with other CR measurements.</description>

      <title>The IXPE View of Neutron Star Low-Mass X-ray Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-mass X-ray binaries hosting weakly magnetized neutron stars (NS-LMXBs) are among the brightest sources in the X-ray sky. Since 2021, the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) has provided new measurements of the X-ray polarization of these sources. IXPE observations have revealed that most NS-LMXBs are significantly polarized in the X-rays, providing unprecedented insight into the geometry of their accretion flow. In this review paper, we summarize the first results obtained by IXPE on NS-LMXBs, the emerging trends within each class of sources (atoll/Z), and possible physical interpretations.</description>

      <title>Effects of Dark Matter on the Spontaneous Scalarization in Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark matter, an important portion of compact objects, can influence different phenomena in neutron stars. The spontaneous scalarization in the scalar-tensor gravity has been proposed for neutron stars. Here, we investigate the spontaneous scalarization in dark matter admixed neutron stars. Applying the dark matter equations of state, we calculate the structure of scalarized neutron stars containing dark matter. The dark matter equations of state are based on observational data from the rotational curves of galaxies and the fermionic self-interacting dark matter. Our results verify that the spontaneous scalarization is affected by the dark matter pressure in neutron stars. Depending on the central density of scalarized dark matter admixed neutron stars, the dark matter pressure alters the central scalar field. The increase of dark matter pressure in low-density scalarized stars amplifies the central scalar field. However, the pressure of dark matter in high-density scalarized stars suppresses the central scalar field. Our calculations confirm that the stars in the merger event GW170817 and in the low-mass X-ray binary 4U 1820-30 can be scalarized dark matter admixed neutron stars.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Probe Of Extreme Multi-Messenger Astrophysics (POEMMA) is a proposed dual-satellite mission to observe Ultra-High-Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECRs), increasing the statistics at the highest energies, and Very-High-Energy Neutrinos (VHENs), following multi-messenger alerts of astrophysical transient events throughout the universe such as gamma-ray bursts and gravitational wave events. POEMMA-Balloon with Radio (PBR) is a scaled-down version of the POEMMA design, adapted to be flown as a payload on one of NASA's sub-orbital Super Pressure Balloons (SPBs) circling over the Southern Ocean for up to 100 days after a launch from Wanaka, New Zealand. This overview will provide a summary of the mission with its science goals, the instruments, and the current status of PBR.</description>

      <title>Black hole-neutron star binaries with high spins and large mass asymmetries: I. Properties of quasi-equilibrium sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Black hole - neutron star (BHNS) mergers are a promising target of current gravitational-wave (GW) and electromagnetic (EM) searches, being the putative origin of ultra-relativistic jets, gamma-ray emission, and r-process nucleosynthesis. However, the possibility of any EM emission accompanying a GW detection crucially depends on the amount of baryonic mass left after the coalescence, i.e. whether the neutron star (NS) undergoes a `tidal disruption' or `plunges' into the black hole (BH) while remaining essentially intact. As the first of a series of two papers, we here report the most systematic investigation to date of quasi-equilibrium sequences of initial data across a range of stellar compactnesses $\mathcal{C}$, mass ratios $q$, BH spins $\chi_{_{\rm
  BH}}$, and equations of state satisfying all present observational constraints. Using an improved version of the elliptic initial-data solver FUKA, we have computed more than $1000$ individual configurations and estimated the onset of mass-shedding or the crossing of the innermost stable circular orbit in terms of the corresponding characteristic orbital angular velocities $\Omega_{_{\rm MS}}$ and $\Omega_{_{\rm
  ISCO}}$ as a function of $\mathcal{C}, q$, and $\chi_{_{\rm BH}}$. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the dependence of these frequencies on the BH spin is investigated. In turn, by setting $\Omega_{_{\rm MS}} = \Omega_{_{\rm ISCO}}$ it is possible to determine the separatrix between the `tidal disruption' or `plunge' scenarios as a function of the fundamental parameters of these systems, namely, $q, \mathcal{C}$, and $\chi_{_{\rm BH}}$. Finally, we present a novel analysis of quantities related to the tidal forces in the initial data and discuss their dependence on spin and separation.</description>

      <title>Black hole - neutron star binaries with high spins and large mass asymmetries: II. Properties of dynamical simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Black hole (BH) - neutron star (NS) binary mergers are not only strong sources of gravitational waves (GWs), but they are also candidates for joint detections in the GW and electromagnetic (EM) spectra. However, the possible emergence of an EM signal from these binaries is determined by a complex combination of the equation of state (EOS), the BH spin, and the mass ratio. In this second paper in a series, we present a systematic exploration of the possible space of binary parameters in terms of the mass ratio and BH spin so as to construct a complete description of the dynamical processes accompanying a BHNS binary merger. This second work relies not only on the initial data presented in the companion paper I, but also on the predictions via quasi-equilibrium (QE) sequences on the outcome of the binary. In this way, and for the first time, we are able to relate the predictions of QE analyses with the results of accurate general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations. In addition to a careful investigation of the evolution of the BH mass and spin as a result of the merger, the total remnant rest-mass of the resulting accretion disk and its properties, and of the corresponding post-merger GW emission, special attention is paid to the conditions that lead to tidal disruption. Leveraging QE calculations, we are able to verify the reliability of stringent predictions about the occurrence or not of a plunge and to measure the `strength' of the tidal disruption when it takes place. Finally, using a novel contraction of the Riemann tensor in a tetrad comoving with the fluid introduced in paper I, we are able to point out the onset of the instability to tidal disruption. This new diagnostic can be employed not only to determine the occurrence of the disruption, but also to characterize it in terms of the binary parameters.</description>

      <title>Phase Stability in the 3-Dimensional Open-source Code for the Chiral mean-field Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we explore independently for the first time three chemical potentials (baryon $\mu_B$, charged $\mu_Q$, and strange $\mu_S$) in the Chiral mean-field (CMF) model. We designed and implemented \texttt{CMF++}, a new version of the CMF model rewritten in \texttt{C++} that is optimized, modular, and well-documented. \texttt{CMF++} has been integrated into the MUSES Calculation Engine as a free and open source software module. The runtime improved in more than 4 orders of magnitude across all 3 chemical potentials, when compared to the legacy code. Here we focus on the zero temperature case and study stable, as well as metastable and unstable, vacuum, hadronic, and quark phases, showing how phase boundaries vary with the different chemical potentials. Due to the significant numerical improvements in \texttt{CMF++}, we can calculate for the first time high-order susceptibilities within the CMF framework to study the properties of the quark deconfinement phase transition. We found phases of matter that include a light hadronic phase, strangeness-dominated hadronic phase, and quark deconfinement within our $\mu_B$, $\mu_S$, $\mu_Q$ phase space. The phase transitions are of first, second (quantum critical point), and third order between these phases and we even identified a tricritical point.</description>

      <title>Galactic Distribution of Supernovae and OB Associations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We update and extend a previous model by Higdon and Lingenfelter for the longitudinal profile of the N\,II intensity in the Galactic plane. The model is based on four logarithmic spiral arms, to which features like the Local Arm and local sources are added. Connecting then the N\,II to the H\,II emission, we use this model to determine the average spatial distribution of OBassociations in the Milky Way. Combined with a stellar mass and cluster distribution function, the model predicts the average spatial and temporal distribution of core-collapse supernovae in the Milky Way. In addition to this average population, we account for supernovae from observed OB associations, providing thereby a more accurate description of the nearby Galaxy. The complete model is made publicly available in the python code SNOB.</description>

      <title>ALMACAL XII. Data characterisation and products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ALMACAL survey is based on a database of reprocessed ALMA calibration scans suitable for scientific analysis, observed as part of regular PI observations. We present all the data accumulated from the start of ALMA operations until May 2022 for 1047 calibrator fields across the southern sky spanning ALMA Bands 3 to 10 (~ 84 - 950 GHz), so-called ALMACAL-22. Encompassing over 1000 square arcmin and accumulating over 2000 hours of integration time, ALMACAL is not only one of the largest ALMA surveys to date, but it continues to grow with each new scientific observation. We outline the methods for processing and imaging a subset of the highest-quality data ('pruned sample'). Using deconvolution techniques within the visibility data (uv plane), we created data cubes as the final product for further scientific analysis. We describe the properties and shortcomings of ALMACAL and compare its area and sensitivity with other sub-millimetre surveys. Notably, ALMACAL overcomes limitations of previous sub-millimetre surveys, such as small sky coverage and the effects of cosmic variance. Moreover, we discuss the improvements introduced by the latest version of this dataset that will enhance our understanding of dusty star-forming galaxies, extragalactic absorption lines, active galactic nucleus physics, and ultimately the evolution of molecular gas.</description>

      <title>XUV irradiation of young planetary atmospheres. Results from a joint XMM-Newton and HST observation of HIP67522</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evaporation and the chemistry of the atmospheres of warm and hot planets are strongly determined by the high-energy irradiation they receive from their parent stars. This is more crucial among young extra-solar systems, due to the high activity of stars at early ages. In particular, the EUV part of the stellar spectra drives significant processes of photo-chemical interaction, but it is not directly measurable due to strong interstellar absorption and the lack of sufficiently sensitive instrumentation. An alternative approach is to derive synthetic spectra from the analysis of FUV and X-ray emission lines, that allow to estimate the missed flux in the EUV band. We performed joint and simultaneous spectroscopy of HIP 67522 with XMM-Newton and HST aimed at reconstructing the full high-energy spectrum of this 17 Myr old solar-type (G0) star, which is the youngest known transiting multi-planet system at present time. We performed a time-resolved spectral analysis of the observations, including quiescent emission and flaring variability. Then, we derived the Emission Measure Distribution (EMD) vs. temperature of the chromospheric and coronal plasma from the high-resolution spectra obtained in X-rays with RGS and in FUV with COS. We derived broad-band X-ray and EUV luminosities from the synthetic spectrum based on the EMD, that allowed us to test alternative EUV vs. X-ray scaling laws available in literature. We also employed the total XUV flux received by the inner planet of the system to estimate its instantaneous atmospheric mass loss rate. We confirm that HIP 67522 is a very active star with a hot corona, reaching plasma temperatures above 20 MK even in quiescent state. Its EUV/X-ray flux ratio falls in between the predictions of the two scaling laws we have tested, indicating an important spread in the stellar properties, that requires further investigation.</description>

      <title>Unique Imprint of Black Hole Spin on the Polarization of Near-Horizon Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extracting information about the gravitational background from black hole images is both important and challenging. In this study, we use a physically motivated plasma model, typically applied to stationary, axisymmetric spacetimes, to demonstrate that in a rotating black hole spacetime, the polarizations of emitted light near the event horizon depend solely on the spacetime geometry, independent of the plasma flow geometry. We confirm that the frame-dragging effect of a rotating black hole governs the observed polarization structure in the near-horizon image. This finding indicates a unique imprint of the black hole spin on the polarization of the near-horizon image. We anticipate that refined observations of near-horizon emissions by the next-generation Event Horizon Telescope will enable us to determine the black hole spin in a straightforward manner.</description>

      <title>What is the nature of GW230529? An exploration of the gravitational lensing hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On the 29th of May 2023, the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration observed a compact binary coalescence event consistent with a neutron star-black hole merger, though the heavier object of mass 2.5-4.5 $M_\odot$ would fall into the purported lower mass gap. An alternative explanation for apparent observations of events in this mass range has been suggested as strongly gravitationally lensed binary neutron stars. In this scenario, magnification would lead to the source appearing closer and heavier than it really is. Here, we investigate the chances and possible consequences for the GW230529 event to be gravitationally lensed. We find this would require high magnifications and we obtain low rates for observing such an event, with a relative fraction of lensed versus unlensed observed events of $2 \times 10^{-3}$ at most. When comparing the lensed and unlensed hypotheses accounting for the latest rates and population model, we find a 1/58 chance of lensing, disfavoring this option. Moreover, when the magnification is assumed to be strong enough to bring the mass of the heavier binary component below the standard limits on neutron star masses, we find high probability for the lighter object to have a sub-solar mass, making the binary even more exotic than a mass-gap neutron star-black hole system. Even when the secondary is not sub-solar, its tidal deformability would likely be measurable, which is not the case for GW230529. Finally, we do not find evidence for extra lensing signatures such as the arrival of additional lensed images, type-II image dephasing, or microlensing. Therefore, we conclude it is unlikely for GW230529 to be a strongly gravitationally lensed binary neutron star signal.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic and observational constraints on black holes with primary hair in Beyond Horndeski Gravity: Stability and shadows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We found that, unlike General Relativity, the shift-symmetric subclass of Beyond Horndeski theories provides black holes with primary hair, which are thermodynamically stable and compatible with current Event Horizon Telescope observations for M87* and Sgr A* black holes. We first investigate its thermodynamic properties by studying the influence of the primary hair on the thermodynamic quantities and the local stability, imposing severe constraints in the allowed range of the primary hair values. Then, we analyze the null geodesics near this black hole, demonstrating how the scalar hair influences the shadow diameter, finding that higher values of the primary hair lead to smaller shadow sizes. Additionally, we constrain the scalar hair using the observational data, revealing its sensitivity to the choice of other black hole parameters. To further probe the observational features of the scalar hair, we simulate face-on two-dimensional images of spherically infalling accretion disks, examining how the primary scalar hair affects the black hole's shadow. Finally, we impose all relevant constraints to identify black holes that are both stable and consistent with observational data.</description>

      <title>Energy extraction from a rotating black hole via magnetic reconnection: the plunging bulk plasma and orientation angle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic reconection provides a new avenue to extract energy from a rotating black hole in astrophysical scenarios. There have been many works studying the feasibility of extracting energy via magnetic reconnection in the scheme of magnetohydrodynamics. However, most of them focused on circularly flowing bulk plasma only, and the influence of orientation angle, the angle between flowing direction of bulk plasma and ejection direction of plasmoids, was never carefully considered. In this work, we would like to study the energy extraction via magnetic reconnection in the plunging plasma, and more importantly, we analyze the influence of orientation angle in depth. Actually, we consider the magnetic reconnection occurring in bulk plasma with two kinds of streamlines, one being the circular flow and the other being the plunging flow from the ISCO. We find that the plunging plasma has higher energy-extraction efficiency. Moreover, we notice that it is favorable for energy extraction when the orientation angle is suitably increased if the bulk plasma plunges. We further define a quantity to characterize the energy extraction probability, through which we conclude that the plunging bulk plasma is much more capable in energy extraction than the circularly flowing one.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.00834v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Several features in the mass spectrum of merging binary black holes (BBHs) have been identified using data from the Third Gravitational Wave Transient Catalog (GWTC-3). These features are of particular interest as they may encode the uncertain mechanism of BBH formation. We assess if the features are statistically significant or the result of Poisson noise due to the finite number of observed events. We simulate catalogs of BBHs whose underlying distribution does not have the features of interest, apply the analysis previously performed on GWTC-3, and determine how often such features are spuriously found. We find that one of the features found in GWTC-3, the peak at $\sim35\,M_{\odot}$, cannot be explained by Poisson noise alone: peaks as significant occur in $1.7\%$ of catalogs generated from a featureless population. This peak is therefore likely to be of astrophysical origin. The data is suggestive of an additional significant peak at $\sim10\,M_{\odot}$, though the exact location of this feature is not resolvable with current observations. Additional structure beyond a power law, such as the purported dip at $\sim14\,M_{\odot}$, can be explained by Poisson noise. We also provide a publicly-available package, \texttt{GWMockCat}, that creates simulated catalogs of BBH events with correlated measurement uncertainty and selection effects according to user-specified underlying distributions and detector sensitivities.</description>

      <title>X-ray hardening preceding the onset of SGR 1935+2154's radio pulsar phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.08832v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetars are neutron stars with extremely strong magnetic fields, frequently powering high-energy activity in X-rays. Pulsed radio emission following some X-ray outbursts have been detected (\citealt{Camilo2006,camilo2007a}), albeit its physical origin is unclear. It has long been speculated that the origin of magnetars' radio signals is different from those from canonical pulsars, although convincing evidence is still lacking. Five months after magnetar SGR 1935+2154's X-ray outburst and its associated Fast Radio Burst (FRB) 20200428, a radio pulsar phase was discovered. Here we report the discovery of X-ray spectral hardening associated with the emergence of periodic radio pulsations from SGR 1935+2154 and a detailed analysis of the properties of the radio pulses. The observations suggest that radio emission originates from the outer magnetosphere of the magnetar, and the surface heating due to the bombardment of inward-going particles from the radio emission region is responsible for the observed X-ray spectral hardening.</description>

      <title>Deciphering Accretion-Driven Starquakes in Recycled Millisecond Pulsars using Gravitational Waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03675v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recycled millisecond pulsars are susceptible to starquakes as they are continuously accreting matter from their binary companion. A starquake happens when the rotational frequency of the star crosses its breaking frequency. In this study, we perform a model analysis of an accreting neutron star suffering a starquake. We analyze two models: a spherical star with accreting mountains and a deformed star with accreting mountains. We find that as the star crosses the breaking frequency and suffers a starquake there is a sudden change in the continuous gravitational wave signal arriving from them. It is interesting to note that the amplitude of the gravitational wave signals increases suddenly for the spherical star. In contrast, for the deformed star, the amplitude of the continuous gravitational wave signal decreases suddenly. This sudden change in the continuous gravitational wave signal in recycled millisecond pulsars can be a unique signature for such pulsars undergoing a starquake.</description>

      <title>Uncovering Stealth Bias in LISA observations of Double White Dwarf Binaries due to Tidal Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10396v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Double white dwarfs are important gravitational wave sources for LISA, as they are some of the most numerous compact systems in our universe. Here we consider finite-sized effects due to tidal interactions, as they are expected to have a measurable impact on these systems. Previous studies suggested that tidal effects would allow the individual masses to be measured, but there was a subtle error in those analyses. Using a fully Bayesian analysis we find that while tidal effects do not allow us to constrain the individual masses, they do yield informative lower bounds on the total mass of the system. Including tidal effects is crucial to the accuracy of our estimation of the chirp and total mass. Neglecting tidal effects leads to significant biases towards higher chirp masses, and we see that the lower bound of the total masses is biased towards a higher value as well. For many systems observed by LISA, tidal effects can lead to a "stealth" bias, since only the first derivative of the frequency can be measured. To separate tidal effects from the usual point particle decay we need to be able to measure the change in the second derivative of the frequency cause by the tides. This can only be done for high frequency systems observed with high signal-to-noise. The bias, if not accounted for, can have significant astrophysical implications; for example, it could lead to an incorrect estimation of the population of potential Type IA supernovae progenitors.</description>

      <title>Separating source-intrinsic and Lorentz invariance violation induced delays in the very high energy emission of blazar flares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01182v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Aims: The aim of the present study is to explore how to disentangle energy-dependent time delays due to a possible Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) at Planck scale from intrinsic delays expected in standard blazar flares.
  Methods: We first characterise intrinsic time delays in BL Lacs and Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars in standard one-zone time-dependent synchrotron self-Compton or external Compton models, during flares produced by particle acceleration and cooling processes. We simulate families of flares with both intrinsic and external LIV-induced energy-dependent delays. Discrimination between intrinsic and LIV delays is then investigated in two different ways. A technique based on Euclidean distance calculation between delays obtained in the synchrotron and in the inverse-Compton spectral bumps is used to assess their degree of correlation. A complementary study is performed using spectral hardness versus intensity diagrams in both energy ranges.
  Results: We show that the presence of non-negligible LIV effects, which essentially act only at very high energies (VHE), can drastically reduce the strong correlation expected between the X-ray and the VHE gamma-ray emission in leptonic scenarios. The LIV phenomenon can then be hinted at measuring the Euclidean distance $d_{E}$ from simultaneous X-ray and gamma-ray flare monitoring. Large values of minimal distance $d_{E,min}$ would directly indicate the influence of non-intrinsic time delays possibly due to LIV in SSC flares. LIV effects can also significantly modify the VHE hysteresis patterns in hardness-intensity diagrams and even change their direction of rotation as compared to the X-ray behaviour. Both observables could be used to discriminate between LIV and intrinsic delays, provided high quality flare observations are available.</description>

      <title>Relativistic X-ray reflection from the accreting millisecond X-ray pulsar IGR J17498-2921</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06193v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The accreting millisecond X-ray pulsar IGR J17498-2921 went into X-ray outburst on April 13-15, 2023, for the first time since its discovery on August 11, 2011. Here, we report on the first follow-up \nustar{} observation of the source, performed on April 23, 2023, around ten days after the peak of the outburst. The \nustar{} spectrum of the persistent emission ($3-60$ \kev{} band) is well described by an absorbed blackbody with a temperature of $kT_{bb}=1.61\pm 0.04$\kev{}, most likely arising from the NS surface and a Comptonization component with power-law index $\Gamma=1.79\pm0.02$, arising from a hot corona at $kT_{e}=16\pm 2$ keV. The X-ray spectrum of the source shows robust reflection features which have not been observed before. We use a couple of self-consistent reflection models, {\tt relxill} and {\tt relxillCp}, to fit the reflection features. We find an upper limit to the inner disc radius of $ 6\: R_{ISCO}$ and $ 9\: R_{ISCO}$ from {\tt relxill} and {\tt relxillCp} model, respectively. The inclination of the system is estimated to be $\simeq 40\degr$ from both reflection models. Assuming magnetic truncation of the accretion disc, the upper limit of magnetic field strength at the pole of the NS is found to be $B\lesssim 1.8\times 10^{8}$ G. Furthermore, the \nustar{} observation revealed two type I X-ray bursts and the burst spectroscopy confirms the thermonuclear nature of the burst. The blackbody temperature reaches nearly $2.2$ keV at the peak of the burst.</description>

      <title>Arecibo Wow! I: An Astrophysical Explanation for the Wow! Signal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08513v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Ohio State University Big Ear radio telescope detected in 1977 the Wow! Signal, one of the most famous and intriguing signals of extraterrestrial origin. Characterized by its strong relative intensity and narrow bandwidth near the 1420 MHz hydrogen line, its source has never been detected again despite numerous follow-up attempts. Arecibo Wow! is a new technosignature project using archived data from the Arecibo Observatory. Here we present our first results of drift scans made between February and May 2020 at 1420 MHz. The methods, frequency, and bandwidth of these observations are similar to those used to detect the Wow! Signal. However, our observations are more sensitive, have better temporal resolution, and include polarization measurements. We report the detection of narrowband signals (10 kHz) near the hydrogen line similar to the Wow! Signal, although two-orders of magnitude less intense and in multiple locations. Despite the similarities, these signals are easily identifiable as small interstellar clouds of cold hydrogen (HI) in the galaxy. We hypothesize that the Wow! Signal was caused by a sudden brightening of the hydrogen line in these clouds triggered by a strong transient radiation source, such as a magnetar flare or a soft gamma repeater (SGR). A maser flare or superradiance mechanisms can produce stimulated emission consistent with the Wow! Signal. Our hypothesis explains all observed properties of the Wow! Signal, proposes a new source of false positives in technosignature searches, and suggests that the Wow! Signal could be the first recorded event of an astronomical maser-like flare in the hydrogen line.</description>

Abstract: The recent opening of gravitational wave astronomy has shifted the debate about black hole mimickers from a purely theoretical arena to a phenomenological one. In this respect, missing a definitive quantum gravity theory, the possibility to have simple, meta-geometries describing in a compact way alternative phenomenologically viable scenarios is potentially very appealing. A recently proposed metric by Simpson and Visser is exactly an example of such meta-geometry describing, for different values of a single parameter, different non-rotating black hole mimickers. Here, we employ the Newman--Janis procedure to construct a rotating generalisation of such geometry. We obtain a stationary, axially symmetric metric that depends on mass, spin and an additional real parameter $\ell$. According to the value of such parameter, the metric may represent a rotating traversable wormhole, a rotating regular black hole with one or two horizons, or three more limiting cases. By studying the internal and external rich structure of such solutions, we show that the obtained metric describes a family of interesting and simple regular geometries providing viable Kerr black hole mimickers for future phenomenological studies.</description>

Abstract: Pulsar timing array (PTA) data releases showed strong evidence for a stochastic gravitational-wave background in the nanohertz band. When the signal is interpreted by a scenario of scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs), we encounter overproduction of primordial black holes (PBHs). We wonder if varying the equation of state (EoS) of the early Universe can resolve this issue and thereby lead to a consistent interpretation of the PTA data. Analyzing a data combination of PTA, big-bang nucleosynthesis, and cosmic microwave background, we find that an epoch with EoS $w\sim\mathcal{O}(10^{-2})$ between the end of inflation and the onset of radiation domination can significantly suppress the production of PBHs, leading to alleviation of the PBH-overproduction issue. With the inferred interval $w=0.44_{-0.40}^{+0.52}$ at 95\% confidence level, our scenario can interpret the PTA data just as well as the conventional scenario of SIGWs produced during the radiation domination.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from mergers of Population III binary black holes: roles played by two evolution channels</title>

Abstract: The gravitational wave (GW) signal from binary black hole (BBH) mergers is a promising probe of Population III (Pop III) stars. To fully unleash the power of the GW probe, one important step is to understand the relative importance and features of different BBH evolution channels. We model two channels, isolated binary stellar evolution (IBSE) and nuclear star cluster-dynamical hardening (NSC-DH), in one theoretical framework based on the semi-analytical code A-SLOTH, under various assumptions on Pop III initial mass function (IMF), initial binary statistics and high-$z$ nuclear star clusters (NSCs). The NSC-DH channel contributes $\sim 8-95\%$ of Pop III BBH mergers across cosmic history, with higher contributions achieved by initially wider binary stars, more top-heavy IMFs, and more abundant high-$z$ NSCs. The dimensionless stochastic GW background (SGWB) produced by Pop III BBH mergers has peak values $\Omega^{\rm peak}_{\rm GW}\sim 10^{-11}-8\times 10^{-11}$ around observer-frame frequencies $\nu\sim 10-100\ \rm Hz$. The Pop III contribution can be a non-negligible ($\sim 2-32\%$) component in the total SGWB at $\nu\lesssim 10\ \rm Hz$. The estimated detection rates of Pop III BBH mergers by the Einstein Telescope are $\sim 6-230\ \rm yr^{-1}$ and $\sim 30-1230\ \rm yr^{-1}$ for the NSC-DH and IBSE channels, respectively. Pop III BBH mergers in NSCs are more massive than those from IBSE, so they dominate the Pop III SGWB below $20$ Hz in most cases. Besides, the detection rate of Pop III BBH mergers involving at least one intermediate-mass BH above $100\ \rm M_\odot$ by the Einstein Telescope is $\sim 0.5-200\ \rm yr^{-1}$ in NSCs but remains below $0.1\ \rm yr^{-1}$ for IBSE.</description>
