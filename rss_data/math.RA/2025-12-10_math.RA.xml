      <title>Decompositions of Group Algebras as a Direct Sum of Projective Indecomposable Modules and of Blocks in Positive Characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dissertation focuses on decomposing a group algebra $kG$ over a field of positive characteristic into a direct sum of projective indecomposable modules. Such a decomposition is obtained together with the Artin--Wedderburn Theorem. The main goal of the dissertation is to explicitly decompose given group algebras as a direct sum of their projective indecomposable modules.
  To achieve this, we determine the radical series of each projective indecomposable module of the given group algebras. For a group algebra over characteristic $p$, each projective indecomposable module has a simple head that is isomorphic to its socle. Projective covers and injective envelopes are used to construct these modules. A cyclic group algebra is uniserial, and a $p$-group algebra over characteristic $p$ is itself a projective indecomposable module. Using these properties, we explicitly find all projective indecomposable modules for the following group algebras over characteristic $2$: the Klein four-group, the alternating group $A_4$, and the alternating group $A_5$. Their relationships play an important role in this process.
  Since $p$-group algebras have trivial head and trivial socle, the Klein four-group algebra has a corresponding radical series. Its decomposition into a direct sum of projective indecomposable modules is described explicitly, and the Cartan matrix of a group algebra is obtained by calculating the multiplicities of simples in its projective indecomposable modules.
  The topic is then extended slightly by considering the unique decomposition of a group algebra into a direct sum of particular modules known as blocks. For $kA_4$, the primitive orthogonal idempotents are calculated, and since $kA_4$ has one block, it is equal to its block decomposition. For $kA_5$, we show that there are two blocks, determined by checking the nonzero entries in its Cartan matrix.</description>

      <title>Lie Theory Theorems over Positive Characteristic and Modular Lie algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sometimes, it is very important to consider what type of setting is assumed when studying a mathematical object. For example, in Galois theory, properties can completely change if we study a field extension over $F_p$ instead of a field over $\mathbb{Q}$. When we consider base fields for modules, algebras, or vector spaces, we often recall commonly used fields such as $\mathbb{C}$ and fields $F$ with char $F= p$.
  Similar behavior arises in the study of Lie algebras. Properties that hold for Lie algebras over a field of characteristic zero do not necessarily hold over a field of characteristic $p$. In general, we are more familiar with studying Lie algebras and their representations over $\mathbb{C}$. However, an interesting fact is that new properties can be discovered by studying the theory over fields of positive characteristic.
  Therefore, we will closely examine how theorems and properties in Lie algebra theory do not hold or behave differently when the base field has characteristic p. In fact, there is a related area of study known as modular Lie theory that deals specifically with this setting. In this theory, we study concepts such as the definition of restricted Lie algebras, that is, Lie algebras $L$ equipped with a p-mapping $[p] : L \rightarrow L$, defined as $x\mapsto x^{[p]}$, where the base field has prime characteristic. In other words, the theory introduces a new tool, the $p$-mapping, for the study of modular Lie algebras.
  In this project, we aim to study Lie algebras defined over fields of positive characteristic. Specifically, the main focus will be on how Lie algebras behave over such fields and how we can develop the general framework of modular Lie theory based on the insights and structures that arise in this setting.</description>

      <title>Cartan Horadam Spinors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Number sequences with wide-ranging applications in mathematics, physics, medicine, and engineering remain an active research topic. This study examines these sequences through the general framework of Horadam numbers and their special cases associated with Cartan numbers. By defining spinor transformations on the resulting structures, new types of spinors are introduced and their key properties are analyzed. The proposed approach bridges distinct yet contemporary research areas, contributing to a broader interdisciplinary perspective.</description>

      <title>Generalized Interlacing Families: New Error Bounds for CUR Matrix Decompositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces the concept of generalized interlacing families of polynomials, which extends the classical interlacing polynomial method to handle polynomials of varying degrees. We establish a fundamental property for these families, proving the existence of a polynomial with a desired degree whose smallest root is greater than or equal to the smallest root of the expected polynomial. Applying this framework to the generalized CUR matrix approximation problem, we derive a theoretical upper bound on the spectral norm of a residual matrix, expressed in terms of the largest root of the expected polynomial. We then explore two important special cases: the classical CUR matrix decompositions and the row subset selection problem. For classical CUR matrix decompositions, we derive an explicit upper bound for the largest root of the expected polynomial. This yields a tighter spectral norm error bound for the residual matrix compared to many existing results. Furthermore, we present a deterministic polynomial-time algorithm for solving the classical CUR problem under certain matrix conditions. For the row subset selection problem, we establish the first known spectral norm error bound. This paper extends the applicability of interlacing families and deepens the theoretical foundations of CUR matrix decompositions and related approximation problems.</description>

      <title>The Jordan canonical form of the Fr\'{e}chet derivative of a matrix function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\F$ be an algebraically closed field of characteristic $0$. Given a square matrix $A \in \F^{n \times n}$ and a polynomial $f \in \F[w]$, we determine the Jordan canonical form of the formal Fr\'{e}chet derivative of $f(A)$, in terms of that of $A$ and of $f$. When $\F\subseteq \C$, via Hermite interpolation, our result provides a full solution to [N.J. Higham, \emph{Functions of Matrices: Theory and Computation}, Research Problem 3.11]. A generalization consists of finding the Jordan canonical form of linear combinations of Kronecker products of powers of two square matrices, i.e., $\sum_{i,j} a_{ij} (X^i \otimes Y^j)$. For this generalization, we provide some new partial results, including a partial solution under certain assumptions and general bounds on the number and the sizes of Jordan blocks.</description>

      <title>L-algebras and their ideals: from simplicity to semidirect products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the ideals of semidirect products of L-algebras and the structure of simple L-algebras. We provide a precise characterization of the ideals of semidirect products and describe the structure of their prime spectrum. Furthermore, we introduce a family of finite simple L-algebras and prove that every simple linear L-algebra belongs to this family. We also show that the family we construct coincides with the class of simple algebras in a certain subclass of finite CKL-algebras. As an application, we use these results to give a clear description of linear Hilbert algebras and their symmetric semidirect products.</description>

      <title>A Generalisation of the Munn Semigroup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To each meet-semilattice $E$ is associated an inverse semigroup $T_{E}$ called the Munn semigroup of $E$. We generalise this construction by replacing the meet-semilattice $E$ by a presheaf of sets $X$ over a meet-semilattice. The inverse semigroup $T_{X}$ that results is called the generalised Munn semigroup. Our construction can be viewed as a generalisation of one due to Zhitomirskiy as well as a restriction of one due to Reilly. We prove that idempotent-separating representations in to the generalised Munn semigroup characterise \'etale actions of inverse semigroups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We call an $\mathbb{R}$-algebra locally complexified-gentle if it becomes a locally gentle $\mathbb{C}$-algebra up to Morita equivalence after complexification. We use modulated quivers to introduce two types of locally complexified-gentle algebras and show that they are Morita equivalent to some semilinear clannish algebras.</description>

      <title>Skew polynomial representations of matrix algebras and applications to coding theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the existing skew polynomial representations of matrix algebras which are direct sum of matrix spaces over division rings. In this representation, the sum-rank distance between two tuples of matrices is captured by a weight function on their associated skew polynomials, defined through degrees and greatest common right divisors with the polynomial that defines the representation. We exploit this representation to construct new families of maximum sum-rank distance (MSRD) codes over finite and infinite fields, and over division rings. These constructions generalize many of the known existing constructions of MSRD codes as well as of optimal codes in the rank and in the Hamming metric. As a byproduct, in the case of finite fields we obtain new families of MDS codes which are linear over a subfield and whose length is close to the field size.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08001v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that any smooth rigid analytic variety $X$ admits an affinoid covering $\{U_i\}$ such that the Banach algebras involved in the Fr\'echet--Stein presentation of the completed ring of differential operators D-cap$(U_i)$ are Auslander regular for each $i$. We use this result to prove projection formulae and adjunction results for coadmissible D-cap-modules.</description>

      <title>A new generalization of the Narayana numbers inspired by linear operators on associative $d$-ary algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13671v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study a generalization of the Narayana numbers $N_d(n,k) = \frac{1}{n+1} \binom{n+1}{k+1} \binom{ n + (n-k)(d-2)+1}{k}$ for integers $d \geq 2$ and $n,k \geq 0$. This two-parameter array extends the classical Narayana numbers ($d=2$) and yields a $d$-ary analogue of the Catalan numbers $C_d(n) = \sum_{k=0}^n N_d(n,k)$. We give nine combinatorial interpretations of $N_d(n,k)$ that unify and generalize known combinatorial interpretations of the Narayana numbers and $C_3(n)$ in the literature. In particular, we show that $N_d(n,k)$ counts a natural class of operator monomials over a $d$-ary associative algebra, thereby extending a result of Bremner and Elgendy for the binary case. We also construct explicit bijections between these monomials and several families of classic combinatorial objects, including Schr\"{o}der paths, Dyck paths, rooted ordered trees, and $231$-avoiding permutations.</description>
