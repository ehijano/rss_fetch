      <title>The sphere free energy of the vector models to order $1/N$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the large-$N$ expansion of the sphere free energy $F=-\log Z_{S^d}$ of the O(N) $\phi^4$ and the Gross-Neveu $(\bar{\psi} \psi)^2$ CFTs to order $1/N$. Analytical regularization of these theories requires consistently shifting the UV scaling dimension of the auxiliary field: this can only be done by modifying its kinetic term. This modification combines with the counterterms to give the result that matches the $\epsilon$-expansion, resolving a puzzle raised by Tarnopolsky in arXiv:1609.09113. These $F$s can be written compactly in terms of the anomalous dimensions, for both the short-range and the long-range versions of these CFTs. We also provide various technical results including a computation of the counterterms on the sphere and a neat derivation of the sphere free energy of a free conformal field. Finally, we observe that the long-range CFT becomes the short-range CFT at exactly the point where its $\tilde{F} =-\sin \tfrac{\pi d}{2} F$ is maximized as a function of the vector's scaling dimension.</description>

      <title>Holographic QCD Matter: Chiral Soliton Lattices in Strong Magnetic Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the chiral soliton lattice (CSL) in the framework of holographic QCD in magnetic field. Under appropriate boundary conditions for the gauge field and the quark mass deformation, we demonstrate that the ground state in the gravitational dual of QCD is given by the CSL in the background magnetic field and the baryon number density. In the presence of the background magnetic field, we show that the CSL is interpreted as a uniformly distributed D4-branes in the holographic setup, where the chiral soliton is identified with a non-self-dual instanton vortex or a center vortex in the five dimensional bulk gauge theory. While the baryon numbers are given to chiral solitons as well as Skyrmions due to the different terms in the Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) term in the chiral perturbation theory, these baryon numbers with different origins are unified in terms of the instanton charge density in five dimensions. With bulk analysis of the WZW term, we find that the pion decay constant becomes dependent on the magnetic field. For the massless pion case, we obtain an analytical form that is in qualitative agreement with lattice QCD results for strong magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Quantum TBA for refined BPS indices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Refined BPS indices give rise to a quantum Riemann-Hilbert problem that is inherently related to a non-commutative deformation of moduli spaces arising in gauge and string theory compactifications. We reformulate this problem in terms of a non-commutative deformation of a TBA-like equation and obtain its formal solution as an expansion in refined indices. As an application of this construction, we derive a generating function of solutions of the TBA equation in the unrefined case.</description>

      <title>A conformal approach to matter coupled Aristotelian gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show how to take the first step in the conformal program for constructing general matter couplings to Aristotelian gravity with arbitrary $p$-brane foliation. For this purpose we extend the $p$-brane Aristotelian algebra to the direct sum of two conformal algebras: one with Minkowski signature for the longitudinal directions and a second one with Euclidean signature for the transverse directions. For some cases, it is sufficient to work with a subalgebra of this conformal extension that, instead of two dilatations that are isotropic in either the longitudinal or transverse directions, contains a single dilatation that acts on the longitudinal and transverse directions in an an-isotropic way. Using this conformal extension we show how different electric and magnetic versions of Aristotelian gravity can be constructed that all have the distinguishing property that they are not invariant under any (Galilean or Carrollian) boost symmetry. We next consider several matter couplings both for quadratic-derivative models as well as for some higher-derivative models that have recently been considered in connection with studies on fractons.</description>

      <title>Higher symmetries, anomalies, and crossed squares in lattice gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine higher-form symmetries of quantum lattice gauge theories through the lens of homotopy theory and operator algebras. We show that in the operator-algebraic approach both higher-form symmetries and 't Hooft anomalies arise from considering restrictions of symmetry transformations to spatial regions. The data of these restrictions are naturally packaged into a higher group. For example, for gauge theories in two spatial dimensions, this information is encoded in a crossed square of groups, which is an algebraic model of a 3-group. In general, we propose that higher groups appear in lattice models and QFT as crossed n-cubes of groups via a nonabelian version of the Cech construction.</description>

      <title>Symmetry, Symmetry Topological Field Theory and von Neumann Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the additivity and Haag duality of the von Neumann algebra of a quantum field theory $\mathcal{T}_\mathcal{F}$ with 0-form (and the dual $(d-2)$-form) (non)-invertible global symmetry $\mathcal{F}$. We analyze the symmetric (uncharged) sector von Neumann algebra of $\mathcal{T}_\mathcal{F}$ with the inclusion of bi-local and bi-twist operators in it. We establish the connection between the existence of these non-local operators in $\mathcal{T}_\mathcal{F}$ and certain properties of the Lagrangian algebra $\mathcal{L}$ of the extended operators in the corresponding symmetry topological field theory (SymTFT). We prove that additivity or Haag duality of the symmetric sector von Neumann algebra is violated when $\mathcal{L}$ satisfies specific criteria, thus generalizing the result of Shao, Sorce and Srivastava to arbitrary dimensions. We further demonstrate the SymTFT construction via concrete examples in two dimensions.</description>

      <title>Supercurrents and (Partial) Supersymmetry in Adjoint QCD$_2$ and Its Generalizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $1+1$-dimensional $SU(N)$ gauge theory coupled to an adjoint Majorana fermion, also known as adjoint QCD$_2$, has the surprising feature that at fermion mass $\sqrt{\frac{g^2 N}{2 \pi}}$ it exhibits supersymmetry. In this paper, we obtain a deeper insight into how the supersymmetry works by constructing the gauge invariant, Lorentz covariant supercurrent $j_{\mu A}$. Its conservation relies crucially on the presence of a quantum anomaly. We generalize this construction to a class of models where, in addition to an adjoint Majorana fermion of an appropriate mass, the gauge theory is coupled to some collection of massless fermions ($SU(N)$ may be replaced by a more general gauge group). In general, these models have a supersymmetric massive sector and a non-supersymmetric CFT sector [arXiv:2202.04017], but there are cases in which both sectors are supersymmetric. An example of such a gapless, fully supersymmetric model is $SU(N)$ gauge theory coupled to three adjoint Majorana fermions, of which two are massless and the third has mass $\sqrt{\frac{3g^2 N}{2\pi}}$.</description>

      <title>Scattering Hawking Radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the physical consequences of scattering Hawking radiation emitted in the vicinity of the horizon of a Schwarzschild black hole. The Hawking radiation from the horizon becomes soft at a large distance away from the horizon due to the gravitational redshift, and the above process is exactly the soft theorem in curved spacetime. For an observer located at infinity, such a scattering process introduces a large gauge transformation, which can be regarded as a memory effect. The large gauge transformation is expected to encode more information about the radiation and might shed light on the black hole information paradox.</description>

      <title>Celestial Holography meets dS/CFT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a concrete link between celestial amplitudes and cosmological correlators. We first construct a map from quantum field theories (QFTs) in $(D+2)$-dimensional Euclidean space to theories on the $(D+1)$-dimensional sphere, through a Weyl rescaling and a Fourier transformation. An analytic continuation extends this map to a relation between QFTs in Minkowski spacetime $\text{M}_{D+2}$ and in de Sitter spacetime $\text{dS}_{D+1}$ with the Bunch-Davies vacuum. Combining this relation with celestial holography, we show that the extrapolated operators in de Sitter space can be represented by operators on the celestial sphere $S^{D}$. Our framework offers a systematic route to transfer computational techniques and physical insights between celestial holography and the dS/CFT correspondence.</description>

      <title>Renormalization group for effective field theories: cutoff schemes and universality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In effective field theories, the concept of renormalization of perturbative divergences is replaced by renormalization group concepts such as relevance and universality. Universality is related to cutoff scheme independence in renormalization. Three-dimensional scalar field theory with just the quartic coupling is universal but the less relevant sextic coupling introduces a cutoff scheme dependence, which we quantify by three independent parameters, in the two-loop order of perturbation theory. However, reasonable schemes only allow reduced ranges of those parameters, even contrasting the sharp cutoff with very smooth cutoffs. The sharp cutoff performs better. In any case, the effective field theory possesses some degree of universality even in the massive case (off criticality).</description>

      <title>Nilpotency Property, Physicality Criteria, Constraints and Standard BRST Algebra: A 4D Field-Theoretic System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the framework of Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) formalism, we discuss the off-shell nilpotent (anti-)BRST and the bosonic ghost-scale symmetries of a set of coupled (but equivalent) Lagrangian densities for the four (3 + 1)-dimensional (4D) combined field-theoretic system of the free Abelian 3-form and 1-form gauge theories. We demonstrate that the Noether (anti-)BRST charges are non-nilpotent due to the presence of a set of non-trivial Curci-Ferrari (CF) type restrictions on our theory. These CF-type restrictions are derived and discussed from different theoretical angles in our present endeavor. In addition to it, we obtain the nilpotent versions of the above (anti-)BRST charges from their counterparts non-nilpotent versions and discuss the physicality criteria w.r.t. the nilpotent charges to show that the physical states (existing in the total quantum Hilbert space of states) are those that are annihilated by the operator forms of the first-class constraints of our classical 4D combined field-theoretic system. The standard BRST algebra among the nilpotent (anti-)BRST charges and the bosonic ghost charge is derived, too.</description>

      <title>Gauge Symmetries, Exact Symmetries and Conserved Charges in Minimal Massive Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a three-dimensional gravitational model known as Minimal Massive Gravity (MMG), which includes an auxiliary field, using the covariant phase space method. Our analysis reveals the presence of three gauge symmetries whose algebras close via field recombination and parameter classification within this framework. Upon incorporating these additional symmetries within a specific limit of parameters, we find that the Kosmann derivative should be replaced by a novel transformation compatible with Wald's approach, which establishes a new mechanism for generating exact symmetries and constructing their corresponding conserved charge in theories with auxiliary fields, extending beyond standard methods. However, this transformation does not yield closed algebras on the space of fundamental fields. We find that this corresponds to a Lorentz vector that characterizes the approximate completeness of translation symmetry. As a result, we obtain a gauge invariant charge at a certain limit of parameters, which emerges as a nontrivial combination of the diffeomorphism charge and integrable gauge charges.</description>

      <title>Accelerated cosmological expansion from pseudo-Hermiticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that a well-studied pseudo-Hermitian field theory composed of two complex scalar fields can generate accelerated cosmological expansion through a novel mechanism. The dynamics is unique to the pseudo-Hermitian field theory, and it arises in the regime of broken antilinear symmetry, wherein a growth instability from the resulting complex eigenspectrum competes with the Hubble damping. The azimuthal components of the complex scalar fields asymptote to a constant rate of rolling at late times, reminiscent of motion around the infinite staircase of M.C. Escher's lithograph "Ascending and Descending". The resulting centripetal acceleration drives the radial components of the field away from the minimum of the potential, and the system generates a self-sustaining and constant Hubble rate at late times, even when tuning the minimum of the potential such that the classical vacuum energy is vanishing. This result evidences the potential to generate novel and physically relevant dynamics that are unique to pseudo-Hermitian field theories, and that their regimes of broken antilinear symmetry can be physically relevant in dynamical spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Searching for quantum-gravity footprint around stellar-mass black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09528v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: According to the asymptotically safe gravity, black holes may have characteristics different from those described according to general relativity if the running of the gravitational constant coupling happens at low energies. Particularly, they should be more compact, with a smaller event horizon, which in turn affects the other quantities dependent on it, like the photon ring and the size of the innermost stable circular orbit. We decided to test the latter hypothesis by searching in the literature for observational measurements of the inner radius of the accretion disk around stellar-mass black holes. We selected the smallest values measured when the disk was in high/soft state, made them homogeneous by taking into account the most recent and more reliable values of mass, spin, viewing angle, and distance from the Earth, and compared with the expectations of the Kerr metric. We do not find any significant deviation. Some doubtful cases can be easily understood as due to specific states of the object during the observation or instrumental biases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent work has identified non-compact symmetric spaces U/H as a promising class of homogeneous manifolds to develop a geometrically consistent theory of neural networks. An initial implementation of these concepts has been presented in a twin paper under the moniker of Cartan Neural Networks, showing both the feasibility and the performance of these geometric concepts in a machine learning context. The current paper expands on the mathematical structures underpinning Cartan Neural Networks, detailing the geometric properties of the layers and how the maps between layers interact with such structures to make Cartan Neural Networks covariant and geometrically interpretable. Together, these twin papers constitute a first step towards a fully geometrically interpretable theory of neural networks exploiting group-theoretic structures</description>

      <title>A Quantum Superposition of Black Hole Evaporation Histories: Recovering Unitarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Black hole evaporation is one of the most striking phenomena at the interface between gravity and quantum physics. In Hawking's semi-classical treatment, where matter is quantum mechanical and the spacetime is definite and classical, evaporation leads to an apparent loss of unitarity of the overall evolution, and to the so-called black hole information paradox. Here, we go beyond this semi-classical treatment and formulate a toy quantum model of black hole evaporation that allows the black hole to evolve into a superposition of being fully evaporated and not fully evaporated, consistent with the Hawking particles being in a coherent superposition of different energy levels. We model Hawking particle production by the repeated action of quantum-controlled unitaries, generating emission from the quantum black hole and accounting for a quantum coherent back-reaction on the black hole matter state. We show that the probability of full annihilation of the black hole matter increases with time until the black hole is, asymptotically, fully evaporated in every branch of the quantum superposition. We prove that under natural assumptions, this evaporation model is unitary, such that the initial state can in principle be recovered from the final asymptotic state of the radiation.</description>

      <title>Two scalarizations of magnetically charged black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study two scalarizations of magnetically charged black holes in the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet-scalar theory with the nonlinear electrodynamics (NED) term. For this purpose, two scalar coupling functions $f_1(\phi)$ and $f_2(\phi)$ are introduced to couple to Gauss-Bonnet (GB) and NED terms. The bald black hole is described by mass ($M$) and action parameter ($\alpha$) with magnetic charge ($P$), which becomes the quantum Oppenheimer-Snyder black hole for $P=M$ whose action is still unknown. We derive Smarr formula which describes a correct thermodynamics for the charged black hole. Two Davies points of heat capacity are not identified with two critical onset mass and action parameter for GB$^-$ scalarization with $f_1(\phi)$. Furthermore, the shadow radius analysis of charged black hole is performed to include naked singularities and it is compared to the EHT observation. There is no constraints on the action parameter, whereas new mass constraints are found. Finally, the NED$^+$ spontaneous scalarization with $f_2(\phi)$ leads to infinite branches of scalarized charged black holes.</description>

      <title>Generic EFT-motivated beyond General Relativity gravitational wave tests and their curvature dependence: from observation to interpretation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a "dictionary" to expedite the identification of potential deviations in gravitational waveforms from those predicted by General Relativity (GR) during the inspiral phase of black hole binaries. Assuming deviations from GR can be described by a local Effective Field Theory (EFT) formulated in terms of curvature operators (and possibly additional scalar fields), this dictionary characterizes how deviations scale with the masses of the binary components and identifies the leading order Post-Newtonian corrections in generic theories constructed within the EFT framework. By establishing a direct connection between observations and candidate theories beyond GR, this dictionary also aids in distinguishing genuine physical effects from systematic errors. These results can be readily incorporated into essentially all existing tests for the inspiral regime and, in particular, facilitate a more efficient combination of data from multiple events.</description>

      <title>Tightening constraints on primordial oscillations with latest ACT and SPT data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The oscillation in primordial power spectrum (PPS), a fingerprint of not only a wide class of models of inflation but new physics, is of significant theoretical interest, and can be imprinted on the cosmic microwave background (CMB). In this work, we present constraints on periodic oscillations in the PPS using the latest ACT DR6 and SPT-3G D1 CMB data with the precise measurements at high multipoles beyond the Planck angular resolution and sensitivity. It is found that the combination of SPT and ACT with Planck CMB dataset significantly tightens the upper bound to $A_\mathrm{log,lin}\lesssim 0.029$ at 95\% C.L., showing no hint for primordial oscillations, where $A_\mathrm{log,lin}$ are the amplitudes of logarithmic and linear oscillation in the PPS, respectively. Our work presents state-of-the-art CMB constraints on primordial oscillations, highlighting the power of the ground-based CMB experiments in constraining physics beyond the simplest slow-roll models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic comparison of charmonium light-front wave functions obtained through two complementary non-perturbative approaches: Basis Light-Front Quantization (BLFQ) and Dyson-Schwinger Equations (DSE). Key observables include the charge form factor, gravitational form factors, light-cone distribution amplitudes, decay constants, and two-photon transition form factors. Despite their distinct theoretical foundations and model parameters, the predictions from BLFQ and DSE exhibit remarkable agreement across all observables. This convergence validates both frameworks for studying charmonium structure and highlights the complementary strengths of Hamiltonian-based -- BLFQ -- and Lagrangian-based -- DSE -- methods in addressing non-perturbative QCD.</description>

      <title>A Non-Commutative Kalb-Ramond Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17390v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a new black hole solution within the framework of a non-commutative gauge theory applied to Kalb-Ramond gravity. Using the method recently proposed in the literature [Nucl.Phys.B 1017 (2025) 116950], we employ the Moyal twist $\partial_r \wedge \partial_\theta$ to implement non-commutativity, being encoded by parameter $\Theta$. We begin by verifying that the resulting black hole no longer possesses spherical symmetry, while the event horizon remains unaffected by non-commutative corrections. The Kretschmann scalar is computed to assess the corresponding regularity. It turns out that the solution is regular, provided that the Christoffel symbols and related quantities are not expanded to second order in $\Theta$. We derive the thermodynamic quantities, including the Hawking temperature $T^{(\Theta,\ell)}$, entropy $S^{(\Theta,\ell)}$, and heat capacity $C_V^{(\Theta,\ell)}$. The remnant mass $M_{\text{rem}}$ is estimated by imposing $T^{(\Theta,\ell)} \to 0$, although the absence of a physical remnant indicates complete evaporation. Quantum radiation for bosons and fermions is analyzed via the tunneling method, where divergent integrals are treated using the residue theorem. Notably, in the low-frequency regime, the particle number density for bosons surpasses that of fermions (at least within the scope of the methods considered here). The effective potential for a massless scalar field is obtained perturbatively, enabling the computation of quasinormal modes and the time-domain profiles. Finally, further bounds on $\Theta$ and $\ell$ (Lorentz-violating paramter) are derived from solar system tests, including the perihelion precession of Mercury, light deflection, and the Shapiro time delay.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the universal properties of the Lanczos algorithm applied to finite-size many-body quantum systems. Focusing on autocorrelation functions of local operators and on their infinite-time behaviour at finite size, we conjecture that in the large $n$ limit, the ratios between consecutive Lanczos coefficients should have specific scalings with the size of the lattice that we make precise and that depend on the hydrodynamic tail of the autocorrelation function. The scaling associated with strong or approximate zero-modes is also discussed. We support our conjecture with a numerical study of different models.</description>

      <title>Inflationary Fossils Beyond Perturbation Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we provide the missing link between two approaches aimed at characterizing the effect of long perturbation modes in Inflation. We consider the Inflationary Fossils' approach (arXiv:1203.0302 and related works) that characterizes the power-spectrum of the inflaton field in presence of other long and non dynamical fossil fields, and a technique, appeared in arXiv:2103.09244, that computes, beyond perturbation theory, the power-spectrum of a scalar field in presence of a large fluctuation of a second field. We clarify a few points on the applicability of the non-perturbative technique. We prove in five distinct cases that the non-perturbative approach, once expanded to first order in the coupling, matches the perturbative result following the Fossils' approach. We believe that this non-perturbative technique extends to all orders the Fossils' approach, resumming infinitely many diagrams of standard in-in perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>The canonical generalised Levi-Civita connection and its curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a (semi-Riemannian) generalised metric $\mathcal G$ and a divergence operator $\mathrm{div}$ on an exact Courant algebroid $E$, we geometrically construct a canonical generalised Levi-Civita connection $D^{\mathcal G, \mathrm{div}}$ for these data. In this way we provide a resolution of the problem of non-uniqueness of generalised Levi-Civita connections. Since the generalised Riemann tensor of $D^{\mathcal G, \mathrm{div}}$ is an invariant of the pair $(\mathcal G, \mathrm{div})$, we no longer need to discard curvature components which depend on the choice of the generalised connection. As a main result we decompose the generalised Riemann curvature tensor of $D^{\mathcal G, \mathrm{div}}$ in terms of classical (non-generalised) geometric data. Based on this set of master formulas we derive a comprehensive curvature tool-kit for applications in generalised geometry. This includes decompositions for the full generalised Ricci tensor, the generalised Ricci tensor, and three generalised scalar-valued curvature invariants, two of which are new.</description>

      <title>Collinear limit of the energy-energy correlator in $e^+ e^-$ collisions: transition from perturbative to non-perturbative regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the collinear limit of the energy-energy correlator (EEC) in $e^+e^-$ collisions, focusing on the transition from the perturbative QCD regime at relatively large angles to the non-perturbative region at small angles. To describe this transition, we introduce a non-perturbative jet function and perform a global analysis at NNLO+NNLL accuracy using experimental data spanning center-of-mass energies from $Q = 29.0$ to $91.2$ GeV. This marks the first accurate description of the EEC across the entire near-side region ($0^\circ&lt;\chi&lt;90^\circ$) within a unified theoretical framework. Our analysis also provides, for the first time, a quantitative extraction of the non-perturbative contribution to the EEC quark jet function, identifying a characteristic transition scale around $2.3$ GeV - distinct from the scale observed in EEC-in-jet measurements in $pp$ collisions at the LHC, which are dominated by gluon jets. These results offer the first evidence for flavor dependence (quark vs. gluon) in the EEC and provide new insights into the interplay between perturbative and non-perturbative QCD dynamics.</description>

Abstract: Black holes regain their static configuration by emitting ringdown gravitational waves, whose amplitude decays in time following a power law at fixed spatial positions. We show that the nonlinear decay power law may be obtained by simple scattering calculations using the in-in formalism and argue that the nonperturbative law should be $t^{-2\ell-1}$, where $\ell$ is the multipole of the propagating spherical gravitational wave.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the impact of diffeomorphisms where more than one nonequivalent spinor structure is built upon a given base manifold endowed with nontrivial topology. We call attention to the fact that a relatively straightforward construction evinces a lack of symmetry between fermionic modes from different spinor bundle sections, leading to a dynamic preference breaking the permutation character of diffeomorphisms on spinor structures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08693v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a quantitative holographic relation between a microscopic measure of randomness and the geometric length of the wormhole in the black hole interior. To this end, we perturb an AdS black hole with Brownian semiclassical sources, implementing the continuous version of a random quantum circuit for the black hole. We use the random circuit to prepare ensembles of states of the black hole whose semiclassical duals contain Einstein-Rosen (ER) caterpillars: long cylindrical wormholes with large numbers of matter inhomogeneities, of linearly growing length with the circuit time. In this setup, we show semiclassically that the ensemble of ER caterpillars of average length $k\ell_{\Delta}$ and matter correlation scale $\ell_{\Delta}$ forms an approximate quantum state $k$-design of the black hole. At exponentially long circuit times, the ensemble of ER caterpillars becomes polynomial-copy indistinguishable from a collection of random states of the black hole. We comment on the implications of these results for holographic circuit complexity and for the holographic description of the black hole interior.</description>

Abstract: Microcausality -- the vanishing of commutators outside the lightcone -- is a fundamental property of relativistic quantum field theories. We derive its implications for two-point functions of scalar operators on {\it Lorentz-breaking} states. We restrict to spatially homogeneous and isotropic states, at zero and finite temperature, such as finite-density states of matter and primordial inflationary states. In a mixed $(t, \vec k \, )$ representation, we find certain analyticity and exponential boundedness conditions, which we verify in a variety of examples. Crucially, we discuss how our conditions can be tested within the regime of validity of Lorentz-breaking low-energy effective field theories, clarifying the role of the group velocity of low-energy excitations. In the cosmological case, we derive a positivity condition on an EFT coefficient in an inflationary background. Lastly, we comment on how microcausality can be used to constrain higher-point correlation functions, via suitable nested commutators.</description>

Abstract: We study the sphere partition function of 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ holographic SCFTs arising on the worldvolume of $N$ coincident M2-branes in the presence of squashing and real mass deformations. We argue that the all-order large $N$ perturbative expansion of the partition function resums into a compact expression in terms of an Airy function. We provide ample evidence for this conjecture using numerical methods, saddle point analysis in the 't Hooft limit, and the relation of the squashed sphere partition function to the Cardy-like limit of the superconformal index. We also discuss the relation of our results to topological string theory and the statistical mechanics of Fermi gases. Our conjecture has a bearing on the AdS/CFT correspondence and the structure of perturbative M-theory corrections to 11d supergravity which we discuss.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05077v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In many quantum field theories (such as higher-dimensional holomorphic field theories or raviolo theories), operator product expansions of local operators can have as coefficients not only ordinary functions but also 'derived' functions with nonzero ghost number, which are certain elements of sheaf cohomology. We analyse the 'derived' functions that should appear in operator product expansions for a quantum field theory with an arbitrary number of topological, holomorphic and/or ordinary spacetime dimensions and identify necessary and sufficient conditions for such 'derived' functions to appear. In particular, theories with one topological spacetime dimension and multiple ordinary spacetime dimensions provide a smooth analogue of the (holomorphic) raviolo.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12235v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a three-parameter family of smooth and horizonless rotating solutions of Einstein-Maxwell theory with Chern-Simons term in five dimensions and discuss their stringy origin in terms of three-charge brane systems in Type IIB and M-theory. The general solution interpolates smoothly between Kerr and static Topological Star geometries. We show that for specific choices of the parameters and quantized values of the angular momentum the geometry terminates on a smooth five-dimensional cap, and it displays neither ergoregion nor closed timelike curves. We discuss the propagation of particles and waves showing that geodetic motion is integrable and the radial and angular propagation of scalar perturbations can be separated and described in terms of two ordinary differential equations of confluent Heun type.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10062v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct and analyse infinite classes of regular supergravity backgrounds dual to four-dimensional superconformal field theories (SCFTs) compactified on a circle with a supersymmetry-preserving twist. These flows lead to three-dimensional gapped QFTs preserving four supercharges. The solutions arise in Type IIB, Type IIA, and eleven-dimensional supergravity, and generalise known constructions by incorporating deformations that avoid typical singularities associated with the holographic description of the Coulomb branch of the CFT. We examine several observables: Wilson loops, holographic central charges, and complexity. We show they exhibit a universal factorisation, with each observable decomposing into a UV-CFT contribution times a flow-dependent factor. We also explore the parameter regimes where higher-curvature corrections become relevant, affecting the physical interpretation of certain observables. Our findings provide new insights into universal features of holographic RG flows and resolve a puzzle related to complexity in these systems.</description>

      <title>Bulk Spacetime Encoding via Boundary Ambiguities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12890v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a method to reconstruct the exterior of a static, planar-symmetric black hole from an infinite set of discrete momentum-space locations, known as pole-skipping points, where the boundary Green's function becomes ambiguous. The reconstruction is fully analytical and involves solving only linear equations. It further enables a reinterpretation of any pure gravitational field equation in pole-skipping data. Moreover, our method reveals that the pole-skipping points are redundant: only a subset is independent, while the rest are fixed by an equal number of homogeneous polynomial constraints. These identities are universal, independent of the details of the bulk geometry, including its dimensionality, asymptotic behavior, or the existence of a holographic duality.</description>

Abstract: It is long known that A-series minimal models and D-series minimal models are exchanged by gauging the invertible $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry. More recently, it has been shown that A-series minimal models and E-series minimal models are exchanged by gauging a non-invertible symmetry. We complete the triality picture by showing that D-series minimal models and E-series minimal models are exchanged by gauging another non-invertible symmetry.</description>

      <title>Holomorphic supergravity in ten dimensions and anomaly cancellation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06003v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We formulate a ten-dimensional version of Kodaira-Spencer gravity on a Calabi-Yau five-fold that reproduces the classical Maurer-Cartan equation governing supersymmetric heterotic moduli. Quantising this theory's quadratic fluctuations, we show that its one-loop partition function simplifies to products of holomorphic Ray-Singer torsions and exhibits an anomaly that factorises as in $SO(32)$ and $E_8\times E_8$ supergravity. Based on this, we conjecture that this theory is the $SU(5)$-twisted version of ten-dimensional $N=1$ supergravity coupled to Yang-Mills and show that is related to the type I Kodaira-Spencer theory of Costello-Li via a non-local field redefinition. The counter-terms needed to cancel the anomaly and retain gauge invariance for the one-loop effective theory reconstruct the differential of a recently discovered double-extension complex. This complex has non-tensorial extension classes and its first cohomology counts the infinitesimal moduli of heterotic compactifications modulo order $\alpha'^2$ corrections.</description>

      <title>Character of the highest weight module of BMS algebra realized on codimensional-two boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10137v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the highest weight representation (HWR) of the three and four-dimensional Bondi-Metzner-Sachs (BMS) algebra realized on the codimension-two boundary of asymptotic flat spacetime (AFS). In such a realization, the action of supertranslation shifts the conformal weight of the highest-weight states. As a result, there is no extra quantum number relating to the supertranslation. We construct the highest-weight BMS modules and compute their characters. We show that the vacuum character of BMS$_3$ exactly agrees with the 1-loop partition function of three-dimensional asymptotic flat gravity. We expect the vacuum character of BMS$_4$ may shed light on the flat holography in four dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2201.09475v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a construction of the Coulomb branch of a $3d\ {\mathcal N}=4$ gauge theory corresponding to a choice of a connected reductive group $G$ and a symplectic finite-dimensional reprsentation $\mathbf M$ of $G$, satisfying certain anomaly cancellation condition. This extends the construction of arXiv:1601.03586 (where it was assumed that ${\mathbf M}={\mathbf N}\oplus{\mathbf N}^*$ for some representation $\mathbf N$ of $G$). Our construction goes through certain "universal" ring object in the twisted derived Satake category of the symplectic group $Sp(2n)$. The construction of this object uses a categorical version of the Weil representation; we also compute the image of this object under the (twisted) derived Satake equivalence and show that it can be obtained from the theta-sheaf introduced by S.Lysenko on $\operatorname{Bun}_{Sp(2n)}({\mathbb P}^1)$ via certain Radon transform. We also discuss applications of our construction to a potential mathematical construction of $S$-duality for super-symmetric boundary conditions in 4-dimensional gauge theory and to (some extension of) the conjectures of D.Ben-Zvi, Y.Sakellaridis and A.Venkatesh.</description>

      <title>Unifying Ordinary and Null Memory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05936v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Based on a recently proposed reinterpretation of gravitational wave memory that builds up on the definition of gravitational waves pioneered by Isaacson, we provide a unifying framework to derive both ordinary and null memory from a single well-defined equation at leading order in the asymptotic expansion. This allows us to formulate a memory equation that is valid for any unbound asymptotic energy-flux that preserves local Lorentz invariance. Using Horndeski gravity as a concrete example metric theory with an additional potentially massive scalar degree of freedom in the gravitational sector, the general memory formula is put into practice by presenting the first account of the memory correction sourced by the emission of massive field waves. Throughout the work, physical degrees of freedom are identified by constructing manifestly gauge invariant perturbation variables within an SVT decomposition on top of the asymptotic Minkowski background, which will in particular prove useful in future studies of gravitational wave memory within vector tensor theories.</description>

      <title>Bunch-Davies initial conditions and non-perturbative inflationary dynamics in Numerical Relativity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06783v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that it is possible to simulate realistic inhomogeneities during cosmological inflation with high precision using {Numerical Relativity}. Stochastic initial conditions are set in line with the Bunch-Davies {vacuum} and satisfy the Hamiltonian and Momentum constraints of General Relativity to leading order in perturbation theory. The subsequent fully non-linear dynamical evolution is formulated within a family of geodesic gauges but can in principle be adapted to any choice of coordinates. We present 3 examples of inflationary dynamics: a simple quadratic potential, a potential with an inflection point and a strong resonance model. When perturbations are small, we recover standard predictions of cosmological perturbation theory, and we quantify strongly non-linear inhomogeneities when non-perturbative configurations emerge, such as in the strong resonance model. Our results pave the way towards the first realistic non-perturbative, and fully non-linear Numerical Relativity simulations of the early inflationary universe.</description>

      <title>Stellar Light Scattering as a Probe for a Braneworld-Induced Baryogenesis Scenario</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16588v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A recent baryogenesis scenario [Phys. Rev. D 110, 023520 (2024)], rooted in a two-brane Universe model, proposed a solution to the matter-antimatter asymmetry through the dynamics of a new pseudo-scalar field. In the present paper, one investigates the phenomenological consequences of this proposal. One shows that the associated boson could persist as a relic from the early Universe, forming a subdominant component of dark matter. While its overall cosmological density is small ($\approx 0.2\%$), one demonstrates that a one-loop process facilitates an ultra-weak coupling to photons, leading to a distinctive scattering signature. One argues that this effect could produce a faint, glowing halo around massive, hot stars, characterized by a unique spectral decay. Detecting or constraining this elusive light with current and future instruments like the JWST would provide a powerful and direct observational test of the underlying braneworld dynamics and its connection to baryogenesis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17032v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel systematic framework for engineering energy-momentum tensors in linearized gravity that generate gravitational fields with a prescribed multipolar structure, aimed at modeling black hole mimickers. As a concrete example, we analyze an anisotropic rotating fluid with a Gaussian-like energy-density profile which, at linearized order, satisfies all energy and causality conditions while generating a gravitational field that exactly reproduces the multipolar structure of a Kerr black hole. We then investigate the phenomenology of both the source and the induced metric, comparing our findings with the corresponding black hole limit.</description>

      <title>Momentum-Resolved Probing of Lorentz-Violating Dispersion Relations via Unruh-DeWitt Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17757v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by quantum gravity frameworks predicting Planck-scale deviations from Lorentz invariance, we probe Lorentz symmetry violation via modified dispersion relations $\omega_{|\textbf{k}|}$. Departing from conventional approaches, we employ an Unruh-DeWitt detector to probe energy-dependent modifications to the dispersion relations. Two key methodological advances are introduced: (i) a generalized formulation for detector acceleration without assuming specific dispersion relations, and (ii) a momentum-resolved detection paradigm enabling spectral decomposition of $\omega_{|\textbf{k}|}$ through localized momentum-shell integration. Analysis of deviations reveals disruption of the thermal spectrum under significant departures from the Lorentz invariance, while small perturbative regimes manifest as phase-modulated thermal distributions. By restricting detector-field interactions to narrow spectral windows and performing iterative Taylor expansions around reference momenta $|\textbf{k}_0|$, we derive coefficients encoding derivatives of $\omega_{|\textbf{k}|}$, reconstructing its global profile via momentum-space tomography. Our approach offers a scalable method to test Lorentz symmetry violation across energy scales, and establishes a foundation for experimental verification of Planck-scale relics through high-precision spectral measurements.</description>

      <title>Rotational Metric: A Solution to Einstein's Clock-Rate Problem and Its Magnetospheric Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20501v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rotational metric provides an exact solution to Einstein's clock-rate problem in curved spacetime, specifically, whether time flows more slowly at the equator of a compact object such as a neutron star than at its poles. It features a curvature singularity, an event horizon, a potentially evolving ergosphere, a rigidly-rotating normal space, and two stationary limit surfaces. Although derived from the Schwarzschild metric through rotational transformations, it includes an additional ergosphere. Given the equivalence of inertia and gravity, this demonstrates how non-inertial transformations, such as rotational transformations, can introduce new spacetime structures into a gravitational system. In particular, the additional physical degrees of freedom carried by rotational transformations are `eaten' by the gravitational system to form an additional ergosphere. Furthermore, the rotational metric effectively models a rigidly-rotating gravitational system and is applicable for describing rotationally-induced gravitational effects in various rotating magnetospheres.</description>

      <title>Extremal monomial property of q-characters and polynomiality of the X-series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00260v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The character of every irreducible finite-dimensional representation of a simple Lie algebra has the highest weight property. The invariance of the character under the action of the Weyl group W implies that there is a similar "extremal weight property" for every weight obtained by applying an element of W to the highest weight. In this paper we conjecture an analogous "extremal monomial property" of the q-characters of simple finite-dimensional modules over the quantum affine algebras, using the braid group action on q-characters defined by Chari. In the case of the identity element of W, this is the highest monomial property of q-characters proved in arXiv:math/9911112. Here we prove it for simple reflections. Somewhat surprisingly, the extremal monomial property for each w in W turns out to be equivalent to polynomiality of the "X-series" corresponding to w, which we introduce in this paper. We show that these X-series are equal to certain limits of the generalized Baxter operators for all w in W. Thus, we find a new bridge between q-characters and the spectra of XXZ-type quantum integrable models associated to quantum affine algebras. This leads us to conjecture polynomiality of all generalized Baxter operators, extending the results of arXiv:1308.3444.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22763v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Some recent studies based on numerical relativity simulations claim that slow contraction/ekpyrosis is strongly preferred over inflation as the smoothing mechanism that brought the universe into the homogeneous, isotropic and flat state we observe today on large scales. In this paper, we evaluate the likelihood of the initial conditions employed in the aforementioned simulations by estimating the probability that a free scalar field dominating the universe at the beginning of inflation or ekpyrosis will be sufficiently homogeneous on scales comparable to the Hubble radius at that time. We explore the space of parameters that characterize the initial power spectrum of the scalar field, finding that either can be more likely than the other for a fixed choice of parameters. On the other hand, when we extremize over these parameters, we find that the maximal probability for inflation is much higher than that of ekpyrosis.</description>

      <title>Maximum entropy principle for quantum processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.24079v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The maximum entropy principle, as applied to quantum systems, is a fundamental prescript positing that for a quantum system for which we only have partial knowledge, the maximum entropy state consistent with the partial knowledge is a valuable choice as the system's state. An intriguing result is that in case the only prior knowledge is of a fixed mean energy, the maximum entropy state turns out to be the thermal state, a ubiquitous state in several arenas, especially in statistical mechanics. We extend the consequences of this principle from static quantum states to dynamic quantum processes. We establish that a quantum channel attains maximal entropy under a fixed mean energy constraint if and only if it is an absolutely thermalizing channel whose fixed output is the thermal state of the same mean energy. This provides an alternative approach for understanding the emergence of absolute thermalization processes within the observable part of the universe under physically natural energy constraints. Our results have potential implications for understanding the informational and thermodynamic utility of quantum channels under physical constraints. As an application, we examine the consequences for private randomness distillation from energy-constrained quantum processes.</description>

      <title>Braneworld Dark Energy in light of DESI DR2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07193v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent observational results from the DESI collaboration reveal tensions with the standard $\Lambda$CDM model and favour a scenario in which dark energy (DE) decays over time. The DESI DR2 data also suggest that the DE equation of state (EoS) may have been phantom-like ($w &lt; - 1$) in the past, evolving to $w &gt; - 1$ at present, implying a recent crossing of the phantom divide at $w = - 1$. Scalar field models of DE naturally emerge in ultraviolet-complete theories such as string theory, which is typically formulated in higher dimensions. In this work, we investigate a broad class of $thawing~scalar~field~models$, including the simple quadratic, quartic, exponential, symmetry-breaking and axion potentials, propagating on a (4+1)-dimensional ghost-free phantom braneworld, and demonstrate that their effective EoS exhibits a phantom-divide crossing. Alongside the Hubble parameter and EoS of DE, we also analyse the evolution of the $Om$ diagnostic, and demonstrate that the time dependence of these quantities is in excellent agreement with the DESI DR2 observations. Furthermore, we perform a comprehensive parameter estimation using Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling, and find that the $\chi^2$ values for all our models are remarkably close to that of the widely used CPL parametrisation, indicating that our models fit the data very well.</description>

      <title>Properties of compact objects in quadratic non-metricity gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14591v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Astrophysical compact objects are studied in the context of quadratic non-metricity gravity. The solutions to the gravitational field equations, which include fluid components, are analyzed to investigate the density and pressure properties of radio pulsars. It is explicitly demonstrated that the theoretically stable models are consistent with astronomical data, due to the geometric features of the quadratic component. Furthermore, it is shown that, in contrast to the compactness limits of black holes in general relativity, the core density can significantly exceed the density at which nuclear saturation occurs, and the surface density can also surpass the value of nuclear saturation. Additionally, it is found that the radial sound speed remains below the conformal upper bound for sound velocity established by perturbative quantum chromodynamics.</description>
