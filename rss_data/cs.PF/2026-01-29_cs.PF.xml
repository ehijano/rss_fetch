      <title>Colored Markov Modulated Fluid Queues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Markov-modulated fluid queues (MMFQs) are a powerful modeling framework for analyzing the performance of computer and communication systems. Their distinguishing feature is that the underlying Markov process evolves on a continuous state space, making them well suited to capture the dynamics of workloads, energy levels, and other performance-related quantities. Although classical MMFQs do not permit jumps in the fluid level, they can still be applied to analyze a wide range of jump processes.
  In this paper, we generalize the MMFQ framework in a new direction by introducing {\bf colored MMFQs} and {\bf colored MMFQs with fluid jumps}. This enriched framework provides an additional form of memory: the color of incoming fluid can be used to keep track of the fluid level when certain events took place. This capability greatly enhances modeling flexibility and enables the analysis of queueing systems that would otherwise be intractable due to the curse of dimensionality or state-space explosion.</description>

      <title>The Multiserver-Job Stochastic Recurrence Equation for Cloud Computing Performance Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Multiserver-Job Queuing Model (MJQM) with general independent arrivals and service times under FCFS scheduling, using stochastic recurrence equations (SREs) and ergodic theory. We prove the monotonicity and separability properties of the MJQM SRE, enabling the application of the monotone-separable extension of Loynes' theorem and the formal definition of the MJQM stability condition. Based on these results, we introduce and implement two algorithms: one for drawing sub-perfect samples (SPS) of the system's workload and the second one to estimate the system's stability condition given the statistics of the jobs' input stream. The SPS algorithm allows for a massive GPU parallelization, greatly improving the efficiency of performance metrics evaluation. We also show that this approach extends to more complex systems, including MJQMs with typed resources.</description>

      <title>DABench-LLM: Standardized and In-Depth Benchmarking of Post-Moore Dataflow AI Accelerators for LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The exponential growth of large language models has outpaced the capabilities of traditional CPU and GPU architectures due to the slowdown of Moore's Law. Dataflow AI accelerators present a promising alternative; however, there remains a lack of in-depth performance analysis and standardized benchmarking methodologies for LLM training. We introduce DABench-LLM, the first benchmarking framework designed for evaluating LLM workloads on dataflow-based accelerators. By combining intra-chip performance profiling and inter-chip scalability analysis, DABench-LLM enables comprehensive evaluation across key metrics such as resource allocation, load balance, and resource efficiency. The framework helps researchers rapidly gain insights into underlying hardware and system behaviors, and provides guidance for performance optimizations. We validate DABench-LLM on three commodity dataflow accelerators, Cerebras WSE-2, SambaNova RDU, and Graphcore IPU. Our framework reveals performance bottlenecks and provides specific optimization strategies, demonstrating its generality and effectiveness across a diverse range of dataflow-based AI hardware platforms.</description>
