      <title>Ambush strategy enhances organisms' performance in rock-paper-scissors games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a five-species cyclic system wherein individuals of one species strategically adapt their movements to enhance their performance in the spatial rock-paper-scissors game. Environmental cues enable the awareness of the presence of organisms targeted for elimination in the cyclic game. If the local density of target organisms is sufficiently high, individuals move towards concentrated areas for direct attack; otherwise, they employ an ambush tactic, maximising the chances of success by targeting regions likely to be dominated by opponents. Running stochastic simulations, we discover that the ambush strategy enhances the likelihood of individual success compared to direct attacks alone, leading to uneven spatial patterns characterised by spiral waves. We compute the autocorrelation function and measure how the ambush tactic unbalances the organisms' spatial organisation by calculating the characteristic length scale of typical spatial domains of each species. We demonstrate that the threshold for local species density influences the ambush strategy's effectiveness, while the neighbourhood perception range significantly impacts decision-making accuracy. The outcomes show that long-range perception improves performance by over 60\%, although there is potential interference in decision-making under high attack triggers. Understanding how organisms' adaptation to their environment enhances their performance may be helpful not only for ecologists but also for data scientists aiming to improve artificial intelligence systems.</description>

      <title>Emergence of rogue-like waves in a reaction-diffusion system: Stochastic output from deterministic dissipative dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18349v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rogue waves are an intriguing nonlinear phenomenon arising across different scales, ranging from ocean waves through optics to Bose-Einstein condensates. We describe the emergence of rogue-like wave dynamics in a reaction-diffusion system that arise as a result of a subcritical Turing instability. This state is present in a regime where all time-independent states are unstable, and consists of intermittent excitation of spatially localized spikes, followed by collapse to an unstable state and subsequent regrowth. We characterize the spatiotemporal organization of spikes and show that in sufficiently large domains the dynamics are consistent with a memoryless process.</description>
