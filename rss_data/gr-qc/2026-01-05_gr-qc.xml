      <title>From Rotating Attractors to Extremal Black Holes with Axionic Hair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study extremal, rotating black holes in four-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell-axion (EMA) theory through a combined near-horizon and bulk analysis. At the level of the near-horizon extremal geometry (NHEG), using the entropy function formalism, we prove that regular rotating attractors with axionic hair exist only for configurations that are purely electrically or purely magnetically charged; regular rotating dyonic attractors are excluded by the axion equation of motion, a result that we established perturbatively and non-perturbatively within the NHEG system. On the global side, we construct families of asymptotically flat, rotating extremal EMA black holes that interpolate to the electric NHEG branch, confirming that horizon data are fixed by extremization of the entropy function and decoupled from asymptotic moduli in line with the attractor mechanism.</description>

      <title>Gravitation and Spacetime: Emergent from Spinor Interactions -- How?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Newtonian gravity arises as the nonrelativistic, static, weak-field limit of some Lorentzian spacetime geometry solving the generally covariant Einstein equations for a given matter field configuration. Spacetime geometry has a local description in the spinor basis of Penrose. The breakdown of relativistic quantum (field) theory at small distances suggests that, the Lorentzian geometry is to be modified below some regularization length. The thermodynamic correspondence, e.g. for black holes or other horizons, indicates that, Lorentzian spacetime is an emergent geometric description of an ensemble of more fundamental constituents. The independent derivations of the area law of the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy by string theory and loop quantum gravity show that, (some) properties of spacetime do not depend on the nature of its fundamental constituents (in leading order).
  Whether, on a fundamental scale, spacetime gravity has its own classical or quantum constituents (like e.g. in loop quantum gravity), or it is just an effective theory, deriving from expectation values of quantum matter operators (like in spinor gravity or causal fermion systems), this is still open. We compare some very different classical and quantum approaches to spacetime geometry, all deriving in one way or another from spinors, and comment on questions for future research in order to clarify their relations. We propose that both, the causal structure and the spin networks for generation of discrete geometry arise via projection from all particle spinors (fermionic and bosonic) within a causal double cone region and their spin interwining interaction events onto a spatial section of this double cone region.</description>

      <title>Metric Reconstruction and Second Order Perturbation for Generic Spherically Symmetric spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Higher-order perturbations during the ringdown phase are essential for testing gravitational theories. This requires a perturbation framework that extends beyond General Relativity, as well as an appropriate method for reconstructing the spacetime metric. In this work, we address these challenges within the context of general spherically symmetric spacetimes. We introduce a modified Teukolsky equation for perturbative calculations in asymptotically flat, spherically symmetric spacetimes. The metric reconstruction method, which does not rely on the Hertz potential, is extended to $tr$-symmetric spacetime, allowing for the calculation of metric components under specific gauge conditions. Additionally, we present a second-order perturbation theory applicable to generic spherically symmetric spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Tails and Transient Behaviors of Quantum-Corrected Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational wave astronomy plays a pivotal role in testing the dynamics of gravity in strong-field regimes and probing the nature of black holes. Motivated by recent studies on late-time tails in gravitational waves, we examine the gravitational wave tails of black holes incorporating quantum corrections within the framework of effective Loop Quantum Gravity. Our findings indicate that both the amplitudes and the intermediate behavior of these tails are influenced by quantum corrections. We demonstrate that the amplitude and transient characteristics of the tail are sensitive to the specific details of the black hole's dynamics.</description>

      <title>Imprints of quantum gravity effects on gravitational waves: a comparative study using extreme mass-ratio inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within a generally covariant Hamiltonian framework of loop quantum gravity (LQG), two black hole models parameterized by a quantum correction $\zeta$ have recently been constructed. Using extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) as high-precision probes, we investigate the imprints of this LQG deformation in the surrounding spacetime. Waveforms generated via an improved augmented analytic kludge (AAK) model in both LQG-BH backgrounds and in Schwarzschild spacetime are compared through a faithfulness analysis. This allows us to quantify the detectability of the deviation with LISA and to derive constraints on $\zeta$ based on a detection threshold. We find that the first LQG-BH model produces significantly stronger signatures in EMRI signals than the second, making its quantum gravity effects more accessible to future space-borne gravitational-wave detection.</description>

      <title>Dynamical constraints on variable vacuum energy in Brans-Dicke theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this research work, we investigate the late-time accelerated expansion of the universe within the framework of Brans-Dicke theory by considering dynamical vacuum energy models with a time-varying cosmological constant. Two vacuum energy models are studied, namely the hybrid vacuum law $\Lambda(t)=\alpha H^{2}+\beta\dot{H}$ and the power vacuum law $\Lambda(H)=\alpha_{1}H^{n}$, where $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\alpha_{1}$ and $n$ are free parameters. We derive analytical solutions for the Hubble parameter and other relevant cosmological quantities. The evolution of the deceleration parameter, the effective equation of state, the cosmographic parameters and the present age of the universe are also analyzed.</description>

      <title>Taxonomy of periodic orbits and gravitational waves in a deformed Schwarzschild black hole spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate periodic orbits of test particles around a deformed Schwarzschild black hole and the resulting gravitational waves. Firstly, we examine the properties of circular orbits and find that circular orbits could disappear when the deformation is large enough. Then, using an orbital taxonomy, we characterize various periodic orbits with a set of triples, which describes the zoom-whirl behaviours. We also calculate the gravitational waveform signals generated by different periodic orbits, revealing the influence of the deformation on the gravitational wave, which can be potentially picked up by future space-based detectors.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of electric-magnetic spacetimes with massive particle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uniqueness of the four-dimensional static, asymptotically flat, Einstein-Maxwell spacetime with both electric and magnetic charges, containing non-extremal massive particle sphere, being an inner boundary in it, has been proved. It is isometric to Reissner-Nordstr\"om spacetime with electric/magnetic charges. In contrast to the previous results concerning the classification of photon spheres, it describes the existence of the entire set of spacetme foliations, a set of massive particle sphere addressed to the various energies of the particles. The conformal positive energy, positive mass theorem and adequate conformal transformations constitute the mail tools in the proof.</description>

      <title>Interacting Ghost Dark Energy with Sign-Changeable Coupling in Brans-Dicke Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we analyze the ghost dark energy model in Brans-Dicke cosmology in the framework of a flat Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker universe. We consider an interaction between ghost dark energy and dark matter with a sign-changeable interaction term. To discuss the cosmological implications of the model, we consider a well-motivated logarithmic form of the Brans-Dicke scalar field. By deriving the cosmological evolution equations, we obtain the cosmological parameters such as the equation of state and deceleration parameters. We analyze the behavior of the cosmological parameters by plotting their graphs against the redshift parameter ($z$). We observe that the equation of state parameter shows quintessence-like behaviour during present and future epochs; however, phantom-like behavior is also possible for suitable values of the model parameters. Analysis of the deceleration parameter shows a smooth recent phase transition of the universe (deceleration to acceleration). An interesting result we observe is the decelerated expansion of the universe in the far future, i.e, the universe experiences another phase transition in the future. The physical significance of the well-known cosmological plane ($w_D-w_D'$ plane) is discussed in our model. We observe that the trajectories start in the freezing region with the same initial behavior, deviate from each other during the evolution and ends in the thawing region. Finally, we perform a detailed thermodynamic analysis and demonstrate that the generalized second law of thermodynamics is satisfied within the present interacting ghost dark energy model.</description>

      <title>Massless graviton in de Sitter as second sound in two-fluid hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of gravitons and their masses, clear in the case of Minkowski spacetime, remains ambiguous for de Sitter spacetime. Here, we used a two-fluid approach to de Sitter thermodynamics and found a collective mode that is analogous to second sound in the two-fluid dynamics of the de Sitter state. This mode is massless and propagates at the speed of light. This suggests that this second-sound analog is a massless graviton propagating in de Sitter spacetime. The type of graviton this mode represents requires further consideration.</description>

      <title>Exceptional Lines and Excitation of (Nearly) Double-Pole Quasinormal Modes: A Semi-Analytic Study in the Nariai Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that quasinormal modes (QNMs) of a massive scalar field in Kerr-de Sitter and Myers-Perry black holes exhibit an exceptional line (EL), which is a continuous set of exceptional points (EPs) in parameter space, at which two QNM frequencies and their associated solutions coincide. We find that the EL appears in the parameter space spanned by the scalar mass and the black hole spin parameter, and also in the Nariai limit, i.e., $r_{\rm c} - r_{\rm h} \to 0$, where $r_{\rm c}$ and $r_{\rm h}$ denote the radii of the cosmological and black hole horizons, respectively. We analytically study the amplitudes or excitation factors of QNMs near the EL. Such an analytic treatment becomes possible since, in the Nariai limit, the perturbation equation reduces to a wave equation with the P\"{o}schl-Teller (PT) potential. We discuss the destructive excitation of QNMs and the stability of the ringdown near and at the EL. The transient linear growth of QNMs -- a characteristic excitation pattern near an EP or EL -- together with the conditions under which this linear growth dominates the early ringdown, is also studied analytically. Our conditions apply to a broad class of systems that involve the excitation of (nearly) double-pole QNMs.</description>

      <title>Extremalization approach to black hole thermodynamics: perturbations around higher-derivative gravities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When higher-derivative terms are added to a gravitational action, black hole solutions and their thermodynamic properties are generally corrected. Recent progress has shown that, by treating higher-derivative operators as perturbations, the first-order corrections to black hole thermodynamics can be obtained without explicit knowledge of the corresponding perturbed black hole solutions. This result can be understood as a consequence of an extremalization principle underlying the Euclidean action formulation of black hole thermodynamics. In this work, we emphasize that this extremalization approach is not restricted to perturbations around Einstein gravity. Instead, it can be applied to perturbations of more general higher-derivative gravity theories whose black hole solutions are already known and can be taken as the zeroth-order background. As an explicit illustration, we consider Einstein--Gauss--Bonnet gravity as the zeroth-order theory and study the first-order thermodynamic corrections induced by further higher-order curvature operators. We show that these corrections can be derived without solving the perturbed black hole solutions, both in asymptotically flat and asymptotically AdS spacetimes.</description>

      <title>A 3+1 Perturbative Approach to the Cosmic Dynamo Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we analyze the evolution of PMFs within a perturbed Friedmann-Lema\^{\i}tre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) spacetime using the formalisms of Numerical Relativity (NR). We apply the 3+1 decomposition to first-order cosmological perturbations to derive the cosmological dynamo equation under the kinematic-dynamo approximation. Our objective is to study the interaction between the seed magnetic field and the growing modes of scalar perturbations, whose associated velocity fields are evolved numerically using the software \texttt{Einstein Toolkit} and \texttt{FLRWSolver}. We find that these velocity fields effectively drive the amplification of the PMF, demonstrating that the extent of this growth is dependent on the electrical conductivity of the cosmic medium. Our findings provide a computational description linking primordial magnetogenesis to the evolution of magnetic seeds, ultimately explaining the ubiquity of large-scale magnetic fields in the universe</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inflationary production of massive dark photons with non-minimal couplings to gravity shows surprising growth at large momenta. These couplings appear in the effective low energy description of a more fundamental theory. We find that the growth is absent in explicit gauge invariant UV-complete models. Such completions are also free of "ghost" instabilities, which often appear in the effective models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13284v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Open effective field theories provide a systematic framework for describing systems coupled to an environment, where dissipation, noise, and modified conservation laws naturally arise. Working within the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism, we examine open extensions of three well-studied theories: the superfluid, Maxwell theory, and Einstein gravity. In gauge and gravitational theories, open terms that break advanced symmetries while preserving physical ones are not automatically consistent; they are allowed only if they lead to deformed identities among the equations of motion. We explicitly construct such a term in open gravity and show that it leads to a consistent deformation of the diffeomorphism identities.</description>

      <title>A pathway to non-perturbative Quantum Affine Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19315v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore a new route toward a non-perturbative quantization of gravity based on a purely affine formulation, where the affine connection is the fundamental field and the metric, when it exists, emerges as a derived quantity. Starting from the Palatini formulation of General Relativity, we recall how an equivalent Eddington-type purely affine action arises at the classical level under mild assumptions. A key feature for the non-perturbative program is that, in the pure gravity case, for a positive cosmological constant, the action is bounded below, allowing one to define a well-posed statistical ensemble of connections. We discretize this theory on a fixed hypercubic lattice and construct the corresponding partition function, including torsionful and torsionless ensembles. We provide an open C++ Monte Carlo implementation that can simulate these ensembles in arbitrary dimension, and we present proof-of-principle results in two dimensions.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the holographic mixed-state entanglement measures in the Einstein-Maxwell-Scalar (EMS) theory. Several quantities are computed, including the holographic entanglement entropy (HEE), mutual information (MI), entanglement wedge cross-section (EWCS), and butterfly velocity ($v_B$). Our findings demonstrate that these measures can effectively diagnose phase transitions. Notably, EWCS and MI, as mixed-state entanglement measures, exhibit behavior opposite to that of the HEE. Additionally, we study the butterfly velocity, a dynamic quantum information measure, and observe that it behaves differently from the static quantum information measures. We propose that the butterfly velocity is initially dominated by entanglement and subsequently by thermal entropy as the coupling constant increases. Moreover, we examine the scaling behavior of the holographic entanglement measures and find that all the critical exponents are equal to $1$, which is twice that of the scalar field. We also explore the inequality between EWCS and MI, noting that the growth rate of MI consistently exceeds that of EWCS during phase transitions. These features are expected to be universal across thermodynamic phase transitions, with the inequalities becoming more significant as one moves away from the critical point.</description>

      <title>Diagnosing Metal-Insulator and Hawking-Page Transitions: A Mixed-State Entanglement Perspective in Einstein-Born-Infeld-Massive Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study mixed-state entanglement measures in Einstein-Born-Infeld (EN-BI) massive gravity theory, a model exhibiting both Hawking-Page transitions and metal-insulator transitions (MIT) at finite temperatures. Our comprehensive investigation reveals that the entanglement wedge cross-section (EWCS), a novel mixed-state entanglement measure, demonstrates unique properties in detecting phase transitions. For MIT, we find the higher-order terms of EWCS align closely with the critical point, outperforming measures like holographic entanglement entropy (HEE) and mutual information (MI) in finite temperature systems. This enhanced sensitivity provides a more accurate tool for probing quantum phase transitions in strongly correlated systems. In Hawking-Page transitions, we observe that all entanglement measures effectively diagnose both first-order and second-order phase transitions, with EWCS showing configuration-independent behavior. Importantly, we discover that all geometry-related quantities, including entanglement measures, demonstrate a universal critical exponent of 1/3 near the second-order phase transition point, suggesting fundamental connections between quantum information theory and critical phenomena in gravitational systems. Our results highlight EWCS's potential as a powerful probe for phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Soft Algebras in AdS$_4$ from Light Ray Operators in CFT$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flat Minkowski space (M$^4$) and AdS$_4$ can both be conformally mapped to the Einstein cylinder. The maps may be judiciously chosen so that some null generators of the $\mathcal{I}^+$ boundary of M$^4$ coincide with antipodally-terminating null geodesic segments on the boundary of AdS$_4$. Conformally invariant nonabelian gauge theories in M$^4$ have an asymptotic $S$-algebra generated by a tower of soft gluons given by weighted null line integrals on $\mathcal{I}^+$. We show that, under the conformal map to AdS$_4$, the leading soft gluons are dual to light transforms of the conserved global symmetry currents in the boundary CFT$_3$. The tower of light ray operators obtained from the $SO(3,2)$ descendants of this light transform realize a full set of generators of the $S$-algebra in the boundary CFT$_3$. This provides a direct connection between holographic symmetry algebras in M$^4$ and AdS$_4$.</description>

      <title>Isotropic stochastic gravitational wave background reconstruction for Taiji constellation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.00169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stochastic gravitational wave background is a broadband target from diverse astrophysical and cosmological sources. The background falls within the mHz frequency band could become a potential observable for future space-based interferometers. Taiji, a proposed space mission slated for launch in the 2030s, will enable the study of such a background. However, the unique characteristics of space missions pose distinctive challenges for separating the stochastic background from instrumental noise. To address the data analysis requirements, we develop a preliminary pipeline to search for the SGWB and evaluate its performance with Taiji simulation datasets. At present, we demonstrate that the algorithm can successfully recover the parameters of injected background with a known spectral density after setting aside the complication of galactic binaries foreground. Furthermore, by employing the trans-dimensional Markov Chain Monte Carlo method, we extend the analysis to reconstruct the background with unknown spectral morphology.</description>

Abstract: Assuming that Dark Matter is an ultralight scalar field which is coupled to electromagnetism via a gauge-kinetic function and which at the time of recombination is oscillating coherently over a Hubble patch, we show that there is a tachyonic instability for the gauge field modes which leads to the generation of magnetic fields on cosmological scales of sufficient amplitude to explain observations.</description>

      <title>Terrestrial Test of Shapiro Time Delay: Forth test of Einstein General Theory of Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Shapiro time delay is one of the four classical tests of Einstein general theory of relativity and is commonly interpreted as a constrain on the parametrized post Newtonian (PPN) parameter gamma, which is exactly unity in general relativity. To date all measurement of the Shapiro time delay have been confined to astrophysical and solar system observations, yielding constrains on the PPN parameter gamma at the 10-5 level. In this work, we propose a fiber based Sagnac interferometer for precision terrestrial measurements of the Shapiro time delay, enabling a laboratory scale determination of gamma with an intrinsic sensitivity approaching 10-9. This approach provides an independent test of general relativity in a previously unexplored regime.</description>

      <title>Late-Time Resolution of the Hubble Tension in CPL Cosmology with Massive Neutrinos via Bayesian Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive Bayesian analysis of the Hubble constant within the framework of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), focusing on the standard $\Lambda$CDM model and its dynamical dark energy extensions described by the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization, both with and without massive neutrinos. By embedding the cosmological background equations directly into a Bayesian PINN architecture, we reconstruct the Hubble expansion history $H(z)$ in a data-driven yet physically consistent manner, while rigorously propagating epistemic uncertainties. Our analysis combines late-time observational probes, including Cosmic Chronometers, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO DESI DR2), and the Pantheon supernova sample, and quantifies the resulting tension in the inferred Hubble constant with respect to Planck 2018 Cosmic Microwave Background constraints and the SH0ES (R22) local distance ladder measurement. Within $\Lambda$CDM, we find that data combinations involving BAO tend to favor lower values of $H_0$, alleviating the tension with Planck at the expense of increased disagreement with SH0ES. Allowing for a time-evolving dark energy equation of state in the CPL framework systematically shifts the posterior of $H_0$ toward higher values, leading to a notable reduction of the SH0ES tension, particularly for combinations including supernova data. The most flexible scenario, CPL with a free total neutrino mass $\Sigma m_\nu$, yields a balanced reconciliation between early- and late-Universe determinations of $H_0$, with tension levels typically reduced to the $\sim1$-$2\sigma$ range relative to both Planck and SH0ES. Our results highlight the nontrivial interplay between dark energy dynamics and neutrino mass in addressing the Hubble tension and demonstrate the efficacy of Bayesian PINNs as a robust and versatile tool for precision cosmology beyond the standard paradigm.</description>

      <title>Dissecting the Hubble tension: Insights from a diverse set of Sound Horizon-free H0 measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Hubble tension is commonly framed as a discrepancy between local, late-time measurements favoring $H_0 \approx 73$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ and early-time, Sound-Horizon-based measurements favoring $H_0 \approx 67$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. We challenge this viewpoint by analyzing 83 Sound-Horizon-independent $H_0$ measurements, categorized into four classes: Distance Ladder measurements using local calibrators; Local One-Step $\Lambda$CDM measurements assuming the standard expansion history; Pure Local One-Step measurements independent of $H(z)$ shape; and CMB Sound Horizon free measurements using CMB data without the Sound Horizon scale. We find that the 29 Distance Ladder measurements yield $H_0 = 72.74 \pm 0.40$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ ($\chi^2_\nu \equiv \chi^2/d.o.f= 0.74$), while the 54 One-Step measurements collectively yield $H_0 = 68.67 \pm 0.46$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ ($\chi^2_\nu = 0.85$), a $6.7\sigma$ tension exceeding the Planck--SH0ES discrepancy. This tension remains significant at $4.5\sigma$ after accounting for correlations. Among One-Step categories, Local One-Step $\Lambda$CDM measurements favor the lowest value ($H_0 = 67.18 \pm 0.90$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$), Pure Local One-Step yield an intermediate value ($H_0 = 70.38 \pm 1.00$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$), and CMB Sound Horizon Free measurements give $H_0 = 68.71 \pm 0.63$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. Thus, that the Hubble tension is better characterized as a discrepancy between the Distance Ladder and all other methodologies, rather than an early-vs-late-time split. We also identify a $2.4\sigma$ internal tension among One-Step measurements: analyses assuming $\Lambda$CDM systematically recover lower $H_0$ values by about 3.2 km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ compared to model-independent methods. This suggests either unrecognized systematics/physics in the Distance Ladder or deviations from $\Lambda$CDM in the late-time Universe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.00790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Right-handed neutrinos are naturally induced by dark extra dimension models and play an essential role in neutrino oscillations. The model parameters can be examined by the long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiments. In this work, we compute the predicted neutrino oscillation spectra within/without extra dimension models and compare them with the experimental data. We find that the neutrino data in the T2K and NOvA experiments are compatible with the standard neutrino oscillation hypothesis. The results set the stringent exclusion limit on the extra dimension model parameters at a high confidence level. The derived constraints on dark dimension right-handed neutrinos are complementary to those results from the collider experiments and cosmological observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13946v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Euclidean path integral approach to quantum gravity is conventionally formulated in terms of the Einstein-Hilbert-York-Gibbons-Hawking action, which requires suitable subtractions to produce the correct black hole partition function. However, there is a unique, canonical teleparallel reformulation which reproduces the same results without subtractions or other ambiguities. This is verified in the case of a black hole with or without an electric or a magnetic charge and in a background with or without a cosmological constant. Moreover, a new quasilocal prescription is proposed and tested, where the black hole partition function is determined solely by the horizon boundary term, yielding the correct Helmholtz free energy without the need for counterterms.</description>

      <title>Motion of spinning particles in the Kerr-Newman black hole exterior. I. Periodic orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05603v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The motion of a spinning particle in the exterior of a Kerr-Newman black hole is studied. The dynamics is governed by the Mathisson-Papapetrou equations in the pole-dipole approximation, including the spin-curvature coupling to leading order in the spin. In terms of conserved quantities, the dynamical equations in Mino time can be transformed into the integral form for both aligned and misaligned spins with respect to the orbital motion. These non-geodesic equations can be solved analytically with the solutions involving Jacobi elliptic functions. The radial potential is derived to study the particle's parameter space for various types of orbits, based on its roots corrected by the particle's spin. We consider equatorial motion oscillating between two turning points, which are the two outermost roots of the radial potential, in the misaligned case. In this case, there is an induced oscillatory motion out of the equatorial plane. In particular, the periods of the motion are obtained explicitly. When the orbits become a source of gravitational-wave emission, these periods of motion will play a key role in determining gravitational-wave signals in the frequency domain. Numerical kludge waveforms are constructed. The gravitational-wave amplitudes are found to be sensitive to the turning points of the orbits. The implications for gravitational-wave emission due to extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) are discussed.</description>

Abstract: We investigate $P$-$V$ criticality, with a focus on Ruppeiner geometry, in the extended phase space of Hayward anti-de Sitter (AdS) black holes. Through thermodynamic analysis, we confirm that Hayward-AdS black holes undergo distinct $P$-$V$ phase transitions and exhibit well-defined critical phenomena in the vicinity of their critical points. These behaviors are characterized by four critical exponents that typically obey the scaling laws predicted by mean-field theory--indicating a consistent thermodynamic framework with classical phase transition systems ($e.g.,$ van der Waals fluids). Furthermore, we employ Ruppeiner geometry to probe the thermodynamic fluctuations of Hayward-AdS black holes, and by calculating the corresponding curvature scalar, we gain direct insights into the interaction nature of the black hole's microscopic constituents.</description>

      <title>Holographic dark energy in modified Kaniadakis cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11569v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well-known that any modification to the entropy expression not only change the energy density of the holographic dark energy, but also modifies the cosmological field equations through thermodynamics-gravity correspondence. Here we propose a Kaniadakis holographic dark energy (KHDE) in the background of the modified Kaniadakis cosmology by incorporating the effects of Kaniadakis entropy into the Friedmann equations. We choose the Hubble radius, $L=H^{-1}$, as system's IR cutoff and determine the cosmological implications of this model. We first consider a dark energy (DE) dominated universe and reveal that this model mimics the cosmological constant with $w_{DE}=-1$. This implies that the theoretical origin of the cosmological constant, $\Lambda$, may be understood through KHDE in the context of Kaniadakis cosmology. Remarkably, we observe that in the absence of interaction between DE and dark matter (DM), and in contrast to HDE in standard cosmology, our model can explain the current acceleration of the cosmic expansion for the Hubble radius as IR cutoff. When the interaction between DE and DM is taken into account, we see that the total equation of state parameter (EoS), $w_{tot}=p_{tot}/\rho_{tot}$ can cross the phantom line at the present time. We also analyze the squared speed of sound, $v_s^2$, for this model and find out that $(v_s^2&lt;0)$ for interacting KHDE. Investigating the statefinder, confirms the distinction between KHDE and $\Lambda$CDM model. It is seen that the statefinder diagram move away from the point of $\left\lbrace r,s\right\rbrace= \left\lbrace 1,0\right\rbrace$ with increasing the interaction parameter.</description>

Abstract: The claim in \cite{Al-Badawi:2025ipr} that *"the errors in the foundational components (3) and (5) of Ref. [1] invalidate all subsequent analyses, numerical results, and physical interpretations that depend on them"* is **entirely unfounded**. This statement reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of the typographical nature of the error and appears to be a misplaced critique originating from a competing author, rather than a substantive assessment of the results, which remain fully valid.</description>

Abstract: We prove the Penrose inequality with angular momentum for asymptotically flat, axisymmetric vacuum initial data sets containing a stable marginally outer trapped surface. This inequality provides a lower bound for the ADM mass in terms of the area and angular momentum of the black hole horizon, with equality holding if and only if the initial data set corresponds to a slice of the Kerr spacetime. Our proof combines the Jang equation approach with the p-harmonic level set method. A key component of the analysis is a modified Hawking mass functional that incorporates angular momentum and exhibits monotonicity along the flow. We also establish the rigidity of the inequality using the Mars-Simon tensor.</description>

      <title>Physical Effects of Gravitational Waves at Second Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15704v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is currently no rigorous definition of gravitational wave strain at second order in cosmological perturbation theory. The usual association of gravitational waves with transverse and traceless fluctuations of the metric on spatial hypersurfaces becomes ambiguous at second order, as it inherently depends on the spacetime slicing. While this poses no practical issues in linearized gravity, it presents a fundamental problem for secondary gravitational waves, especially notorious for gravitational waves induced by primordial fluctuations. We compute, for the first time, the physical effects of gravitational waves at second order, as measured by geodesic observers that emit and receive electromagnetic signals, thereby settling the debate on gauge ambiguities. We find that the measured gravitational wave strain coincides with the transverse-traceless components in the Newton gauge.</description>

      <title>Multi-messenger detectability of continuous gravitational waves from the near future to next generation detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22938v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Continuous gravitational waves have the potential to transform gravitational wave astronomy and yield fresh insights into astrophysics, nuclear and particle physics, and condensed matter physics. We evaluate their detectability by combining various theoretical and observational arguments from the literature and systematically applying those arguments to known astronomical objects and future gravitational wave detectors. We detail and update previous estimates made in support of Cosmic Explorer [M. Evans et al., arXiv:2306.13745; I. Gupta et al., Class. Quantum Grav. 41, 245001 (2024)]. It is commonly argued that the spins of accreting neutron stars are regulated by gravitational wave emission and that millisecond pulsars contain a young pulsar's magnetic field buried under accreted material. If either of these arguments holds, the first detection of continuous gravitational waves is likely with near future upgrades of current detectors, and many detections are likely with next generation detectors such as Cosmic Explorer and the Einstein Telescope. A lack of detections in the next several years would begin to raise serious doubts about current theories of millisecond pulsar formation.</description>

      <title>Colloquium: Multimessenger astronomy with continuous gravitational waves and future detectors</title>

Abstract: Continuous gravitational waves from rapidly rotating neutron stars are on the new frontiers of gravitational wave astrophysics and have strong connections to electromagnetic astronomy, nuclear astrophysics, and condensed matter physics. In this Colloquium I survey prospects for detection of continuous gravitational waves from various neutron star populations, especially aided by electromagnetic observations. Although there are caveats, current theories and observations suggest that the first detections are likely within a few years, and that many are likely in the era of next generation detectors such as Cosmic Explorer and the Einstein Telescope. I also survey what can be learned from these signals, each one of which will contain more cycles than all the compact binary mergers ever detected. Since continuous gravitational wave emission mechanisms depend on aspects of neutron star physics, such as crustal elasticity, which are not well constrained by current astronomical observations and physical experiments, their detection can tell us a great deal that is new about extreme matter. Even more can be learned by combining gravitational wave observations with data from the Square Kilometre Array, the Next Generation Very Large Array, FAST, and other electromagnetic detectors operating in the next generation era.</description>

      <title>Lense-Thirring Acoustic Black Holes : Shadows and Light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23113v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the Lense-Thirring Acoustic Black Hole (LTABH), motivated by the relevance of analogue models for black holes embedded in various physical systems, such as the cosmological microwave background or quantum superfluids. We investigate the LTABH spacetime geometry, showing that the roots of the metric function determine a partition of the spacetime into four regions, depending on the acoustic parameter $\xi $ (whereas the dependence vanishes for the rotation parameter $a$); on the other hand, the parameter $a$ turns out to affect the critical radii associated to the maxima of the effective potential. All in all, both the acoustic sphere radius $r_{as}$ and the photon sphere radius $r_{ps}$, respectively giving rise to the acoustic shadow $R_{as}$ and to the optical shadow $R_{s}$, depend on $\xi $ and $a$. More precisely, the rotation parameter $a$ is more relevantly affecting $R_{s}$ (through a right shift), while $R_{as}$ retains its circular shape. For what concerns the acoustic parameter, we notice that the higher $\xi $ is, the larger the size of both shadows. All of these results are confirmed through a detailed analysis of the distortions and of the shadows radii. Moreover, by deriving the magnitude of the precession frequency $\Omega $, we observe that it significantly increases near the acoustic horizons, both in the extremal and in the non-extremal cases, which implies that the Lense-Thirring (frame dragging) effect, which can be traced back to $\xi $ itself, becomes important near such regions. On the other hand, we also show that there are regions of the LTABH spacetime in which $% \Omega $ vanishes, suggesting that therein possible probe particles would not be affected by the frame dragging at all. Finally, we derive the deflection of the light near the LTABH.</description>

      <title>Impact of Anisotropy on Neutron Star Structure and Curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24194v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of pressure anisotropy on the structural and geometric properties of neutron stars within general relativity, focusing primarily on the phenomenological Bowers-Liang (BL) model, and comparing selected results with a quasi-local prescription. Using the SLy equation of state, we explore how anisotropic stresses modify global observables such as the mass-radius relation, moment of inertia, compactness, and tidal deformability over a broad range of anisotropy parameters. We find that moderate positive anisotropy can increase the maximum supported mass up to approximately $2.4\;M_\odot$ and enhance stellar compactness by up to $20\%$ relative to isotropic configurations, while remaining broadly consistent with current NICER and gravitational-wave constraints.
  To probe the internal gravitational field, we compute curvature invariants including the Ricci scalar, the Ricci tensor contraction, the Kretschmann scalar, and the Weyl scalar. We show that curvature measures directly tied to the matter distribution exhibit a strong sensitivity to anisotropy, whereas the Weyl curvature remains comparatively insensitive, reflecting its role as a measure of the free gravitational field. Within the phenomenological BL framework, the maximum compactness increases with anisotropy and reaches values as high as $\mathcal{C}_{\max}\approx 0.25$-$0.38$ for $\lambda_{\rm BL}\in[-4,+4]$, although the physical realizability of such highly compact configurations depends sensitively on the underlying anisotropy mechanism. A comparison with the quasi-local model highlights the strong model dependence of anisotropic effects, underscoring both the potential significance and the limitations of phenomenological anisotropy prescriptions in modeling strong-field neutron-star interiors.</description>

      <title>$\xi R \phi^2$ coupling, cosmological constant and quantum gravitational correction to Newton's potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09523v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This letter investigates the contribution of the $\sqrt{-g}\xi R\phi^2$ interaction to the long range gravitational potential for massive scalar fields, from the non-relativistic limit of the 2-2 scattering amplitude with graviton exchanges. Such coupling is naturally motivated from the renormalisation of a scalar field theory with quartic self interaction in a curved spacetime. This is qualitatively different from the minimal ones like $ \sqrt{G} h^{\mu\nu}T_{\mu\nu}$, as the vertices corresponding to the former do not explicitly contain any scalar momenta, but instead explicitly contains the momentum carried by graviton line. For the minimal vertex, the long range gravitational potential up to one loop $({\cal O}(G), {\cal O}(G^2))$ was obtained earlier from the terms non-analytic in the transfer momentum, $q^{-2},\ q^{-1},\ \ln q^2 $, yielding potentials respectively like $r^{-1}$, $r^{-2}$, $r^{-3}$. However owing to the aforesaid explicit appearance of transfer momentum for the non-minimal vertices, the leading contribution in this case comes at ${\cal O}(\xi G^2)$, and turns out to be subleading compared to even $r^{-3}$. To complement this `screening' effect, we consider the three graviton vertex generated by the $\sim \Lambda \sqrt{-g}/G$ term in the action, where $\Lambda$ is the cosmological constant. This vertex does not explicitly contain any graviton momentum. With this vertex, and assuming short scale scattering much small compared to the Hubble horizon, we compute the seagull, the vacuum polarisation and the fish diagrams and obtain the 2-2 scattering amplitudes. The leading gravitational potential at ${\cal O}(\xi \Lambda G^2 )$ behaves like $ r^{-1}$, even though it is much subleading compared to Newton's potential due to the appearance of $\Lambda$. We also discuss the scenario where this potential dominates the aforesaid ${\cal O}(\xi G^2)$ one.</description>

      <title>Four-charge static non-extremal black holes in the five-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=2$, $STU-W^2U$ supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13655v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct, for the first time, new static non-extremal five-dimensional black hole solutions (without or with squashed horizons) endowing with four different electric charge parameters in the $D = 5$, $\mathcal{N} = 2$ supergravity coupled to three vector multiplets with a specific pre-potential $\mathcal{V} = STU -W^2U \equiv 1$. When the fourth charge parameter disappears, the solution simplify reduces to the three-charge static black hole solution previously presented in ref. [1], which belongs to the solution to the $D = 5$, $\mathcal{N} = 2$ supergravity coupled to two vector multiplets (also notably known as the $STU$ model). We parameterize the model in such a simple fashion that not only can one easily recover the static three-charge solution but also it is very convenient to study their thermodynamical properties of the obtained black hole solutions in the case without a squashing horizon. We then show that the thermodynamical quantities perfectly obey both the differential first law and integral Smarr formula of thermodynamics. Finally, we also extend to present its generalizations with squashed horizons or including a nonzero cosmological constant.</description>

      <title>The Twin Paradox in Quantum Field Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06076v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vacuum fluctuations in quantum field theory impose fundamental limitations on our ability to measure time in short scales. To investigate the impact of universal quantum field theory effects on observer-dependent time measurements, we introduce a clock model based on the vacuum decay probability of a finite-sized quantum system. Using this model, we study a microscopic twin paradox scenario and find that, in the smallest scales, time is not only dependent on the trajectory connecting two events, but also on how vacuum fluctuations interact with the microscopic details of the clocks.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Dark Energy models in light of the latest observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20616v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study several models and parameterizations of dynamical dark energy (DE) that have been studied already in the past, in conjunction with the recently proposed model $w$XCDM, the running vacuum model (RVM) with and without a threshold at $z=1$ and two variants of it, the RRVM and the ``flipped RVM'', and compare them all with the concordance $\Lambda$CDM model and the popular $w_0w_a$CDM parameterization. We use two standard sets of cosmological data, one including distant supernovae from Pantheon$+$ and the other from DES-Y5. The rest of the data (BAO from DESI DR2 and CMB from Planck PR4) are shared by the two sets. They are analyzed with the help of \texttt{CLASS}. No structure formation data are utilized for this analysis and no use is made of the SH0ES calibration of $H_0$. Even so, we find that the flipped RVM and to a lesser extent the $w$XCDM and the RVM with threshold, point to significant evidence of dynamical DE, at a level comparable to $w_0w_a$CDM, more conspicuously for the dataset that involves DES-Y5 observations. We also find that while more traditional models studied in the past, in which there is an exchange between vacuum energy and cold dark matter (through e.g. an interactive source proportional either to the density of dark matter or to that of vacuum) still hint at dynamical DE, the strength of the statistical signal (which we assess through information criteria and other estimators) is nevertheless less pronounced. Finally, we discuss the ability of the various models to explain the data by performing an analysis of their effective equation-of-state parameters and corresponding evolution of their dark energy densities.</description>
