      <title>Inverse Surrogate Model of a Soft X-Ray Spectrometer using Domain Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we present a method to create a robust inverse surrogate model for a soft X-ray spectrometer. During a beamtime at an electron storage ring, such as BESSY II, instrumentation and beamlines are required to be correctly aligned and calibrated for optimal experimental conditions. In order to automate these processes, machine learning methods can be developed and implemented, but in many cases these methods require the use of an inverse model which maps the output of the experiment, such as a detector image, to the parameters of the device. Due to limited experimental data, such models are often trained with simulated data, which creates the challenge of compensating for the inherent differences between simulation and experiment. In order to close this gap, we demonstrate the application of data augmentation and adversarial domain adaptation techniques, with which we can predict absolute coordinates for the automated alignment of our spectrometer. Bridging the simulation-experiment gap with minimal real-world data opens new avenues for automated experimentation using machine learning in scientific instrumentation.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Analysis of Event-Mode Experimental Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutron and x-ray scattering experiments traditionally rely upon histogrammed data sets, which are analysed using least-squares curve fitting of multiple probability distribution components to quantify separately the various scientific contributions of interest. The main advantage to these methods is the relative ease of deployment due to their intuitive nature. Despite great popularity, these methods have known drawbacks, which can cause systematic errors and biases in some common scenarios in this field. Improvements over the base methods include dynamic optimisation of histogram bin width and the application of modern numerical optimisation methods that have greater stability, but, whilst reduced, the systematic effects carried by this stack nonetheless remain. In this study, we demonstrate analysis of neutron scattering event data using neither any numerical integration or histogramming steps, nor least squares fitting. The benefits of the new methodology are revealed: more accurate parameter values, orders of magnitude greater efficiency (i.e. fewer data points required for the same parameter accuracy) and a reduced impact of inherent systematic error. The main drawbacks are a less intuitive analysis method and an increase in computation time.</description>

      <title>Water Cherenkov detectors with fiber enhanced PMT for cosmic ray observation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Water Cherenkov detectors (WCDs) have been widely used in cosmic ray observations. This paper presents, for the first time, a cost-effective WCD design integrating a small photomultiplier tube (PMT) with wavelength-shifting fiber (WLS fiber) bundles. A WCD prototype was constructed in our laboratory, utilizing a fiber-PMT photosensor composed of a small PMT optically coupled with a WLS fiber bundle. This work details the structure of the fiber-PMT and the WCD. Measurements show the photosensor's time shift is 6.71 ns. Using cosmic ray muons, the WCD prototype demonstrated a light yield up to 30 photoelectrons with 2.3 ns time resolution under optimal conditions. Furthermore, tests under different trigger configurations indicate good performance uniformity. These findings validate the feasibility of the proposed design. A comparative analysis between a WCD using a standalone PMT and one equipped with the fiber-PMT shows that the fiber-PMT achieves nearly a 200\% improvement in light yield, albeit with a slight reduction in time performance.</description>

      <title>Propagation Measurements and Modeling for Low Altitude UAVs From 1 to 24 GHz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In most countries, small (&lt;2 kg) and medium (&lt;25 kg) size unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) must fly at low altitude, below 120 m, and with permanent radio communications with ground for control and telemetry. These communications links can be provided using 4G/5G networks or dedicated links, but in either this case the communications can be significantly degraded by frequent Non Line of Sight (NLoS) propagation. In this case, reflection and diffraction from ground objects are critical to maintain links, and hence accurate propagation models for this must be considered. In this letter we present a model for path loss when the UAV is flying in NLOS conditions. The study is based on measurements made at frequencies of 1, 4, 12, and 24 GHz with a UAV flying in a suburban environment. Measurements have been used to model NLOS propagation below 4 GHz, where the dominant mechanism is diffraction, and above 4GHzwhere multipath is the dominant propagationmechanism. The model can be of use in predicting excess losses when UAVs fly in suburban NLOS conditions.</description>

      <title>WIMP Dark Matter Search using a 3.1 tonne $\times$ year Exposure of the XENONnT Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on a search for weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) dark matter (DM) via elastic DM-xenon-nucleus interactions in the XENONnT experiment. We combine datasets from the first and second science campaigns resulting in a total exposure of $3.1\;\text{tonne}\times\text{year}$. In a blind analysis of nuclear recoil events with energies above $3.8\,\mathrm{keV_{NR}}$, we find no significant excess above background. We set new upper limits on the spin-independent WIMP-nucleon scattering cross-section for WIMP masses above $10\,\mathrm{GeV}/c^2$ with a minimum of $1.7\,\times\,10^{-47}\,\mathrm{cm^2}$ at $90\,\%$ confidence level for a WIMP mass of $30\,\mathrm{GeV}/c^2$. We achieve a best median sensitivity of $1.4\,\times\,10^{-47}\,\mathrm{cm^2}$ for a $41\,\mathrm{GeV}/c^2$ WIMP. Compared to the result from the first XENONnT science dataset, we improve our sensitivity by a factor of up to 1.8.</description>

      <title>Halbach 2.0 -- Creating homogeneous fields with finite size magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Homogeneous magnetic fields can be generated through the strategic arrangement of permanent magnets. The Halbach array serves as a prominent example of an effective design following this principle. However, it is a two-dimensional approach because it is optimal when placing infinitely long magnets -- line dipoles -- on a circle. If shorter, more realistic magnets are to be used, the optimal arrangement of magnetic moments diverges from the classical Halbach geometry. This paper presents optimal solutions for three-dimensional arrangements calculated for point dipoles, including optimized orientations for single rings and stacks of two rings. They are superior to the original Halbach arrangement and a modification described in the literature, both in terms of the strength and the homogeneity of the magnetic field. Analytic formulae are provided for both cases and tested by experimental realizations.</description>

      <title>Table-top three-dimensional photoemission orbital tomography with a femtosecond extreme ultraviolet light source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Following electronic processes in molecules and materials at the level of the quantum mechanical electron wavefunction with angstrom-level spatial resolution and with full access to its femtosecond temporal dynamics is at the heart of ultrafast condensed matter physics. A breakthrough invention allowing experimental access to electron wavefunctions was the reconstruction of molecular orbitals from angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy data in 2009, termed photoemission orbital tomography (POT). This invention puts ultrafast three-dimensional (3D) POT in reach, with many new prospects for the study of ultrafast light-matter interaction, femtochemistry and photo-induced phase transitions. Here, we develop a synergistic experimental-algorithmic approach to realize the first 3D-POT experiment using a short-pulse extreme ultraviolet light source. We combine a new variant of photoelectron spectroscopy, namely ultrafast momentum microscopy, with a table-top spectrally-tunable high-harmonic generation light source and a tailored algorithm for efficient 3D reconstruction from sparse, undersampled data. This combination dramatically speeds up the experimental data acquisition, while at the same time reducing the sampling requirements to achieve complete 3D information. We demonstrate the power of this approach by full 3D imaging of the frontier orbitals of a prototypical organic semiconductor absorbed on pristine Ag(110).</description>

      <title>Vertex Imaging Hadron Calorimetry Using AI/ML Tools</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15385v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The fluctuations in energy loss to processes that do not generate measurable signals, such as binding energy losses, set the limit on achievable hadronic energy resolution in traditional energy reconstruction techniques. The correlation between the number of hadronic interaction vertices in a shower and invisible energy is found to be strong and is used to estimate invisible energy fraction in highly granular calorimeters in short time intervals (&lt;10 ns). We simulated images of hadronic showers using GEANT4 and deployed a neural network to analyze the images for energy regression. The neural network-based approach results in significant improvement in energy resolution, from 13 % to 4 % in the case of a Cherenkov calorimeter for 100 GeV pion showers. We discuss the significance of the phenomena responsible for this improvement and the plans for experimental verification of these results and further development.</description>

      <title>Monitoring the tagging efficiency of the Low-Energy Muon beamline through background analysis: Insights into the long-term performance of ultrathin carbon foils</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17280v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The efficient tagging of individual muons, along with the stability of the involved ultrathin carbon foil, is critical for ensuring fast, reliable and reproducible low-energy muon spin rotation (LE-$\mathrm{\mu}$SR) measurements. At the Paul Scherrer Institute's Low-Energy Muon (LEM) beamline, we developed a method to monitor the tagging efficiency of the beamline using routinely collected muon decay histograms. This method leverages background comparison before and after the arrival time of the muons at the sample to extract the tagging efficiency, eliminating the need for additional detectors or measurements. By analyzing data collected between 2018 and 2024, we confirm the method's reliability and validate its results using independent reference measurements. Furthermore, we establish a correlation between the tagging efficiency and foil thickness by investigating the impact of contamination and outgassing on the carbon foil, as well as the restoration effects of laser cleaning. The findings underscore the importance of monitoring the carbon foil's condition to maintain consistent beamline performance and reproducibility. This method offers a practical approach for detector efficiency monitoring, applicable to other beamlines employing similar setups.</description>

      <title>Efficient cosmic ray generator for particle detector simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07452v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditional cosmic ray simulations make use of the Montecarlo method in a very naive way to randomise energy and direction for each simulated particle. The flux of cosmic rays is modelled as a rain coming from a plane above the object of interest (detectors in particle physics applications, planes in dosimetry studies, etc.) with an experimental angular and energy distributions. This strategy is very inefficient because many of the particles never touch the detector. Here a refined way of implementing the Montecarlo method is proposed in order to generate a sample of events that hit the target volume whose angular distribution coincides with the one from the naive implementation. It is based on the projection of a sphere containing the target volume onto a plane tangent to it with a fixed angle, we call it the secant method. This configuration allows to compute the probability of a cosmic particle hitting the sphere with this incoming angle as proportional to the area of the corresponding section of a cylinder. The performance of this method is faster in terms of computing time and identical physical results are achieved. It has been implemented in REST-for-Physics framework and it is tested with the geometry of a real detector, the IAXO-D0 Micromegas X-ray detector for the future axion helioscope BabyIAXO. Our method is 37 times more efficient than the traditional Montecarlo schema for the same accuracy, being more useful when the target volume departs from spherical shape</description>
