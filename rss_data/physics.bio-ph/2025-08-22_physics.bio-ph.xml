      <title>Visualizing Poloidal Orientation in DNA Minicircles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A short (&lt;150 bp) double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) molecule ligated end-to-end forms a DNA minicircle. Due to sequence-dependent, nonuniform bending energetics, such a minicircle is predicted to adopt a certain inside-out orientation, known as the poloidal orientation. Despite theoretical and computational predictions, experimental evidence for this phenomenon has been lacking. In this study, we introduce a single-molecule approach to visualize the poloidal orientation of DNA minicircles. We constructed a set of DNA minicircles, each containing a single biotin located at a different position along one helical turn of the dsDNA, and imaged the location of biotin-bound NeutrAvidin relative to the DNA minicircle using atomic force microscopy (AFM). We applied this approach to two DNA sequences previously predicted to exhibit strongly preferred poloidal orientations. The observed relative positions of NeutrAvidin shifted between the inside and outside of the minicircle with different phases, indicating distinct poloidal orientations for the two sequences. Coarse-grained simulations revealed narrowly distributed poloidal orientations with different mean orientations for each sequence, consistent with the AFM results. Together, our findings provide experimental confirmation of preferred poloidal orientations in DNA minicircles, offering insights into the intrinsic dynamics of circular DNA.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium protein complexes as molecular automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biology stores information and computes at the molecular scale, yet the ways in which it does so are often distinct from human-engineered computers. Mapping biological computation onto architectures familiar to computer science remains an outstanding challenge. Here, inspired by Crick's proposal for molecular memory, we analyse a thermodynamically-consistent model of a protein complex subject to driven, nonequilibrium enzymatic reactions. In the strongly driven limit, we find that the system maps onto a stochastic, asynchronous variant of cellular automata, where each rule corresponds to a different set of enzymes being present. We find a broad class of phenomena in these 'molecular automata' that can be exploited for molecular computation, including error-tolerant memory via multistable attractors, and long transients that can be used as molecular stopwatches. By systematically enumerating all possible dynamical rules, we identify those that allow molecular automata to implement simple computational architectures such as finite-state machines. Overall, our results provide a framework for engineering synthetic molecular automata, and offer a route to building protein-based computation in living cells.</description>

      <title>Irreversibility and symmetry breaking in the creation and annihilation of defects in active living matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active living matter continuously creates and annihilates topological defects in a process that remains poorly understood. Here, we investigate these dynamics in two distinct active living systems, swarming bacteria and human bronchial epithelial cells. Despite their entirely different evolutionary origins, biological functions, and physical scales, both systems exhibit half-integer defects, consistent with the nematic phase. However, in contrast to active nematic theory, we find that defect creation and annihilation undergoes spatial symmetry breaking. We propose that this results from a fundamental dualism between nematic structural organization and generated polar forces, which are intrinsic to living systems. Furthermore, our estimation of entropy production reveals that creation and annihilation are not reversed processes. Our findings challenge conventional nematic models and emphasize the role of defect-mediated dynamics in non-equilibrium biological systems as a major source of entropy production.</description>

      <title>An Uncertainty Visualization Framework for Large-Scale Cardiovascular Flow Simulations: A Case Study on Aortic Stenosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a generalizable uncertainty quantification (UQ) and visualization framework for lattice Boltzmann method simulations of high Reynolds number vascular flows, demonstrated on a patient-specific stenosed aorta. The framework combines EasyVVUQ for parameter sampling with large-eddy simulation turbulence modeling in HemeLB, and executes ensembles on the Frontier exascale supercomputer. Spatially resolved metrics, including entropy and isosurface-crossing probability, are used to map uncertainty in pressure and wall shear stress fields directly onto vascular geometries. Two sources of model variability are examined: inlet peak velocity and the Smagorinsky constant. Inlet velocity variation produces high uncertainty downstream of the stenosis where turbulence develops, while upstream regions remain stable. Smagorinsky constant variation has little effect on the large-scale pressure field but increases WSS uncertainty in localized high-shear regions. In both cases, the stenotic throat manifests low entropy, indicative of robust identification of elevated WSS. By linking quantitative UQ measures to three-dimensional anatomy, the framework improves interpretability over conventional 1D UQ plots and supports clinically relevant decision-making, with broad applicability to vascular flow problems requiring both accuracy and spatial insight.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement learning of a biflagellate model microswimmer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many microswimmers are able to swim through viscous fluids by employing periodic non-reciprocal deformations of their appendages. Here we use a simple microswimmer model inspired by swimming biflagellates which consists of a spherical cell body and two small spherical beads representing the motion of the two flagella. Using reinforcement learning we identify for different microswimmer morphologies quasi-optimized swimming strokes. For all studied cases the identified strokes result in symmetric and quasi-synchronized beating of the two flagella beads. Interestingly, the stroke-averaged flow fields are of pusher type, and the observed swimming gaits outperform previously used biflagellate microswimmer models relying on predefined circular flagella bead motion.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the attractive electrosolvation force between colloidal particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14652v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Direct measurement of the pair interaction potential between electrically like-charged particles in solution reveals a strong and long-ranged attractive force. This counterintuitive attraction has been suggested to arise from the orientation of solvent molecules at the interface between the object and the electrolyte. Measuring interactions between charged microspheres carrying a variety of surface chemistries reveals that the range of the electrosolvation attraction is substantially longer than previously held. Furthermore, the length scale governing the decay of the attractive force depends on particle properties. The observations highlight significant departures from current thinking and the need for a model of interparticle interactions that accounts for the molecular nature of the solvent, its interfacial behaviour, and spatial correlations.</description>
