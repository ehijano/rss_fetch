      <description>arXiv:2503.13522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: After AlphaFold won the Nobel Prize, protein prediction with deep learning once again became a hot topic. We comprehensively explore advanced deep learning methods applied to protein structure prediction and design. It begins by examining recent innovations in prediction architectures, with detailed discussions on improvements such as diffusion based frameworks and novel pairwise attention modules. The text analyses key components including structure generation, evaluation metrics, multiple sequence alignment processing, and network architecture, thereby illustrating the current state of the art in computational protein modelling. Subsequent chapters focus on practical applications, presenting case studies that range from individual protein predictions to complex biomolecular interactions. Strategies for enhancing prediction accuracy and integrating deep learning techniques with experimental validation are thoroughly explored. The later sections review the industry landscape of protein design, highlighting the transformative role of artificial intelligence in biotechnology and discussing emerging market trends and future challenges. Supplementary appendices provide essential resources such as databases and open source tools, making this volume a valuable reference for researchers and students.</description>

      <title>Carbonic anhydrase II simulated with a universal neural network potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The carbonic anhydrase II enzyme (CA II) is one of the most significant enzymes in nature, reversibly converting CO$_2$ to bicarbonate at a remarkable rate. The precise mechanism it uses to achieve this rapid turnover remains unclear due to our inability to directly observe or simulate the full process dynamically. Here, we use a recently developed universal neural network potential (Orb) to simulate the active site of CA II. We reproduce several known features of the reaction mechanism, including the proton relay that conducts protons out of the active site to the His64 residue. Additionally, we observe a new reaction pathway where CO$_2$ reacts with a water molecule in the active site, which donates a proton to the zinc-bound hydroxide. This differs from the established mechanism where CO$_2$ directly reacts with hydroxide. Existing experimental data and independent quantum chemistry calculations are used to support the plausibility of this new mechanism. This demonstrates the potential of Orb to efficiently generate novel insights into important molecular scale processes that can potentially be harnessed to improve CO$_2$ capture technologies and drug design.</description>

      <title>3D-MolT5: Leveraging Discrete Structural Information for Molecule-Text Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05797v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The integration of molecular and natural language representations has emerged as a focal point in molecular science, with recent advancements in Language Models (LMs) demonstrating significant potential for comprehensive modeling of both domains. However, existing approaches face notable limitations, particularly in their neglect of three-dimensional (3D) information, which is crucial for understanding molecular structures and functions. While some efforts have been made to incorporate 3D molecular information into LMs using external structure encoding modules, significant difficulties remain, such as insufficient interaction across modalities in pre-training and challenges in modality alignment. To address the limitations, we propose \textbf{3D-MolT5}, a unified framework designed to model molecule in both sequence and 3D structure spaces. The key innovation of our approach lies in mapping fine-grained 3D substructure representations into a specialized 3D token vocabulary. This methodology facilitates the seamless integration of sequence and structure representations in a tokenized format, enabling 3D-MolT5 to encode molecular sequences, molecular structures, and text sequences within a unified architecture. Leveraging this tokenized input strategy, we build a foundation model that unifies the sequence and structure data formats. We then conduct joint pre-training with multi-task objectives to enhance the model's comprehension of these diverse modalities within a shared representation space. Thus, our approach significantly improves cross-modal interaction and alignment, addressing key challenges in previous work. Further instruction tuning demonstrated that our 3D-MolT5 has strong generalization ability and surpasses existing methods with superior performance in multiple downstream tasks.

      <title>RNA-FrameFlow: Flow Matching for de novo 3D RNA Backbone Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13839v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce RNA-FrameFlow, the first generative model for 3D RNA backbone design. We build upon SE(3) flow matching for protein backbone generation and establish protocols for data preparation and evaluation to address unique challenges posed by RNA modeling. We formulate RNA structures as a set of rigid-body frames and associated loss functions which account for larger, more conformationally flexible RNA backbones (13 atoms per nucleotide) vs. proteins (4 atoms per residue). Toward tackling the lack of diversity in 3D RNA datasets, we explore training with structural clustering and cropping augmentations. Additionally, we define a suite of evaluation metrics to measure whether the generated RNA structures are globally self-consistent (via inverse folding followed by forward folding) and locally recover RNA-specific structural descriptors. The most performant version of RNA-FrameFlow generates locally realistic RNA backbones of 40-150 nucleotides, over 40% of which pass our validity criteria as measured by a self-consistency TM-score &gt;= 0.45, at which two RNAs have the same global fold.

      <title>Beyond Atoms: Enhancing Molecular Pretrained Representations with 3D Space Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10489v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Molecular pretrained representations (MPR) has emerged as a powerful approach for addressing the challenge of limited supervised data in applications such as drug discovery and material design. While early MPR methods relied on 1D sequences and 2D graphs, recent advancements have incorporated 3D conformational information to capture rich atomic interactions. However, these prior models treat molecules merely as discrete atom sets, overlooking the space surrounding them. We argue from a physical perspective that only modeling these discrete points is insufficient. We first present a simple yet insightful observation: naively adding randomly sampled virtual points beyond atoms can surprisingly enhance MPR performance. In light of this, we propose a principled framework that incorporates the entire 3D space spanned by molecules. We implement the framework via a novel Transformer-based architecture, dubbed SpaceFormer, with three key components: (1) grid-based space discretization; (2) grid sampling/merging; and (3) efficient 3D positional encoding. Extensive experiments show that SpaceFormer significantly outperforms previous 3D MPR models across various downstream tasks with limited data, validating the benefit of leveraging the additional 3D space beyond atoms in MPR models.</description>

      <title>Endhered patterns in matchings and RNA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18802v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An endhered (end-adhered) pattern is a subset of arcs in matchings, such that the corresponding starting points are consecutive and the same holds for the ending points. Such patterns are in one-to-one correspondence with the permutations. We focus on the occurrence frequency of such patterns in matchings and native (real-world) RNA structures with pseudoknots. We present combinatorial results related to the distribution and asymptotic behavior of the pattern 21, which corresponds to two consecutive base pairs frequently encountered in RNA, and the pattern 12, representing the archetypal minimal pseudoknot. We show that in matchings these two patterns are equidistributed, which is quite different from what we can find in native RNAs. We also examine the distribution of endhered patterns of size 3, showing how the patterns change under the transformation called endhered twist. Finally, we compute the distributions of endhered patterns of size 2 and 3 in native secondary RNA structures with pseudoknots and discuss possible outcomes of our study.</description>

      <title>The diffusive dynamics and electrochemical regulation of weak polyelectrolytes across liquid interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14555v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a framework to study the spatio-temporal evolution of liquid-liquid phase separation of weak polyelectrolytes in ionic solutions. Unlike strong polyelectrolytes, which carry a fixed charge, the charge state of weak polyelectrolytes is modulated by the electrochemical environment through protonation and deprotonation processes. Leveraging numerical simulations and analysis, our work reveals how solution acidity (pH) influences the formation, interactions, and structural properties of phase-separated coacervates. We find that pH gradients can be maintained across coacervate interfaces resulting in a clear distinction in the electro-chemical properties within and outside the coacervate. By regulating the charge state of weak polyelectrolytes, pH gradients interact and modulate the electric double layer forming at coacervate interfaces eventually determining how they interact. Further linear and nonlinear analyses of stationary localised solutions reveal a rich spectrum of behaviours that significantly distinguish weak from strong polyelectrolytes. Overall, our results demonstrate the importance of charge regulation on phase-separating solutions of charge-bearing molecules and the possibility of harnessing charge-regulated mechanisms to control coacervates and shape their stability and spatial organisation.</description>
