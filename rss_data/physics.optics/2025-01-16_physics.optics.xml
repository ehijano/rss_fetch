      <title>Unsupervised neural-implicit laser absorption tomography for quantitative imaging of unsteady flames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel neural-implicit approach to laser absorption tomography (LAT) with experimental verification. A coordinate neural network is used to represent thermochemical state variables as continuous functions of space and time. Unlike most existing neural methods for LAT, which rely on prior simulations and supervised training, our approach is based solely on LAT measurements, utilizing a differentiable observation operator with line parameters provided in standard spectroscopy database formats. Although reconstructing scalar fields from multi-beam absorbance data is an inherently ill-posed, nonlinear inverse problem, our continuous space-time parameterization supports physics-inspired regularization strategies and enables physics-informed data assimilation. Synthetic and experimental tests are conducted to validate the method, demonstrating robust performance and reproducibility. We show that our neural-implicit approach to LAT can capture the dominant spatial modes of an unsteady flame from very sparse measurement data, indicating its potential to reveal combustion instabilities in measurement domains with minimal optical access.</description>

      <title>Dielectric permittivity extraction of MoS$_2$ nanoribbons using THz nanoscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nanoscale optical properties of high-quality MoS$_2$ nanoribbons are investigated using THz nanoscopy based on a scattering-type scanning probe. The nanoribbons comprise a multi-layer core, surrounded by monolayer edges. A featureless complex permittivity spectrum covering the range 0.6-1.6 THz is extracted from experimental time-domain measurements through a minimization procedure, adopting an extended finite-dipole model of the probe-sample interaction. Real-space mapping of the nanoribbon reveals variations in the local permittivity down to the instrument-limited resolution, on the order of 30 nm. Clustering analysis statistically identifies regions of lower apparent permittivity that we attribute to a high curvature at the edges of the nanoribbon causing an increase in local material strain or cross-talk in the measured signal with topography-induced measurement artifacts. The core of the nanoribbon contains two regions that follow tightly distributed, but slightly shifted Gaussian statistics in complex permittivity space, with the real part mean of both distributions lying around 5.4 and compatible with literature values of the static permittivity of thin-film MoS$_2$ reported previously. Our results show that the nanoribbons exhibit a modest degree of dielectric variation at the nanoscale that could be explained by heterogeneous doping or variations in the local defect density. We believe that our approach could be useful for the direct real-space measurement of dielectric disorder in other low-dimensional semiconducting material systems.</description>

      <title>Optical rotation of ferrofluid on a horizontal substrate by Marangoni and thermomagnetic forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light-actuation enables non-contact, precise, and flexible manipulation of liquids in microfluidics and liquid robots. However, it has long been a challenge to achieve optical rotation of liquid on a horizontal substrate because of the weak force of light. Here, we report, for the first time, the laser-induced rotation of macroscopic liquid placed on a horizontal substrate above cylindrical magnets. The investigated ferrofluid exhibits multiple spikes due to the Rosensweig phenomenon on the surface with different strengths of external magnetic field and rotates in a controllable direction by adjusting the laser beam position around ferrofluid spikes. This rotation results from the laser-induced displacement between the ferrofluid gravitational center, magnetic field center, Marangoni force, and non-uniform thermomagnetic force. Movement tracking of the spikes, thermal magnetization, and thermal imaging of ferrofluid were performed to elucidate the mechanism. Additionally, the influence of laser power, laser irradiation position, and magnetic field intensity on laser-induced rotation of ferrofluid are systematically studied. This work demonstrates a novel horizontal rotation of liquid using light and provides a deep understanding of the underlying mechanism and a flexible strategy for manipulating liquid for various optofluidic applications.</description>

      <title>Monoclinic nonlinear metasurfaces for resonant engineering of polarization states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarization is a fundamental property of light that can be engineered and controlled efficiently with optical metasurfaces. Here, we employ chiral metasurfaces with monoclinic lattice geometry and achiral meta-atoms for resonant engineering of polarization states of light. We demonstrate, both theoretically and experimentally, that a monoclinic metasurface can convert linearly polarized light into elliptically polarized light not only in the linear regime but also in the nonlinear regime with the resonant generation of the third-harmonic field. We reveal that the ellipticity of the fundamental and higher-harmonic fields depends critically on the angle of the input linear polarization, and the effective chiral response of a monoclinic lattice plays a significant role in the polarization conversion.</description>

      <title>Topologically protected edge states in time photonic crystals with chiral symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time photonic crystals are media in which their electromagnetic parameters are modulated periodically in time, showing promising applications in non-resonant lasers and particle accelerators, among others. Traditionally utilized to study space photonic crystals, topological band theory has also been translated recently to analyze time photonic crystals with time inversion symmetry, enabling the construction of the temporal version of topological edge states. However, temporal disorder can readily break time inversion symmetry in practice, hence likely destroying the edge states associated with this type of time photonic crystals. To overcome this limitation, here we propose a new class of time photonic crystals presenting chiral symmetry instead, whose edge states exhibit superior robustness over the time-reversal-symmetry-protected counterparts. Our time photonic crystal is equivalent to a temporal version of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, and the chiral symmetry of this type of time photonic crystals quantizes the winding number defined in the Bloch frequency band. Remarkably, random temporal disorders do not impact the eigenfrequencies of these chiral-symmetry-protected edge states, while instead enhancing their temporal localizations. Our findings thus provide a promising paradigm to control field amplification with exceptional robustness as well as being a feasible platform to investigate various topological phases in time-varying media.</description>

      <title>Pulse compression by photoexcitation-induced dynamics of Bragg mirrors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose dynamical Bragg mirrors as a means to compress intense short optical pulses. We show that strong-field photoexcitation of carriers changes the refractive index of the layers and leads to motion of the resonance-defined boundary of the Bragg mirror. In a reflection geometry, this counter-propagating motion leads to significant compression of the incident pulse. We utilize a finite-difference time-domain numerical model to predict up to a 6-fold pulse compression in the few-femtosecond regime. Modification of the refractive index and properties of the compressed pulse as a function of the incident pulse parameters are investigated.</description>

      <title>Broad Spectral Tuning of Ultra-Low Loss Polaritons in a van der Waals Crystal by Intercalation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phonon polaritons (PhPs) -- light coupled to lattice vibrations -- in polar van der Waals (vdW) crystals are promising candidates for controlling the flow of energy at the nanoscale due to their strong field confinement, anisotropic propagation, and ultra-long lifetime in the picosecond range \cite{ref1,ref2,ref3,ref4,ref5}. However, the lack of tunability in their narrow and material-specific spectral range -- the Reststrahlen Band (RB) -- severely limits their technological implementation. Here, we demonstrate that the intercalation of Na atoms in the vdW semiconductor $\alpha$-V$_2$O$_5$ enables a broad spectral shift of RBs, and that the PhPs excited exhibit ultra-low losses (lifetime of $4 \pm 1$~ps), similar to PhPs in the non-intercalated crystal (lifetime of $6 \pm 1$ ps). We expect our intercalation method to be applicable to other vdW crystals, opening the door for the use of PhPs in broad spectral bands in the mid-infrared domain.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Delayed Fluorescence in Non-Local Metasurfaces: The Role of Electronic Strong Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong light-matter coupling has garnered significant attention for its potential to optimize optoelectronic responses. In this study, we designed open cavities featuring non-local metasurfaces composed of aluminum nanoparticle arrays. The surface lattice resonances in these metasurfaces exhibit electronic strong coupling with the boron difluoride curcuminoid derivative, known for its highly efficient thermally activated delayed f luorescence in the near-infrared. Our results show that delayed fluorescence induced by triplet-triplet annihilation can be enhanced by a factor of 2.0-2.6 in metasurfaces that are either tuned or detuned to the molecular electronic transition. We demonstrate that delayed fluorescence enhancements in these systems primarily stem from increased absorption in the organic layer caused by the nanoparticle array, while strong coupling has negligible effects on reverse intersystem crossing rates, aligning with previous studies. We support these findings with finite-difference-time-domain simulations. This study elucidates how light-matter interactions affect delayed fluorescence, highlighting the potential applications in optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Topological pumping of multi-frequency solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the topological pumping of quadratic optical solitons, observed through their quantized transport in a dynamic optical potential. A distinctive feature of this system is that the two fields with different frequencies, which together form the quadratic soliton, evolve in separate yet topologically equivalent dynamic optical potentials. Pumping in this system exhibits several notable differences from pumping in cubic media. While Chern indices characterizing quantized transport for uncoupled fundamental and second harmonic waves are nonzero, small-amplitude solitons with narrow spectra do not move, thus revealing a non-topological phase. As the nonlinearity increases, the system undergoes a sharp transition, depending on the velocity of one of the sublattices forming dynamical potential, into the phase where the quantized transport of quadratic solitons governed by nonzero Chern numbers is observed. The power level at which this transition occurs increases with increase of pumping velocity, and the transition is observed even in the regime when the adiabatic approximation no longer applies. Unlike in cubic media, in a quadratic medium neither breakup of topological pumping nor fractional pumping at high power levels are observed.</description>

      <title>Integrated Photonic Programmable Random Matrix Generator with Minimal Active Components</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Random matrices are fundamental in photonic computing because of their ability to model and enhance complex light interactions and signal processing capabilities. In manipulating classical light, random operations are utilized for random projections and dimensionality reduction, which are important for analog signal processing, computing, and imaging. In quantum information processing, random unitary operations are essential to boson sampling algorithms for multiphoton states in linear photonic circuits. In photonic circuits, random operations are realized through disordered structures resulting in fixed unitary operations or through large meshes of interferometers and reconfigurable phase shifters, which require a large number of phase shifters. In this article, we introduce a compact photonic circuit for generating random matrices by utilizing programmable phase modulation layers interlaced with a fixed mixing operator. We show that using only two random phase layers is sufficient for producing output optical signals with a white-noise profile, even for highly sparse input optical signals. We experimentally demonstrate these results using a silicon photonics circuit with tunable thermal phase shifters and utilize waveguide lattices as mixing layers. The proposed circuit offers a practical method for generating random matrices for photonic information processing and for applications in data encryption.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamic full-field optical coherence tomography (DFFOCT) has recently emerged as an invaluable label-free microscopy technique, owing to its sensitivity to cell activity, as well as speed and sectioning ability. However, the quality of DFFOCT images are often degraded due to phase noise and fringe artifacts. In this work, we present a new implementation named Rolling-Phase (RP) DFFOCT, in which the reference arm is slowly scanned over magnitudes exceeding 2$\pi$. We demonstrate mathematically and experimentally that it shows superior image quality while enabling to extract both static and dynamic contrast simultaneously. We showcase RP DFFOCT on monkey retinal explant, and demonstrate its ability to better resolve subcellular structures, including intranuclear activity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well-known that water in both liquid and vapor phases exhibits exceptionally weak absorption of light in the visible range. Recent experiments, however, have demonstrated that at the liquid-air interface, absorption in the visible range is drastically increased. This increased absorption results in a rate of evaporation that exceeds the theoretical thermal limit by between two and five times. Curiously, the evaporation rate peaks at green wavelengths of light, while no corresponding absorptance peak has been observed. Experiments suggest that photons can cleave off clusters of water molecules at the surface, but no clear theoretical model has yet been proposed to explain how this is possible. This paper aims to present such a model and explain this surprising and important phenomenon.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The investigation of fluorescence lifetime became an important tool in biology and medical science. So far, established methods of fluorescence lifetime measurements require the illumination of the investigated probes with pulsed or amplitude-modulated light. In this paper, we examine the limitations of an innovative method of fluorescence lifetime using time-frequency correlated photons generated by a continuous-wave source. For this purpose, we investigate the lifetime of IR-140 to demonstrate the functional principle and its dependencies on different experimental parameters. We also compare this technique with state-of-the-art FLIM and observed an improved figure-of-merit. Finally, we discuss the potential of a quantum advantage.</description>

      <title>Spectral and temporal properties of type-II parametric down-conversion: The impact of losses during state generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we theoretically study spectral and temporal properties of pulsed spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) generated in lossy waveguides. Our theoretical approach is based on the formalism of Gaussian states and the Langevin equation, which is elaborated for weak parametric down-conversion and photon-number-unresolved click detection. Using the example of frequency-degenerate type-II SPDC generated under pump-idler group-velocity-matching condition, we show how the joint-spectral intensity, mode structure, normalized second-order correlation function, and Hong-Ou-Mandel interference pattern depend on internal losses of the SPDC process. In addition, we propose a new method for the experimental determination of internal losses of nonlinear waveguides which is based on the measurement of the normalized second-order correlation functions.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates the properties of continuous frames, with a particular focus on phase retrieval and norm retrieval in the context of Hilbert spaces. We introduce the concept of continuous near-Riesz bases and prove their invariance under invertible operators. Some equivalent conditions for phase and norm retrieval property of continuous frames are presented. We study the stability of phase retrieval under perturbations. Furthermore, tensor product frames for separable Hilbert spaces are studied, and we establish the equivalence of phase retrieval and norm retrieval properties between components and their tensor products.</description>

      <title>Searches for ultralight vector and axion dark matter with KAGRA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08930v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have proposed using laser interferometric gravitational wave detectors to search for ultralight vector and axion dark matter. Vector dark matter can be probed through oscillating forces on suspended mirrors, while axion dark matter can be detected via oscillating polarization rotation of laser beams. This paper reviews these searches with the KAGRA detector in Japan, including the first vector dark matter search with KAGRA's 2020 data and installation of polarization optics for axion dark matter search during the upcoming 2025 observing run.</description>

      <title>Practical security of twin-field quantum key distribution with optical phase-locked loop under wavelength-switching attack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09318v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The twin-field class quantum key distribution (TF-class QKD) has experimentally demonstrated the ability to surpass the fundamental rate-distance limit without requiring a quantum repeater, as a revolutional milestone. In TF-class QKD implementation, an optical phase-locked loop (OPLL) structure is commonly employed to generate a reference light with correlated phase, ensuring coherence of optical fields between Alice and Bob. In this configuration, the reference light, typically located in the untrusted station Charlie, solely provides wavelength reference for OPLL and does not participate in quantum-state encoding. However, the reference light may open a door for Eve to enter the source stations that are supposed to be well protected. Here, by identifying vulnerabilities of an acousto-optic modulator (AOM) in the OPLL scheme, we propose and demonstrate a wavelength-switching attack on a TF-class QKD system. This attack involves Eve deliberately manipulating the wavelength of the reference light to increase mean photon number of prepared quantum states, while maintaining stable interference between Alice and Bob as required by TF-class QKD protocols. The maximum observed increase in mean photon number is 8.7%, which has been theoretically proven to compromise the security of a TF-class QKD system. Moreover, we have shown that with well calibration of the modulators, the attack can be eliminated. Through this study, we highlight the importance of system calibration in the practical security in TF-class QKD implementation.</description>

      <title>A neuromorphic camera for tracking passive and active matter with lower data throughput</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07230v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the merits of using a neuromorphic, or event-based camera (EBC), for tracking of both passive and active matter. For passive matter, we tracked the Brownian motion of different micro-particles and estimated their diffusion coefficient. For active matter, we explored the case of tracking murine spermatozoa and extracted motility parameters from the motion of cells. This has applications in enhancing outcomes for clinical fertility treatments. Using the EBC, we obtain results equivalent to those from an sCMOS camera, yet achieve a reduction in file size of up to two orders of magnitude. This is important in the modern computer era, as it reduces data throughput, and is well-aligned with edge-computing applications. We believe the EBC is an excellent choice, particularly for long-term studies of active matter.</description>
