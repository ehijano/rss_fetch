      <title>Shallow core levels, or how to determine the doping and $T_c$ of Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$ and Bi$_{2}$Sr$_2$CuO$_{6+\delta}$ without cooling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determining the doping level in high-temperature cuprate superconductors is crucial for understanding the origin of superconductivity in these materials and for unlocking their full potential. However, accurately determining the doping level remains a significant challenge due to a complex interplay of factors and limitations in various measurement techniques. In particular, in Bi$_{2}$Sr$_2$CuO$_{6+\delta}$ and Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$, where the mobile carriers are introduced by non-stoichiometric oxygen $\delta$, the determination has been extremely problematic. Here, we study the doping dependence of the electronic structure of these materials in angle-resolved photoemission and find that both the doping level, $p$, and the superconducting transition temeprature, $T_c$ can be precisely determined from the binding energy of the Bi $5d$ core-levels. The measurements can be performed at room temperature, enabling the determination of $p$ and $T_c$ without cooling the samples. This should be very helpful for further studies of these materials.</description>

      <title>Predicted High-Pressure Hot Superconductivity in Li$_2$CaH$_{16}$ and Li$_2$CaH$_{17}$ Phases that Resemble the Type-II Clathrate Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-temperature high-pressure superconducting hydrides are typically characterized by cage-like hydrogenic lattices filled with electropositive metal atoms. Here, density functional theory based evolutionary crystal structure searches find two phases that possess these geometric features and are related to the Type-II clathrate structure. In these $Fd\overline{3}m$ Li$_2$CaH$_{16}$ and $R\overline{3}m$ Li$_2$CaH$_{17}$ phases the calcium atom occupies the larger cage and the lithium atom the smaller one. The highest superconducting critical temperatures predicted within the isotropic Eliashberg formalism, 330~K at 350~GPa for $Fd\overline{3}m$ Li$_2$CaH$_{16}$ and 370~K at 300~GPa for $R\overline{3}m$ Li$_2$CaH$_{17}$, suggest these structures fall in the class of high-energy-density quantum materials known as hot superconductors. As pressure is lowered the cage-like lattices distort with the emergence of quasimolecular hydrogenic motifs; nonetheless Li$_2$CaH$_{17}$ is predicted to be superconducting down to 160~GPa at 205~K.</description>

      <title>Cu NMR study of lightly doped La$_{2-x}$Sr$_{x}$CuO$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a single crystal Cu NMR study of the cuprate superconductor La$_{2-x}$Sr$_{x}$CuO$_4$ with hole doping levels between $x=2$\% and $8$\%. Measurements with short spin echo times enable us to systematically study the local properties of the electronic spin system in the region of the phase diagram where the material evolves from the insulating antiferromagnetic parent phase to the superconducting state. We find evidence for qualitative changes as the Sr concentration increases through $x=5$\% in both NMR spectra and relaxation times, which we interpret as signatures of a low-temperature transition from a state with disconnected metallic islands to a granular metal with tunneling between the grains. These results provide microscopic insight into the physics of a doped charge-transfer insulator in the presence of quenched substitutional disorder, indicate that a connectivity transition occurs, and demonstrate that complex nanoscale electronic phase separation is ubiquitous in LSCO around the doping level where superconductivity first appears in the phase diagram.</description>

      <title>Origin of the density wave instability in trilayer nickelate La4Ni3O10 revealed by optical and ultrafast spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here we employed optical spectroscopy and ultrafast reflectivity measurements to investigate the density wave instability of trilayer nickelate La4Ni3O10 at ambient pressure. Our optical spectroscopy measurements indicate that La4Ni3O10 is metallic with a large plasma frequency at room temperature. As the temperature decreases, we observe the formation of an energy gap in reflectivity below TDW, signaling the charge/spin density wave transition. The Drude component was largely removed due to the gap opening in the Fermi surface. Our Drude-Lorentz analysis reveals that the energy gap in La4Ni3O10 is approximately 61 meV, which is three times larger than that obtained from ARPES measurements. The density wave gap feature is more prominent than that observed in bilayer nickelate La3Ni2O7, suggesting more carriers are gapped at the Fermi surface across the density wave transition. By comparing the measured plasma frequency with the first-principles calculation, we categorize La4Ni3O10 as a moderately electronic correlation material, similar to the parent compound of iron-based superconductors, however, being weaker than the bilayer nickelate La3Ni2O7. Our ultrafast pump-probe experiments also show that the relaxation time diverges near the transition temperature. By analyzing the amplitude and relaxation time with the Rothwarf-Taylor model, we estimate the energy gap to be 58 meV, which agrees with the result of optical spectroscopy. The more prominent gap feature and weaker electronic correlation might be the cause of a lower superconductivity transition temperature in La4Ni3O10 under high pressure. These findings significantly contribute to understanding the origin of density wave and superconductivity in trilayer nickelate La4Ni3O10.</description>

      <title>Discovery of Superconductivity and Electron-Phonon Drag in the Non-Centrosymmetric Weyl Semimetal LaRhGe$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11402v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an exploration of the effect of electron-phonon coupling and broken inversion symmetry on the electronic and thermal properties of the semimetal LaRhGe$_3$. Our transport measurements reveal evidence for electron-hole compensation at low temperatures, resulting in a large magnetoresistance of 3000% at 1.8 K and 14 T. The carrier concentration is on the order of $10^{21}\rm{/cm}^3$ with high carrier mobilities of $2000~\rm{cm}^2/\rm{Vs}$. When coupled to our theoretical demonstration of symmetry-protected $\textit{almost movable}$ Weyl nodal lines, we conclude that LaRhGe$_3$ supports a Weyl semimetallic state. We discover superconductivity in this compound with a $T_{\text c}$ of 0.39(1) K and $B_{\rm{c}}(0)$ of 2.2(1) mT, with evidence from specific heat and transverse-field muon spin relaxation. We find an exponential dependence in the normal state electrical resistivity below $\sim50$ K, while Seebeck coefficient and thermal conductivity measurements each reveal a prominent peak at low temperatures, indicative of strong electron-phonon interactions. To this end, we examine the temperature-dependent Raman spectra of LaRhGe$_3$ and find that the lifetime of the lowest energy $A_1$ phonon is dominated by phonon-electron scattering instead of anharmonic decay. We conclude that LaRhGe$_3$ has strong electron-phonon coupling in the normal state, while the superconductivity emerges from weak electron-phonon coupling. These results open up the investigation of electron-phonon interactions in the normal state of superconducting non-centrosymmetric Weyl semimetals.</description>

      <title>Nanofluidic platform for studying the first-order phase transitions in superfluid helium-3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06079v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The symmetry-breaking first-order phase transition between superfluid phases $^3$He-A and $^3$He-B can be triggered extrinsically by ionising radiation or heterogeneous nucleation arising from the details of the sample cell construction. However, the role of potential homogeneous intrinsic nucleation mechanisms remains elusive. Discovering and resolving the intrinsic processes may have cosmological consequences, since an analogous first-order phase transition, and the production of gravitational waves, has been predicted for the very early stages of the expanding Universe in many extensions of the Standard Model of particle physics. Here we introduce a new approach for probing the phase transition in superfluid $^3$He. The setup consists of a novel stepped-height nanofluidic sample container with close to atomically smooth walls. The $^3$He is confined in five tiny nanofabricated volumes and assayed non-invasively by NMR. Tuning of the state of $^3$He by confinement is used to isolate each of these five volumes so that the phase transitions in them can occur independently and free from any obvious sources of heterogeneous nucleation. The small volumes also ensure that the transitions triggered by ionising radiation are strongly suppressed. Here we present the preliminary measurements using this setup, showing both strong supercooling of $^3$He-A and superheating of $^3$He-B, with stochastic processes dominating the phase transitions between the two. The objective is to study the nucleation as a function of temperature and pressure over the full phase diagram, to both better test the proposed extrinsic mechanisms and seek potential parallel intrinsic mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Comment on "Trapped flux in a small crystal of CaKFe$_4$As$_4$ at ambient pressure and in a diamond anvil pressure cell" by S. L. Bud'ko et al</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17500v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In their paper arXiv:2405.08189, Supercond. Sci. Technol. 37 (2024) 065010 [1], Bud'ko et al. present experimental results for trapped magnetic flux for a tiny sample of a type II superconductor. The paper aims to provide evidence in support of the interpretation that similar measurements performed in samples of hydrogen-rich materials under high pressure by Minkov, Bud'ko and coauthors [2] are conclusive evidence [3] for superconductivity in hydrides under pressure. Here we point out that the new evidence presented by Bud'ko et al. [1] further supports our interpretation [4],[5] that the reported measurements of trapped flux on hydrides under pressure [2] are evidence that the samples are $not$ superconducting.</description>
