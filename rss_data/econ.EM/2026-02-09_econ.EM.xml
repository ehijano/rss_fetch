      <title>Identification and Estimation of Network Models with Nonparametric Unobserved Heterogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Homophily based on observables is widespread in networks. Therefore, homophily based on unobservables (fixed effects) is also likely to be an important determinant of the interaction outcomes. Failing to properly account for latent homophily (and other complex forms of unobserved heterogeneity) can result in inconsistent estimators and misleading policy implications. To address this concern, we consider a network model with nonparametric unobserved heterogeneity, leaving the role of the fixed effects unspecified. We argue that the interaction outcomes can be used to identify agents with the same values of the fixed effects. The variation in the observed characteristics of such agents allows us to identify the effects of the covariates, while controlling for the fixed effects. Building on these ideas, we construct several estimators of the parameters of interest and characterize their large sample properties. Numerical experiments illustrate the usefulness of the suggested approaches and support the asymptotic theory.</description>

      <title>Social Interactions Models with Latent Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies estimation and inference of heterogeneous peer effects featuring group fixed effects and slope heterogeneity under latent structure. We adapt the Classifier-Lasso algorithm to consistently discover latent structures and determine the number of clusters. To solve the incidental parameter problem in the binary choice model with social interactions, we propose a parametric bootstrap method to debias and establish its asymptotic validity. Monte Carlo simulations confirm strong finite sample performance of our methods. In an application to students' risky behaviors, the algorithm detects two latent clusters and finds that peer effects are significant within one of the clusters, demonstrating the practical applicability in uncovering heterogeneous social interactions.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity analysis of the perturbed utility stochastic traffic equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08347v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper develops a sensitivity analysis framework for the perturbed utility route choice (PURC) model and the accompanying stochastic traffic equilibrium model. We derive analytical sensitivity expressions for the Jacobian of the individual optimal PURC flow and equilibrium link flows with respect to link cost parameters under general assumptions. This allows us to determine the marginal change in link flows following a marginal change in link costs across the network. We show how to implement these results while exploiting the sparsity generated by the PURC model. Numerical examples illustrate the use of our method for estimating equilibrium link flows after link cost shifts, identifying critical design parameters, and quantifying uncertainty in performance predictions. Finally, we demonstrate the method in a large-scale example. The findings have implications for network design, pricing strategies, and policy analysis in transportation planning and economics, providing a bridge between theoretical models and real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Estimating the Intensive Margin Effect in Panel Data Settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08614v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many policies operate through two different channels: the extensive margin (e.g., the decision to participate) and the intensive margin (e.g., the intensity of the response among participants). This paper develops a novel identification strategy to estimate the intensive margin effect in panel data settings. I adapt the Horowitz-Manski-Lee bounds to the Changes-in-Changes framework to partially identify both the average and quantile intensive margin treatment effects. Additionally, I explore how to leverage multiple sources of sample selection to relax the monotonicity assumption in the original Horowitz-Manski-Lee bounds, which may be of independent interest. Alongside the identification strategy, I present estimators and inference results. I illustrate the relevance of the proposed methodology by analyzing a job training program in Colombia.</description>

      <title>High-dimensional censored MIDAS logistic regression for corporate survival forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09740v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of forecasting corporate distress, a problem marked by three key statistical hurdles: (i) right censoring, (ii) high-dimensional predictors, and (iii) mixed-frequency data. To overcome these complexities, we introduce a novel high-dimensional censored MIDAS (Mixed Data Sampling) logistic regression. Our approach handles censoring through inverse probability weighting and achieves accurate estimation with numerous mixed-frequency predictors by employing a sparse-group penalty. We establish finite-sample bounds for the estimation error, accounting for censoring, MIDAS approximation error, and heavy tails. For statistical inference, we develop a de-sparsified version of the proposed penalized estimator and establish its asymptotic theory, which enables valid statistical inference in high-dimensional settings with censoring. We show that censoring induces a nonstandard variance structure for the de-sparsified estimator, a feature that, to the best of our knowledge, has not been studied in the existing literature. The superior performance of the method is demonstrated through Monte Carlo simulations. Finally, we present an extensive application of our methodology to predict the financial distress of Chinese-listed firms and to identify covariates that are statistically significant for predicting distress. Our novel procedure is implemented in the R package \texttt{Survivalml}.</description>

      <title>Nested Pseudo-GMM Estimation of Demand for Differentiated Products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05137v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a fast algorithm for computing the GMM estimator in the BLP demand model (Berry, Levinsohn, and Pakes, 1995). Inspired by nested pseudo-likelihood methods for dynamic discrete choice models, our approach avoids repeatedly solving the inverse demand system by swapping the order of the GMM optimization and the fixed-point computation. We show that, by fixing consumer-level outside-option probabilities, BLP's market-share to mean-utility inversion becomes closed-form and, crucially, separable across products, yielding a nested pseudo-GMM algorithm with analytic gradients. The resulting estimator scales dramatically better with the number of products and is naturally suited for parallel and multithreaded implementation. In the inner loop, outside-option probabilities are treated as fixed objects while a pseudo-GMM criterion is minimized with respect to the structural parameters, substantially reducing computational cost. Monte Carlo simulations and an empirical application show that our method is significantly faster than the fastest existing alternatives, with efficiency gains that grow more than proportionally in the number of products.</description>
