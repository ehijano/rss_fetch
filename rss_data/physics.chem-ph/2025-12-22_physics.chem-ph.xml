      <title>How back reaction and hydrogen transport control the performance of hydrogen release from liquid organic carriers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrogen, as a clean energy carrier, is a promising option for sustainable energy storage and utilization, yet its storage and transportation remain challenging. Liquid Organic Hydrogen Carriers (LOHCs) provide a potential solution by enabling the reversible chemical binding and release of hydrogen. However, recent experimental studies have revealed a puzzling inhibition of catalytic activity during LOHC dehydrogenation, associated with the absence of hydrogen bubble formation, reduced hydrogen production rates and significant variability across experiments. In this work, we derive a model to elucidate the mechanisms underlying this inhibition, taking into account both the reversible nature of the hydrogenation-dehydrogenation reaction and the role of transport phenomena. Our results demonstrate that efficient transport of hydrogen away from the catalytic pellet is essential to suppress back-reactions and thereby maximize the performance of porous catalysts. In particular, we demonstrate that two distinct kinetic regimes - with high or strongly inhibited hydrogen production - can arise depending on whether bubble nucleation is enabled or suppressed. Beyond LOHC systems, our findings are applicable to a broader class of reversible reactions, particularly those involving volatile products that can leave the liquid reaction medium in form of bubbles.</description>

      <title>Fast, systematic and robust relative binding free energies for simple and complex transformations : dual-LAO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17624v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relative Binding Free Energy (RBFE) calculations are a cornerstone of rational hit-to-lead and lead optimization in modern drug discovery. However, the high computational cost and limited reliability in tackling large or complex molecular transformations often prevent their routine, high-throughput use. Here we introduce dual-LAO, a novel, highly efficient method for calculating RBFE. Building on the Lambda-ABF-OPES framework, this method combines a dual-topology setup and suitable restraints to dramatically accelerate free energy convergence. We demonstrate that dual-LAO, in combination with the AMOEBA polarizable force field, achieves an unprecedented acceleration factor of 15 to 30 times compared to current state-of-the-art methods on standard drug targets. Crucially, the approach maintains high accuracy and successfully tackles previously prohibitive molecular changes, including scaffold-hopping, buried water displacement, charge changes, ring-opening, and binding pose perturbations. This significant leap in efficiency allows for the widespread, routine integration of predictive molecular simulations into the rapid optimization cycles of drug discovery, enabling chemists to confidently model historically challenging systems in timescales compatible with real-world project deadlines.</description>

      <title>Signatures of coherent energy transfer and exciton delocalization in time-resolved optical cross correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how optical second-order cross correlations witness the quantum features of a prototype donor-acceptor light-harvesting unit. By considering a pair of detuned two-level emitters electronically coupled and incoherently driven to a non-equilibrium steady-state, we gain insight into how electronic quantum properties such as exciton eigenstate delocalization, coherent energy transfer and steady-state electronic coherence, are manifested in the joint probability of emission or optical second-order cross correlation. Specifically, we show that the frequency associated with oscillations present in time-resolved second-order cross correlation functions quantifies not only the time scale of coherent energy transfer but also the degree of delocalization of the exciton eigenstates. Furthermore, we show that time-resolved cross correlations directly witness steady-state electronic coherence. Our work strengthens the idea that measurements of the intensity quantum cross correlations can provide distinctive signatures of the quantum behavior of biophysical emitters.</description>

      <title>Theory of Non-Dichroic Enantio-Sensitive Chiroptical Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the photoelectron angular distributions produced by elliptical and cross-polarized two-color laser fields interacting with randomly oriented chiral molecules decompose into four irreducible representations of the $D_{2h}$ point group. One of these ($A_u$) corresponds to a non-dichroic enantiosensitive (NoDES) contribution. This NoDES contribution has opposite sign for opposite enantiomers but remains invariant under reversal of the field ellipticity, enabling chirality detection that is robust against variations of the relative phase between orthogonal field components. We propose a protocol to isolate this component using only two velocity-map imaging projections and validate it through numerical simulations. Our calculations, performed in the two-photon resonantly-enhanced ionization, multi-photon, and strong-field ionization regimes with cross-polarized two-color fields show that the NoDES signal reaches about 1\% of the energy-resolved ionization yield, comparable to photoelectron circular dichroism and much larger than standard magnetic-dipole chiroptical effects. NoDES spectroscopy thus provides a symmetry-protected and phase-robust route to probe molecular chirality on the ultrafast time scale. The experimental confirmation of our theory is presented in the companion paper [L. Fede et al., arXiv (2025)].</description>

      <title>Accurate atomic correlation and total energies for correlation consistent effective core potentials II: Rb-Xe elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employ correlation-consistent effective core potentials (ccECPs) to perform exact or nearly exact correlation and total energy calculations for the fifth-row elements (Rb-Xe). Total energies are calculated using various correlated methods: configuration interaction (CI), coupled-cluster (CC) up to perturbative quadruple excitations whenever feasible, and stochastic quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) approaches. In order to estimate the energy at the complete basis set (CBS) limit, the basis sets are constructed systematically through aug-cc-p(C)VnZ for each ccECP and further extrapolated to the CBS limit within the corresponding methods. Kinetic energies are evaluated at the FCI/CISD level to provide insights into the electron density and localization of the ccECPs. We also provide data sets for widely used diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) to quantify fixed-node biases with single-reference trial wavefunctions. These comprehensive benchmarks validate the accuracy of ccECPs within the CC, CI, and QMC methodologies, thus providing accurate and tested valence-only Hamiltonians for many-body electronic structure calculations.</description>

      <title>Influence of Pt/Ru ratios on the oxidation mechanism of MCrAlYTa coatings modified with Ptsingle bondRu overlays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the influence of varying Pt/Ru ratios on the oxidation mechanism of NiCoCrAlYTa coatings with electrodeposited, vacuum-annealed Ptsingle bondRu overlays. Weight change measurements, scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (SEM/EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were used for high-temperature oxidation analyses, showing superior resistance with higher Pt contents. This was attributed to the creation of a denser, thinner, and more homogeneous layer of alumina (alpha-Al2O3) in the thermally-grown oxide (TGO) layer. On the contrary, an increase in Ru contents led to the development of other oxides and microcracks along with alumina in the TGO layer, undermining oxidation protection. The accommodation of Ti and Ta, in the minimally-deteriorative form of carbide, along with Y into the TGO layer with increasing Pt contents further enhanced oxidation resistance. In addition to the explored significant impact of the Pt/Ru ratio on oxide scale characteristics and oxidation resistance, the lower cost of Ru compared to Pt suggests the potential for designing cost-effective systems through optimized Pt/Ru ratios and microstructural engineering.</description>

      <title>Comparative analysis of electrodeposited Pt, Ru and Pt-Ru overlays for high-temperature oxidation protection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Platinum (Pt) and ruthenium (Ru), both members of the platinum-group metals (PGMs), are renowned for their exceptional resistance to corrosion, oxidation, and high temperatures, making them promising candidates for advanced high-temperature applications. This study investigates the direct current (DC) electrodeposition of Pt, Ru, and a binary Pt-Ru alloy onto NiCoCrAlYTa-coated single-crystal superalloy CMSX-4, along with their vacuum annealing and respective effects on the isothermal oxidation behavior of the system at 1100 {\deg}C. All the electrodeposited overlays demonstrated substantial enhancement in oxidation resistance. However, Pt exhibited the highest protection efficiency, Ru the least, and the Pt-Ru alloy provided an intermediate level of performance. Microscopic and X-ray diffraction analyses revealed that the competitive formation of protective {\alpha}-Al2O3 and spinel NiAl2O4 phases on the coated surfaces played a crucial role in determining the oxidation resistance, driven by atomic interactions between the elements in the NiCoCrAlYTa bond coat and the overlay metals. Despite Ru's relatively lower oxidation resistance compared to Pt, its significantly lower cost offers potential advantages in cost-sensitive, high-temperature applications. These findings provide valuable insights into optimizing Pt-group metal coatings for durability in high-performance systems.</description>

      <title>Eliminating the irregular surface layer of anodically-grown Ni-Ti-O nanopore arrays in a two-stage anodization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nanopores (NPs) grown by anodizing can be partially hidden beneath a relatively compact surface oxide layer, which limits the volumetric surface area of these nanostructures. In this work, nitinol (NiTi) alloy was anodized in an electrolyte containing ethylene glycol, water, and sodium chloride in static and stirred electrolyte stages with the aim of removing the irregular surface array while achieving a thick NP layer. Electron micrographs showed that anodization in the static electrolyte provides a controlled thickness of NP layers covered by an irregular surface layer. In contrast, anodizing in the stirred electrolyte reduced the thickness and the degree of irregularity, which were controlled by the different kinetics of dissolution at the tops, perimeters and bottoms of NPs. To benefit simultaneously from the thickness and regularity of the oxide layers, two-stage anodizing under static and then stirred electrolyte conditions was found to be effective. Following a 30 min anodization in the static electrolyte, anodizing for 30 min under the stirred conditions provided the highest regularity in the oxide array, resulting in NPs of almost 40 nm and 11 {\mu}m in diameter and layer thickness, respectively. Two-stage anodizing under static then stirred electrolyte conditions is proposed in order to promote NP structures for applications demanding higher surface areas.</description>

      <title>Spectral finite-element formulation of the optimized effective potential method for atomic structure in the random phase approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a spectral finite-element formulation of the optimized effective potential (OEP) method for atomic structure calculations in the random phase approximation (RPA). In particular, we develop a finite-element framework that employs a polynomial mesh with element nodes placed according to the Chebyshev-Gauss-Lobatto scheme, high-order $\mathcal{C}^0$-continuous Lagrange polynomial basis functions, and Gauss-Legendre quadrature for spatial integration. We employ distinct polynomial degrees for the orbitals, Hartree potential, and RPA-OEP exchange-correlation potential. Through representative examples, we verify the accuracy of the developed framework, assess the fidelity of one-parameter double-hybrid functionals constructed with RPA correlation, and develop a machine-learned model for the RPA-OEP exchange-correlation potential at the level of the generalized gradient approximation, based on the kernel method and linear regression.</description>

      <title>Mechanistic Origin of Charge Separation and Enhanced Photocatalytic Activity in D-$\pi$-A-Functionalized UiO-66-NH$_2$ MOFs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Donor-$\pi$-acceptor (D-$\pi$-A) functionalization of MOF linkers can enhance visible-light photocatalytic activity, yet the mechanisms responsible for these effects remain unclear. Here we combine EPR spectroscopy, transient photoluminescence, and first-principles calculations to examine how diazo-coupled anisole, diphenylamine (DPA), and N,N-dimethylaniline (NNDMA) groups modify the photophysics of UiO-66-NH$_2$. All donor units introduce new occupied states near the valence-band edge, enabling charge separation through dye-to-framework electron transfer. Among them, the anisole-modified material stands out for facilitating efficient intersystem crossing into a triplet charge-transfer configuration that suppresses fast recombination and yields long-lived charge carriers detectable by photo-EPR. Meanwhile, bulkier donors such as DPA and NNDMA - despite their stronger electron-donating character - also tend to introduce defect-associated trap states. These results underscore the interplay between donor-induced electronic-structure changes, triplet pathways, and defect-mediated recombination, offering a mechanistic basis for tuning photocatalytic response in D-$\pi$-A-modified MOFs.</description>

      <title>Witnessing Entanglement in Mixed-Particle Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce an entanglement witness that identifies off-diagonal long-range order (ODLRO) -- a distinctive form of entanglement -- in systems containing both fermionic and bosonic particles. By analyzing the particle-hole reduced density matrices of each subsystem, the approach detects ODLRO independently in both fermionic and bosonic sectors and identifies when long-range order develops across the entire mixed-particle system. The witness also quantifies the magnitude of ODLRO within each particle type, revealing how fermionic and bosonic correlations combine to form the total entanglement of the system, including a bosonic condensation of particle-hole pairs driven by many-body correlations rather than particle statistics. Using the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick spin model, we show how the transition from ODLRO localized to one particle type to ODLRO shared by both particle types captures the onset of collective entanglement in a mixed-particle environment, providing new insight into systems where fermionic and bosonic correlations coexist.</description>

      <title>Experimentally Mapping the Phase Diagrams of Photoexcited Small Polarons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the fundamental properties that dictate photoexcited polarons in materials is critical to tuning their properties. Theoretical models of polarons have only recently been extended to the excited state. Experimental measurements of polaron formation and transport have been widely undertaken across a range of materials, from photocatalysts and superconductors to soft conducting polymers. Here, we map experimental measurements of quantities such as polaron strength onto phase diagrams of the Holstein, Hubbard-Holstein, and t-J-Holstein models. This work demonstrates that tuning electron-phonon coupling strength, electron localization, and spin exchange can be leveraged to suppress or control polaron formation in transition metal oxides. We find that the t-J-Holstein model best describes the measured iron oxides and could be generally applied to a wide range of systems that exhibit polaron formation in the excited state. This work combines experimental data with ground state models to provide a robust parameter space for informing photoexcited polaron design.</description>

      <title>Beyond Force Metrics: Pre-Training MLFFs for Stable MD Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14850v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine-learning force fields (MLFFs) have emerged as a promising solution for speeding up ab initio molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, where accurate force predictions are critical but often computationally expensive. In this work, we employ GemNet-T, a graph neural network model, as an MLFF and investigate two training strategies: (1) direct training on MD17 (10K samples) without pre-training, and (2) pre-training on the large-scale OC20 dataset followed by fine-tuning on MD17 (10K). While both approaches achieve low force mean absolute errors (MAEs), reaching 5 meV/A per atom, we find that lower force errors do not necessarily guarantee stable MD simulations. Notably, the pre-trained GemNet-T model yields significantly improved simulation stability, sustaining trajectories up to three times longer than the model trained from scratch. By analyzing local properties of the learned force fields, we find that pre-training produces more structured latent representations, smoother force responses to local geometric changes, and more consistent force differences between nearby configurations, all of which contribute to more stable and reliable MD simulations. These findings underscore the value of pre-training on large, diverse datasets to capture complex molecular interactions and highlight that force MAE alone is not always a sufficient metric of MD simulation stability.</description>

Abstract: The coherent-state initial-value representation (IVR) for the semi-classical real-time propagator of a quantum system, developed by Herman and Kluk (HK), is widely used in computational studies of chemical dynamics. On the other hand, the Boltzmann operator $e^{-\hat{H}/(k_B T)}$, with $\hat{H}$,$k_B$, and $T$ representing the Hamiltonian, Boltzmann constant, and temperature, respectively, plays a crucial role in chemical physics and other branches of quantum physics. One might naturally assume that a semi-classical IVR for the matrix element of this operator in the coordinate representation (i.e., $ \langle \tilde{x} | e^{-\hat{H}/(k_B T)} | x \rangle$, or the imaginary-time propagator) could be derived via a straightforward ``real-time $\rightarrow$ imaginary-time transformation'' from the HK IVR of the real-time propagator. However, this is not the case, as such a transformation results in a divergence in the high-temperature limit $(T \rightarrow \infty)$. In this work, we solve this problem and develop a reasonable HK-like semi-classical IVR for $ \langle \tilde{x} | e^{-\hat{H}/(k_B T)} | x \rangle$ specifically for systems where either the gradient of the potential energy (i.e., the force intensity) has a finite upper bound, or the potential becomes harmonic in the long-range limit. The integrand in this IVR is a real Gaussian function of the positions $x$ and $\tilde{x}$, which facilitates its application to realistic problems. Our HK-like IVR is exact for free particles and harmonic oscillators, and its effectiveness for other systems is demonstrated through numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Modeling Diffusion and Permeation Across the Stratum Corneum Lipid Barrier</title>

Abstract: Human skin oils are a major sink for ozone in densely occupied indoor environments. Understanding how the resulting volatile and semivolatile organic oxidation products influence indoor air chemistry requires accurate representations not only of their emission into indoor air but also of their transport across the outermost skin barrier, the stratum corneum. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we investigate the passive permeation of acetone, 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one, and water -- two representative products of skin-oil oxidation and a reference compound -- through a model stratum corneum lipid membrane. We determine position-dependent diffusivities using two complementary analyses based on the same set of simulations and evaluate their accuracy through a propagator analysis. The two approaches provide upper and lower bounds for the true diffusivity, which, when combined with previously reported free-energy profiles, yield permeabilities relevant for modeling macroscopic skin transport. Our results show that permeation is governed primarily by energetic barriers rather than by molecular mobility, and that the predicted transport coefficients vary by about one order of magnitude depending on the chosen diffusivity estimator. These findings provide molecular-level constraints for parameters used in indoor air chemistry models and establish a transferable framework for linking atomistic transport mechanisms to large-scale simulations of human exposure and indoor air quality.</description>
