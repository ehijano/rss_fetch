      <title>Opinion polarisation in social networks driven by cognitive dissonance avoidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the consequences of opinion polarization effect our everyday life in more and more aspect, the understanding of its origins and driving forces becomes increasingly important. Here we develop an agent-based network model with realistic human traits: individuals in our simulations are endowed with an internal belief system which they attempt to keep as coherent as possible. This desire -- to reassure existing attitudes while avoiding cognitive dissonance -- is one of the most influential and widely accepted theories in social psychology by now. Our model shows that even in networks that start out completely uniform (from a society of clones), this effort leads to fragmentation and polarization, reflected both by the individual beliefs (attitudes) and the emerging communities in the social network. By fine-tuning two parameters: (i) "dissonance penalty", measuring the strength with which agents attempt to avoid cognitive dissonance, and (ii) "triadic closure affinity", the parameter reflecting agents' likelihood to connect with friends of friends, a wide range of possible community structures are observed.</description>

      <title>Divergence asymmetry and connected components in a general duplication-divergence graph model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This Letter introduces a generalization of known duplication-divergence models for growing random graphs. This general model includes a coupled divergence asymmetry rate, which allows to obtain, for the first time, the structure of random growing networks by duplication and divergence in a continuous range of configurations between complete asymmetric divergence -- divergence rates affect only edges emanating from one of the duplicate vertices -- and symmetric divergence -- divergence rates affect equiprobably both the original and the copy vertex. Multiple connected sub-graphs (of order greater than one) emerge as the divergence asymmetry rate slightly moves from the complete asymmetric divergence case. Mean-field results of priorly published models are nicely reproduced by this general model. Moreover, in special cases, the connected sub-graph size distribution $C_s$ of networks grown by this model suggests a power-law scaling of the form $C_s \sim s^{-\lambda}$ for $s&gt;1$, e.g., with $\lambda \approx 5/3$ for divergence rate $\delta \approx 0.7$.</description>

      <title>Collective memory, consensus, and learning explained by social cohesion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14386v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Humans cluster in social groups where they discuss their shared past, problems, and potential solutions; they learn collectively when they repeat activities; they establish social norms; they synchronize when they sing or dance together; and they bond through social cohesion. A group is more cohesive if its members are closer together in their network and are bonded by multiple connections. Network proximity and redundancy are indicated by the second smallest eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrix of the group network, called the algebraic connectivity. This eigenvalue is key to explaining and predicting the outcomes of said activities.</description>

      <title>On the Principles behind Opinion Dynamics in Multi-Agent Systems of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15492v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the evolution of opinions inside a population of interacting large language models (LLMs). Every LLM needs to decide how much funding to allocate to an item with three initial possibilities: full, partial, or no funding. We identify biases that drive the exchange of opinions based on the LLM's tendency to find consensus with the other LLM's opinion, display caution when specifying funding, and consider ethical concerns in its opinion. We find these biases are affected by the perceived absence of compelling reasons for opinion change, the perceived willingness to engage in discussion, and the distribution of allocation values. Moreover, tensions among biases can lead to the survival of funding for items with negative connotations. We also find that the final distribution of full, partial, and no funding opinions is more diverse when an LLM freely forms its opinion after an interaction than when its opinion is a multiple-choice selection among the three allocation options. In the latter case, consensus is mostly attained. When agents are aware of past opinions, they seek to maintain consistency with them, changing the opinion dynamics. Our study is performed using Llama 3 and Mistral LLMs.</description>
