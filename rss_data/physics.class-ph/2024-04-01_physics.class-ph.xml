      <title>Existence and Uniqueness of Rayleigh waves with both normal and tangential boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Impedance boundary condition are of great interest in linear elasticity as a method to model several non-standard problems. Recently, in the frame of surface wave propagation in an elastic isotropic half-space, Godoy et al. [Wave Motion 49 (2012), 585-594] proposed a general class of impedance boundary conditions that generalize the standard stress-free boundary condition in the non-dispersive regime. A natural question that arises in this context is whether the property of existence and uniqueness of a surface wave, observed in the stress-free case (called Rayleigh wave), holds for full Godoy's impedance boundary conditions. Godoy et al. addressed this question for the tangential case (the tangential stress is proportional to the horizontal displacement times the frequency and the normal stress vanishes). Recently, Giang and Vinh [J Eng Math 130, 13 (2021)] studied the normal case (the tangential stress vanishes and the normal stress is proportional to the normal displacement times the frequency). In this work, we consider an uniparametric family of Godoy's impedance boundary conditions defined by proportional ratios of the same magnitude but opposite sign. We demonstrate the existence and uniqueness of the Rayleigh surface wave for each value of the impedance parameter, showing for the first time that full Godoy's impedance boundary conditions are also capable of explaining surface wave propagation. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the effect of the impedance parameter in the speed of the surface wave.</description>

      <title>Principle of virtual action in continuum mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the principle of virtual action as  a foundation of continuum mechanics.  Used mainly in relativity, the method has a useful application in classical mechanics and places the notion of action as the basic concept of dynamics. The principle is an extension of virtual work to space-time. It extends the efforts made by d'Alembert and Lagrange.   Unlike the classical case of equilibrium, the principle of virtual action becomes a  postulate for the formulation of models in dynamics.  It allows to use a minimal set of clear conjectures and is extended to the case of media with dissipation; it can be used for more complex systems.</description>
