      <title>Superperiods and superstring measure near the boundary of the moduli space of supercurves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the behavior of the superperiod map near the boundary of the moduli space of stable supercurves and prove that it is similar to the behavior of periods of classical curves. We consider two applications to the geometry of this moduli space in genus $2$, denoted as $\bar{\mathcal S}_2$. First, we characterize the canonical projection of $\bar{\mathcal S}_2$ in terms of its behavior near the boundary, proving in particular that $\bar{\mathcal S}_2$ is not projected. Secondly, we combine the information on superperiods with the explicit calculation of genus $2$ Mumford isomorphism, due to Witten, to study the expansion of the superstring measure for genus $2$ near the boundary. We also present the proof, due to Deligne, of regularity of the superstring measure on $\bar{\mathcal S}_g$ for any genus.</description>

      <title>Unirationality is the Same as Rational Connectedness in Characteristic Zero</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we describe a fibration for a smooth, projective variety $ X $ over a field of characteristic zero. This fibration is similar to the MRC fibration, and we call it the MU fibration of $ X $. The MU fibration $ \pi: X \dashrightarrow MU(X) $ is characterized by the following properties: i) The very general fibres of $ \pi $ are unirational, ii) if $ Z $ is a unirational sub-variety of $ X $, $ z $ is a very general point of $ MU(X) $ (i.e., a point in the complement of a countable union of Zariski closed sub-sets of $ MU(X) $), and $ Z $ intersects $ \pi^{-1}(z) $ non-trivially, then $ Z $ is contained in $ \pi^{-1}(z) $, iii) The variety $ MU(X) $ is unique up to birational equivalence. If we call $ MU(X) $ a maximal unirational quotient, then $ X $ is unirational if and only if the dimension of any maximal unirational quotient is equal to zero. We use this work to show that unirationality, rational connectedness, and rational chain connectedness are equivalent for smooth varieties over a field of characteristic zero, and that the MRC quotient of a smooth, projective variety over a field of characteristic zero is not uniruled.</description>

      <title>Local Local-global principle for leaf schemes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Hodge loci as leaf schemes of foliations. The main ingredient is the Gauss-Manin connection matrix of families of projective varieties. We also aim to investigate a conjecture on the ring of definition of leaf schemes and its consequences such as the algebraicity of leaf schemes (Cattani-Deligne-Kaplan theorem in the case of Hodge loci). This conjecture is a consequence of a local-global principle for leaf schemes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We classify geometrically integral regular del Pezzo surfaces which are not geometrically normal over imperfect fields of positive characteristic. Based on this classification, we show that a three-dimensional terminal del Pezzo fibration onto a curve over an algebraically closed field always admits a section. Moreover, we prove that the total space is rational if the base curve is rational and the anticanonical degree of a fibre is at least five.</description>

      <title>Towards Brill-Noether Theory for Spectral Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate Brill-Noether loci of two kinds of spectral curves: double covers whose branch locus is a canonical divisor and spectral covers of the projective line. Our techniques are based on the Hitchin correspondence and Higgs bundles.
  For the first kind our results determine the gonality sequence, when the rank of the linear system is much smaller than the genus. For this the curve and the branch divisor are assumed to be general. In the second case we compute dimensions of the finer splitting loci if these spaces are non-empty. We compare this result with the existing literature about general curves with a fixed gonality.</description>

      <title>On the distribution of non-rigid families in the moduli spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the Shafarevich conjecture, we introduce the notions of very general rigidity and generic rigidity to characterize the distribution of non-rigid families in the corresponding moduli space. Our main results focus on moduli spaces of polarized manifolds where the infinitesimal Torelli theorem holds. We show that if the derived Mumford-Tate group of the associated polarized $\mathbb{Z}$-variation of Hodge structures is absolutely simple, then the moduli space $\mathcal{M}$ has the very general rigidity property, meaning all non-rigid families are contained within a countable union of closed strict irreducible subschemes of $\mathcal{M}$. If, in addition, the associated Mumford-Tate domain is not a bounded symmetric domain of rank greater than one, then the moduli space exhibits a stronger rigidity property, generic rigidity, where the countable union in the definition of very general rigidity is replaced by a finite union. As a corollary of the generic rigidity, we establish a geometric version of the Bombieri-Lang-type finiteness result. Many examples of moduli spaces, such as those of projective hypersurfaces of certain degrees, satisfy the conditions of our main theorems. We also explore the relationship between the bases of maximally non-rigid families and special subvarieties in the moduli spaces of Calabi-Yau manifolds, inspired by a detailed analysis of Viehweg-Zuo's example of maximally non-rigid families of Calabi-Yau quintics in $\mathbb{P}^4$.</description>

      <title>Finite abelian groups acting on rationally connected threefolds I: Groups of product type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We initiate the study of finite abelian groups that faithfully act on three-dimensional rationally connected varieties. We show that these groups can be naturally divided into three types. The first type consists of finite abelian groups that are products of two groups that belong to the Cremona group of rank 1 and 2, respectively; the second type consists of cyclic extensions of finite abelian groups acting on a K3 surface; the third type consists of groups that act on terminal Fano threefolds with empty anti-canonical linear system. We also establish a boundedness result for the groups of the second type.</description>

      <title>On reflection maps from n-space to n+1-space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we consider some problems about a reflected graph map germ $f$ from $(\mathbb{C}^n,0)$ to $(\mathbb{C}^{n+1},0)$. A reflected graph map is a particular case of a reflection map, which is defined using an embedding of $\mathbb{C}^n$ in $\mathbb{C}^{p}$ and then applying the action of a reflection group $G$ on $\mathbb{C}^{p}$. In this work, we present a description of the presentation matrix of $f_*{\cal O}_n$ as an ${\cal O}_{n+1}$-module via $f$ in terms of the action of the associated reflection group $G$. We also give a description for a defining equation of the image of $f$ in terms of the action of $G$. Finally, we present an upper (and also a lower) bound for the multiplicity of the image of $f$ and some applications.</description>

      <title>Degree two Gopakumar-Vafa invariants of local curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the Gopakumar-Vafa (GV) theory of local curves, namely, the total spaces of rank two vector bundles with canonical determinant on smooth projective curves. Under a certain genericity condition on the rank two bundles, we propose a general mechanism to compute the degree two GV invariants of local curves. In particular, we determine all the degree two GV invariants when the base curve has genus two. Combined with previous work by Bryan and Pandharipande, we obtain the GV/GW correspondence in this case. When the base curve has genus greater than two, we calculate GV invariants for some extremal genera, providing evidence for the GV/GW conjecture for curves of higher genus.</description>

Abstract: We describe the behaviour of a free conic-line arrangement to the deletion, respectively addition, of a smooth conic. Along the way we derive some restrictions on the geometry of a conic-line arrangement induced by the freeness property. We show the same behaviour extends to free reduced curves in general.</description>

Abstract: We specify a Turing machine $T_{\text{Mordell}}$ with the following properties.
  1. On input $(K,C/K)$, with $K/\mathbb{Q}$ a number field and $C/K$ a smooth projective hyperbolic curve, if $T_{\text{Mordell}}$ terminates, then it outputs $C(K)$.
  2. The Hodge, Tate, and Fontaine-Mazur conjectures imply that $T_{\text{Mordell}}$ always terminates.
  Similarly we specify a Turing machine $T_{\text{Shafarevich}}$ with the following properties.
  1. On input $(g, K,S, d)$, with $g, d \in \mathbb{Z}^+$, $K/\mathbb{Q}$ a number field, and $S$ a finite set of places of $K$, if $T_{\text{Shafarevich}}$ terminates, then it outputs the finitely many polarized $g$-dimensional abelian varieties $A/K$, with polarization of degree $d$, having good reduction outside $S$.
  2. The Hodge, Tate, and Fontaine-Mazur conjectures imply that $T_{\text{Shafarevich}}$ always terminates.</description>

      <title>Sum of Squares Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing expressive generative models that support exact and efficient inference is a core question in probabilistic ML. Probabilistic circuits (PCs) offer a framework where this tractability-vs-expressiveness trade-off can be analyzed theoretically. Recently, squared PCs encoding subtractive mixtures via negative parameters have emerged as tractable models that can be exponentially more expressive than monotonic PCs, i.e., PCs with positive parameters only. In this paper, we provide a more precise theoretical characterization of the expressiveness relationships among these models. First, we prove that squared PCs can be less expressive than monotonic ones. Second, we formalize a novel class of PCs -- sum of squares PCs -- that can be exponentially more expressive than both squared and monotonic PCs. Around sum of squares PCs, we build an expressiveness hierarchy that allows us to precisely unify and separate different tractable model classes such as Born Machines and PSD models, and other recently introduced tractable probabilistic models by using complex parameters. Finally, we empirically show the effectiveness of sum of squares circuits in performing distribution estimation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.16187v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a complete answer to the rationality problem (up to stable $k$-equivalence) for norm one tori $T=R^{(1)}_{K/k}(\mathbb{G}_m)$ of $K/k$ whose Galois closures $L/k$ are $A_5\simeq {\rm PSL}_2(\mathbb{F}_4)$ and ${\rm PSL}_2(\mathbb{F}_8)$ extensions. In particular, we prove that $T$ is stably $k$-rational for $G={\rm Gal}(L/k)\simeq {\rm PSL}_2(\mathbb{F}_{8})$, $H={\rm Gal}(L/K)\simeq (C_2)^3$ and $H\simeq (C_2)^3\rtimes C_7$ where $C_n$ is the cyclic group of order $n$. Based on the result, we conjecture that $T$ is stably $k$-rational for $G\simeq {\rm PSL}_2(\mathbb{F}_{2^d})$, $H\simeq (C_2)^d$ and $H\simeq (C_2)^d\rtimes C_{2^d-1}$. Some other cases $G\simeq A_n$, $S_n$, ${\rm GL}_n(\mathbb{F}_{p^d})$, ${\rm SL}_n(\mathbb{F}_{p^d})$, ${\rm PGL}_n(\mathbb{F}_{p^d})$, ${\rm PSL}_n(\mathbb{F}_{p^d})$ and $H\lneq G$ are also investigated for small $n$ and $p^d$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.09391v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the singularities of secant varieties of smooth projective varieties using methods from birational geometry when the embedding line bundle is sufficiently positive. More precisely, we study the Du Bois complex of secant varieties and its relationship with the sheaves of differential forms. Through this analysis, we give a necessary and sufficient condition for these varieties to have $p$-Du Bois singularities (in a sense that was proposed in [SVV23]). In addition, we show that the singularities of these varieties are never higher rational, by giving a classification of the cases when they are pre-1-rational. From these results, we deduce several consequences, including a Kodaira-Akizuki-Nakano type vanishing result for the reflexive differential forms of the secant varieties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.04852v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $E$ be a uniform bundle on an arbitrary generalised Grassmannian $X$ defined over $\mathbb{C}$. We show that if the rank of $E$ is at most $e.d.(\mathrm{VMRT})$, then $E$ necessarily splits. For some generalised Grassmannians, we prove that the upper bounds $e.d.(\mathrm{VMRT})$ are optimal and classify all unsplit uniform bundles of minimal ranks. Under some special assumptions, we show that morphisms to some generalised flag varieties must be constant, which partially answered a conjecture of Kumar.</description>

      <title>Three approaches to a categorical Torelli theorem for cubic threefolds of non-Eckardt type via the equivariant Kuznetsov components</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20554v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $Y$ be a cubic threefold with a non-Eckardt type involution $\tau$. Our first main result is that the $\tau$-equivariant category of the Kuznetsov component $\mathcal{K}u_{\mathbb{Z}_2}(Y)$ determines the isomorphism class of $Y$ for general $(Y,\tau)$. We shall prove this categorical Torelli theorem via three approaches: a noncommutative Hodge theoretical one (using a generalization of the intermediate Jacobian construction due to Alexander Perry), a Bridgeland moduli theoretical one (using equivariant stability conditions), and a Chow theoretical one (using some techniques in [kuznetsovnonclodedfield2021]).The remaining part of the paper is devoted to proving an equivariant infinitesimal categorical Torelli for non-Eckardt cubic threefolds $(Y,\tau)$. To accomplish it, we prove a compatibility theorem on the algebra structures of the Hochschild cohomology of the bounded derived category $D^b(X)$ of a smooth projective variety $X$ and on the Hochschild cohomology of a semi-orthogonal component of $D^b(X)$. Another key ingredient is a generalization of a result in [macri2009infinitesima] which shows that the twisted Hochschild-Kostant-Rosenberg isomorphism is compatible with the actions on the Hochschild cohomology and on the singular cohomology induced by an automorphism of $X$. In appendix, we prove an equivariant categorical Torelli theorem for arbitrary cubic threefold with a geometric involution under a natural assumption.</description>

      <title>Terminal 3-folds that are not Cohen-Macaulay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02608v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An important local vanishing theorem for the minimal model program is the fact that klt singularities in characteristic zero are Cohen-Macaulay. In contrast, even in the narrow setting of terminal singularities of dimension 3, we show that Cohen-Macaulayness can fail in characteristic $p$ or mixed characteristic $(0,p)$ for $p$ equal to 2, 3, or 5. This is optimal, by work of Arvidsson-Bernasconi-Lacini.
  The examples are quotients of regular schemes by the cyclic group $G$ of order $p$. In characteristic $p$ or mixed characteristic, such quotients can exhibit a wide range of behavior. Our key technical tool is a sufficient condition for quotients by $G$ to have only toric singularities.</description>

      <title>Three perspectives on categorical symmetric Howe duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.07584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2001.07584v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the categorical symmetric Howe duality introduced by Khovanov, Lauda, Sussan and Yonezawa. While originally defined from a purely diagrammatic perspective, this construction also has geometric and representation-theoretic interpretations, corresponding to certain perverse sheaves on spaces of quiver representations and the category of Gelfand-Tsetlin modules over $\mathfrak{gl}_n$.
  In particular, we show that the "deformed Webster algebras" discussed in work of Khovanov-Lauda-Sussan-Yonezawa manifest a Koszul duality between blocks of the category of Gelfand-Tsetlin modules over $\mathfrak{gl}_n$, and the constructible sheaves on representations of a linear quiver invariant under a certain parabolic in the group that acts by changing bases. Furthermore, we show that this duality intertwines translation functors with a diagrammatic categorical action. Includes an appendix by the author and Jerry Guan.</description>

      <title>Generalized metric tree arrangements and Dressians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.06868v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Metric trees and metric tree arrangements index cones in the polyhedral fan structure in the Dressian $Dr(2,n)$ and $Dr(3,n)$ respectively. We introduce the notion of generalized metric tree arrangements which parameterize points in $Dr(k,n)$ and extend previously known results to $Dr(k,n)$ along with providing explicit examples of these generalized metric tree arrangements. We study the adjacency of cones in the positive Dressian $Dr_{&gt;0}(3, n)$ and introduce generalized Whitehead moves which provide a condition for adjacency of maximal cones in $Dr_{&gt;0}(3,n)$ in terms of the associated metric tree arrangements.</description>

      <title>A positive proportion of monic odd-degree hyperelliptic curves of genus $g \geq 4$ have no unexpected quadratic points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09421v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{F}_g$ be the family of monic odd-degree hyperelliptic curves of genus $g$ over $\mathbb{Q}$. Poonen and Stoll have shown that for every $g \geq 3$, a positive proportion of curves in $\mathcal{F}_g$ have no rational points except the point at infinity. In this note, we prove the analogue for quadratic points: for each $g\geq 4$, a positive proportion of curves in $\mathcal{F}_g$ have no points defined over quadratic extensions except those that arise by pulling back rational points from $\mathbb{P}^1$.</description>
