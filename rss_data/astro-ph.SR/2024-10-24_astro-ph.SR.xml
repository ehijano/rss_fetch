      <title>WIYN Open Cluster Study. XC. Radial-velocity Measurements and Spectroscopic Binary Orbits in the Open Cluster NGC 2506</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: NGC 2506 is a rich, intermediate-age (2.0 Gyr), metal-poor ([Fe/H] $\sim$ -0.2) open cluster. This work presents the results of 12,157 spectroscopic radial-velocity measurements of 2,442 stars in the NGC 2506 field over 41 years, made as part of the WIYN Open Cluster Study. Radial-velocity measurements are complete for the population of proper-motion member stars brighter than a Gaia G magnitude of 15.5, in which 320 proper-motion and radial-velocity cluster members were identified. Within the observation limit of G $&lt;$ 16.5, 469 proper-motion and radial-velocity members were identified. This work reports on the characteristics of NGC 2506, including projected spatial distribution, radial-velocity dispersion, and virial mass. This work also presents orbital solutions for 49 binary members with periods between 1 and 7,580 days. NGC 2506 has an incompleteness-corrected binary frequency for binaries with periods less than $10^4$ days of $35 \pm 5$%. This work also discusses in detail the 14 blue stragglers stars of NGC 2506$\unicode{x2014}$finding at least 64 $\pm$ 21% to be in binaries, 5 yellow straggler stars, and several other stars of note.</description>

      <title>Nested active regions anchor the heliospheric current sheet and stall the reversal of the coronal magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During the solar cycle, the Sun's magnetic field polarity reverses due to the emergence, cancellation, and advection of magnetic flux towards the rotational poles. Flux emergence events occasionally cluster together, although it is unclear if this is due to the underlying solar dynamo or simply by chance. Regardless of the cause, we aim to characterise how the reversal of the Sun's magnetic field and the structure of the solar corona are influenced by nested flux emergence. From the spherical harmonic decomposition of the Sun's photospheric magnetic field, we identify times when the reversal of the dipole component stalls for several solar rotations. Using observations from sunspot cycle 23 to present, we locate the nested active regions responsible for each stalling and explore their impact on the coronal magnetic field using potential field source surface extrapolations. Nested flux emergence has a more significant impact on the topology of the coronal magnetic field than isolated emergences as it produces a coherent (low spherical harmonic order) contribution to the photospheric magnetic field. The heliospheric current sheet (HCS), that separates oppositely directed coronal magnetic field, can become anchored above these regions due to the formation of strong opposing magnetic fluxes. Further flux emergence, cancellation, differential rotation, and diffusion, then effectively advects the HCS and shifts the dipole axis. Nested flux emergence can restrict the evolution of the HCS and impede the reversal of the coronal magnetic field. The sources of the solar wind can be more consistently identified around nested active regions as the magnetic field topology remains self-similar for multiple solar rotations. This highlights the importance of identifying nested active regions to guide the remote-sensing observations of modern heliophysics missions.</description>

      <title>ExoMol Line Lists -- LXII: Ro-Vibrational Energy Levels and Line-Strengths for the Propadienediylidene (C3) in its Ground Electronic State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Improved opacities are needed for modelling the atmospheres and evolution of cool carbon-rich stars and extra-solar planets; in particular, contributions made by the astrophysically important propadienediylidene (C$_3$) molecule need, at a minimum, to be determined using a line list which includes all significant transitions in the energy range of interest. We report variational calculations giving ro-vibrational energy levels and corresponding line-strengths for $^{12}$C$_3$, $^{12}$C$^{13}$C$^{12}$C and $^{12}$C$^{12}$C$^{13}$C. In the $^{12}$C$_3$ case we obtain 2166503 ro-vibrational state energies $\le$ 20000 cm$^{-1}$ for the electronic $\tilde{X}^1 \Sigma_g^+$ ground-state. Comparison with experiment indicates a maximum error of +/- 0.03 cm$^{-1}$ in calculated positions of lines involving an upper state energy $\lesssim$ 4000 cm$^{-1}$. For lines with upper state energies $\gtrsim$ 4000 cm$^{-1}$ to have comparable line-position accuracies, conical intersections would need to be accounted for in an adopted potential energy surface. Line lists and associated opacities are provided in the ExoMol Database http://www.exomol.com ).</description>

      <title>The Formation of Black Holes in Non-interacting, Isolated Binaries. Gaia Black Holes as Calibrators of Stellar Winds From Massive Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. The black holes discovered using Gaia, especially Gaia BH1 and BH2, have low mass companions of solar-like metallicity in wide orbits. For standard isolated binary evolution formation channels including interactions such an extreme mass ratio is unexpected; especially in orbits of hundreds to thousands of days. Aims. Here, we investigate a non-interacting formation path for isolated binaries to explain the formation of Gaia BH1 and BH2. Methods. We use single star models computed with MESA to constrain the main characteristics of possible progenitors of long-period black hole binaries like Gaia BH1 and BH2. Then, we incorporate these model grids into the binary population synthesis code POSYDON, to explore whether the formation of the observed binaries at solar metallicity is indeed possible. Results. We find that winds of massive stars ($\gtrsim 80\,M_\odot$), especially during the Wolf-Rayet phase, tend to cause a plateau in the initial stellar mass to final black hole mass relation (at about $13\,M_\odot$ in our default wind prescription). However, stellar winds at earlier evolutionary phases are also important at high metallicity, as they prevent the most massive stars from expanding ($&lt;100\,R_\odot$) and filling their Roche lobe. Consequently, the strength of the applied winds affects the range of the final black hole masses in non-interacting binaries, making it possible to form systems similar to Gaia BH1 and BH2. Conclusions. We deduce that wide binaries with a black hole and a low mass companion can form at high metallicity without binary interactions. There could be hundreds of such systems in the Milky Way. The mass of the black hole in binaries evolved through the non-interacting channel can potentially provide insights into the wind strength during the progenitors evolution.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Parameters of a Binary System Consisting of a Red Dwarf and a Compact Star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: TIC 157365951 has been classified as a $\delta$ Scuti type by the International Variable Star Index (VSX). Through the spectra from Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) and its light curve, we further discovered that it is a binary system. This binary system comprises a red dwarf star and a compact star. Through the spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting, we determined the mass of the red dwarf star as $M_1 = 0.31 \pm 0.01 M_{\odot}$ and its radius as $R_1 = 0.414 \pm 0.004 R_{\odot}$. By fitting the double-peaked H${\rm \alpha}$ emission, we derived the mass ratio of $q = 1.76 \pm 0.04 $, indicating a compact star mass of $M_2 = 0.54 \pm 0.01 M_{\odot}$. Using Phoebe to model the light curve and radial velocity curve for the detached binary system, we obtained a red dwarf star mass of $M_1 = 0.29 \pm 0.02 M_{\odot}$, a radius of $R_1 = 0.39 \pm 0.04 R_{\odot}$, and a Roche-lobe filling factor of $f = 0.995\pm0.129$, which is close to the $f=1$ expected for a semi-detached system. The Phoebe model gives a compact star mass $M_2 = 0.53 \pm 0.05 M_{\odot}$. Constraining the system to be semidetached gives $M_1 = 0.34 \pm 0.02 M_{\odot}$, $R_1 = 0.41 \pm 0.01 R_{\odot}$, and $M_2 = 0.62 \pm 0.03 M_{\odot}$. The consistency of the models is encouraging. The value of the Roche-lobe filling factor suggests that there might be ongoing mass transfer. The compact star mass is as massive as a typical white dwarf.</description>

      <title>Estimating early coronal mass ejection propagation direction with DIRECD during the severe May 8 and follow-up June 8, 2024 events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On May 8, 2024, solar active region 13664 produced an X-class flare, several M-class flares, and multiple Earth-directed Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs). The initial CME caused coronal dimmings, characterized by localized reductions in extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) emissions, indicating mass loss and expansion during the eruption. After one solar rotation, on June 8, 2024, the same region produced another M-class flare followed by coronal dimmings observed by the SDO and STEREO spacecraft. We analyzed early CME evolution and direction from coronal dimming expansion at the end of the impulsive phase using the DIRECD (Dimming Inferred Estimation of CME Direction) method. To validate the 3D CME cone, we compared CME properties from the low corona with white-light coronagraph data. The May 8 CME expanded radially, with a 7.7 deg inclination, 70 deg angular width, and 0.81 Rsun cone height, while the June 8 CME had a 15.7 deg inclination, 81 deg width, and 0.89 Rsun height. Our study shows that tracking low coronal signatures, like coronal dimming expansion, can estimate CME direction early, providing crucial lead time for space weather forecasts.</description>

      <title>Prediction of Large Solar Flares Based on SHARP and HED Magnetic Field Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existing flare prediction primarily relies on photospheric magnetic field parameters from the entire active region (AR), such as Space-Weather HMI Activity Region Patches (SHARP) parameters. However, these parameters may not capture the details the AR evolution preceding flares. The magnetic structure within the core area of an AR is essential for predicting large solar flares. This paper utilizes the area of high photospheric free energy density (HED region) as a proxy for the AR core region. We construct two datasets: SHARP and HED datasets. The ARs contained in both datasets are identical. Furthermore, the start and end times for the same AR in both datasets are identical. We develop six models for 24-hour solar flare forecasting, utilizing SHARP and HED datasets. We then compare their categorical and probabilistic forecasting performance. Additionally, we conduct an analysis of parameter importance. The main results are as follows: (1) Among the six solar flare prediction models, the models using HED parameters outperform those using SHARP parameters in both categorical and probabilistic prediction, indicating the important role of the HED region in the flare initiation process. (2) The Transformer flare prediction model stands out significantly in True Skill Statistic (TSS) and Brier Skill Score (BSS), surpassing the other models. (3) In parameter importance analysis, the total photospheric free magnetic energy density ($\mathrm {E_{free}}$) within the HED parameters excels in both categorical and probabilistic forecasting. Similarly, among the SHARP parameters, the R_VALUE stands out as the most effective parameter for both categorical and probabilistic forecasting.</description>

      <title>Precise physical parameters of three late-type eclipsing binary giant stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detached eclipsing binaries (DEBs) allow for the possibility of precise characterization of its stellar components. They offer a unique opportunity to derive their physical parameters in a near-model-independent way for a number of systems consisting of late-type giant stars. Here we aim to expand the sample of low-metallicity late-type giant stars with precise parameters determined. We aim to determine the fundamental parameters like the mass, radius, or effective temperature for three long-period late-type eclipsing binaries from the Large Magellanic Cloud: OGLE-LMC-ECL-25304, OGLE-LMC-ECL-28283, and OGLE-IV LMC554.19.81. Subsequently we aim to determine the evolutionary stages of the systems.We fit the light curves from the OGLE project and radial velocity curves from high resolution spectrographs using the Wilson-Devinney code. The spectral analysis was performed with the GSSP code and resulted in the determination of atmospheric parameters such as effective temperatures and metallicities. We used isochrones provided by the MIST models based on the MESA code to derive evolutionary status of the stars. We present the first analysis of three DEBs composed of similar He-burning late-type stars passing through the blue loop. Estimated masses for OGLE-LMC-ECL-29293 (G4III + G4III) are $M_1=2.898\pm0.031$ and $M_2=3.153\pm0.038$ $M_\odot$, stellar radii are $R_1=19.43\pm0.31$ and $R_2=19.30\pm0.31$ $R_\odot$. OGLE-LMC-ECL-25304 (G4III + G5III) has stellar masses of $M_1=3.267\pm0.028$ and $M_2=3.229\pm0.029$ $M_\odot$, radii of $R_1=23.62\pm0.42$ and $R_2=25.10\pm0.43$ $R_\odot$. OGLE-IV LMC554.19.81 (G2III + G2III) have masses of $M_1=3.165\pm0.020$ and $M_2=3.184\pm0.020$ $M_\odot$, radii of $R_1=18.86\pm0.26$ and $R_2=19.64\pm0.26$ $R_\odot$. All masses were determined with a precision better than 2\% and radii better than 1.5\%. The ages of the stars are in the range of 270-341 Myr.</description>

      <title>The effect of data-driving and relaxation model on magnetic flux rope evolution and stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of data-driving on flux rope eruptivity in magnetic field simulations by analysing fully data-driven modelling results of active region (AR) 12473 and AR11176, as well as preforming relaxation runs for AR12473 (found to be eruptive). Here, the driving is switched off systematically at different time steps. We analyse the behaviour of fundamental quantities, essential for understanding the eruptivity of magnetic flux ropes (MFRs). The data-driven simulations are carried out with the time-dependent magnetofrictional model (TMFM) for AR12473 and AR11176. For the relaxation runs, we employ the magnetofrictional method (MFM) and a zero-beta magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model to investigate how significant the differences between the two relaxation procedures are when started from the same initial conditions. To determine the eruptivity of the MFRs, we calculate characteristic geometric properties, such as the cross-section, MFR height along with stability parameters, such as MFR twist and the decay index. For eruptive cases, we investigate the effect of sustained driving beyond the point of eruptivity on the MFR properties. We find that the fully-driven AR12473 MFR is eruptive while the AR11176 MFR is not. For the relaxation runs, we find that the MFM MFRs are eruptive when the driving is stopped around the flare time or later, while the MHD MFRs show eruptive behaviour even if the driving is switched off one and a half days before the flare occurs. We find that characteristic MFR properties can vary greatly even for the eruptive cases of different relaxation simulations. The results suggest that data driving can significantly influence the evolution of the eruption, with differences appearing even when the relaxation time is set to later stages of the simulation when the MFRs have already entered an eruptive phase.</description>

      <title>Temporally resolved Type III solar radio bursts in the frequency range 3-13 MHz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio observations from space allow to characterize solar radio bursts below the ionospheric cutoff, which are otherwise inaccessible, but suffer from low, insufficient temporal resolution. In this Letter we present novel, high-temporal resolution observations of type III solar radio bursts in the range $3-13$ MHz. A dedicated configuration of the Radio and Plasma Waves (RPW) High Frequency Receiver (HFR) on the Solar Orbiter mission, allowing for a temporal resolution as high as $\sim0.07$s (up to 2 orders of magnitude better than any other spacecraft measurements), provides for the very first time resolved measurements of the typical decay time values in this frequency range. The comparison of data with different time resolutions and acquired at different radial distances indicates that discrepancies with decay time values provided in previous studies are only due to the insufficient time resolution not allowing to accurately characterize decay times in this frequency range. The statistical analysis on a large sample of $\sim500$ type III radio bursts shows a power low decay time trend with a spectral index of $-0.75\pm0.03$ when the median values for each frequency are considered. When these results are combined with previous observations, referring to frequencies outside the considered range, a spectral index of $-1.00\pm0.01$ is found in the range $\sim0.05-300$ MHz, compatible with the presence of radio-wave scattering between 1 and 100 R$_{Sun}$.</description>

Abstract: We present observations and analysis of an X1.8 non-eruptive solar flare on 2012 October 23, which is characterized by an extremely large late-phase peak seen in the warm coronal extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) emissions ($\sim$ 3 MK), with the peak intensity over 1.4 times that of main flare peak. The flare is driven by a failed eruption of a magnetic flux rope (MFR), whose strong squeeze force acting on the overlying magnetic structures gives rise to an intense early heating of the late-phase loops. Based on differential emission measure (DEM) analysis, it is found that the late-phase loops experience a "longer-than-expected" cooling without the presence of any obvious additional heating, and meanwhile, their volume emission measure (EM) maintains a plateau level for a long time before turning into an evident decay. Without the need for an additional heating, we propose that the special thermodynamic evolution of the late-phase loops revealed in this flare might arise from loop cross-sectional expansions with height, which are evidenced by both direct measurements from EUV images and by magnetic field extrapolation. By blocking the losses of both heat flux and mass from the corona, such an upward cross-sectional expansion not only elongates the loop cooling time, but also more effectively sustains the loop density, therefore leading to a later-than-expected occurrence of the warm coronal late phase in combination with a sufficiently high late-phase peak. We further verify such a scenario by analytically solving the cooling process of a late-phase loop characterized by a variable cross section.</description>

      <title>Investigation of the nature of the wind interaction in HD93205 based on multi-epoch X-ray observations</title>

Abstract: The study of the X-ray emission from massive binaries constitutes a relevant approach to investigate shock physics. The case of short period binaries may turn out to be quite challenging, especially in very asymmetric systems where the primary wind may overwhelm that of the secondary in the wind interaction. Our objective consists in providing an observational diagnostic of the X-ray behaviour of HD93205, that is a very good candidate to investigate these aspects. We analysed 31 epochs of XMM-Newton X-ray data spanning about two decades to investigate its spectral and timing behaviour. The X-ray spectrum is very soft along the full orbit, with a luminosity exclusively from the wind interaction region in the range of 2.3 -- 5.4\,$\times$10$^{32}$\,erg\,s$^{-1}$. The light curve peaks close to periastron, with a rather wide pre-periastron low-state coincident with the secondary's body hiding a part of the X-ray emitting region close to its surface. We determined a variability time scale of 6.0807\,$\pm$\,0.0013\,d, in full agreement with the orbital period. Making use of a one-dimensional approach to deal with mutual radiative effects, our results point to a very likely hybrid wind interaction, with a wind-photosphere occurring along most of the orbit, while a brief episode of wind-wind interaction may still develop close to apastron. Beside mutual radiative effects, the radiative nature of the shock that leads to some additional pre-shock obliquitity of the primary wind flow certainly explains the very soft emission. HD93205 constitutes a relevant target to investigate shock physics in short period, asymmetric massive binary systems, where various mutual radiative effects and radiative shocks concur to display an instructive soft X-ray behaviour. HD93205 should be considered as a valid, though challenging target for future three-dimensional modelling initiatives.</description>

      <title>Twins in Diversity: Understanding circumstellar disk evolution in the twin clusters of W5 complex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Young star-forming regions in massive environments are ideal test beds to study the influence of surroundings on the evolution of disks around low-mass stars. We explore two distant young clusters, IC 1848-East and West located in the massive W5 complex. These clusters are unique due to their similar (distance, age, and extinction) yet distinct (stellar density and FUV radiation fields) physical properties. We use deep multi-band photometry in optical, near-IR, and mid-IR wavelengths complete down to the substellar limit in at least five bands. We trace the spectral energy distribution of the sources to identify the young pre-main sequence members in the region and derive their physical parameters. The disk fraction for the East and West clusters down to 0.1 M$_\odot$ was found to be $\sim$27$\pm$2% (N$_{disk}$=184, N$_{diskless}$=492) and $\sim$17$\pm$1% (N$_{disk}$=173, N$_{diskless}$=814), respectively. While no spatial variation in the disk fraction is observed, these values are lower than those in other nearby young clusters. Investigating the cause of this decrease, we find a correlation with the intense feedback from massive stars throughout the cluster area. We also identified the disk sources undergoing accretion and observed the mass accretion rates to exhibit a positive linear relationship with the stellar host mass and an inverse relationship with stellar age. Our findings suggest that the environment significantly influences the dissipation of disks in both clusters. These distant clusters, characterized by their unique attributes, can serve as templates for future studies in outer galaxy regions, offering insights into the influence of feedback mechanisms on star and planetary formation.</description>

      <title>The origin and evolution of the [CII]-deficit in HII regions and star-forming molecular clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyse synthetic maps of the [CII] 158 $\mu$m line and FIR continuum of simulated molecular clouds (MCs) within the SILCC-Zoom project to study the origin of the [CII]-deficit, i.e., the drop of the [CII]/FIR intensity ratio. All simulations include stellar radiative feedback and account for further ionisation of C$^+$ into C$^{2+}$ inside HII regions. For individual HII regions, $I_\mathrm{FIR}$ is initially high in the vicinity of young stars, and then moderately decreases as the gas is compressed into shells. In contrast, $I_\mathrm{CII}$ drops strongly over time, to which the second ionisation of C$^+$ into C$^{2+}$ contributes. This leads to a strong drop of $I_\mathrm{[CII]}/I_\mathrm{FIR}$ inside HII regions, decreasing from 10$^{-3}$-10$^{-2}$ at scales above 10 pc to 10$^{-6}$-10$^{-4}$ at scales below 2pc. However, projection effects can affect the radial profile of $I_\mathrm{[CII]}$ and $I_\mathrm{FIR}$ and create apparent HII regions without any stars. On MC scales, $L_\mathrm{[CII]}/L_\mathrm{FIR}$ decreases from values $\gtrsim$10$^{-2}$ in MCs without star formation to values around $\sim10^{-3}$ in MCs with star formation. We attribute this and the origin of the [CII]-deficit to two main contributors: (i) the saturation of the [CII] line and (ii) the conversion of C$^+$ into C$^{2+}$ by stellar radiation. The drop of $L_\mathrm{[CII]}/L_\mathrm{FIR}$ can be divided into two phases: (i) early on, the saturation of [CII] and the further ionisation of C$^+$ limit the increase of $L_\mathrm{[CII]}$, while $L_\mathrm{FIR}$ increases rapidly, leading to the initial decline of $L_\mathrm{[CII]}/L_\mathrm{FIR}$. (ii) In more evolved HII regions, $L_\mathrm{CII}$ stagnates and partially even drops due to the aforementioned reasons. $L_\mathrm{FIR}$ stagnates as the gas gets pushed into the cooler shells keeping $L_\mathrm{[CII]}/L_\mathrm{FIR}$ at low values of $\sim10^{-3}$.</description>

      <title>JWST/MIRI detection of a carbon-rich chemistry in a solar nebula analog</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been proposed, and confirmed by multiple observations, that disks around low mass stars display a molecule-rich emission and carbon-rich disk chemistry as compared to their hotter, more massive solar counterparts. In this work, we present JWST Disk Infrared Spectral Chemistry Survey (JDISCS) MIRI-MRS observations of the solar-mass star DoAr 33, a low-accretion rate T Tauri star showing an exceptional carbon-rich inner disk. We report detections of H$_2$O, OH, and CO$_2$, as well as the more complex hydrocarbons, C$_2$H$_2$ and C$_4$H$_2$. Through the use of thermochemical models, we explore different spatial distributions of carbon and oxygen across the inner disk and compare the column densities and temperatures obtained from LTE slab model retrievals. We find a best match to the observed column densities with models that have carbon enrichment, and the retrieved emitting temperature and area of C$_2$H$_2$ with models that have C/O $=$ 2$-$4 inside the 500 K carbon-rich dust sublimation line. This suggests that the origin of the carbon-rich chemistry is likely due to the sublimation of carbon rich grains near the soot line. This would be consistent with the presence of dust processing as indicated by the detection of crystalline silicates. We propose that this long-lived hydrocarbon rich chemistry observed around a solar-mass star is a consequence of the unusually low M-star-like accretion rate of the central star, which lengthens the radial mixing timescale of the inner disk allowing the chemistry powered by carbon grain destruction to linger.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic follow-up of gravitational waves: review and lessons learned</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detection of gravitational waves (GWs) has provided a new tool to study the Universe, with the scientific return enriched when combined with established probes: electromagnetic (EM) radiation and energetic particles. Since the groundbreaking detection in 2017 of merging neutron stars producing GW emission, a gamma-ray burst and an optical 'kilonova', the field has grown rapidly. At present, no additional neutron star mergers have been jointly detected in GW and EM radiation, but with upgrades in EM and GW facilities now is a chance to take stock of almost a decade of observations. We discuss the motivations for following up GW sources and the basic challenges of searching large areas for a rapidly-evolving EM signal. We examine how the kilonova counterpart to GW170817 was discovered and the association confirmed, and outline some of the key physics enabled by this discovery. We then review the status of EM searches since 2017, highlighting areas where more information (in GW alerts or catalogs) can improve efficiency, and discuss what we have learned about kilonovae despite the lack of further multi-messenger detections. We discuss upcoming facilities and the many lessons learned, considering also how these could inform searches for lensed mergers.</description>

      <title>XTE J1814-338: A potential hybrid star candidate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A recent analysis on the properties of XTE J18014-338 yielded a surprising radius value around ~ 7 km. Notably, this estimation is significantly lower compared to the expected values for the radius of neutron stars, which are derived from both theoretical calculations and corresponding observations. In this letter, we focus on the construction of hybrid equations of state for the possible reconciliation of the exotic XTE J18014-338 properties. Our analysis indicates that an equation of state involving a sufficiently strong phase transition could potentially lead to the explanation of the size and mass of such a compact object. By examining the sign of the $dM/dP_c$ slope, we found that stellar configurations compatible to XTE J18014-338 are only stable for a 'stiff' low density phase. For a 'soft' hadronic EOS selection the stability of the resulting configurations may not be satisfied in terms of the turning point criterion. However, a complementary analysis for the radial oscillations of the aforementioned configurations indicates their stability when a slow phase conversion is considered.</description>

      <title>Anatomy of a Fall: Stationary and super-Keplerian spiral arms generated by accretion streamers in protostellar discs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Late-stage infall onto evolved protoplanetary discs is an important source of material and angular momentum replenishment, and disc substructures. In this paper we used 3D smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations to model streamer-disc interactions for a prograde streamer. The initially parabolic streamer interacts with the disc material to excite disc eccentricity, which can last on the order of $10^5$ years. We found that the spiral arms the streamer excited in the disc can have a variety of pattern speeds, ranging from stationary to super-Keplerian. Spiral arms with various pattern speeds can exist simultaneously, providing a way to diagnose them in observations. Streamer induced spirals appear similar to those generated by a massive outer companion, where the pitch angle of the spiral increases towards the source of the perturbation. Additionally, the spirals arms can show large and sudden pitch angle changes. Streamer induced spirals are long-lived, lasting approximately $3-4\times$ longer than the initial streamer infall timescale ($\sim$$10^4$ years). After the initial interaction with the disc, a long lasting low $m$ azimuthal mode persists in the disc.</description>

      <title>Reliable Transmission Spectrum Extraction with a Three-Parameter Limb Darkening Law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stellar limb darkening must be properly accounted for to accurately determine the radii of exoplanets at various wavelengths. The standard approach to address limb darkening involves either using laws with coefficients from modelled stellar spectra or determining the coefficients empirically during light curve fitting of the data. Here, we test how accurately three common laws -- quadratic, power, and a three-parameter law -- can reproduce stellar limb darkening at different wavelengths and across a broad range of stars. We show that using a quadratic limb darkening law, which is most frequently employed by the community, leads to wavelength-dependent offsets in retrieved transmission spectra. For planets with high impact parameters ($b$ larger than about 0.5) the amplitude of these offsets can reach 1\% of the transit depth which is some cases is comparable to and can even exceed the expected signals from the planetary atmosphere. Furthermore, the quadratic law causes an offset in the value of the impact parameter when it is determined by fitting the broadband transit light curves. In contrast, using the Kipping--Sing three-parameter law leads to robust retrievals. We advocate the use of this law in retrievals, especially for transits with large impact parameters.</description>

      <title>Detection of faculae in the transit and transmission spectrum of WASP-69b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context: Transmission spectroscopy is a powerful tool for understanding exoplanet atmospheres. At optical wavelengths, it makes it possible to infer the composition and the presence of aerosols in the atmosphere. However, unocculted stellar activity can result in contamination of atmospheric transmission spectra by introducing spurious slopes and molecular signals.
  Aims: We aim to characterise the atmosphere of the transiting exoplanet WASP-69b, a hot Jupiter orbiting an active K star, and characterise the host star's activity levels. Methods: We obtained three nights of spectrophotometric data with the FORS2 instrument on the VLT, covering a wavelength range of 340-1100 nm. We performed retrievals on the full spectrum with combined stellar activity and planet atmosphere models.
  Results: We directly detect a facula in the form of a hot spot crossing event in one of the transits and indirectly detect unocculted faculae through an apparently decreasing radius towards the blue end of the transmission spectrum. We determine a facula temperature of $\Delta T=+644^{+427}_{-263}$ K for the former and a stellar coverage fraction of around 30% with a temperature of $\Delta T=+231\pm72$ K for the latter. The planetary atmosphere is best fit with a high-altitude cloud deck at 1.4 mbar that mutes atomic and molecular features. We find indications of water and ammonia with $log(H_2O)=-2.01^{+0.54}_{-0.86}$ and $log(NH_3)=-3.4^{+0.96}_{-5.20} respectively and place 3$\sigma$ upper limits on TiO ($10^{-7.65}$) and K ($10^{-7}$). Conclusions. The simultaneous multi-wavelength observations allow us to break the size-contrast degeneracy for facula-crossings, meaning we can obtain temperatures for both the directly and indirectly detected faculae, which are consistent with each other.</description>

      <title>Mergers of compact objects with cores of massive stars: evolution, r-process and multi-messenger signatures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of massive binary systems has steadily progressed over the past decades, with increasing focus on their evolution, interactions and mergers, driven by improvements in computational modelling and observational techniques. In particular, when a binary system involves a massive giant and a neutron star (NS) or a black hole (BH) that go through common envelope evolution (CEE), it might results in the merger of the compact object with the core of its giant companion, giving rise to various high energy astrophysical phenomena. We review the different evolutionary channels that lead to compact objects-core mergers, key physical processes with emphasis on the role of accretion physics, feasibility of r-process nucleosynthesis, expected observable electromagnetic, neutrinos and gravitational-waves (GWs) signatures, as well as potential correlation with detected core collapse supernovae (CCSNe), luminous fast blue optical transients (LFBOTs) and low luminosity long gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs). After presenting our current understanding of these mergers, we conclude discussing prospects for future advancements.</description>

      <title>PRODIGE -- envelope to disk with NOEMA. IV. An infalling gas bridge surrounding two Class 0/I systems in L1448N</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. The formation of stars has been subject to extensive studies in the past decades from molecular cloud to protoplanetary disk scales. It is still not fully understood how the surrounding material in a protostellar system, that often shows asymmetric structures with complex kinematic properties, feeds the central protostar(s) and their disk(s). Aims. We study the spatial morphology and kinematic properties of the molecular gas surrounding the IRS3A and IRS3B protostellar systems in the L1448N region located in the Perseus molecular cloud. Methods. We present 1 mm NOEMA observations of the PRODIGE large program and analyze the kinematic properties of molecular lines. Given the complexity of the spectral profiles, the lines are fitted with up to three Gaussian velocity components. The clustering algorithm DBSCAN is used to disentangle the velocity components into the underlying physical structure. Results. We discover an extended gas bridge (~3000 au) surrounding both the IRS3A and IRS3B systems in six molecular line tracers (C18O, SO, DCN, H2CO, HC3N, and CH3OH). This gas bridge is oriented along the northeast-southwest direction and shows clear velocity gradients on the order of 100 km/s/pc towards the IRS3A system. We find that the observed velocity profile is consistent with analytical streamline models of gravitational infall towards IRS3A. The high-velocity C18O (2-1) emission towards IRS3A indicates a protostellar mass of ~1.2 Msun. Conclusions. While high angular resolution continuum data often show IRS3A and IRS3B in isolation, molecular gas observations reveal that these systems are still embedded within a large-scale mass reservoir with a complex spatial morphology as well as velocity profiles. The kinematic properties of the extended gas bridge are consistent with gravitational infall toward the IRS3A protostar.</description>

Abstract: Recent studies of high-redshift galaxies using JWST, such as GN-z11 revealed highly elevated levels of nitrogen (N). This phenomenon extends to gravitationally-lensed galaxies like the Sunburst Arc at z = 2.37, as well as to globular clusters (GCs). We propose that this originates from the presence of very massive stars (VMSs) with masses ranging from 100 to 1000\,\Msun. The He {\sc ii} observed in the Sunburst Arc could also stem from the disproportionately large contribution of VMSs. We build an entirely new Framework for massive star evolution which is no longer set by Dutch or other mass-loss "recipes" but which take the physics of $\Gamma$ or $L/M$-dependent winds into account. We discuss the mass-loss kink and the transition mass-loss rate between optically thin and thick winds, before we study the evaporative mass-loss history of VMSs. Our novel evolution models exhibit vertical evolution in the HR-diagram from the zero-age main sequence due to a self-regulatory effect driven by their wind-dominated nature, and we discuss what wind physics sets the stellar upper-mass limit. Our estimate for the Sunburst Arc in Vink (2023) suggests that the significant amounts of N found in star-forming galaxies likely arise from VMSs. We evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of previous hypotheses, including fast rotating massive stars and supermassive stars (SMSs), and we conclude that only our VMS model satisfies the relevant criteria. Finally, we advocate for the inclusion of VMSs in population synthesis and chemical evolution models, emphasizing the need for a self-consistent wind approach, which currently does not exist. Even minor inaccuracies in mass-loss rates dramatically impact the stellar evolution of VMS, as well as their ionizing and chemical feedback.</description>

      <title>The ESO UVES/FEROS Large Programs of TESS OB pulsators. II. On the physical origin of macroturbulence</title>

Abstract: Spectral lines of hot massive stars are known to exhibit large excess broadening in addition to rotational broadening. This excess broadening is often attributed to macroturbulence whose physical origin is a matter of active debate in the stellar astrophysics community. By looking into the statistical properties of a large sample of O- and B-type stars, both in the Galaxy and LMC, we aim to shed light on the physical origin of macroturbulent line broadening. We deliver newly measured macroturbulent velocities for 86 stars from the Galaxy in a consistent manner with 126 stars from the LMC. A total sample of 594 O- and B-type stars with measured macroturbulent velocities was composed by complementing our sample with archival data. Furthermore, we compute an extensive grid of MESA models to compare, in a statistical manner, the predicted interior properties of stars (such as convection and wave propagation) with the inference of macroturbulent velocities from high-resolution spectroscopic observations. We find the presence of two principally different regimes where, depending on the initial stellar mass, different mechanisms may be responsible for the observed excess line broadening. Stars with initial masses above some 30$M_{\odot}$ are found to have macroturbulent velocities fully determined by subsurface convective zones formed in the iron opacity bump (FeCZ), while some other mechanism is required to explain observations for masses below 12$M_{\odot}$. The latter finding leaves the potential for waves generated at the interface of the convective core and radiative envelope of the star to be responsible for the observed macroturbulent broadening. Both mechanisms may co-exist in the intermediate regime of stellar masses, between some 12 and 30$M_{\odot}$.</description>

      <title>X-Shooting ULLYSES: Massive Stars at low metallicity IX: Empirical constraints on mass-loss rates and clumping parameters for OB supergiants in the Large Magellanic Cloud</title>

Abstract: Context. Current implementations of mass loss for hot, massive stars in stellar evolution models include a sharp increase in mass loss when blue supergiants become cooler than Teff 20-22kK. This drastic mass-loss jump has been motivated by the potential presence of a so-called bistability ionisation effect, which may occur for line-driven winds in this temperature region due to recombination of important line-driving ions. Aims. We perform quantitative spectroscopy using UV (ULLYSES program) and optical (XShootU collaboration) data for 17 OB-supergiant stars in the LMC (covering the range Teff 14-32kK), deriving absolute constraints on global stellar, wind, and clumping parameters. We examine whether there are any empirical signs of a mass-loss jump in the investigated region, and we study the clumped nature of the wind. Methods. We use a combination of the model atmosphere code fastwind and the genetic algorithm code Kiwi-GA to fit synthetic spectra of a multitude of diagnostic spectral lines in the optical and UV. Results. We find no signs of any upward mass loss jump anywhere in the examined region. Standard theoretical comparison models, which include a strong bistability jump thus severely over predict the empirical mass-loss rates on the cool side of the predicted jump. Additionally, we find that on average about 40% of the total wind mass seems to reside in the diluted medium in between dense clumps. Conclusions. Our derived mass-loss rates suggest that for applications like stellar evolution one should not include a drastic bistability jump in mass loss for stars in the temperature and luminosity region investigated here. The derived high values of interclump density further suggest that the common assumption of an effectively void interclump medium (applied in the vast majority of spectroscopic studies of hot star winds) is not generally valid in this parameter regime.</description>

      <title>Deep learning interpretability analysis for carbon star identification in Gaia DR3</title>

Abstract: Context. A large fraction of Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars develop carbon-rich atmospheres during their evolution. Based on their color and luminosity, these carbon stars can be easily distinguished from many other kinds of stars. However, numerous G, K, and M giants also occupy the same region as carbon stars on the HR diagram. Despite this, their spectra exhibit differences, especially in the prominent CN molecular bands. Target. We aim to distinguish carbon stars from other kinds of stars using $Gaia$'s XP spectra, while providing attributional interpretations of key features necessary for identification, and even discovering additional new spectral key features. Method. We propose a classification model named `GaiaNet', an improved one-dimensional convolutional neural network specifically designed for handling $Gaia$'s XP spectra. We utilized the SHAP interpretability model to determine SHAP values for each feature in a spectrum, enabling us to explain the output of the `GaiaNet' model and provide further meaningful analysis. Compared to four traditional machine-learning methods, the `GaiaNet' model exhibits an average classification accuracy improvement of approximately 0.3% on the validation set, with the highest accuracy reaching 100%. Utilizing the SHAP model, we present a clear spectroscopic heatmap highlighting molecular band absorption features primarily distributed around CN773.3 and CN895.0, and summarize five key feature regions for carbon star identification. Upon applying the trained classification model to the CSTAR sample with Gaia `xp_sampled_mean' spectra, we obtained 451 new candidate carbon stars as a by-product.</description>
