      <title>A novel splitting method for Vlasov-Ampere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vlasov equations model the dynamics of plasma in the collisionless regime. A standard approach for numerically solving the Vlasov equation is to operator split the spatial and velocity derivative terms, allowing simpler time-stepping schemes to be applied to each piece separately (known as the Cheng-Knorr method). One disadvantage of such an operator split method is that the order of accuracy of fluid moments (e.g., mass, momentum, and energy) is restricted by the order of the operator splitting (second-order accuracy in the Cheng-Knorr case). In this work, we develop a novel approach that first represents the particle density function on a velocity mesh with a local fluid approximation in each discrete velocity band and then introduces an operator splitting that splits the inter-velocity band coupling terms from the dynamics within the discrete velocity band. The advantage is that the inter-velocity band coupling terms are only needed to achieve consistency of the full distribution functions, but the local fluid models within each band are sufficient to achieve high-order accuracy on global moments such as mass, momentum, and energy. The resulting scheme is verified on several standard Vlasov-Poisson test cases.</description>

      <title>Variations of the Near-Surface Electric field measured at Aragats during Geomagnetic Storms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: At least two mechanisms effectively transfer interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) disturbances into the atmosphere. First, the inflow of solar wind into the ionosphere at low latitudes significantly enhances the total vertical electron content, increasing atmospheric conductivity. Second, Forbush decreases (FD) reduce the cosmic ray flux by a few percent, lowering ionization levels at middle latitudes and decreasing conductivity. Changes in atmospheric conductivity affect the global electric circuit and atmospheric electric field (AEF). However, to study the response of AEF to geomagnetic storms (GMS), it is necessary to carefully monitor atmospheric conditions before and during storms, as meteorological influences can be much stronger than those of GMS. Charged clouds above detectors, lightning flashes, and abrupt weather changes significantly impact near-surface electric field (NSEF) variations, which serve as a proxy for AEF measured at the Earth's surface. The facilities at Aragats station monitor all environmental parameters on a one-minute timescale. We analyze four GMS events described in previous studies, detailing the corresponding weather conditions to isolate the genuine influence of GMS on NSEF. The GMS of June 22, 2015, and September 8, 2017, occurred under fair-weather conditions, providing clear evidence of GMS influence on NSEF. These events were long-lasting, positive, and modest, ranging from 0.2 to 0.3 kV/m, and coincided with the depletion phase of FD. The sky was clear, no rain was detected, and lightning flashes from previous thunderstorms were more than 20 km from the station. The other two events did not meet favorable weather criteria, and their occurrence during GMS seemed incidental. We identify a feature that may indicate the solar (FD) origin of NSEF enhancement: a dip in the enhanced NSEF during the daytime.</description>

      <title>High-Efficiency Plasma-Based Compressor for Ultrafast Soft X-ray Free-Electron Lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The generation of intense, femtosecond-scale X-ray pulses is crucial for probing matter under extreme temporal and field conditions. Current chirped-pulse amplification (CPA) techniques in free-electron lasers (FELs), however, face efficiency limitations in the soft X-ray regime due to the inherent constraints of conventional optical compressors. To address this challenge, we propose a high-efficiency plasma-based compressor utilizing highly ionized noble gas plasma. Exploiting strong refractive index dispersion near ionic resonances, this scheme achieves over 70% transmission efficiency around 5.2 nm, and is extendable to other highly charged ions for operation across discrete bands in the soft X-ray to vacuum ultraviolet. Simulations demonstrate that a 25 fs FEL pulse can be compressed to 1.4 fs with peak power boosted to over 100 GW, while maintaining high energy throughput. This approach overcomes the long-standing efficiency bottleneck of soft X-ray CPA and opens a scalable path toward compact, high-brightness attosecond FEL sources.</description>

      <title>Correlation of the L-mode density limit with edge collisionality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18442v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The "density limit" is one of the fundamental bounds on tokamak operating space, and is commonly estimated via the empirical Greenwald scaling. This limit has garnered renewed interest in recent years as it has become clear that ITER and many tokamak pilot plant concepts must operate near or above the Greenwald limit to achieve their objectives. Evidence has also grown that the Greenwald scaling - in its remarkable simplicity - may not capture the full complexity of the density limit. In this study, we assemble a multi-machine database to quantify the effectiveness of the Greenwald limit as a predictor of the L-mode density limit and compare it with data-driven approaches. We find that a boundary in the plasma edge involving dimensionless collisionality and pressure, $\nu_{*\rm, edge}^{\rm limit} = 3.5 \beta_{T,{\rm edge}}^{-0.40}$, achieves significantly higher accuracy (false positive rate of 2.3% at a true positive rate of 95%) of predicting density limit disruptions than the Greenwald limit (false positive rate of 13.4% at a true positive rate of 95%) across a multi-machine dataset including metal- and carbon-wall tokamaks (AUG, C-Mod, DIII-D, and TCV). This two-parameter boundary succeeds at predicting L-mode density limits by robustly identifying the radiative state preceding the terminal MHD instability. This boundary can be applied for density limit avoidance in current devices and in ITER, where it can be measured and responded to in real time.</description>

      <title>Effects of oxidation and impurities in lithium surfaces on the emitting wall plasma sheath</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17686v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Use of lithium as a surface coating in fusion devices improves plasma performance, but the change in wall properties affects the secondary electron emission properties of the material. Lithium oxidizes easily, which drives the emission yield well above unity. We present here simulations demonstrating the change in sheath structure from monotonic to the nonmonotonic space-charge limited sheath using an energy-dependent data-driven emission model which self-consistently captures both secondary emission and backscattering populations. Increased secondary electron emission from the material has ramifications for the degradation and erosion of the wall. Results shows that the oxidation leads to an increased electron flux into the wall, and a reduced ion flux. The net transfer of energy to the surface is significantly greater for the oxidized case than for the pure lithium case. High reflection rates of low-energy backscattered particles leads to a high re-emission rate at the wall.</description>

      <title>A simple, accurate model for detachment access</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05486v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In next-step fusion tokamaks such as SPARC and ITER, achieving high levels of scrape-off-layer power dissipation will be essential to protect the divertor while maintaining good core plasma performance. The Lengyel model for power dissipation is easy to interpret and fast enough to incorporate into plasma control and scoping tools, but it systematically overestimates the impurity concentration required to reach detachment by a factor of ~5 relative to experiments and higher-fidelity simulations. In this work, we extend the Lengyel model to match the semi-empirical Kallenbach scaling, which successfully describes detachment access on several operating tokamaks. We found that we can reproduce the experimental scaling by accounting for cross-field transport in the divertor, power and momentum loss due to neutral ionization close to the divertor target and turbulent broadening of the upstream heat flux channel. These corrections cause the impurity concentration required for detachment to decrease faster than $n_{e,u}^2$, reproducing the $c_z\propto 1/n_{e,u}^{2.7-3.2}$ scalings found in experiment. The model also quantitatively reproduces the impurity concentration needed to reach detachment in experiment, demonstrating that the extended Lengyel model can be used as a simple, accurate model for detachment access.</description>

      <title>Simulating X-point radiator turbulence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16190v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coupling a high-performance burning plasma core to a detached boundary solution is critical for realizing magnetic confinement fusion power. Predictive simulations of the edge and scrape-off layer are therefore essential and must self-consistently account for turbulence and the interplay between the plasma, neutral gas, and impurities. We present results on controlled full detachment in ASDEX Upgrade with an X-point radiator (XPR), obtained with the edge turbulence code GRILLIX. Two simulations with dense nitrogen radiation fronts, located 5 and 12 cm above the X-point (accounting for 80% of the input heating power), are discussed. In validations against density, temperature, and bolometry measurements, the simulations show good agreement and reproduce the detached divertor conditions observed in the experiment. Neutral gas is critical for achieving detachment and modulating the height of the XPR front, in agreement with previous SOLPS-ITER transport modeling and analytical power balance studies. In addition, the front structure is highly dynamic due to turbulence, consisting of ionizing and radiative mantles surrounding intermittent cold spots of recombining plasma. Near the detachment front, density and temperature fluctuation amplitudes exceed the background by more than 400%, compared to 40% in an attached reference case. In detached conditions, we observe an inward shift of the radial electric field well at the OMP, along with the breaking of poloidal symmetry in the electrostatic potential. The latter induces strong radial flows around the XPR, which may explain the ELM suppression observed in the H-mode XPR regime.</description>

      <title>Pair Production in time-dependent Electric field at Finite times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.12079v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the finite-time behavior of pair production from the vacuum by a time-dependent Sauter pulsed electric field. By examining the temporal behavior of the single-particle distribution function, we observe oscillatory patterns in the longitudinal momentum spectrum of the particles at finite times. These oscillations arise due to quantum interference effects resulting from the various dynamical processes/channels leading to the creation of the (quasi-)particle of a given momentum. Furthermore, we derive an approximate and simplified analytical expression for the distribution function at finite times, allowing us to explain these oscillations' origin and behavior. The role of the vacuum polarization function and its counterterm are also discussed in this regard. The transverse momentum spectrum peaked at the nonzero value of the transverse momentum at finite times, which indicates the role of multiphoton transitions in the creation of quasiparticles.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal spectral transfers in fluid dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02259v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by previous work on kinetic energy cascades in the ocean and atmosphere, we develop a spatio-temporal spectral transfer tool that can be used to study scales of variability in generalized dynamical systems. In particular, we use generalized time-frequency methods from signal analysis to broaden the applicability of frequency transfers from theoretical to practical applications such as the study of ocean or atmosphere data or simulation output. We also show that triad interactions in wavenumber used to study kinetic energy and enstrophy cascades can be generalized to study triad interactions in frequency or wavenumber-frequency. We study the effects of sweeping on the locality of frequency transfers and frequency triad interactions to better understand the locality of spatio-temporal frequency transfers. As an illustrative example, we use the spatio-temporal spectral transfer tool to study the results of a simulation of two-dimensional homogeneous isotropic turbulence. This simulated fluid is forced at a well-defined wavenumber and frequency with dissipation occurring at both large and small scales, making this one of the first studies of "modulated turbulence" in two dimensions. Our results show that the spatio-temporal transfers we develop in this paper are robust to potential practical problems such as low sampling rates or nonstationarity in time series of interest. We anticipate that this method will be a useful tool in studying scales of spatio-temporal variability in a wide range of fluids applications as higher resolution data and simulations become more widely available.</description>
