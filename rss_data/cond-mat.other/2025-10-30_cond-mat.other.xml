      <title>Bi-isotropic effects on hybrid surface polaritons in bilayer configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the bi-isotropic effects in the formation and tunability of hybrid surface polaritons in bilayer configurations. We consider a heterostructure composed of a medium with bi-isotropic constitutive relations and an AFM layer. Using the transfer matrix formalism, we derive general expressions for the dispersion relations of surface polaritonic modes, including the dependence on the bi-isotropic parameter, and analyze their coupling to bulk magnon-polaritons. As an illustration of application, we consider a heterostructure formed with Bi$_{2}$Se$_{3}$ interfaced with antiferromagnetic (AFM) materials that support terahertz-frequency magnons, specifically Cr$_{2}$O$_{3}$ and FeF$_{2}$. In the strong bi-isotropic coupling regime, the surface Dirac plasmon--phonon--magnon polariton (DPPMP) dispersion undergoes a pronounced redshift, accompanied by suppression of the characteristic anticrossing between the Dirac plasmon and the phonon. This effect, observed in all AFM materials considered, suggests a weakening of the hybrid interaction, possibly due to saturation or detuning mechanisms induced by increased $\alpha$. Furthermore, increasing the Fermi energy of the topological insulator enhances the surface plasmon and phonon contributions, inducing a blueshift of the DPPP branches and bringing them closer to resonance with the magnon mode, thereby increasing the hybridization strength. Intriguingly, this redshift partially compensates the blueshift induced by a higher Fermi level, restoring the system to a weak-coupling regime analogous to that observed at lower Fermi energies. Our findings reveal that both the Fermi level and the bi-isotropic response offer independent and complementary control parameters for tuning the strength of light--magnon coupling in TI/AFM heterostructures, with potential implications for reconfigurable THz spintronic and photonic devices.</description>

      <title>From Divergent Series to Geometry: Resurgence of the Quantum Metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we analyze perturbative expansions of the quantum metric tensor (QMT) in anharmonic oscillators, focusing on quartic, sextic, and $d$-dimensional models. Using high-order perturbation theory, we show that the divergent QMT series exhibit factorial growth. Our analysis identifies universal non-perturbative scales, with coefficients displaying large-order behavior consistent with resurgence theory. Then, we apply resurgence and Borel--Pad\'e resummation to the QMT. Comparisons with exact diagonalization confirm that Borel--Pad\'e resummations yield accurate results, especially for the ground state. For completeness, we also present the analysis of the energy eigenvalues in the examples. Our findings extend resurgent techniques from energies to the QMT, highlighting the interplay between quantum geometry and non-perturbative physics.</description>

      <title>Stabilization of Metallic, Excitonic Insulator, and Superionic Phases in Helium-Rare Gas Compounds at Sub-Terapascal Pressures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Helium and rare gases (RG: Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe) are typically considered chemically inert, yet under the extreme pressures of planetary interiors they may form compounds with unexpected properties. Using crystal structure prediction and first-principles calculations, we mapped the phase diagram of binary He-RG systems up to $1$ TPa. We identify several previously unknown stoichiometric compounds that are both thermodynamically and vibrationally stable at sub-terapascal pressures, within the reach of modern high-pressure experiments. In particular, AHe$_{2}$ and AHe (A: Ar, Kr, Xe) adopt previously unreported orthorhombic, hexagonal and cubic phases that remain stable over wide pressure ranges. We further find that He-Xe systems host metallic and excitonic insulator phases at pressures nearly an order of magnitude lower than those required for pure helium, offering a pathway to realize these exotic quantum states experimentally. Finite-temperature simulations also reveal superionic He-Xe phases, in which helium ions diffuse either anisotropically or isotropically depending on the host lattice. These findings constitute the first prediction of helium-based systems that combine metallicity and superionicity, with profound implications for energy transport and planetary dynamo processes. Overall, our results demonstrate that mixing helium with heavier rare gases provides an effective strategy to stabilize metallic, excitonic insulator, and superionic phases at experimentally accessible pressures, opening new research directions for condensed matter physics and planetary science.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Topological States without Dimension Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07048v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological insulators exhibit boundary states protected by bulk band topology, a principle first established in quantum systems and later extended to classical waves, including phononics. Conventionally, an $n$-dimensional bulk with nontrivial topology hosts $(n-1)$-dimensional topologically protected boundary states, which may be further gapped out by breaking the symmetry that protects them, potentially leading to the emergence of $(n-2)$-dimensional, or even lower-dimensional topological states, as in higher-order topological insulators. In this work, we introduce an alternative mechanism for gapping out topological states and forming new topological modes within the resulting gap without further unit-cell symmetry breaking or dimension reduction. Using one- and two-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) models, we show that controlled repositioning of topological domain walls enables the construction of hierarchical unit cells that gap out the original domain-wall states while preserving the underlying symmetry. This process produces higher-hierarchical-level topological states, characterized by a generalized winding number, and can be iterated to realize multiple - potentially infinite - hierarchical levels of topological states. Our approach expands the conventional topological classification and offers a versatile route for engineering complex networks of protected modes in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Rectification of Vibrational Energy Transfer in Driven Chiral Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00324v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the combination of molecular chirality and phase-controlled driving can lead to rectification of vibrational energy transfer. We demonstrate this effect using classical models of (1) a single helical chain and (2) a more realistic model of polyethylene double helix. We examine the effect of the driving frequency, polarization, and temperature on this phenomenon. Notably, we find that the direction and magnitude of the observed directionality preference depend on the driving frequency and phase, and that the effect persists at room temperature.</description>
