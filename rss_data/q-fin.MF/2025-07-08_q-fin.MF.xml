      <title>Increasing Systemic Resilience to Socioeconomic Challenges: Modeling the Dynamics of Liquidity Flows and Systemic Risks Using Navier-Stokes Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern economic systems face unprecedented socioeconomic challenges, making systemic resilience and effective liquidity flow management essential. Traditional models such as CAPM, VaR, and GARCH often fail to reflect real market fluctuations and extreme events. This study develops and validates an innovative mathematical model based on the Navier-Stokes equations, aimed at the quantitative assessment, forecasting, and simulation of liquidity flows and systemic risks. The model incorporates 13 macroeconomic and financial parameters, including liquidity velocity, market pressure, internal stress, stochastic fluctuations, and risk premiums, all based on real data and formally included in the modified equation. The methodology employs econometric testing, Fourier analysis, stochastic simulation, and AI-based calibration to enable dynamic testing and forecasting. Simulation-based sensitivity analysis evaluates the impact of parameter changes on financial balance. The model is empirically tested using Georgian macroeconomic and financial data from 2010-2024, including GDP, inflation, the Gini index, CDS spreads, and LCR metrics. Results show that the model effectively describes liquidity dynamics, systemic risk, and extreme scenarios, while also offering a robust framework for multifactorial analysis, crisis prediction, and countercyclical policy planning.</description>

      <title>Community Bail Fund Systems: Fluid Limits and Approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Community bail funds (CBFs) assist individuals who have been arrested and cannot afford bail, preventing unnecessary pretrial incarceration along with its harmful or sometimes fatal consequences. By posting bail, CBFs allow defendants to stay at home and maintain their livelihoods until trial. This paper introduces new stochastic models that combine queueing theory with classic insurance risk models to capture the dynamics of the remaining funds in a CBF. We first analyze a model where all bail requests are accepted. Although the remaining fund balance can go negative, this model provides insight for CBFs that are not financially constrained. We then apply the Skorokhod map to make sure the CBF balance does not go negative and show that the Skorokhod map produces a model where requests are partially fulfilled. Finally, we analyze a model where bail requests can be blocked if there is not enough money to satisfy the request upon arrival. Although the blocking model prevents the CBF from being negative, the blocking feature gives rise to new analytical challenges for a direct stochastic analysis. Thus, we prove a functional law of large numbers or a fluid limit for the blocking model and show that the fluid limit is a distributed delay equation. We assess the quality of our fluid limit via simulation and show that the fluid limit accurately describes the large-scale stochastic dynamics of the CBF. Finally, we prove stochastic ordering results for the CBF processes we analyze.</description>
