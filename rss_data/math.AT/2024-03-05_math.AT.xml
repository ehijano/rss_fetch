      <title>Nested cobordisms, Cyl-objects and Temperley-Lieb algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a discrete cobordism category for nested manifolds and nested cobordisms between them. A variation of stratified Morse theory applies in this case, and yields generators for a general nested cobordism category. Restricting to a low-dimensional example of the ``striped cylinder'' cobordism category Cyl, we give a complete set of relations for the generators. With an eye towards the study of TQFTs defined on a nested cobordism category, we describe functors Cyl$\to\mathcal{C}$, which we call Cyl-objects in $\mathcal{C}$, and show that they are related to known algebraic structures such as Temperley-Lieb algebras and cyclic objects. We moreover define novel algebraic constructions inspired by the structure of Cyl-objects, namely a doubling construction on cyclic objects analogous to edgewise subdivision, and a cylindrical bar construction on self-dual objects in a monoidal category.</description>

      <title>Controllable Subspaces in Structured Networks of Hierarchical Directed Acyclic Graphs: Controllability of Individual Nodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the context of structured networks, this paper introduces the concept of the Fixed Strongly Structurally Controllable Subspace (FSSCS), enabling a comprehensive characterization of controllable subspaces. From a graph-theoretical viewpoint, the paper defines Fixed Strongly Structurally Controllable (FSSC) nodes based on the FSSCS concept and establishes the necessary and sufficient conditions for their identification. This paper proposes a method for determining the exact dimension of the Strongly Structurally Controllable Subspace (SSCS) in hierarchical directed acyclic graphs, employing a blend of graph-theoretical approaches and controllability matrix analyses. This approach not only facilitates the identification of FSSC nodes but also enhances our understanding of the robustness of node controllability against variations in network parameters within structured networks, marking a significant advancement in the field of strong structural controllability of individual nodes.</description>

      <title>Constructing monads from cubical diagrams and homotopy colimits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is the first step in a general program for defining cocalculus towers of functors via sequences of compatible monads. Goodwillie's calculus of homotopy functors inspired many new functor calculi in a wide range of contexts in algebra, homotopy theory and geometric topology. Recently, the third and fourth authors have developed a general program for constructing generalized calculi from sequences of compatible comonads. In this paper, we dualize the first step of the Hess-Johnson program, focusing on monads rather than comonads. We consider categories equipped with an action of the poset category $\mathcal{P}(n)$, called $\mathcal{P}(n)$-modules. We exhibit a functor from $\mathcal{P}(n)$-modules to the category of monads. The resulting monads act on categories of functors whose codomain is equipped with a suitable notion of homotopy colimits. In the final section of the paper, we demonstrate the monads used to construct McCarthy's dual calculus as an example of a monad arising from a $\mathcal{P}(n)$-module. This confirms that our dualization of the Hess-Johnson program generalizes McCarthy's dual calculus, and serves as a proof of concept for further development of this program.</description>

      <title>The Non-Orientable 4-Genus of 11 Crossing Non-Alternating Knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The non-orientable 4-genus of a knot K in the three sphere is defined to be the minimum first Betti number of a non-orientable surface F in the four-ball so that K bounds F. We will survey the tools used to compute the non-orientable 4-genus, and use various techniques to calculate this invariant for non-alternating 11 crossing knots. We also will view obstructions to a knot bounding a M\"obius band given by the double branched cover of the three sphere branched over K.</description>

      <title>Atiyah duality for motivic spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that Atiyah duality holds in the $\infty$-category of non-$\mathbb A^1$-invariant motivic spectra over arbitrary derived schemes: every smooth projective scheme is dualizable with dual given by the Thom spectrum of its negative tangent bundle. The Gysin maps recently constructed by L. Tang are a key ingredient in the proof. We then present several applications. First, we study $\mathbb A^1$-colocalization, which transforms any module over the $\mathbb A^1$-invariant sphere into an $\mathbb A^1$-invariant motivic spectrum without changing its values on smooth projective schemes. This can be applied to all known $p$-adic cohomology theories and gives a new elementary approach to "logarithmic" or "tame" cohomology theories; it recovers for instance the logarithmic crystalline cohomology of strict normal crossings compactifications over perfect fields and shows that the latter is independent of the choice of compactification. Second, we prove a motivic Landweber exact functor theorem, associating a motivic spectrum to any graded formal group law classified by a flat map to the moduli stack of formal groups. Using this theorem, we compute the ring of $\mathbb P^1$-stable cohomology operations on the algebraic K-theory of qcqs derived schemes, and we prove that rational motivic cohomology is an idempotent motivic spectrum.</description>

      <title>Dagger $n$-categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a coherent definition of dagger $(\infty,n)$-category in terms of equivariance data trivialized on parts of the category. Our main example is the bordism higher category $\mathbf{Bord}_{n}^X$. This allows us to define a reflection-positive topological quantum field theory to be a higher dagger functor from $\mathbf{Bord}_{n}^X$ to some target higher dagger category $\mathcal{C}$. Our definitions have a tunable parameter: a group $G$ acting on the $(\infty,1)$-category $\mathbf{Cat}_{(\infty,n)}$ of $(\infty,n)$-categories. Different choices for $G$ accommodate different flavours of higher dagger structure; the universal choice is $G = \operatorname{Aut}(\mathbf{Cat}_{(\infty,n)}) = (\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z})^n$, which implements dagger involutions on all levels of morphisms. The Stratified Cobordism Hypothesis suggests that there should be a map $\mathrm{PL}(n) \to \operatorname{Aut}(\mathbf{AdjCat}_{(\infty,n)})$, where $\mathrm{PL}(n)$ is the group of piecewise-linear automorphisms of $\mathbb{R}^n$ and $\mathbf{AdjCat}_{(\infty,n)}$ the $(\infty,1)$-category of $(\infty,n)$-categories with all adjoints; we conjecture more strongly that $\operatorname{Aut}(\mathbf{AdjCat}_{(\infty,n)}) \cong \mathrm{PL}(n)$. Based on this conjecture we propose a notion of dagger $(\infty,n)$-category with unitary duality or $\mathrm{PL}(n)$-dagger category. We outline how to construct a $\mathrm{PL}(n)$-dagger structure on the fully-extended bordism $(\infty,n)$-category $\mathbf{Bord}_n^X$ for any stable tangential structure $X$; our outline restricts to a rigorous construction of a coherent dagger structure on the unextended bordism $(\infty,1)$-category $\mathbf{Bord}_{n,n-1}^X$. The article is a report on the results of a workshop held in Summer 2023, and is intended as a sketch of the big picture and an invitation for more thorough development.</description>

      <title>The categorical spin-statistics theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish the spin-statistics theorem for topological quantum field theories (TQFTs) in the framework of Atiyah. We incorporate spin via spin structures on bordisms, and represent statistics using super vector spaces. Unitarity is implemented using dagger categories, in a manner that is equivalent to the approach of Freed-Hopkins, who employed $\mathbb{Z}/2$-equivariant functors to address reflection-positivity. A key contribution of our work is the introduction of the notion of fermionically dagger compact categories, which extends the well-established concept of dagger compact categories. We show that both the spin bordism category and the category of super Hilbert spaces are examples of fermionically dagger compact categories. The spin-statistics theorem for TQFTs emerges as a specific case of a more general result concerning symmetric monoidal dagger functors between fermionically dagger compact categories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.06478v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define a relative cup product in the De Rham cohomology of any diffeological space. To do it, two different versions of the relative De Rham cohomology groups are presented. As an application, we define the cohomological Lusternik-Schnirelmann category of a diffeological space and we prove a cohomological lower bound given by the length of the cup product.</description>

Abstract: Let G be a group which is topologically a CW-complex, BG a classifying space for G, and A a discrete abelian group. To a central extension of G by A, one can associate a cohomology class in $H^2(BG,A)$. We show this association is injective, and bijective in many cases. A homomorphism to G lifts to the extension iff the pullback of the associated cohomology class vanishes.</description>

      <title>Pull-back Geometry of Persistent Homology Encodings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.07073v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Persistent homology (PH) is a method for generating topology-inspired representations of data. Empirical studies that investigate the properties of PH, such as its sensitivity to perturbations or ability to detect a feature of interest, commonly rely on training and testing an additional model on the basis of the PH representation. To gain more intrinsic insights about PH, independently of the choice of such a model, we propose a novel methodology based on the pull-back geometry that a PH encoding induces on the data manifold. The spectrum and eigenvectors of the induced metric help to identify the most and least significant information captured by PH. Furthermore, the pull-back norm of tangent vectors provides insights about the sensitivity of PH to a given perturbation, or its potential to detect a given feature of interest, and in turn its ability to solve a given classification or regression problem. Experimentally, the insights gained through our methodology align well with the existing knowledge about PH. Moreover, we show that the pull-back norm correlates with the performance on downstream tasks, and can therefore guide the choice of a suitable PH encoding.</description>

      <title>Filtered formal groups, Cartier duality, and derived algebraic geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.10262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2101.10262v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a notion of formal groups in the filtered setting and describe a duality relating these to a specified class of filtered Hopf algebras. We then study a deformation to the normal cone construction in the setting of derived algebraic geometry. Applied to the unit section of a formal group $\widehat{\mathbb{G}}$, this provides a $\mathbb{G}_m$-equivariant degeneration of $\widehat{\mathbb{G}}$ to its tangent Lie algebra. We prove a unicity result on complete filtrations, which, in particular, identifies the resulting filtration on the coordinate algebra of this deformation with the adic filtration on the coordinate algebra of $\widehat{\mathbb{G}}$. We use this in a special case, together with the aforementioned notion of Cartier duality, to recover the filtration on the filtered circle of [MRT19]. Finally, we investigate some properties of $\widehat{\mathbb{G}}$-Hochschild homology set out in loc. cit., and describe "lifts" of these invariants to the setting of spectral algebraic geometry.</description>

      <title>A Tight Max-Flow Min-Cut Duality Theorem for Non-Linear Multicommodity Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.04252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.04252v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Max-Flow Min-Cut theorem is the classical duality result for the Max-Flow problem, which considers flow of a single commodity. We study a multiple commodity generalization of Max-Flow in which flows are composed of real-valued k-vectors through networks with arc capacities formed by regions in \R^k. Given the absence of a clear notion of ordering in the multicommodity case, we define the generalized max flow as the feasible region of all flow values.
  We define a collection of concepts and operations on flows and cuts in the multicommodity setting. We study the mutual capacity of a set of cuts, defined as the set of flows that can pass through all cuts in the set. We present a method to calculate the mutual capacity of pairs of cuts, and then generalize the same to a method of calculation for arbitrary sets of cuts. We show that the mutual capacity is exactly the set of feasible flows in the network, and hence is equal to the max flow. Furthermore, we present a simple class of the multicommodity max flow problem where computations using this tight duality result could run significantly faster than default brute force computations.
  We also study more tractable special cases of the multicommodity max flow problem where the objective is to transport a maximum real or integer multiple of a given vector through the network. We devise an augmenting cycle search algorithm that reduces the optimization problem to one with m constraints in at most \R^{(m-n+1)k} space from one that requires mn constraints in \R^{mk} space for a network with n nodes and m edges. We present efficient algorithms that compute eps-approximations to both the ratio and the integer ratio maximum flow problems.</description>

      <title>$G$-Mapper: Learning a Cover in the Mapper Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.06634v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Mapper algorithm is a visualization technique in topological data analysis (TDA) that outputs a graph reflecting the structure of a given dataset. However, the Mapper algorithm requires tuning several parameters in order to generate a ``nice" Mapper graph. This paper focuses on selecting the cover parameter. We present an algorithm that optimizes the cover of a Mapper graph by splitting a cover repeatedly according to a statistical test for normality. Our algorithm is based on $G$-means clustering which searches for the optimal number of clusters in $k$-means by iteratively applying the Anderson-Darling test. Our splitting procedure employs a Gaussian mixture model to carefully choose the cover according to the distribution of the given data. Experiments for synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our algorithm generates covers so that the Mapper graphs retain the essence of the datasets, while also running significantly fast.</description>
