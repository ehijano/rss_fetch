      <title>Comprehensive measurement of $\eta^\prime$ photoproduction off the proton at $E_\gamma &lt; 2.4$ $\mathrm{GeV}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the spectroscopy of nucleon resonances at the total energies from the $\eta^\prime$-meson production threshold to $2.32$ $\mathrm{GeV}$, photon beam asymmetries of the reaction $\gamma p \to \eta^\prime p$ were measured together with total and differential cross sections by analyzing the two decay modes $\eta^\prime \to \gamma \gamma$ and $\pi^0 \pi^0 \eta$. New constraints for amplitude decomposition were given by the first-time result of photon beam asymmetries at $E_\gamma &gt; 1.84$ $\mathrm{GeV}$ and the most precise data of differential cross sections to date at extremely backward $\eta^\prime$ angles. The possibility of a larger coupling constant of the $\eta^\prime$-nucleon system to the $N(2250)$ resonance was implied in the partial wave analyses using the present data.</description>

      <title>Observation of the jet diffusion wake using dijets in heavy ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energetic quarks and gluons traversing a hot and dense quark-gluon plasma deposit energy and momentum into the medium before hadronizing to collimated sprays of particles, known as jets. This energy-momentum deposition is expected to produce medium responses, collectively known as jet wakes, with ``diffusion wake'' denoting a depletion of particles in the direction opposite to the propagating jet. These phenomena are studied by comparing dijet-hadron correlations measured in lead-lead (PbPb) and proton-proton (pp) collisions to assess jet-induced modifications of bulk particle production. The analysis uses PbPb and pp data recorded at a nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV with the CMS detector at the CERN LHC. By exploring how the dijet-hadron correlation distributions differ for various pseudorapidity separations of the two jets in the dijet, the presence of a jet diffusion wake is firmly established. The wake has a significance greater than 5 standard deviations for charged particles in the transverse momentum range 1 $\lt$ $p_\mathrm{T}$ $\lt$ 2 GeV. The measurements are compared with various model predictions with and without jet wake effects, providing new insights into quark-gluon plasma properties and the formation of jet-induced wakes.</description>

      <title>Nucleon Size Independence of Hadronic Nucleus-Nucleus Cross Sections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent proposals to constrain the nucleon size using hadronic cross sections ($\sigma_{\rm AA}$) conflict with collective flow data. I demonstrate this dependence is an artifact of ``geometric inflation,'' where smearing point-like nucleons unintentionally dilutes the nuclear surface. By implementing a self-consistent framework that preserves the global nuclear density, I show that $\sigma_{\rm AA}$ is essentially insensitive to the nucleon width. This establishes $\sigma_{\rm AA}$ as a robust probe of the nuclear surface rather than the sub-nucleon scale. Utilizing this property, I extract a neutron skin thickness for $^{208}$Pb of $\Delta r_{\rm np} \in [0, 0.24]$~fm, providing an unconventional way to constrain the nuclear symmetry energy using high-energy hadronic observables.</description>

      <title>Evidence of Nuclear Urca Process in the Ocean of Neutron-Star Superburst MAXI J1752$-$457</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose that the rapid cooling of the neutron star following its X-ray superburst in MAXI J1752$-$457 over a period of 4 days, observed by two Japanese satellites, MAXI and NinjaSat, is due to enhanced neutrino emission from cycles of electron capture and $\beta^{-}$ decay involving odd-$A$ nuclei (or Urca pairs) in the ocean. Hence, this work provides the first indication of the possible existence of such a ``nuclear Urca process". The observation of MAXI J1752$-$457 implies a hot ignition layer with a maximum temperature of $\sim4~{\rm GK}$, located near the Urca shell in the ocean, such that the nuclear Urca process becomes dominant for up to $\sim2$ days after the superburst. This behavior is distinct from that of normal Type-I X-ray bursts, which are triggered by hydrogen or helium burning in much shallower layers than those of superbursts. Our findings enable probing of superburst ashes through Urca pairs via long-term monitoring of crust cooling on day-long timescales.</description>

      <title>Constraining the nuclear symmetry energy from electric dipole polarizability and neutron skin in $^{208}\mathrm{Pb}$ within antisymmetrized molecular dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The electric dipole polarizability $\alpha_D$ and the neutron skin thickness $\Delta R_{np}$ of $^{208}\mathrm{Pb}$ are two powerful and clean probes to constrain the symmetry energy at subsaturation density. Within the framework of the antisymmetrized molecular dynamics (AMD) model, we found that the sensitive densities of $\alpha_D$ and $\Delta R_{np}$ ranges from the 0.2$\rho_0$ to 0.57$\rho_0$. To well describe the data of $\alpha_D$ and $\Delta R_{np}$, the effective interaction parameters with $S_0\sim34$ MeV and $L=66-75$ MeV are favored. The constraints of symmetry energy over the density ranging from 0.2$\rho_0$ to 0.57$\rho_0$ are obtained, and the values of symmetry energy at the starting and ending density region are $S(\rho=0.2\rho_0)=10.5\pm 0.63$ MeV and $S(\rho=0.57\rho_0)=23.1\pm 0.4$ MeV.</description>

      <title>2025 EIC-France Workshop: Physics Highlights and Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19664v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This document presents a synthesis of the theory contributions and discussions from the 2nd EIC-France Workshop, held at IJCLab (Orsay) on 1-3 December 2025. The workshop brought together members of the French hadron-physics community to review recent theoretical developments relevant to the future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) and to coordinate national efforts in preparation for its early physics program. The report first summarizes the collider's initial running conditions and luminosity performance, as outlined in the EIC Early Science Matrix. It then provides concise overviews of the theoretical presentations on inclusive, semi-inclusive, exclusive, heavy-flavor, and small-x physics.
  Based on these discussions, two measurements emerged as especially well suited for early EIC operation and strongly aligned with areas of established French expertise: inclusive diffraction and inclusive quarkonium production. These channels offer clean signatures, robust theoretical interpretability, and direct sensitivity to fundamental QCD phenomena such as gluon saturation, heavy-quark dynamics, and the small-x structure of hadrons and nuclei.
  In addition, the workshop identified longer-term physics opportunities that will benefit from the full capabilities of the EIC after its ramp-up phase. These include accessing the three-dimensional structure of the pion through the Sullivan process and a broader program of exclusive three-body final states, both of which represent high-impact avenues for exploring hadronic structure and non-perturbative QCD. Together, the elements summarized in this report provide a coherent overview of the strategic priorities and scientific ambitions shaping the French community's contribution to the EIC physics program.</description>

      <title>Evidence of medium response to hard probes using correlations of Z bosons with hadrons in heavy ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09307v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The first measurement of pseudorapidity and azimuthal angle distributions relative to the momentum vector of a Z boson for low transverse momentum ($p_\mathrm{T}$) charged hadrons in lead-lead (PbPb) collisions is presented. By studying the hadrons produced in an event with a high-$p_\mathrm{T}$ Z boson (40 $\lt$ $p_\mathrm{T}$ $\lt$ 350 GeV), the analysis probes how the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) medium created in these collisions affects the parton recoiling opposite to the Z boson. Utilizing PbPb data at a nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s_{_\mathrm{NN}}}$ = 5.02 TeV from 2018 with an integrated luminosity of 1.67 nb$^{-1}$ and proton-proton (pp) data at the same energy from 2017 with 301 pb$^{-1}$, the distributions are examined in bins of charged-hadron $p_\mathrm{T}$. A significant modification of the distributions for charged hadrons in the range 1 $\lt$ $p_\mathrm{T}$ $\lt$ 2 GeV in PbPb collisions is observed when compared to reference measurements from pp collisions. The data provide new information about the correlation between hard and soft particles in heavy ion collisions, which can be used to test predictions of various jet quenching models. When compared to theoretical predictions, the results are consistent with expectations of a hydrodynamic wake created when the QGP is depleted of energy by the parton propagating through it. Therefore, this Letter presents the first evidence of probe-induced energy depletion and the resulting response by the QGP medium.</description>

      <title>New Ground State in ${}^{149}$La: Lanthanum Isotopes Lose Their Distinctive Feature in Two-Neutron Separation Energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11033v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nuclear mass is a key indicator of how the nuclear shell structure evolves. The recent mass measurement study of neutron-rich lanthanum isotopes [A. Jaries, $et~al$., Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 134}, 042501(2025)] reveals the presence of a distinct prominence in their two-neutron separation energies. However, its presence has been called into question based on the results of another mass determination [B. Liu, Ph.D. thesis, University of Notre Dame (2025)]. In this letter, we report an effort to clarify these contradictory results through the use of the simultaneous mass-lifetime measurement of the neutron-rich lanthanum isotope ${}^{149}$La using a multi-reflection time-of-flight mass spectrograph combined with a $\beta$-TOF detector. The peak corresponding to a $\beta$-decaying state was observed in the time-of-flight spectra at a position of $221(6)~{\rm keV/c^2}$ lighter than the reported ${}^{149}$La mass in A. Jaries, $et~al$., but our measured result is in excellent agreement with the mass value reported in B. Liu. We have concluded that this peak is the ground state of ${}^{149}$La. With this, the previously reported distinct prominence in the two-neutron separation energies disappears, while a new kink structure, similar to that in the cerium isotopes, appears. Comparison with theoretical models suggests that a nuclear shape transition from octupole deformation to another type of deformation occurs around $N=91$ and is likely the cause of this kink structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.12184v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Femtoscopy with photon pairs is a particularly attractive tool for studying high-energy nuclear collisions. Proposed and extensively discussed in several influential theory articles, it has seen only few applications in experiment because of statistics limitations. With the progress of detectors and electronics, only now it is coming within reach. In this paper we discuss the choice of kinematic variables for two-photon correlation functions. In particular, we argue against $C(Q_{\rm inv})$ and in favor of $C(\Delta E,Q_{\rm inv})$.</description>

      <title>Deep learning for jet modification in the presence of the QGP background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20856v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Jet interactions with the color-deconfined QCD medium in relativistic heavy-ion collisions are conventionally assessed by measuring the modification of the distributions of jet observables with respect to their baselines in proton-proton collisions. Deep learning methods enable per-jet evaluation of these modifications, enhancing the use of jets as precision probes of the nuclear medium. In this work, we predict the jet-by-jet fractional energy loss $\chi$ for jets evolving through a quark-gluon plasma (QGP) medium using a Linear Boltzmann Transport (LBT) model. To approximate realistic experimental conditions, we embed medium-modified jets in a thermal background and apply Constituent Subtraction for background removal. Two network architectures are studied: convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using jet images, and dynamic graph convolutional neural networks (DGCNNs) using particle clouds. We find that CNNs achieve accurate predictions for background-free jets but degrade in the presence of the QGP background and remain below the background-free baseline even after background subtraction. In contrast, DGCNNs applied to background-subtracted particle clouds maintain high accuracy across the entire $\chi$ range, demonstrating the advantage of point-cloud-based graph neural networks that exploit full jet structure under realistic conditions.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-preserving calculation of pion light-front wave functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13938v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Poincar\'e-covariant Bethe-Salpeter wave functions are used to calculate light-front wave functions (LFWFs) of the pion, $\pi$, and an analogue state, $\pi_{s\bar s}$. The current masses of the degenerate valence constituents in the $\pi_{s\bar s}$ are around $25$-times larger than those of the pion's valence constituents. Both valence spin-antialigned ($\mathcal L=0$) and valence spin-aligned ($\mathcal L=1$) components are obtained and combined to produce the complete LFWF for each system. Comparing predictions delivered by two distinct Bethe-Salpeter kernels, the impact of nonperturbative dynamical effects contained in the more sophisticated (bRL) kernel are seen to be significant; and contrasts between $\pi$, $\pi_{s \bar s}$ results reveal the interplay between emergent hadron mass and mass effects owing to Higgs-boson couplings. Amongst the results, one finds that for $\pi$, $\pi_{s\bar s}$, the LFWFs can be approximated by a separable form, with that representation being pointwise reliable in the bRL cases. Moreover, the $\mathcal L=1$ component is important; so a LFWF obtained after omission of this piece is typically a poor representation of the system. These features are naturally expressed in $\pi$, $\pi_{s\bar s}$ transverse momentum dependent parton distribution functions (TMDs). In this connection, it is found that a Gaussian \textit{Ansatz} can only provide a rough guide to TMD pointwise behaviour: magnitude deviations between \textit{Ansatz} and prediction exceed a factor of two on $k_\perp^2 \gtrsim 0.55\,$GeV$^2$. One should therefore be cautious in interpreting conclusions drawn from phenomenological analyses based upon Gaussian \textit{Ans\"atze}.</description>

      <title>Hadron Physics Opportunities at FAIR</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15986v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This White Paper outlines a coordinated, decade-spanning programme of hadron and QCD studies anchored at the GSI/FAIR accelerator complex. Profiting from intense deuteron, proton and pion beams coupled with high-rate capable detectors and an international theory effort, the initiative addresses fundamental questions related to the strong interaction featuring confinement and dynamical mass generation. This includes our understanding of hadron-hadron interactions and the composition of hadrons through mapping the baryon and meson spectra, including exotic states, and quantifying hadron structure. This interdisciplinary research connects topics in the fields of nuclear, heavy-ion, and (nuclear) astro (particle) physics, linking, for example, terrestrial data to constraints on neutron star structure. A phased roadmap with SIS100 accelerator start-up and envisaged detector upgrades will yield precision cross sections, transition form factors, in-medium spectral functions, and validated theory inputs. Synergies with external programmes at international accelerator facilities worldwide are anticipated. The programme is expected to deliver decisive advances in our understanding of non-perturbative (strong) QCD and astrophysics, and high-rate detector and data-science technology.</description>

      <title>Direct in-chamber radon-220 (thoron) emanation measurements for rare-event physics experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12622</link>

Abstract: Measuring radon emanation from detector materials is a key method for controlling radon, a significant background in rare-event physics experiments. Methods for measuring radon emanation are well-established but have predominantly focused on the 222Rn isotope, the dominant radon isotope for these backgrounds. However, measurements of 220Rn (thoron), the second most abundant radon isotope, remain relatively unexplored. 220Rn emanation measurements are challenging because the 220Rn must be transferred from the emanation chamber to the active detector within its short 55 s half-life. In this study, a direct in-chamber approach for measuring 220Rn emanation is presented in which the sample is placed directly within the active detector chamber, thereby minimising losses during transfer. The method was demonstrated with a DURRIDGE RAD8 electrostatic radon detector, which measured 220Rn emanation from low-activity thoriated rods with an activity of 76 +/- 20 mBq. Compared with a conventional flowthrough 220Rn emanation setup, the in-chamber method increased sensitivity by a factor of 3. Using helium as the carrier gas provided a further sensitivity increase, giving an overall sensitivity gain of ~5. These results indicate that in-chamber 220Rn emanation measurements provide an effective tool for low-background experiments and have the potential to accelerate radon studies by exploiting the shorter half-life of 220Rn.</description>
