      <title>Eco-evolutionary constraints for the endemicity of rapidly evolving viruses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Antigenic escape constitutes the main mechanism allowing rapidly evolving viruses to achieve endemicity. Beyond granting immune escape, empirical evidence also suggests that mutations of viruses might increase their inter-host transmissibility. While both mechanisms are well-studied individually, their combined effects on viral endemicity remain to be explored. Here we propose a minimal eco-evolutionary framework to simulate epidemic outbreaks generated by pathogens evolving both their transmissibility and immune escape. Our findings uncover a very rich phenomenology arising from the complex interplay between both evolutionary pathways and the underlying contagion dynamics. We first show that contagions at the population level constrain the effective evolution of the virus, accelerating the increase in transmissibility in the first epidemic wave while favoring antigenic variation in the transition to the endemic phase. Our results also reveal that accounting for both evolutionary pathways changes the features of the viruses more prone to become endemic. While chances for endemicity increase with infectiousness of the wild-type variant for viruses not evolving their transmissibility, a non-monotonic behavior is observed when the latter mechanism is included, favoring less transmissible viruses and impairing those ones with intermediate infectiousness.</description>

      <title>A Civilian Astronomer's Guide to UAP Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP) have historically been stigmatized and regarded as pseudoscience due to a general lack of robust evidence. Recently, however, the subject has gained interest among astronomers and the military. This review explores how astronomers can enhance our understanding of these enigmatic phenomena by focusing on empirical tests of specific hypotheses (e.g. the hypothesis of extraterrestrial visitations) rather than solely collecting and categorizing data. We compare the investigation of UAP to the process of calibration and interpretations of astronomical discoveries and propose a toy model involving a network of neuro-interface extraterrestrial probes to model exotic UAP. This model aids in predicting probe signatures and behaviour, improving detection methods, and addressing ethical concerns in UAP research.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the inference of ratings and rankings on Higher Order Networks with complex topologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The inference of rankings plays a central role in the theory of social choice, which seeks to establish preferences from collectively generated data, such as pairwise comparisons. Examples include political elections, ranking athletes based on competition results, ordering web pages in search engines using hyperlink networks, and generating recommendations in online stores based on user behavior. Various methods have been developed to infer rankings from incomplete or conflicting data. One such method, HodgeRank, introduced by Jiang et al.~\cite{jiang2011statistical}, utilizes Hodge decomposition of cochains in Higher Order Networks to disentangle gradient and cyclical components contributing to rating scores, enabling a parsimonious inference of ratings and rankings for lists of items. This paper presents a systematic study of HodgeRank's performance under the influence of quenched disorder and across networks with complex topologies generated by four different network models. The results reveal a transition from a regime of perfect trieval of true rankings to one of imperfect trieval as the strength of the quenched disorder increases. A range of observables are analyzed, and their scaling behavior with respect to the network model parameters is characterized. This work advances the understanding of social choice theory and the inference of ratings and rankings within complex network structures.</description>

      <title>Target search on networks-within-networks with applications to protein-DNA interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel framework for understanding node target search in systems organized as hierarchical networks-within-networks. Our work generalizes traditional search models on complex networks, where the mean-first passage time is typically inversely proportional to the node degree. However, real-world search processes often span multiple network layers, such as moving from an external environment into a local network, and then navigating several internal states. This multilayered complexity appears in scenarios such as international travel networks, tracking email spammers, and the dynamics of protein-DNA interactions in cells. Our theory addresses these complex systems by modeling them as a three-layer multiplex network: an external source layer, an intermediate spatial layer, and an internal state layer. We derive general closed-form solutions for the steady-state flux through a target node, which serves as a proxy for inverse mean-first passage time. Our results reveal a universal relationship between search efficiency and network-specific parameters. This work extends the current understanding of multiplex networks by focusing on systems with hierarchically connected layers. Our findings have broad implications for fields ranging from epidemiology to cellular biology and provide a more comprehensive understanding of search dynamics in complex, multilayered environments.</description>

      <title>Ensemble inequivalence and phase transitions in unlabeled networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discover a first-order phase transition in the canonical ensemble of random unlabeled networks with a prescribed average number of links. The transition is caused by the nonconcavity of microcanonical entropy. Above the critical point, the canonical and microcanonical ensembles are equivalent and have a well-behaved thermodynamic limit. Below the critical point, the ensemble equivalence is broken, and the canonical ensemble is a mixture of phases: empty networks and networks with logarithmic average degrees. As a consequence, networks with bounded average degrees do not survive in the thermodynamic limit, decaying into the empty phase. The celebrated percolation transition in labeled networks is thus absent in unlabeled networks. In view of these differences between labeled and unlabeled ensembles, the question of which one should be used as a null model of different real-world networks cannot be ignored.</description>

      <title>A new family of ladder operators for macroscopic systems, with applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a series of recent scientific contributions the role of bosonic and fermionic ladder operators in a macroscopic realm has been investigated. Creation, annihilation and number operators have been used in very different contexts, all sharing the same common main feature, i.e. the relevance of {\em discrete changes} in the description of the system. The main problem when using this approach is that computations are easy for Hamiltonians which are quadratic in the ladder operators, but become very complicated, both at the analytical and at the numerical level, when the Hamiltonian is not quadratic. In this paper we propose a possible alternative approach, again based on some sort of ladder operators, but for which an analytic solution can often be deduced without particular difficulties. We describe our proposal with few applications, mostly related to different versions of a predator-prey model, and to love affairs (from a decision-making point of view).</description>

      <title>New type of chaotic solutions found in Gravity model of network transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The gravity model is a mathematical model that applies Newton's universal law of gravitation to socio-economic transport phenomena and has been widely used to describe world trade, intercity traffic flows, and business transactions for more than several decades. However, its strong nonlinearity and diverse network topology make a theoretical analysis difficult, and only a short history of studies on its stability exist. In this study, the stability of gravity models defined on networks with few nodes is analyzed in detail using numerical simulations. It was found that, other than the previously known transition of stationary solutions from a unique diffusion solution to multiple localized solutions, parameter regions exist where periodic solutions with the same repeated motions and chaotic solutions with no periods are realized. The smallest network with chaotic solutions was found to be a ring with seven nodes, which produced a new type of chaotic solution in the form of a mixture of right and left periodic solutions.</description>

      <title>Steering cooperation: Adversarial attacks on prisoner's dilemma in complex networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19692v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study examines the application of adversarial attack concepts to control the evolution of cooperation in the prisoner's dilemma game in complex networks. Specifically, it proposes a simple adversarial attack method that drives players' strategies towards a target state by adding small perturbations to social networks. The proposed method is evaluated on both model and real-world networks. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively promote cooperation with significantly smaller perturbations compared to other techniques. Additionally, this study shows that adversarial attacks can also be useful in inhibiting cooperation (promoting defection). The findings reveal that adversarial attacks on social networks can be potent tools for both promoting and inhibiting cooperation, opening new possibilities for controlling cooperative behavior in social systems while also highlighting potential risks.</description>
