      <title>Instabilities and bifurcations in turbulent porous media flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microscale turbulent flow in porous media is conducive to the development of flow instabilities due to strong vortical and shearing flow occurring within the pore space. When the flow instabilities around individual solid obstacles interact with numerous others within the porous medium, unique symmetry-breaking phenomena emerge as a result. This paper focuses on investigations of the vortex dynamics and flow instabilities behind solid obstacles in porous media, emphasizing how solid obstacle geometry and porosity influence both microscale and macroscale flow behavior. Two distinct symmetry-breaking mechanisms were identified in different porosity ranges. In low porosity media (&lt; 0.8), a "deviatory flow" phenomenon occurs, where the macroscale flow deviates from the direction of applied pressure gradient at Reynolds numbers above 500. Deviatory flow is a source of macroscale Reynolds stress anisotropy, which is counterbalanced by a diminished vortex core size. In the intermediate porosity regime (0.8-0.95), a "jetting flow" mechanism creates asymmetric microscale velocity channels in the pore space through temporally biased vortex shedding, occurring during the transition to turbulence. Both symmetry-breaking phenomena are critically influenced by solid obstacle shape, porosity, and Reynolds number. Circularity of solid obstacle geometry and an adequately high Reynolds number provide critical conditions for symmetry-breaking, whereas porosity can be used to parametrize the degree of symmetry-breaking. This paper provides fundamental insights into the intricate flow dynamics in porous media, offering a comprehensive understanding of how microscale vortex interactions generate macroscale flow asymmetries across different geometric configurations.</description>

      <title>Experimental analysis of the role of base blowing geometry on three-dimensional blunt body wakes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This experimental study aims to investigate the effect of different base blowing configurations on the aerodynamics of a squareback Ahmed body. Four different slot configurations through which air is injected were studied. Each configuration had the same blowing area, equivalent to 10$\%$ of the base area of the body, and was designated according to its geometric shape: square (S), vertical (V), cross (C) and horizontal (H). The same range of injected flow rates, $C_{q}$, was tested for each slot geometry at a Reynolds number $Re$= 65000, with corresponding wind tunnel measurements. Our experiments revealed the effect of blowing on the near wake and consequently on the base pressure and drag of the Ahmed body. In particular, the geometry of the slots was shown to be a crucial factor in influencing aerodynamics, especially at blowing flow rates close to $C_{q,opt}$, which is the blowing flow rate that provides the minimum drag coefficient. The centered square slot (S) is the configuration that achieves a greater drag reduction. This behavior is attributed to an elongation in the recirculation region behind the Ahmed body, a reduction in the backflow inside the recirculation bubble, and a decrease in the wake asymmetry associated with the Reflexional Symmetry Breaking (RSB) mode. Conversely, the vertically oriented slot geometries, such as the cross (C) and the vertical (V) configurations, showed limited drag reduction capability while maintaining or even intensifying the wake asymmetry. The horizontal (H) slot represented an intermediate case, mitigating the wake asymmetry to a large extent, but proving to be less effective in reducing the drag than the square case. The hierarchy of the blowing configurations was dictated by the modifications induced in the near wake behind the Ahmed body, which influenced the asymmetry of the wake and the filling/emptying of the recirculation region.</description>

      <title>Analytical and Numerical Linear Analyses of Convection Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conduct linear analyses of convection in domains larger than the temperature scale height. We employ both analytical and numerical methods in these analyses. In the case excluding all dissipation, the typical time scale of convection is determined by the free fall time over the temperature scale height. We quantitatively show the condition for the Boussinesq and Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) approximations to be applicable. We provide a reassessment of the critical Rayleigh number, a key indicator of convection, and show that WKB approximation tends to underestimate the critical Rayleigh number, particularly when the temperature scale height is comparable to or smaller than the domain height. We show clear explanation why both thermal conduction and viscosity are required for stabilizing negative entropy gradient medium.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic plugging of airways by sliding mucus films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When do mucus films plug lung airways? Using reduced-order simulations of a large ensemble of randomly perturbed films, we show that the answer is not determined by just the film's volume. While very thin films always stay open and very thick films always plug, we find a range of intermediate films for which plugging is uncertain. The fastest-growing linear mode of the Rayleigh-Plateau instability ensures that the film's volume is divided among multiple humps. However, the nonlinear growth of these humps can occur unevenly, due to spontaneous axial sliding -- a lucky hump can sweep up a disproportionate share of the film's volume and so form a plug. This sliding-induced plugging is robust and prevails with or without gravitational and ciliary transport.</description>

      <title>Motility and rotation of multi-timescale microswimmers in linear background flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microswimming cells and robots exhibit diverse behaviours due to both their swimming and their environment. One of the core environmental features impacting inertialess swimming is background flows. While the influence of select flows, particularly shear flows, have been extensively investigated, these are special cases. Here, we examine inertialess swimmers in more general flows, specifically general linear planar flows that may also possess rapid oscillations. Relatively weak symmetry constraints are imposed on the swimmer to ensure planarity and to reduce complexity. A further constraint reflecting common observation is imposed, namely that the swimmer is inefficient, which we suitably define. This introduces two separate timescales: a fast timescale associated with swimmer actuation, and a second timescale associated with net swimmer movement, with inefficiency dictating that this latter timescale is much slower, allowing for a multiple timescale simplification of the governing equations. With the exception of mathematically precise edge cases, we find that the behaviour of the swimmer is dictated by two parameter groupings, both of which measure balances between the angular velocity and rate of strain of the background flow. While the measures of flow angular velocity and strain rates that primarily govern the rotational dynamics are modulated by swimmer properties, the primary features of the translational motion are determined solely by a ratio of flow angular velocity to strain rate. Hence, a simple classification of the swimmer dynamics emerges. For example, this illustrates the limited extent to which, and how, microswimmers may control their orientations and trajectories in flows.</description>

      <title>Multi-stream Physics Hybrid Networks for solving Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding and solving fluid dynamics equations efficiently remains a fundamental challenge in computational physics. Traditional numerical solvers and physics-informed neural networks struggle to capture the full range of frequency components in partial differential equation solutions, limiting their accuracy and efficiency. Here, we propose the Multi-stream Physics Hybrid Network, a novel neural architecture that integrates quantum and classical layers in parallel to improve the accuracy of solving fluid dynamics equations, namely Kovasznay flow problem. This approach decomposes the solution into separate frequency components, each predicted by independent Parallel Hybrid Networks, simplifying the training process and enhancing performance. We evaluated the proposed model against a comparable classical neural network, the Multi-stream Physics Classical Network, in both data-driven and physics-driven scenarios. Our results show that the Multi-stream Physics Hybrid Network achieves a reduction in root mean square error by 36% for velocity components and 41% for pressure prediction compared to the classical model, while using 24% fewer trainable parameters. These findings highlight the potential of hybrid quantum-classical architectures for advancing computational fluid dynamics.</description>

      <title>Three-Dimensional Acoustic Turbulence: Weak Versus Strong</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Direct numerical simulation of three-dimensional acoustic turbulence has been performed for both weak and strong regimes. Within the weak turbulence, we demonstrate the existence of the Zakharov-Sagdeev spectrum $\propto k^{-3/2}$ not only for weak dispersion but in the non-dispersion (ND) case as well. Such spectra in the $k$-space are accompanied by jets in the form of narrow cones. These distributions are realized due to small nonlinearity compared with both dispersion/diffraction. Increasing pumping in the ND case due to dominant nonlinear effects leads to the formation of shocks. As a result, the acoustic turbulence turns into an ensemble of random shocks with the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili spectrum.</description>

      <title>Impact of Small-Scale Gravity Waves on Tracer Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Small-scale gravity waves play a crucial role in atmospheric tracer transport, yet their effects remain unresolved in climate models and must be parameterized. This study investigates how gravity waves influence large-scale tracer distributions, utilizing a multiple-scale analysis to systematically identify the governing terms of gravity wave-induced tracer fluxes. The analysis reveals both leading-order and next-order impacts: the former being the inertia-gravity wave-induced tracer Stokes drift, which acts perpendicular to both the large-scale tracer gradient and the wave number, while the latter becomes significant at lower latitudes where Coriolis effects diminish. A numerical framework is developed to incorporate these fluxes into a gravity wave parameterization model, potentially enhancing climate model accuracy without requiring explicit resolution of small-scale wave dynamics. Model validation against high-resolution wave-resolving simulations confirms the effectiveness of this approach. By improving the representation of gravity wave-induced tracer transport, this research advances the accuracy of climate simulations, particularly in their depiction of microphysics and radiative processes.</description>

      <title>Acoustic Propagation/Refraction Through Diffuse Interface Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel approach for simulating acoustic (pressure) wave propagation across different media separated by a diffuse interface through the use of a weak compressibility formulation. Our method builds on our previous work on an entropy-stable discontinuous Galerkin spectral element method for the incompressible Navier-Stokes/Cahn-Hilliard system \cite{manzanero2020entropyNSCH}, and incorporates a modified weak compressibility formulation that allows different sound speeds in each phase. We validate our method through numerical experiments, demonstrating spectral convergence for acoustic transmission and reflection coefficients in one dimension and for the angle defined by Snell's law in two dimensions. Special attention is given to quantifying the modeling errors introduced by the width of the diffuse interface. Our results show that the method successfully captures the behavior of acoustic waves across interfaces, allowing exponential convergence in transmitted waves. The transmitted angles in two dimensions are accurately captured for air-water conditions, up to the critical angle of $13^\circ$. This work represents a step forward in modeling acoustic propagation in incompressible multiphase systems, with potential applications to marine aeroacoustics.</description>

      <title>Kinetic theory based solutions for particle clustering in turbulent flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08133v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kinetic theory provides an elegant framework for studying dispersed particles in turbulent flows. Here the application of such probability density function (PDF)-based descriptions is considered in the context of particle clustering. The approach provides a continuum representation for the particle phase in which momentum conservation identifies two fundamental contributions to the particle mass flux. These take the form of an additional body force, which emerges from inhomogeneities in the sampling of turbulence by particles, and a component of the particle phase stress tensor associated with turbophoresis. Remarkably, these contributions are frequently overlooked in the specification of mean-field models for dispersed particle flows. To assess the relative importance of these mass flux contributions a kinematic simulation study has been performed, making use of a specially constructed inhomogeneous flow field designed to mimic the dynamics of particle pair behaviour. Whilst the turbophoretic contribution always acts to increase the clustering of particles, both the direction in which the additional body force acts and the relative importance of the two mass flux contributions are found to vary with particle inertia and turbulence intensity. In some regimes the body force is also the dominant mechanism responsible for particle clustering, demonstrating its importance within model formulations. It is further highlighted that the evolution of the radial distribution function which describes particle clustering is represented as a balance between convection and diffusion, and only inclusion of the identified mass flux contributions within this balance enables correct prediction of the particle pair concentration profile observed in simulations.</description>

      <title>Energy transfer and budget analysis for transient process with operator-driven reduced-order model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20204v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the possibility of energy transfer and budget analysis for transient flow using eigenmodes of the operator from the Navier-Stokes equation. We derive the energy transfer equation, which provides the energy budget for the eigenmodes, through the Galerkin projection of the equation using the bi-orthogonality of the eigenmodes and the adjoint mode. Energy budget and transfer analysis between modes were conducted for two-dimensional flow around a cylinder with eigenmodes growing or decaying from a steady flow. Using the linearized energy transfer equation and eigenmodes from global stability analysis, we identify the energy budget and spatial distribution that determine mode growth rates. Moreover, energy budget and transfer analysis are realized by considering the time evolution of the eigenmodes, even during the nonlinear development of the eigenmodes. By introducing time-varying dynamic mode decomposition with a phase-control strategy for multiple time-series datasets from numerical simulations of the phase-controlled initial flow, time-varying eigenmodes are extracted in the transient two-dimensional cylinder flow. With the extracted time-dependent modes and the derived energy transfer equations, the time evolution of the energy budget and spatial distribution of energy transfer can be computed until the eigenmodes developed from the steady field reach the post-transient periodic flow. From the time variation of the energy budget and the transfer distribution, the transient process of the cylinder flow can be characterized by the ratio of the magnitude of viscous diffusion for the eigenmode and energy transfer from the base flow.</description>

      <title>Falling plates with leading-edge vortex shedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22606v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a new numerical method for thin plates falling in inviscid fluid that allows for leading-edge vortex shedding. The inclusion of leading-edge shedding restores physical dynamics to vortex-sheet models of falling bodies, and for the first time large-amplitude fluttering and tumbling are observed in inviscid simulations. Leading-edge shedding is achieved by introducing a novel quadrature rule and smoothing procedure for the Birkhoff-Rott equations. The smoothing error is controlled by a novel fencing procedure. We find a transition point between fluttering and tumbling that is consistent with previous viscous simulations and experiments, and other falling motions such as looping, autorotation are also observed as the plate density increases. The dipole street wakes behind the fluttering plates resemble those in experiments. We consider plates bent into V shapes and study the effects of density and bending angle on the qualitative falling dynamics. At small densities, increasing the bending angle stabilizes the falling motion into fluttering, while at large densities, decreasing the bending angle stabilizes the falling motion into autorotation. In the autorotation regime, the magnitude of angular velocity increases as time cubed before it reaches a terminal angular velocity, and in the fluttering regime, the fluttering frequency scales as the $-1/2$ power of $R_1$, the plate density.</description>

      <title>Uncovering triadic interaction relationships latent in Mode A behind a circular cylinder</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00896v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coherence between multiple low-frequency components latent in the flow fields characterizes the nonlinear aspects of fluid dynamics. This study reveals the existance of the distinct frequency components and their interaction relation of the classical Mode A of the cylinder wake. Primaries are one-third of the Karman vortex shedding frequency (third-subharmonic) and bubble pumping, known as the previous study. However, when the spanwise domain size in numerical simulations is sufficiently large, their interaction is obscured by the presence of numerous frequency components. To address this, we introduce a process in which distinct frequency components gradually emerge by starting with a small spanwise domain size and then gradually increasing it from 3.3D to 4.7D, where D represents the diameter of the cylinder. From 3.3D to 3.5D, only the vortex shedding frequency harmonics are present. Third-subharmonic frequency appeared ranging from 3.5D to 3.7D. Bispectral mode decomposition reveals that the harmonics of the third-subharmonic frequency govern the flow in this domain size. The bubble pumping is emergence in the flow fields between 3.7D and 3.8D. The frequency component after this emergence is not only the harmonics of bubble pumping and periodic nature is disrupt. Nonlinear interactions between bubble pumping, the Karman vortex, and the third-subharmonic component complicate the temporal behavior of the flow field. Utilizing the constraint of the spanwise domain size, our approach effectively reveals the interaction relationship between frequency components inherent a flow field with a significant number of frequency components.</description>

Abstract: This work presents a hybrid pressure face-centred finite volume (FCFV) solver to simulate steady-state incompressible Navier-Stokes flows. The method leverages the robustness, in the incompressible limit, of the hybridisable discontinuous Galerkin paradigm for compressible and weakly compressible flows to derive the formulation of a novel, low-order face-based discretisation. The incompressibility constraint is enforced in a weak sense, by introducing an inter-cell mass flux defined in terms of a new, hybrid variable, representing the pressure at the cell faces. This results in a new hybridisation strategy where cell variables (velocity, pressure and deviatoric strain rate tensor) are expressed as a function of velocity and pressure at the barycentre of the cell faces. The hybrid pressure formulation provides first-order convergence of all variables, including the stress, without the need for gradient reconstruction, thus being less sensitive to cell type, stretching, distortion, and skewness than traditional low-order finite volume solvers. Numerical benchmarks of Navier-Stokes flows at low and moderate Reynolds numbers, in two and three dimensions, are presented to evaluate accuracy and robustness of the method. In particular, the hybrid pressure formulation outperforms the FCFV method when convective effects are relevant, achieving accurate predictions on significantly coarser meshes.</description>
