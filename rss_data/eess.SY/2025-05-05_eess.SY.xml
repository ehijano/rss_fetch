      <title>Neural Networks Enabled Discovery On the Higher-Order Nonlinear Partial Differential Equation of Traffic Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling the traffic dynamics is essential for understanding and predicting the traffic spatiotemporal evolution. However, deriving the partial differential equation (PDE) models that capture these dynamics is challenging due to their potential high order property and nonlinearity. In this paper, we introduce a novel deep learning framework, "TRAFFIC-PDE-LEARN", designed to discover hidden PDE models of traffic network dynamics directly from measurement data. By harnessing the power of the neural network to approximate a spatiotemporal fundamental diagram that facilitates smooth estimation of partial derivatives with low-resolution loop detector data. Furthermore, the use of automatic differentiation enables efficient computation of the necessary partial derivatives through the chain and product rules, while sparse regression techniques facilitate the precise identification of physically interpretable PDE components. Tested on data from a real-world traffic network, our model demonstrates that the underlying PDEs governing traffic dynamics are both high-order and nonlinear. By leveraging the learned dynamics for prediction purposes, the results underscore the effectiveness of our approach and its potential to advance intelligent transportation systems.</description>

      <title>MARS: Defending Unmanned Aerial Vehicles From Attacks on Inertial Sensors with Model-based Anomaly Detection and Recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) rely on measurements from Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) to maintain stable flight. However, IMUs are susceptible to physical attacks, including acoustic resonant and electromagnetic interference attacks, resulting in immediate UAV crashes. Consequently, we introduce a Model-based Anomaly detection and Recovery System (MARS) that enables UAVs to quickly detect adversarial attacks on inertial sensors and achieve dynamic flight recovery. MARS features an attack-resilient state estimator based on the Extended Kalman Filter, which incorporates position, velocity, heading, and rotor speed measurements to reconstruct accurate attitude and angular velocity information for UAV control. Moreover, a statistical anomaly detection system monitors IMU sensor data, raising a system-level alert if an attack is detected. Upon receiving the alert, a multi-stage dynamic flight recovery strategy suspends the ongoing mission, stabilizes the drone in a hovering condition, and then resumes tasks under the resilient control. Experimental results in PX4 software-in-the-loop environments as well as real-world MARS-PX4 autopilot-equipped drones demonstrate the superiority of our approach over existing IMU-defense frameworks, showcasing the ability of the UAVs to survive attacks and complete the missions.</description>

      <title>Learning Low-Dimensional Embeddings for Black-Box Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When gradient-based methods are impractical, black-box optimization (BBO) provides a valuable alternative. However, BBO often struggles with high-dimensional problems and limited trial budgets. In this work, we propose a novel approach based on meta-learning to pre-compute a reduced-dimensional manifold where optimal points lie for a specific class of optimization problems. When optimizing a new problem instance sampled from the class, black-box optimization is carried out in the reduced-dimensional space, effectively reducing the effort required for finding near-optimal solutions.</description>

      <title>Remote Estimation over Packet-Dropping Wireless Channels with Partial State Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the design of an optimal transmission policy for remote state estimation over packet-dropping wireless channels with imperfect channel state information. A smart sensor uses a Kalman filter to estimate the system state and transmits its information to a remote estimator. Our objective is to minimize the state estimation error and energy consumption by deciding whether to transmit new information or retransmit previously failed packets. To balance the trade-off between information freshness and reliability, the sensor applies a hybrid automatic repeat request protocol. We formulate this problem as a finite horizon partially observable Markov decision process with an augmented state-space that incorporates both the age of information and the unknown channel state. By defining an information state, we derive the dynamic programming equations for evaluating the optimal policy. This transmission policy is computed numerically using the point-based value iteration algorithm.</description>

      <title>Towards Probabilistic Dynamic Security Assessment and Enhancement of Large Power Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel methodology for probabilistic dynamic security assessment and enhancement of power systems that considers load and generation variability, N-2 contingencies, and uncertain cascade propagation caused by uncertain protection system behaviour. In this methodology, a database of likely operating conditions is generated via weather data, a market model and a model of operators' preventive actions. System states are sampled from this database and contingencies are applied to them to perform the security assessment. Rigorous statistical indicators are proposed to decide how many biased and unbiased samples to simulate to reach a target accuracy on the statistical error on the estimated risk from individual contingencies. Optionally, a screening of contingencies can be performed to limit the computational burden of the analysis. Finally, interpretable machine learning techniques are used to identify the root causes of the risk from critical contingencies, to ease the interpretation of the results, and to help with security enhancement. The method is demonstrated on the 73-bus reliability test system, and the scalability to large power systems (with thousands of buses) is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Bilateral Cognitive Security Games in Networked Control Systems under Stealthy Injection Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies a strategic security problem in networked control systems under stealthy false data injection attacks. The security problem is modeled as a bilateral cognitive security game between a defender and an adversary, each possessing cognitive reasoning abilities. The adversary with an adversarial cognitive ability strategically attacks some interconnections of the system with the aim of disrupting the network performance while remaining stealthy to the defender. Meanwhile, the defender with a defense cognitive ability strategically monitors some nodes to impose the stealthiness constraint with the purpose of minimizing the worst-case disruption caused by the adversary. Within the proposed bilateral cognitive security framework, the preferred cognitive levels of the two strategic agents are formulated in terms of two newly proposed concepts, cognitive mismatch and cognitive resonance. Moreover, we propose a method to compute the policies for the defender and the adversary with arbitrary cognitive abilities. A sufficient condition is established under which an increase in cognitive levels does not alter the policies for the defender and the adversary, ensuring convergence. The obtained results are validated through numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Security Metrics for Uncertain Interconnected Systems under Stealthy Data Injection Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper quantifies the security of uncertain interconnected systems under stealthy data injection attacks. In particular, we consider a large-scale system composed of a certain subsystem interconnected with an uncertain subsystem, where only the input-output channels are accessible. An adversary is assumed to inject false data to maximize the performance loss of the certain subsystem while remaining undetected. By abstracting the uncertain subsystem as a class of admissible systems satisfying an $\mathcal{L}_2$ gain constraint, the worst-case performance loss is obtained as the solution to a convex semi-definite program depending only on the certain subsystem dynamics and such an $\mathcal{L}_2$ gain constraint. This solution is proved to serve as an upper bound for the actual worst-case performance loss when the model of the entire system is fully certain. The results are demonstrated through numerical simulations of the power transmission grid spanning Sweden and Northern Denmark.</description>

      <title>Pattern formation using an intrinsic optimal control approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates a pattern formation control problem for a multi-agent system modeled with given interaction topology, in which $m$ of the $n$ agents are chosen as leaders and consequently a control signal is added to each of the leaders. These agents interact with each other by Laplacian dynamics on a graph. The pattern formation control problem is formulated as an intrinsic infinite time-horizon linear quadratic optimal control problem, namely, no error information is incorporated in the objective function. Under mild conditions, we show the existence of the optimal control strategy and the convergence to the desired pattern formation. Based on the optimal control strategy, we propose a distributed control strategy to achieve the given pattern. Finally, numerical simulation is given to illustrate theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Power System Transition Planning: An Industry-Aligned Framework for Long-Term Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces the category of Power System Transition Planning optimization problem. It aims to shift power systems to emissions-free networks efficiently. Unlike comparable work, the framework presented here broadly applies to the industry's decision-making process. It defines a field-appropriate functional boundary focused on the economic efficiency of power systems. Namely, while imposing a wide range of planning factors in the decision space, the model maintains the structure and depth of conventional power system planning under uncertainty, which leads to a large-scale multistage stochastic programming formulation that encounters intractability in real-life cases. Thus, the framework simultaneously invokes high-performance computing defaultism. In this comprehensive exposition, we present a guideline model, comparing its scope to existing formulations, supported by a fully detailed example problem, showcasing the analytical value of the solution gained in a small test case. Then, the framework's viability for realistic applications is demonstrated by solving an extensive test case based on a realistic planning construct consistent with Alberta's power system practices for long-term planning studies. The framework resorts to Stochastic Dual Dynamic Programming as a decomposition method to achieve tractability, leveraging High-Performance Computing and parallel computation.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-Enabled System Diagnosis in Microgrids: A Feature-Feedback GAN Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing integration of inverter-based resources (IBRs) and communication networks has brought both modernization and new vulnerabilities to the power system infrastructure. These vulnerabilities expose the system to internal faults and cyber threats, particularly False Data Injection (FDI) attacks, which can closely mimic real fault scenarios. Hence, this work presents a two-stage fault and cyberattack detection framework tailored for inverter-based microgrids. Stage 1 introduces an unsupervised learning model Feature Feedback Generative Adversarial Network (F2GAN), to distinguish between genuine internal faults and cyber-induced anomalies in microgrids. Compared to conventional GAN architectures, F2GAN demonstrates improved system diagnosis and greater adaptability to zero-day attacks through its feature-feedback mechanism. In Stage 2, supervised machine learning techniques, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Trees (DT), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are applied to localize and classify faults within inverter switches, distinguishing between single-switch and multi-switch faults. The proposed framework is validated on a simulated microgrid environment, illustrating robust performance in detecting and classifying both physical and cyber-related disturbances in power electronic-dominated systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: OSMnx is a Python package for downloading, modeling, analyzing, and visualizing urban networks and any other geospatial features from OpenStreetMap data. A large and growing body of literature uses it to conduct scientific studies across the disciplines of geography, urban planning, transport engineering, computer science, and others. The OSMnx project has recently developed and implemented many new features, modeling capabilities, and analytical methods. The package now encompasses substantially more functionality than was previously documented in the literature. This article introduces OSMnx's modern capabilities, usage, and design -- in addition to the scientific theory and logic underlying them. It shares lessons learned in geospatial software development and reflects on open science's implications for urban modeling and analysis.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-aware Latent Safety Filters for Avoiding Out-of-Distribution Failures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in generative world models have enabled classical safe control methods, such as Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability, to generalize to complex robotic systems operating directly from high-dimensional sensor observations. However, obtaining comprehensive coverage of all safety-critical scenarios during world model training is extremely challenging. As a result, latent safety filters built on top of these models may miss novel hazards and even fail to prevent known ones, overconfidently misclassifying risky out-of-distribution (OOD) situations as safe. To address this, we introduce an uncertainty-aware latent safety filter that proactively steers robots away from both known and unseen failures. Our key idea is to use the world model's epistemic uncertainty as a proxy for identifying unseen potential hazards. We propose a principled method to detect OOD world model predictions by calibrating an uncertainty threshold via conformal prediction. By performing reachability analysis in an augmented state space-spanning both the latent representation and the epistemic uncertainty-we synthesize a latent safety filter that can reliably safeguard arbitrary policies from both known and unseen safety hazards. In simulation and hardware experiments on vision-based control tasks with a Franka manipulator, we show that our uncertainty-aware safety filter preemptively detects potential unsafe scenarios and reliably proposes safe, in-distribution actions.

      <title>Dual Filter: A Mathematical Framework for Inference using Transformer-like Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a mathematical framework for causal nonlinear prediction in settings where observations are generated from an underlying hidden Markov model (HMM). Both the problem formulation and the proposed solution are motivated by the decoder-only transformer architecture, in which a finite sequence of observations (tokens) is mapped to the conditional probability of the next token. Our objective is not to construct a mathematical model of a transformer. Rather, our interest lies in deriving, from first principles, transformer-like architectures that solve the prediction problem for which the transformer is designed. The proposed framework is based on an original optimal control approach, where the prediction objective (MMSE) is reformulated as an optimal control problem. An analysis of the optimal control problem is presented leading to a fixed-point equation on the space of probability measures. To solve the fixed-point equation, we introduce the dual filter, an iterative algorithm that closely parallels the architecture of decoder-only transformers. These parallels are discussed in detail along with the relationship to prior work on mathematical modeling of transformers as transport on the space of probability measures. Numerical experiments are provided to illustrate the performance of the algorithm using parameter values used in researchscale transformer models.</description>

      <title>Near-optimal Sensor Placement for Detecting Stochastic Target Trajectories in Barrier Coverage Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the deployment of sensors for a 2-D barrier coverage system. The challenge is to compute near-optimal sensor placements for detecting targets whose trajectories follow a log-Gaussian Cox line process. We explore sensor deployment in a transformed space, where linear target trajectories are represented as points. While this space simplifies handling the line process, the spatial functions representing sensor performance (i.e. probability of detection) become less intuitive. To illustrate our approach, we focus on positioning sensors of the barrier coverage system on the seafloor to detect passing ships. Through numerical experiments using historical ship data, we compute sensor locations that maximize the probability all ship passing over the barrier coverage system are detected.</description>

      <title>Fault-Tolerant Multi-Modal Localization of Multi-Robots on Matrix Lie Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consistent localization of cooperative multi-robot systems during navigation presents substantial challenges. This paper proposes a fault-tolerant, multi-modal localization framework for multi-robot systems on matrix Lie groups. We introduce novel stochastic operations to perform composition, differencing, inversion, averaging, and fusion of correlated and non-correlated estimates on Lie groups, enabling pseudo-pose construction for filter updates. The method integrates a combination of proprioceptive and exteroceptive measurements from inertial, velocity, and pose (pseudo-pose) sensors on each robot in an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) framework. The prediction step is conducted on the Lie group $\mathbb{SE}_2(3) \times \mathbb{R}^3 \times \mathbb{R}^3$, where each robot's pose, velocity, and inertial measurement biases are propagated. The proposed framework uses body velocity, relative pose measurements from fiducial markers, and inter-robot communication to provide scalable EKF update across the network on the Lie group $\mathbb{SE}(3) \times \mathbb{R}^3$. A fault detection module is implemented, allowing the integration of only reliable pseudo-pose measurements from fiducial markers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method through experiments with a network of wheeled mobile robots equipped with inertial measurement units, wheel odometry, and ArUco markers. The comparison results highlight the proposed method's real-time performance, superior efficiency, reliability, and scalability in multi-robot localization, making it well-suited for large-scale robotic systems.</description>

      <title>Platoon Coordination and Leader Selection in Mixed Transportation Systems via Dynamic Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the growing penetration of electric trucks, freight transportation is transitioning toward a mixed system comprising both fuel-powered and electric trucks. Enhancing truck platoon formation in such a heterogeneous environment presents new challenges. This paper investigates the hub-based platoon coordination problem in a mixed truck fleet, where the focus is to optimize the trucks' waiting times, charging amounts for electric trucks, and platoon leader assignments. The objective is to maximize the overall platoon revenue of the fleet while accounting for the associated waiting and charging costs. We formulate the problem as a mixed-integer linear program and present a dynamic programming approach to compute its sub-optimal solution efficiently. The proposed method operates in polynomial time, ensuring scalable computational efficiency. Simulation studies involving 1,000 trucks traveling between two hubs in Sweden demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>SeLR: Sparsity-enhanced Lagrangian Relaxation for Computation Offloading at the Edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel computational approach for offloading sensor data processing tasks to servers in edge networks for better accuracy and makespan. A task is assigned with one of several offloading options, each comprises a server, a route for uploading data to the server, and a service profile that specifies the performance and resource consumption at the server and in the network. This offline offloading and routing problem is formulated as mixed integer programming (MIP), which is non-convex and HP-hard due to the discrete decision variables associated to the offloading options. The novelty of our approach is to transform this non-convex problem into iterative convex optimization by relaxing integer decision variables into continuous space, combining primal-dual optimization for penalizing constraint violations and reweighted $L_1$-minimization for promoting solution sparsity, which achieves better convergence through a smoother path in a continuous search space. Compared to existing greedy heuristics, our approach can achieve a better Pareto frontier in accuracy and latency, scales better to larger problem instances, and can achieve a 7.72--9.17$\times$ reduction in computational overhead of scheduling compared to the optimal solver in hierarchically organized edge networks with 300 nodes and 50--100 tasks.</description>

      <title>Learning Neural Control Barrier Functions from Offline Data with Conservatism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Safety filters, particularly those based on control barrier functions, have gained increased interest as effective tools for safe control of dynamical systems. Existing correct-by-construction synthesis algorithms, however, suffer from the curse of dimensionality. Deep learning approaches have been proposed in recent years to address this challenge. In this paper, we contribute to this line of work by proposing an algorithm for training control barrier functions from offline datasets. Our algorithm trains the filter to not only prevent the system from reaching unsafe states but also out-of-distribution ones, at which the filter would be unreliable. It is inspired by Conservative Q-learning, an offline reinforcement learning algorithm. We call its outputs Conservative Control Barrier Functions (CCBFs). Our empirical results demonstrate that CCBFs outperform existing methods in maintaining safety and out-of-distribution avoidance while minimally affecting task performance.</description>

      <title>DexCtrl: Towards Sim-to-Real Dexterity with Adaptive Controller Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dexterous manipulation has seen remarkable progress in recent years, with policies capable of executing many complex and contact-rich tasks in simulation. However, transferring these policies from simulation to real world remains a significant challenge. One important issue is the mismatch in low-level controller dynamics, where identical trajectories can lead to vastly different contact forces and behaviors when control parameters vary. Existing approaches often rely on manual tuning or controller randomization, which can be labor-intensive, task-specific, and introduce significant training difficulty. In this work, we propose a framework that jointly learns actions and controller parameters based on the historical information of both trajectory and controller. This adaptive controller adjustment mechanism allows the policy to automatically tune control parameters during execution, thereby mitigating the sim-to-real gap without extensive manual tuning or excessive randomization. Moreover, by explicitly providing controller parameters as part of the observation, our approach facilitates better reasoning over force interactions and improves robustness in real-world scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves improved transfer performance across a variety of dexterous tasks involving variable force conditions.</description>

      <title>Model Tensor Planning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sampling-based model predictive control (MPC) offers strong performance in nonlinear and contact-rich robotic tasks, yet often suffers from poor exploration due to locally greedy sampling schemes. We propose \emph{Model Tensor Planning} (MTP), a novel sampling-based MPC framework that introduces high-entropy control trajectory generation through structured tensor sampling. By sampling over randomized multipartite graphs and interpolating control trajectories with B-splines and Akima splines, MTP ensures smooth and globally diverse control candidates. We further propose a simple $\beta$-mixing strategy that blends local exploitative and global exploratory samples within the modified Cross-Entropy Method (CEM) update, balancing control refinement and exploration. Theoretically, we show that MTP achieves asymptotic path coverage and maximum entropy in the control trajectory space in the limit of infinite tensor depth and width.
  Our implementation is fully vectorized using JAX and compatible with MuJoCo XLA, supporting \emph{Just-in-time} (JIT) compilation and batched rollouts for real-time control with online domain randomization. Through experiments on various challenging robotic tasks, ranging from dexterous in-hand manipulation to humanoid locomotion, we demonstrate that MTP outperforms standard MPC and evolutionary strategy baselines in task success and control robustness. Design and sensitivity ablations confirm the effectiveness of MTP tensor sampling structure, spline interpolation choices, and mixing strategy. Altogether, MTP offers a scalable framework for robust exploration in model-based planning and control.</description>

      <title>Integration Matters for Learning PDEs with Backwards SDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Backward stochastic differential equation (BSDE)-based deep learning methods provide an alternative to Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for solving high-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs), offering algorithmic advantages in settings such as stochastic optimal control, where the PDEs of interest are tied to an underlying dynamical system. However, existing BSDE-based solvers have empirically been shown to underperform relative to PINNs in the literature. In this paper, we identify the root cause of this performance gap as a discretization bias introduced by the standard Euler-Maruyama (EM) integration scheme applied to short-horizon self-consistency BSDE losses, which shifts the optimization landscape off target. We find that this bias cannot be satisfactorily addressed through finer step sizes or longer self-consistency horizons. To properly handle this issue, we propose a Stratonovich-based BSDE formulation, which we implement with stochastic Heun integration. We show that our proposed approach completely eliminates the bias issues faced by EM integration. Furthermore, our empirical results show that our Heun-based BSDE method consistently outperforms EM-based variants and achieves competitive results with PINNs across multiple high-dimensional benchmarks. Our findings highlight the critical role of integration schemes in BSDE-based PDE solvers, an algorithmic detail that has received little attention thus far in the literature.</description>

      <title>Secure Cluster-Based Hierarchical Federated Learning in Vehicular Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hierarchical Federated Learning (HFL) has recently emerged as a promising solution for intelligent decision-making in vehicular networks, helping to address challenges such as limited communication resources, high vehicle mobility, and data heterogeneity. However, HFL remains vulnerable to adversarial and unreliable vehicles, whose misleading updates can significantly compromise the integrity and convergence of the global model. To address these challenges, we propose a novel defense framework that integrates dynamic vehicle selection with robust anomaly detection within a cluster-based HFL architecture, specifically designed to counter Gaussian noise and gradient ascent attacks. The framework performs a comprehensive reliability assessment for each vehicle by evaluating historical accuracy, contribution frequency, and anomaly records. Anomaly detection combines Z-score and cosine similarity analyses on model updates to identify both statistical outliers and directional deviations in model updates. To further refine detection, an adaptive thresholding mechanism is incorporated into the cosine similarity metric, dynamically adjusting the threshold based on the historical accuracy of each vehicle to enforce stricter standards for consistently high-performing vehicles. In addition, a weighted gradient averaging mechanism is implemented, which assigns higher weights to gradient updates from more trustworthy vehicles. To defend against coordinated attacks, a cross-cluster consistency check is applied to identify collaborative attacks in which multiple compromised clusters coordinate misleading updates. Together, these mechanisms form a multi-level defense strategy to filter out malicious contributions effectively. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm significantly reduces convergence time compared to benchmark methods across both 1-hop and 3-hop topologies.</description>

      <title>Integration of Multi-Mode Preference into Home Energy Management System Using Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Home Energy Management Systems (HEMS) have emerged as a pivotal tool in the smart home ecosystem, aiming to enhance energy efficiency, reduce costs, and improve user comfort. By enabling intelligent control and optimization of household energy consumption, HEMS plays a significant role in bridging the gap between consumer needs and energy utility objectives. However, much of the existing literature construes consumer comfort as a mere deviation from the standard appliance settings. Such deviations are typically incorporated into optimization objectives via static weighting factors. These factors often overlook the dynamic nature of consumer behaviors and preferences. Addressing this oversight, our paper introduces a multi-mode Deep Reinforcement Learning-based HEMS (DRL-HEMS) framework, meticulously designed to optimize based on dynamic, consumer-defined preferences. Our primary goal is to augment consumer involvement in Demand Response (DR) programs by embedding dynamic multi-mode preferences tailored to individual appliances. In this study, we leverage a model-free, single-agent DRL algorithm to deliver a HEMS framework that is not only dynamic but also user-friendly. To validate its efficacy, we employed real-world data at 15-minute intervals, including metrics such as electricity price, ambient temperature, and appliances' power consumption. Our results show that the model performs exceptionally well in optimizing energy consumption within different preference modes. Furthermore, when compared to traditional algorithms based on Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP), our model achieves nearly optimal performance while outperforming in computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Real-Time Planning Method for Swarm Robotics Based on an Optimal Virtual Tube</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Swarm robotics navigating through unknown obstacle environments is an emerging research area that faces challenges. Performing tasks in such environments requires swarms to achieve autonomous localization, perception, decision-making, control, and planning. The limited computational resources of onboard platforms present significant challenges for planning and control. Reactive planners offer low computational demands and high re-planning frequencies but lack predictive capabilities, often resulting in local minima. Long-horizon planners, on the other hand, can perform multi-step predictions to reduce deadlocks but cost much computation, leading to lower re-planning frequencies. This paper proposes a real-time optimal virtual tube planning method for swarm robotics in unknown environments, which generates approximate solutions for optimal trajectories through affine functions. As a result, the computational complexity of approximate solutions is $O(n_t)$, where $n_t$ is the number of parameters in the trajectory, thereby significantly reducing the overall computational burden. By integrating reactive methods, the proposed method enables low-computation, safe swarm motion in unknown environments. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through several simulations and experiments.</description>

      <title>Stabilization of Predator-Prey Age-Structured Hyperbolic PDE when Harvesting both Species is Inevitable</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06823v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Populations do not only interact over time but also age over time. It is therefore common to model them as age-structured PDEs, where age is the space variable. Since the models also involve integrals over age, both in the birth process and in the interaction among species, they are in fact integro-partial differential equations (IPDEs) with positive states. To regulate the population densities to desired profiles, harvesting is used as input. But non-discriminating harvesting, where wanting to repress one species will inevitably repress the other species as well, the positivity restriction on the input (no insertion of population), and the multiplicative nature of harvesting, makes control challenging even for ODE versions of such dynamics, let alone for their IPDE versions on an infinite-dimensional nonnegative state space.
  We introduce a design for a benchmark version of such a problem: a two-population predator-prey setup. The model is equivalent to two coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs), actuated by harvesting which must not drop below zero, and strongly disturbed by two autonomous but exponentially stable integral delay equations (IDEs). We develop two control designs. With a modified Volterra-like control Lyapunov function, we design a simple feedback which employs possibly negative harvesting for global stabilization of the ODE model, while guaranteeing regional regulation with positive harvesting. With a more sophisticated, restrained controller we achieve regulation for the ODE model globally, with positive harvesting. For the full IPDE model, with the IDE dynamics acting as large disturbances, for both the simple and saturated feedback laws we provide explicit estimates of the regions of attraction. The paper charts a new pathway for control designs for infinite-dimensional multi-species dynamics and for nonlinear positive systems with positive controls.</description>

      <title>AC-Informed DC Optimal Transmission Switching Problems via Parameter Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10528v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optimal Transmission Switching (OTS) problems minimize operational costs while treating both the transmission line energization statuses and generator setpoints as decision variables. The combination of nonlinearities from an AC power flow model and discrete variables associated with line statuses makes AC-OTS a computationally challenging Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Program (MINLP). To address these challenges, the DC power flow approximation is often used to obtain a DC-OTS formulation expressed as a Mixed-Integer Linear Program (MILP). However, this approximation often leads to suboptimal or infeasible switching decisions when evaluated with an AC power flow model. This paper proposes an enhanced DC-OTS formulation that leverages techniques for training machine learning models to optimize the DC power flow model's parameters. By optimally selecting parameter values that align flows in the DC power flow model with apparent power flows -- incorporating both real and reactive components -- from AC Optimal Power Flow (OPF) solutions, our method more accurately captures line congestion behavior. Integrating these optimized parameters into the DC-OTS formulation significantly improves the accuracy of switching decisions and reduces discrepancies between DC-OTS and AC-OTS solutions. We compare our optimized DC-OTS model against traditional OTS approaches, including DC-OTS, Linear Programming AC (LPAC)-OTS, and Quadratic Convex (QC)-OTS. Numerical results show that switching decisions from our model yield better performance when evaluated using an AC power flow model, with up to $44\%$ cost reductions in some cases.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Dimensioning of Frequency Containment Reserves: The Case of the Nordic Grid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11093v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the main responsibilities of a Transmission System Operator (TSO) operating an electric grid is to maintain a designated frequency (e.g., 50 Hz in Europe). To achieve this, TSOs have created several products called frequency-supporting ancillary services. The Frequency Containment Reserve (FCR) is one of these ancillary service products. This article focuses on the TSO problem of determining the volume procured for FCR. Specifically, we investigate the potential benefits and impact on grid security when transitioning from a traditionally \textit{static} procurement method to a \textit{dynamic} strategy for FCR volume. We take the Nordic synchronous area in Europe as a case study and use a diffusion model to capture its frequency development. We introduce a controlled mean reversal parameter to assess changes in FCR obligations, in particular for the Nordic FCR-N ancillary service product. We establish closed-form expressions for exceedance probabilities and use historical frequency data as input to calibrate the model. We show that a dynamic dimensioning approach for FCR has the potential to significantly reduce the exceedance probabilities (up to $37\%$) while maintaining the total yearly procured FCR volume equal to that of the current static approach. Alternatively, a dynamic dimensioning approach could significantly increase security at limited extra cost.</description>

      <title>End-to-End Learning Framework for Solving Non-Markovian Optimal Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04649v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integer-order calculus often falls short in capturing the long-range dependencies and memory effects found in many real-world processes. Fractional calculus addresses these gaps via fractional-order integrals and derivatives, but fractional-order dynamical systems pose substantial challenges in system identification and optimal control due to the lack of standard control methodologies. In this paper, we theoretically derive the optimal control via linear quadratic regulator (LQR) for fractional-order linear time-invariant (FOLTI) systems and develop an end-to-end deep learning framework based on this theoretical foundation. Our approach establishes a rigorous mathematical model, derives analytical solutions, and incorporates deep learning to achieve data-driven optimal control of FOLTI systems. Our key contributions include: (i) proposing an innovative system identification method control strategy for FOLTI systems, (ii) developing the first end-to-end data-driven learning framework, Fractional-Order Learning for Optimal Control (FOLOC), that learns control policies from observed trajectories, and (iii) deriving a theoretical analysis of sample complexity to quantify the number of samples required for accurate optimal control in complex real-world problems. Experimental results indicate that our method accurately approximates fractional-order system behaviors without relying on Gaussian noise assumptions, pointing to promising avenues for advanced optimal control.</description>

      <title>Generating Building-Level Heat Demand Time Series by Combining Occupancy Simulations and Thermal Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05427v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite various efforts, decarbonizing the heating sector remains a significant challenge. To tackle it by smart planning, the availability of highly resolved heating demand data is key. Several existing models provide heating demand only for specific applications. Typically, they either offer time series for a larger area or annual demand data on a building level, but not both simultaneously. Additionally, the diversity in heating demand across different buildings is often not considered. To address these limitations, this paper presents a novel method for generating temporally resolved heat demand time series at the building level using publicly available data. The approach integrates a thermal building model with stochastic occupancy simulations that account for variability in user behavior. As a result, the tool serves as a cost-effective resource for cross-sectoral energy system planning and policy development, particularly with a focus on the heating sector. The obtained data can be used to assess the impact of renovation and retrofitting strategies, or to analyze district heating expansion. To illustrate the potential applications of this approach, we conducted a case study in Puertollano (Spain), where we prepared a dataset of heating demand with hourly resolution for each of 9,298 residential buildings. This data was then used to compare two different pathways for the thermal renovation of these buildings. By relying on publicly available data, this method can be adapted and applied to various European regions, offering broad usability in energy system optimization and analysis of decarbonization strategies.</description>

      <title>Transfer Learning for LQR Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06755v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a transfer learning framework for Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) control, where (i) the dynamics of the system of interest (target system) are unknown and only a short trajectory of impulse responses from the target system is provided, and (ii) impulse responses are available from $N$ source systems with different dynamics. We show that the LQR controller can be learned from a sufficiently long trajectory of impulse responses. Further, a transferable mode set can be identified using the available data from source systems and the target system, enabling the reconstruction of the target system's impulse responses for controller design. By leveraging data from source systems, we show that the sample complexity for synthesizing the LQR controller can be reduced by $50 \%$. Algorithms and numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the implementation of the proposed transfer control framework.</description>

      <title>Learning-Based MPC for Fuel Efficient Control of Autonomous Vehicles with Discrete Gear Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11359v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Co-optimization of both vehicle speed and gear position via model predictive control (MPC) has been shown to offer benefits for fuel-efficient autonomous driving. However, optimizing both the vehicle's continuous dynamics and discrete gear positions may be too computationally intensive for a real-time implementation. This work proposes a learning-based MPC scheme to address this issue. A policy is trained to select and fix the gear positions across the prediction horizon of the MPC controller, leaving a significantly simpler continuous optimization problem to be solved online. In simulation, the proposed approach is shown to have a significantly lower computation burden and a comparable performance, with respect to pure MPC-based co-optimization.</description>

      <title>Synthesizing Grid Data with Cyber Resilience and Privacy Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14877v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) provides a principled approach to synthesizing data (e.g., loads) from real-world power systems while limiting the exposure of sensitive information. However, adversaries may exploit synthetic data to calibrate cyberattacks on the source grids. To control these risks, we propose new DP algorithms for synthesizing data that provide the source grids with both cyber resilience and privacy guarantees. The algorithms incorporate both normal operation and attack optimization models to balance the fidelity of synthesized data and cyber resilience. The resulting post-processing optimization is reformulated as a robust optimization problem, which is compatible with the exponential mechanism of DP to moderate its computational burden.</description>

      <title>Online Model Order Reduction of Linear Systems via $(\gamma,\delta)$-Similarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10437v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Model order reduction aims to determine a low-order approximation of high-order models with least possible approximation errors. For application to physical systems, it is crucial that the reduced order model (ROM) is robust to any disturbance that acts on the full order model (FOM) -- in the sense that the output of the ROM remains a good approximation of that of the FOM, even in the presence of such disturbances. In this work, we present a framework for online model order reduction for a class of continuous-time linear systems that ensures this property for any $\mathcal{L}_2$ disturbance. Apart from robustness to disturbances in this sense, the proposed framework also displays other desirable properties for model order reduction: (1) a provable bound on the error defined as the $L_2$ norm of the difference between the output of the ROM and FOM, (2) preservation of stability, (3) compositionality properties and a provable error bound for arbitrary interconnected systems, (4) a provable bound on the output of the FOM when the controller designed for the ROM is used with the FOM, and finally, (5) compatibility with existing approaches such as balanced truncation and moment matching. Property (4) does not require computation of any gap metric and property (5) is beneficial as existing approaches can also be equipped with some of the preceding properties. The theoretical results are corroborated on numerical case studies, including on a building model.</description>

      <title>Recursive Algorithms for Sparse Parameter Identification of Multivariate Stochastic Systems with Non-stationary Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00323v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The classical sparse parameter identification methods are usually based on the iterative basis selection such as greedy algorithms, or the numerical optimization of regularized cost functions such as LASSO and Bayesian posterior probability distribution, etc., which, however, are not suitable for online sparsity inference when data arrive sequentially. This paper presents recursive algorithms for sparse parameter identification of multivariate stochastic systems with non-stationary observations. First, a new bivariate criterion function is presented by introducing an auxiliary variable matrix into a weighted $L_1$ regularization criterion. The new criterion function is subsequently decomposed into two solvable subproblems via alternating optimization of the two variable matrices, for which the optimizers can be explicitly formulated into recursive equations. Second, under the non-stationary and non-persistent excitation conditions on the systems, theoretical properties of the recursive algorithms are established. That is, the estimates are proved to be with (i) set convergence, i.e., the accurate estimation of the sparse index set of the unknown parameter matrix, and (ii) parameter convergence, i.e., the consistent estimation for values of the non-zero elements of the unknown parameter matrix. Finally, numerical examples are given to support the theoretical analysis.</description>

      <title>Employing Federated Learning for Training Autonomous HVAC Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00389v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Buildings account for 40% of global energy consumption. A considerable portion of building energy consumption stems from heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC), and thus implementing smart, energy-efficient HVAC systems has the potential to significantly impact the course of climate change. In recent years, model-free reinforcement learning algorithms have been increasingly assessed for this purpose due to their ability to learn and adapt purely from experience. They have been shown to outperform classical controllers in terms of energy cost and consumption, as well as thermal comfort. However, their weakness lies in their relatively poor data efficiency, requiring long periods of training to reach acceptable policies, making them inapplicable to real-world controllers directly. In this paper, we demonstrate that using federated learning to train the reinforcement learning controller of HVAC systems can improve the learning speed, as well as improve their ability to generalize, which in turn facilitates transfer learning to unseen building environments. In our setting, a global control policy is learned by aggregating local policies trained on multiple data centers located in different climate zones. The goal of the policy is to minimize energy consumption and maximize thermal comfort. We perform experiments evaluating three different optimizers for local policy training, as well as three different federated learning algorithms against two alternative baselines. Our experiments show that these effects lead to a faster learning speed, as well as greater generalization capabilities in the federated policy compared to any individually trained policy. Furthermore, the learning stability is significantly improved, with the learning process and performance of the federated policy being less sensitive to the choice of parameters and the inherent randomness of reinforcement learning.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Symmetry to Accelerate Learning of Trajectory Tracking Controllers for Free-Flying Robotic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11238v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tracking controllers enable robotic systems to accurately follow planned reference trajectories. In particular, reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in the synthesis of controllers for systems with complex dynamics and modest online compute budgets. However, the poor sample efficiency of RL and the challenges of reward design make training slow and sometimes unstable, especially for high-dimensional systems. In this work, we leverage the inherent Lie group symmetries of robotic systems with a floating base to mitigate these challenges when learning tracking controllers. We model a general tracking problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) that captures the evolution of both the physical and reference states. Next, we prove that symmetry in the underlying dynamics and running costs leads to an MDP homomorphism, a mapping that allows a policy trained on a lower-dimensional "quotient" MDP to be lifted to an optimal tracking controller for the original system. We compare this symmetry-informed approach to an unstructured baseline, using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to learn tracking controllers for three systems: the Particle (a forced point mass), the Astrobee (a fullyactuated space robot), and the Quadrotor (an underactuated system). Results show that a symmetry-aware approach both accelerates training and reduces tracking error at convergence.</description>

      <title>Convex Data-Driven Contraction With Riemannian Metrics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20283v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The growing complexity of dynamical systems and advances in data collection necessitates robust data-driven control strategies without explicit system identification and robust synthesis. Data-driven stability has been explored in linear and nonlinear systems, often by turning the problem into a linear or positive semidefinite program. This paper focuses on a new emerging property called contractivity, which refers to the exponential convergence of all system trajectories toward each other under a specified metric. Data-driven closed loop contractivity has been studied for the case of the 2-norm and assuming nonlinearities are Lipschitz bounded in subsets of n dimensional euclidean space. We extend the analysis by considering Riemannian metrics for polynomial dynamics. The key to our derivation is to leverage the convex criteria for closed-loop contraction and duality results to efficiently check infinite dimensional membership constraints. Numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for both linear and nonlinear systems, highlighting its potential for robust data-driven contraction.</description>

      <title>Design and Implementation of a Dual Uncrewed Surface Vessel Platform for Bathymetry Research under High-flow Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12539v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bathymetry, the study of underwater topography, relies on sonar mapping of submerged structures. These measurements, critical for infrastructure health monitoring, often require expensive instrumentation. The high financial risk associated with sensor damage or vessel loss creates a reluctance to deploy uncrewed surface vessels (USVs) for bathymetry. However, the crewed-boat bathymetry operations, are costly, pose hazards to personnel, and frequently fail to achieve the stable conditions necessary for bathymetry data collection, especially under high currents. Further research is essential to advance autonomous control, navigation, and data processing technologies, with a particular focus on bathymetry. There is a notable lack of accessible hardware platforms that allow for integrated research in both bathymetry-focused autonomous control and navigation, as well as data evaluation and processing. This paper addresses this gap through the design and implementation of two complementary USV systems tailored for uncrewed bathymetry research. This includes a low-cost USV for Navigation And Control research (NAC-USV) and a second, high-end USV equipped with a high-resolution multi-beam sonar and the associated hardware for Bathymetry data quality Evaluation and Post-processing research (BEP-USV). The NAC-USV facilitates the investigation of autonomous, fail-safe navigation and control, emphasizing the stability requirements for high-quality bathymetry data collection while minimizing the risk to equipment. The BEP-USV, which mirrors the NAC-USV hardware, is then used for additional control validation and in-depth exploration of bathymetry data evaluation and post-processing methodologies. We detail the design and implementation of both systems, and open source the design. Furthermore, we demonstrate the system's effectiveness in a range of operational scenarios.</description>

      <title>ADAPT: An Autonomous Forklift for Construction Site Operation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14331v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficient material logistics play a critical role in controlling costs and schedules in the construction industry. However, manual material handling remains prone to inefficiencies, delays, and safety risks. Autonomous forklifts offer a promising solution to streamline on-site logistics, reducing reliance on human operators and mitigating labor shortages. This paper presents the development and evaluation of ADAPT (Autonomous Dynamic All-terrain Pallet Transporter), a fully autonomous off-road forklift designed for construction environments. Unlike structured warehouse settings, construction sites pose significant challenges, including dynamic obstacles, unstructured terrain, and varying weather conditions. To address these challenges, our system integrates AI-driven perception techniques with traditional approaches for decision making, planning, and control, enabling reliable operation in complex environments. We validate the system through extensive real-world testing, comparing its continuous performance against an experienced human operator across various weather conditions. Our findings demonstrate that autonomous outdoor forklifts can operate near human-level performance, offering a viable path toward safer and more efficient construction logistics.</description>

      <title>Asynchronous Push-sum Dual Gradient Algorithm in Distributed Model Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18941v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the distributed model predictive control (DMPC) problem for distributed discrete-time linear systems with both local and global constraints over directed communication networks. We establish an optimization problem to formulate the DMPC policy, including the design of terminal ingredients. To cope with the global constraint, we transform the primal optimization problem into its dual problem. Then, we propose a novel asynchronous push-sum dual gradient (APDG) algorithm with an adaptive step-size scheme to solve this dual problem in a fully asynchronous distributed manner. The proposed algorithm does not require synchronous waiting and any form of coordination, which greatly improves solving efficiency. We theoretically prove that the APDG algorithm converges at an R-linear rate as long as the step-size does not exceed the designed upper bound. Furthermore, we develop a distributed termination criterion to terminate the APDG algorithm when its output solution satisfies the specified suboptimality and the global constraint, thereby avoiding an infinite number of iterations. The recursive feasibility and the stability of the closed-loop system are also established. Finally, a numerical example clarifies and validates theoretical findings.</description>
