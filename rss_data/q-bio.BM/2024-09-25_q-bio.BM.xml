      <title>Oxysterols in Vascular Cells and Role in Atherosclerosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atherosclerosis is a major cardiovascular complication of diseases associated with elevated oxidative stress such as type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome. In these situations, low density lipoproteins (LDL) undergo oxidation. Oxidized LDL display proatherogenic activities through multiple and complex mechanisms which lead to dysfunctions of vascular cells (endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells and macrophages). Oxidized LDL are enriched in oxidized products of cholesterol called oxysterols formed either by autoxidation, enzymatically, or by both mechanisms. Several oxysterols have been shown to accumulate in atheroma plaques and to play a key role in atherogenesis. Depending on the type of oxysterols, various biological effects are exerted on vascular cells to regulate the formation of macrophage foam cells, endothelial integrity, adhesion and transmigration of monocytes, plaque progression and instability. Most of these effects are linked to the ability of oxysterols to induce cellular oxidative stress and cytotoxicity mainly through apoptosis and proinflammatory mediators. Like for excess cholesterol, high density lipoproteins (HDL) can exert antiatherogenic activity stimulating the efflux of oxysterols that have accumulated in foamy macrophages.</description>

      <title>DiffPaSS -- High-performance differentiable pairing of protein sequences using soft scores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying interacting partners from two sets of protein sequences has important applications in computational biology. Interacting partners share similarities across species due to their common evolutionary history, and feature correlations in amino acid usage due to the need to maintain complementary interaction interfaces. Thus, the problem of finding interacting pairs can be formulated as searching for a pairing of sequences that maximizes a sequence similarity or a coevolution score. Several methods have been developed to address this problem, applying different approximate optimization methods to different scores. We introduce DiffPaSS, a differentiable framework for flexible, fast, and hyperparameter-free optimization for pairing interacting biological sequences, which can be applied to a wide variety of scores. We apply it to a benchmark prokaryotic dataset, using mutual information and neighbor graph alignment scores. DiffPaSS outperforms existing algorithms for optimizing the same scores. We demonstrate the usefulness of our paired alignments for the prediction of protein complex structure. DiffPaSS does not require sequences to be aligned, and we also apply it to non-aligned sequences from T cell receptors.</description>

      <title>Structure-based Drug Design with Equivariant Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.13695v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Structure-based drug design (SBDD) aims to design small-molecule ligands that bind with high affinity and specificity to pre-determined protein targets. Generative SBDD methods leverage structural data of drugs in complex with their protein targets to propose new drug candidates. These approaches typically place one atom at a time in an autoregressive fashion using the binding pocket as well as previously added ligand atoms as context in each step. Recently a surge of diffusion generative models has entered this domain which hold promise to capture the statistical properties of natural ligands more faithfully. However, most existing methods focus exclusively on bottom-up de novo design of compounds or tackle other drug development challenges with task-specific models. The latter requires curation of suitable datasets, careful engineering of the models and retraining from scratch for each task. Here we show how a single pre-trained diffusion model can be applied to a broader range of problems, such as off-the-shelf property optimization, explicit negative design, and partial molecular design with inpainting. We formulate SBDD as a 3D-conditional generation problem and present DiffSBDD, an SE(3)-equivariant diffusion model that generates novel ligands conditioned on protein pockets. Our in silico experiments demonstrate that DiffSBDD captures the statistics of the ground truth data effectively. Furthermore, we show how additional constraints can be used to improve the generated drug candidates according to a variety of computational metrics. These results support the assumption that diffusion models represent the complex distribution of structural data more accurately than previous methods, and are able to incorporate additional design objectives and constraints changing nothing but the sampling strategy.</description>

      <title>Protein Conformation Generation via Force-Guided SE(3) Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14088v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The conformational landscape of proteins is crucial to understanding their functionality in complex biological processes. Traditional physics-based computational methods, such as molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, suffer from rare event sampling and long equilibration time problems, hindering their applications in general protein systems. Recently, deep generative modeling techniques, especially diffusion models, have been employed to generate novel protein conformations. However, existing score-based diffusion methods cannot properly incorporate important physical prior knowledge to guide the generation process, causing large deviations in the sampled protein conformations from the equilibrium distribution. In this paper, to overcome these limitations, we propose a force-guided SE(3) diffusion model, ConfDiff, for protein conformation generation. By incorporating a force-guided network with a mixture of data-based score models, ConfDiff can generate protein conformations with rich diversity while preserving high fidelity. Experiments on a variety of protein conformation prediction tasks, including 12 fast-folding proteins and the Bovine Pancreatic Trypsin Inhibitor (BPTI), demonstrate that our method surpasses the state-of-the-art method.</description>
