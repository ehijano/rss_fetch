      <title>Complexity and hardness of random peaked circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Near-term feasibility, classical hardness, and verifiability are the three requirements for demonstrating quantum advantage; most existing quantum advantage proposals achieve at most two. A promising candidate recently proposed is through randomly generated peaked circuits. In this work, we study an explicit construction for random peaked circuits: first selecting a random circuit $C$ of polynomial size, which forms a $k$-design. Subsequently, a second random circuit $C'$ is chosen from the same architecture, subject to a postselection criterion: $C'$ must exhibit a high overlap with $C$ in one of their rows. Utilizing unitary design properties, we demonstrate that the circuits generated by this method are non-trivial; specifically, $C'$ is provably far from $C^\dagger$. Indeed, with overwhelmingly high probability, a random peaked circuit generated this way is non-compressible and is of circuit complexity $\tilde \Omega(nk)$. This resolves an open problem posed by Aaronson in 2022. Secondly, we analytically establish that estimating the peakedness of a random peaked circuit to within a $2^{-\text{poly}(n)}$ additive error, is average-case \#P-hard. When the additive error is relaxed to $1/\text{poly}(n)$, we note that the worst-case scenario for this problem is BQP-complete. Under widely accepted assumptions on random quantum circuits, we identify a regime where no classical polynomial-time sequential simulator attains inverse-polynomial additive accuracy on the peak on a non-negligible fraction of instances. Thirdly, we study using peaked circuits as a practical attempt for a verifiable quantum advantage protocol. While the postselection method for generating peaked circuits could be costly, we demonstrate that numerical search for $C'$ with randomized initialization successfully returns a random peaked circuit, achieving the properties as theoretically predicted.</description>

      <title>Privately Estimating Black-Box Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Standard techniques for differentially private estimation, such as Laplace or Gaussian noise addition, require guaranteed bounds on the sensitivity of the estimator in question. But such sensitivity bounds are often large or simply unknown. Thus we seek differentially private methods that can be applied to arbitrary black-box functions. A handful of such techniques exist, but all are either inefficient in their use of data or require evaluating the function on exponentially many inputs. In this work we present a scheme that trades off between statistical efficiency (i.e., how much data is needed) and oracle efficiency (i.e., the number of evaluations). We also present lower bounds showing the near-optimality of our scheme.</description>

      <title>On Estimating the Quantum Tsallis Relative Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The relative entropy between quantum states quantifies their distinguishability. The estimation of certain relative entropies has been investigated in the literature, e.g., the von Neumann relative entropy and sandwiched R\'enyi relative entropy. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study of the estimation of the quantum Tsallis relative entropy. We show that for any constant $\alpha \in (0, 1)$, the $\alpha$-Tsallis relative entropy between two quantum states of rank $r$ can be estimated with sample complexity $\operatorname{poly}(r)$, which can be made more efficient if we know their state-preparation circuits. As an application, we obtain an approach to tolerant quantum state certification with respect to the quantum Hellinger distance with sample complexity $\widetilde{O}(r^{3.5})$, which exponentially outperforms the folklore approach based on quantum state tomography when $r$ is polynomial in the number of qubits. In addition, we show that the quantum state distinguishability problems with respect to the quantum $\alpha$-Tsallis relative entropy and quantum Hellinger distance are $\mathsf{QSZK}$-complete in a certain regime, and they are $\mathsf{BQP}$-complete in the low-rank case.</description>

      <title>Cubic incompleteness: Hilbert's tenth problem begins at degree three</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a preliminary result addressing a long-standing open question: Are cubic Diophantine equations undecidable?} We answer in the affirmative. By encoding G\"odel's first incompleteness theorem via a Fibonacc-based G\"oodel numbering and the Zeckendorf representation, we reduce the arithmetic complexity sufficiently to construct an explicit \emph{cubic Diophantine equation} whose solvability is independent of a model provided by \emph{Peano axioms}. We present three results. First, a commonsense argument that relies on an unjustified generalization by necessity. Second, a constructive procedure that, given any Turing machine $M$, produces a cubic polynomial $Q_M(\vec{u}) \in \mathbb{Z}[\vec{u}]$ of total degree at most $3$, such that the equation $Q_M(\vec{u}) = 0$ has a solution in $\mathbb{N}^k$ if and only if $M$ halts on empty input. Third, we formalize a thesis concerning bounds.</description>

      <title>Complexity classification of counting graph homomorphisms modulo a prime number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.04086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.04086v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Counting graph homomorphisms and its generalizations such as the Counting Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP), its variations, and counting problems in general have been intensively studied since the pioneering work of Valiant. While the complexity of exact counting of graph homomorphisms (Dyer and Greenhill, 2000) and the counting CSP (Bulatov, 2013, and Dyer and Richerby, 2013) is well understood, counting modulo some natural number has attracted considerable interest as well. In their 2015 paper Faben and Jerrum suggested a conjecture stating that counting homomorphisms to a fixed graph H modulo a prime number is hard whenever it is hard to count exactly, unless H has automorphisms of certain kind. In this paper we confirm this conjecture. As a part of this investigation we develop techniques that widen the spectrum of reductions available for modular counting and apply to the general CSP rather than being limited to graph homomorphisms.</description>

      <title>On the Complexity of Claw-Free Vertex Splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06044v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vertex splitting consists of taking a vertex $v$ in a graph and replacing it with two non-adjacent vertices whose combined neighborhoods is the neighborhood of $v$. The split is said to be exclusive when these neighborhoods are disjoint. In the Claw-Free (Exclusive) Vertex Splitting problem, we are given a graph $G$ and an integer $k$, and we are asked if we can perform at most $k$ (exclusive) vertex splits to obtain a claw-free graph. We consider the complexity of Claw-Free Exclusive Vertex Splitting and prove it to be NP-complete in general, while admitting a polynomial-time algorithm when the input graph has maximum degree 4. This result settles an open problem posed in [Firbas \&amp; Sorge, ISAAC 2024]. We also show that our results can be generalized to $K_{1,c}$-Free Vertex Splitting for all $c \geq 3$.</description>

      <title>A Compendium of Subset Search Problems and Reductions relating to the Parsimonious Property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12255v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This thesis centers around the concept of Subset Search Problems (SSP), a type of computational problem introduced by Gr\"une and Wulf to analyze the complexity of more intricate optimization problems. These problems are given an input set, a so-called universe, and their solution lies within their own universe, e.g. the shortest path between two point is a subset of all possible paths. Due to this, reductions upholding the SSP property require an injective embedding from the universe of the first problem into that of the second. This, however, appears inherently similar to the concept of a Parsimonious reduction, a reduction type requiring a bijective function between the solution spaces of the two problems. Parsimonious reductions are mainly used within the complexity class #P, as this class of problems concerns itself with the number of possible solutions in a given problem. These two concepts, SSP and Parsimonious reductions, are inherently similar but, crucially, not equivalent. We therefore explore the interplay between reductions upholding the SSP and Parsimonious properties, highlighting both the similarities and differences by providing a comprehensive theorem delineating the properties required for reductions to uphold both attributes. We also compile and evaluate 46 reductions between 30 subset search variants of computational problems, including those of classic NP-complete problems such as Satisfiability, Vertex Cover, Hamiltonian Cycle, the Traveling Salesman Problem and Subset Sum, providing reduction proofs, illustrative examples and insights as to where the SSP and Parsimonious properties coexist or diverge. With this compendium we contribute to the understanding of the computational complexity of bilevel and robust optimization problems, by contributing a vast collection of proven SSP- and #P-complete problems.</description>

      <title>Computability of extender sets in multidimensional subshifts: asymptotic growths, dynamical constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07549v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Subshifts are sets of colorings of $\mathbb{Z}^d$ defined by families of forbidden patterns. In a given subshift, the extender set of a finite pattern is the set of all its admissible completions. Since soficity of $\mathbb{Z}$ subshifts is equivalent to having a finite number of extender sets, it had been conjectured that the number of extender sets could provide a way to separate the classes of sofic and effective subshifts in higher dimensions. We investigate some computational characterizations of extender sets in multidimensional subshifts, and in particular their growth, in terms of extender entropies (arXiv:1711.07515) and extender entropy dimensions. We prove here that sofic and effective subshifts have the same possible extender entropies (exactly the $\Pi_3$-computable real numbers of $[0,+\infty)$) and extender entropy dimensions, and investigate the computational complexity of these growth-type quantities under various dynamical and combinatorial constraints.</description>

      <title>The Complexity of Local Stoquastic Hamiltonians on 2D Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14244v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show the 2-Local Stoquastic Hamiltonian problem on a 2D square lattice is StoqMA-complete. We achieve this by extending the spatially sparse circuit construction of Oliveira and Terhal, as well as the perturbative gadgets of Bravyi, DiVincenzo, Oliveira, and Terhal. Our main contributions demonstrate StoqMA circuits can be made spatially sparse and that geometrical, stoquastic-preserving, perturbative gadgets can be constructed.</description>

      <title>Verification power of rational-valued automata with deterministic and affine states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07857v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Previous research has shown that two-way automata with deterministic and affine states have strong verification capabilities, and that this power persists when all transition matrices are restricted to rational values. We investigate rational-valued affine automata as verifiers in Arthur--Merlin proof systems. For one-way verifiers, we give protocols with perfect completeness for two nonregular languages. For two-way verifiers, we first describe a weak protocol that verifies every Turing-recognizable language. We then strengthen this construction with a probabilistic continuation check to obtain strong verification with bounded error, establishing that every language decidable in deterministic exponential space is verifiable in Arthur--Merlin systems by rational-valued two-way affine automata. In a complementary, reduction-based route, we present a Knapsack-game verifier with perfect completeness, which implies that every language in PSPACE admits Arthur--Merlin verification by two-way affine automata with rational transitions. Taken together, these results illuminate the verification power of two-way affine automata while keeping arithmetic fully rational.</description>
