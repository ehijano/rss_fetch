      <title>Dual-energy extraction for proton therapy and imaging: validation on a clinical synchrotron-based facility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this study was to investigate the feasibility of extracting proton beams with two distinct energies within a single synchrotron cycle. The energy difference between the beams should be sufficient to use one beam as a range probe to guide the second therapeutic beam in a synchrotron-based proton therapy facility. A clinical synchrotron-based proton therapy facility with a maximum clinical energy of 250 megaeV (MeV) and an experimental energy capability of 330 MeV was used for the study. The synchrotron's internal diagnostic equipment, including beam orbit monitors, dipole magnetic field sensors, acceleration frequency monitors, and energy measurement devices, was used to characterize the properties of the beams within the synchrotron and during extraction. External dosimetric equipment included a PTW water tank fitted with two ionization chambers and an ionization chamber array. These were used to validate dual-energy extraction at the irradiation isocenter independently. Dual-energy extraction was demonstrated across three defined energy ranges: low (75-110 MeV), intermediate (120-155 MeV), and high (195-230 MeV). Both re-acceleration and de-acceleration modes were tested and validated. This preliminary study achieved an energy difference of 35 MeV between extracted beams across the three evaluated energy ranges. This corresponds to clinical targets used under standard operating conditions and does not require hardware modifications. Future studies should explore adjusting the control software to enable target switching during a single cycle or the use of suboptimal targets for higher-energy beams. This would allow for active, real-time range probing. Combining modified dual-energy extraction parameters with low-intensity extraction for high-energy beams shows great promise in enabling simultaneous proton imaging and therapy within a single synchrotron cycle.</description>

      <title>Optimization Studies of Radiation Shielding for the PIP-II Project at Fermilab</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The PIP-II project at Fermilab, which includes an 800-MeV superconducting LINAC, demands rigorous radiation shielding optimization to meet safety requirements. We updated the MARS geometry model to reflect new magnet and collimator designs and introduced high-resolution detector planes to better capture radiation field distributions. To overcome the significant computational demands, we implemented a well-known branching technique that drastically reduced simulation runtimes while maintaining statistical integrity. This was achieved through particle splitting and the application of Russian Roulette techniques. Additionally, new graphical tools were created to streamline data visualization and MARS code usability.</description>

      <title>Laser Wakefield Acceleration Driven by a Discrete Flying Focus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laser wakefield acceleration (LWFA) may enable the next generation of TeV-scale lepton colliders. Reaching such energies will likely require multiple LWFA stages to overcome limitations on the energy gain achievable in a single stage. The use of stages, however, introduces challenges such as alignment, adiabatic matching between stages, and a lower average accelerating gradient. Here, we propose a discrete flying focus that can deliver higher energy gain in a single stage, thereby reducing the number of stages required for a target energy. A sequence of laser pulses with staggered focal points and delays drives a plasma wave in which an electron beam experiences a near-constant accelerating gradient over distances beyond those attainable with a conventional pulse. Simulations demonstrate that a discrete flying focus with a total energy of 150 J can transfer 40 GeV per electron to a 50-pC beam in a single 30-cm stage, corresponding to 50 dephasing lengths.</description>

      <title>Experimental evidence of muon production from a laser-wakefield accelerator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20904v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on experimental evidence for the generation of directional muons from a laser-wakefield accelerator driven by a PW-class laser. The muons were generated following the interaction of a GeV-scale high-charge electron beam with a 2cm-thick Pb target and were detected using a Timepix3 detector placed behind a suitable shielding configuration. Data analysis indicates a $95\pm3$\% confidence of muon detection over noise, in excellent agreement with numerical modelling. Extrapolation of the experimental setup to higher electron energies and charges suggests the potential to guide approximately $10^4$ muons/s onto cm$^2$-scale areas for applications using a 10 Hz PW laser. These results demonstrate the possibility of muon generation using high-power lasers and establish a foundation for the systematic application of laser-driven high-energy muon beams.</description>

      <title>AI-Assisted Transport of Radioactive Ion Beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06469v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Beams of radioactive heavy ions allow researchers to study rare and unstable atomic nuclei, shedding light into the internal structure of exotic nuclei and on how chemical elements are formed in stars. However, the extraction and transport of radioactive beams rely on time-consuming expert-driven tuning methods, where hundreds of parameters are manually optimized. Here, we introduce a system that employs Artificial Intelligence (AI), specifically utilizing Bayesian Optimization, to assist in the transport process of radioactive beams. We apply our methodology to real-life scenarios showing advantages when compared with standard tuning methods. This AI-assisted approach can be extended to other radioactive beam facilities around the world to improve operational efficiency and enhance scientific output.</description>
