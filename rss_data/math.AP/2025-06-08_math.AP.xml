      <title>Global dynamics above the ground state for the energy-critical Hartree equation with radial data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the concentration-compactness-rigidity argument in \cite{KenM:NLS,KenM:NLW} and the non-degeneracy of the ground state in \cite{LLTX:Nondeg,LLTX:g-Hart,LTX:Nondeg}, long time dynamics for the focusing energy-critical Hartree equation with radial data have been classified when the energy $E(u_0)\leq E(W)$ in \cite{LiMZ:crit Hart,LLTX:g-Hart,MWX:Hart,MXZ:crit Hart:f rad}, where $W$ is the ground state. In this paper, we continue the study on the dynamics of the radial solutions with the energy $E(u_0)$ at most slightly larger than that of the ground states. This is an extension of the results \cite{KriNS:NLW rad, KriNS:NLW non,NakR,NakS:NLKG,NakS:book,NakS:NLS,NakS:NLKG:non,Roy} on NLS, NLW and NLKG, which were pioneered by K. Nakanishi and W. Schlag in \cite{NakS:NLKG, NakS:book} in the study of nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation in the subcritical case. The argument is an adaptation of the works in \cite{KriNS:NLW rad, KriNS:NLW non,NakR,Roy}, the proof uses an analysis of the hyperbolic dynamics near the ground state and the variational structure far from them. The key components that allow to classify the solutions are the hyperbolic (ejection) dynamical behavior near the ground state and the one-pass lemma.</description>

      <title>On the orbital stability of periodic snoidal waves for the $\phi^4-$equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main purpose of this paper is to investigate the global well-posedness and orbital stability of odd periodic traveling waves for the $\phi^4$-equation in the Sobolev space of periodic functions with zero mean. We establish new results on the global well-posedness of weak solutions by combining a semigroup approach with energy estimates. As a consequence, we prove the orbital stability of odd periodic waves by applying a Morse index theorem to the constrained linearized operator defined in the Sobolev space with the zero mean property.</description>

      <title>Existence and uniqueness of classical solution to an initial-boundary value problem for the unsteady general planar Broadwell model with four velocities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the unsteady problem for the general planar Broadwell model with four velocities in a rectangular spatial domain over a finite time interval. We impose a class of non-negative initial and Dirichlet boundary data that are bounded and continuous, along with their first-order partial derivatives. We then prove the existence and uniqueness of a non-negative continuous solution, bounded together with its first-order partial derivatives, to the initial-boundary value problem.</description>

      <title>Quantitative stability control of the full spectrum of the Dirichlet Laplacian by the second eigenvalue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^d$ be an open set of finite measure and let $\Theta$ be a disjoint union of two balls of half measure. We study the stability of the full Dirichlet spectrum of $\Omega$ when its second eigenvalue is close to the second eigenvalue of $\Theta$. Precisely, for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$, we provide a quantitative control of the difference $|\lambda_k(\Omega)-\lambda_k(\Theta)|$ by the variation of the second eigenvalue $C(d,k)(\lambda_2(\Omega)-\lambda_2(\Theta))^\alpha$, for a suitable exponent $\alpha$ and a positive constant $C(d,k)$ depending only on the dimension of the space and the index $k$. We are able to find such an estimate for general $k$ and arbitrary $\Omega$ with $\alpha =\frac{1}{d+1}$. In the particular case when $\lambda_k(\Omega)\geq \lambda_k(\Theta)$, we can improve the inequality and find an estimate with the sharp exponent $\alpha = \frac{1}{2}$.</description>

      <title>Elementary discrete diffusion/redistancing schemes for the mean curvature flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider here a fully discrete and explicit scheme for the mean curvature flow of boundaries, based on an elementary diffusion step and a precise redistancing operation. We give an elementary convergence proof for the scheme under the standard CFL condition $h\sim\varepsilon^2$, where $h$ is the time discretization step and $\varepsilon$ the space step. We discuss extensions to more general convolution/redistancing schemes.</description>

      <title>Variational Nonlinear and Nonlocal Curvature Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the minimizing movements scheme \'a la Almgren-Taylor-Wang converges towards level-set solutions to a nonlinear version of nonlocal curvature flows with time-depending forcing term, in the rather general framework of variational curvatures introduced in \cite{ChaMorPon15}. The nonlinearity involved is assumed to satisfy minimal assumptions, namely continuity, monotonicity, and vanishing at zero. Under additional assumptions only on the curvatures involved, we establish uniqueness for level-set solutions.</description>

      <title>Orbital Stability of Plane Waves in the Klein-Gordon Equation against Localized Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the stability and long-term behavior of spatially periodic plane waves in the complex Klein-Gordon equation under localized perturbations. Such perturbations render the wave neither localized nor periodic, placing its stability analysis outside the scope of the classical orbital stability theory for Hamiltonian systems developed by Grillakis, Shatah, and Strauss. Inspired by Zhidkov's work on the stability of time-periodic, spatially homogeneous states in the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation, we develop an alternative method that relies on an amplitude-phase decomposition and leverages conserved quantities tailored to the perturbation equation. We establish an orbital stability result of plane waves that is locally uniform in space, accommodating $L^2$-localized perturbations as well as nonlocalized phase modulations. In certain regimes, our method even allows for unbounded modulations. Our result is sharp in the sense that it holds up to the spectral stability boundary.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of rotationally invariant polynomial root sets under iterated differentiations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We associate to an $N$-sample of a given rotationally invariant probability measure $\mu_0$ with compact support in the complex plane, a polynomial $P_N$ with roots given by the sample. Then, for $t \in (0,1)$, we consider the empirical measure $\mu_t^{N}$ associated to the root set of the $\lfloor t N\rfloor$-th derivative of $P_N$.
  A question posed by O'Rourke and Steinerberger \cite{o2021nonlocal}, reformulated as a conjecture by Hoskins and Kabluchko \cite{hoskins2021dynamics}, and recently reaffirmed by Campbell, O'Rourke and Renfrew \cite{campbell2024fractional}, states that under suitable conditions of regularity on $\mu_0$, for an i.i.d. sample,
  $\mu_t^{N}$ converges to a rotationally invariant probability measure $\mu_t$ when $N$ tends to infinity, and that $(1-t)\mu_t$ has a radial density
  $x \mapsto \psi(x,t)$ satisfying the following partial differential equation:
  \begin{equation} \label{PDErotational}
  \frac{ \partial \psi(x,t) }{\partial t} = \frac{ \partial}{\partial x} \left( \frac{ \psi(x,t) }{ \frac{1}{x} \int_0^x \psi(y,t) dy } \right),
  \end{equation} In \cite{hoskins2021dynamics}, this equation is reformulated as an equation on the distribution function $\Psi_t$ of the radial part of $(1-t) \mu_t$: \begin{equation} \label{equationPsixtabstract} \frac{\partial \Psi_t (x)}{\partial t} = x \frac{\frac{\partial \Psi_t (x)}{\partial x} } {\Psi_t(x)} - 1. \end{equation} Restricting our study to a specific family of $N$-samplings, we are able to prove a variant of the conjecture above. We also emphasize the important differences between the two-dimensional setting and the one-dimensional setting, illustrated in our Theorem \ref{monotonicity}.</description>

      <title>Spreading properties in Kermack-McKendrick models with nonlocal spatial interactions -- A new look</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.11873v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we revisit the famous Kermack-McKendrick model with nonlocal spatial interactions by shedding new lights on associated spreading properties and we also prove the existence and uniqueness of traveling fronts. Unlike previous studies that have focused on integrated versions of the model for susceptible population, we analyze the long time dynamics of the underlying age-structured model for the cumulative density of infected individuals and derive precise asymptotic behavior for the infected population. Our approach consists in studying the long time dynamics of an associated transport equation with nonlocal spatial interactions whose spreading properties are close to those of classical Fisher-KPP reaction-diffusion equations. Our study is self-contained and relies on comparison arguments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.00545v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain the inequalities of the form $$\int_{\Omega}|\nabla u(x)|^2h(u(x))\,{\rm d} x\leq C\int_{\Omega} \left( \sqrt{ |P u(x)||{\cal T}_{H}(u(x))|}\right)^{2}h(u(x))\,{\rm d} x +\Theta,$$ where $\Omega\subset \mathbf{R}^n$ is a bounded Lipschitz domain, $u\in W^{2,1}_{\rm loc}(\Omega)$ is non-negative, $P$ is a uniformly elliptic operator in non-divergent form, ${\cal T}_{H}(\cdot )$ is certain transformation of the monotone $C^1$ function $H(\cdot)$, which is the primitive of the weight $h(\cdot)$, and $\Theta$ is the boundary term which depends on boundary values of $u$ and $\nabla u$, which hold under some additional assumptions. Our results are linked to some results from probability and potential theories, e.g.~to some variants of the Douglas formulae.</description>

      <title>A priori estimates and a blow-up criterion for the incompressible ideal MHD equations with surface tension and a closed free surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09473v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish the a priori estimates and prove a blow-up criterion for the three-dimensional free boundary incompressible ideal magnetohydrodynamics equations. The fluid occupies a bounded region with a free boundary that is a closed surface, without assumptions of simple connectedness or periodicity of the region (thus, Fourier transforms cannot be applied), nor the graph assumption for the free boundary. The fluid is under the influence of surface tension, and flattening the boundaries using local coordinates is insufficient to resolve this problem. This is because local coordinates fail to preserve curvature, as the mean curvature of a flat boundary degenerates to zero. To address these challenges and circumvent the intricate issue of spatial regularity in Lagrangian coordinates, we utilize reference surfaces to represent the free boundary and develop new energy functionals that both preserve the material derivative and incorporate spatial-temporal scaling $\partial_t \sim \nabla^{\frac{3}{2}}$ in Eulerian coordinates. This method enables us to establish both low-order and high-order regularity estimates without any loss of regularity. More importantly, we prove a blow-up criterion and provide a complete classification of blow-ups, including the self-intersection of the free boundary (which the graph assumption cannot handle), the breakdown of the mean curvature, and the blow-up of the normal velocity (which Lagrangian coordinates fail to capture). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result addressing the a priori estimates and the blow-up criterion for free boundary problems with surface tension in general regions.</description>

      <title>Some Comparison Results for First-Order Hamilton-Jacobi Equations and Second-Order Fully Nonlinear Parabolic Equations with Ventcell Boundary Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01899v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we consider fully nonlinear, possibly degenerate, parabolic equations associated with Ventcell boundary conditions in bounded or unbounded, smooth domains. We first analyze the exact form of such boundary conditions in general domains in order that the notion of viscosity solutions makes sense. Then we prove general comparison results, both for first- and second-order equations, under rather natural assumptions on the nonlinearities: $(i)$ in the second-order case, the only restrictive assumption is that the equation has to be strictly elliptic in the normal direction, in a neighborhood of the boundary; $(ii)$ in the first-order one, quasiconvexity assumptions have to be imposed both on the equation and the boundary condition, the equation being coercive in the normal direction. Our method is inspired by the ``twin blow-up method'' of Forcadel-Imbert-Monneau, that we adapt to a scaling consistent with the Ventcell boundary condition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14079v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Plasma sheaths are inhomogeneous stationary states that form when a plasma is in contact with an absorbing wall. We prove linear and non linear stability of a kinetic sheath stationary state for a Vlasov-Poisson type system in a bounded interval. Notably, in the linear setting, we obtain exponential decay of the fluctuation provided the rate of injection of particles at equilibrium is smaller than the rate of absorption at the wall. In the non linear setting, we prove a similar result for small enough equilibrium and small localized perturbation of the equilibrium.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09924v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we present the symmetry of weak solutions to a mixed local-nonlocal singular problem. We also establish results related to the existence, nonexistence, and regularity of weak solutions to a mixed local-nonlocal singular jumping problem. A crucial element in proving our main results is the variational characterization of the solutions, which also reveals the decomposition property. This decomposition property, together with comparison principles and the moving plane method, yields the symmetry result. Additionally, we utilize nonsmooth critical point theory alongside the variational characterization to analyze the jumping problem.</description>

      <title>The Klein-Gordon equation on asymptotically Minkowski spacetimes: causal propagators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01134v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct the causal (forward/backward) propagators for the massive Klein-Gordon equation perturbed by a first order operator which decays in space but not necessarily in time. In particular, we obtain global estimates for forward/backward solutions to the inhomogeneous, perturbed Klein-Gordon equation, including in the presence of bound states of the limiting spatial Hamiltonians.
  To this end, we prove propagation of singularities estimates in all regions of infinity (spatial, null, and causal) and use the estimates to prove that the Klein-Gordon operator is an invertible mapping between adapted weighted Sobolev spaces. This builds off work of Vasy in which inverses of hyperbolic PDEs are obtained via construction of a Fredholm mapping problem using radial points propagation estimates. To deal with the presence of a perturbation which persists in time, we employ a class of pseudodifferential operators first explored in Vasy's many-body work.</description>

      <title>Boundary regularity for the distance functions, and the eikonal equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01774v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the gain in regularity of the distance to the boundary of a domain in $\mathbb R^m$. In particular, we show that if the signed distance function happens to be merely differentiable in a neighborhood of a boundary point, it and the boundary have to be $\mathcal C^{1,1}$ regular. Conversely, we study the regularity of the distance function under regularity hypotheses of the boundary. Along the way, we point out that any solution to the eikonal equation, differentiable everywhere in a domain of the Euclidean space, admits a gradient which is locally Lipschitz.</description>

      <title>Non-Smooth Solutions of the Navier-Stokes Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09261v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-smooth Leray-Hopf solutions of the Navier-Stokes equation are constructed. The construction occurs in a finite periodic volume $\mathbb{T}^3$. The entropyp roduction maximizing solutions are selected.
  Part I of this paper defines the entropy principle and using it, finds improved regularity for the Navier-Stokes solutions.
  Part II concerns initial data and its achievability as a limit of the small time data.
  Part III establishes analyticity properties of the Part II solution; Part IV demonstrates blowup in finite time.</description>

      <title>Stability and minimality of the ball for attractive-repulsive energies with perimeter penalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09406v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider perimeter perturbations of a class of attractive-repulsive energies, given by the sum of two nonlocal interactions with power-law kernels, defined over sets with fixed measure. We prove that there exists curves in the perturbation-volume parameters space that separate stability/instability and global minimality/non-minimality regions of the ball, and provide a precise description of these curves for certain interaction kernels. In particular, we show that in small perturbation regimes there are (at least) two disconnected regions for the mass parameter in which the ball is stable, separated by an instability region.</description>

      <title>Existence of a bi-radial sign-changing solution for Hardy-Sobolev-Mazya type equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14224v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we study the following Hardy-Sobolev-Maz'ya type equation:
  \begin{equation}
  -\Delta u - \mu \frac{u}{|z|^2} = \frac{|u|^{q-2}u}{|z|^t}, \quad u \in D^{1,2} (\mathbb{R}^n),
  \end{equation}
  where $x = (y,z) \in \mathbb{R}^h \times \mathbb{R}^k = \mathbb{R}^n$, with $n \geq 5$, $2 &lt; k &lt;n$, and $t = n - \frac{(n-2)q}{2}$. We establish the existence of a bi-radial sign-changing solution under the assumptions $0 \leq \mu &lt; \frac{(k-2)^2}{4}, \, 2 &lt; q &lt;2^* = \frac{2(n-k+1)}{n-k-1}$. We approach the problem by lifting it to the hyperbolic setting, leading to the equation: $-\Delta_{\mathbb{B}^N} u \, - \, \lambda u = |u|^{p-1}u, \; u \in H^1(\mathbb{B}^N)$, $\mathbb{B}^N$ is the hyperbolic ball model. We study the existence of a sign-changing solution with suitable symmetry by constructing an appropriate invariant subspace of $H^1(\mathbb{B}^N)$ and applying the concentration compactness principle, and the corresponding solution of the Hardy-Sobolev-Maz'ya type equation becomes bi-radial under the corresponding isometry.</description>

      <title>Third order corrections to the ground state energy of a Bose gas in the Gross-Pitaevskii regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07433v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a translation invariant system of $N$ bosons in the Gross-Pitaevskii regime, we establish a precise bound for the ground state energy $E_N$. While the leading, order $N$, contribution to $E_N$ has been known since [30,28] and the second order corrections (of order one) have been first determined in [5], our estimate also resolves the next term in the asymptotic expansion of $E_N$, which is of the order $(\log N) / N$.</description>
