      <title>Adding numbers with spiking neural circuits on neuromorphic hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Progress in neuromorphic computing requires efficient implementation of standard computational problems, like adding numbers. Here we implement one sequential and two parallel binary adders in the Lava software framework, and deploy them to the neuromorphic chip Loihi 2. We describe the time complexity, neuron and synaptic resources, as well as constraints on the bit width of the numbers that can be added with the current implementations. Further, we measure the time required for the addition operation on-chip. Importantly, we encounter trade-offs in terms of time complexity and required chip resources for the three considered adders. While sequential adders have linear time complexity $\bf\mathcal{O}(n)$ and require a linearly increasing number of neurons and synapses with number of bits $n$, the parallel adders have constant time complexity $\bf\mathcal{O}(1)$ and also require a linearly increasing number of neurons, but nonlinearly increasing synaptic resources (scaling with $\bf n^2$ or $\bf n \sqrt{n}$). This trade-off between compute time and chip resources may inform decisions in application development, and the implementations we provide may serve as a building block for further progress towards efficient neuromorphic algorithms.</description>

      <title>Learning richness modulates equality reasoning in neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Equality reasoning is ubiquitous and purely abstract: sameness or difference may be evaluated no matter the nature of the underlying objects. As a result, same-different tasks (SD) have been extensively studied as a starting point for understanding abstract reasoning in humans and across animal species. With the rise of neural networks (NN) that exhibit striking apparent proficiency for abstractions, equality reasoning in NNs has also gained interest. Yet despite extensive study, conclusions about equality reasoning vary widely and with little consensus. To clarify the underlying principles in learning SD, we develop a theory of equality reasoning in multi-layer perceptrons (MLP). Following observations in comparative psychology, we propose a spectrum of behavior that ranges from conceptual to perceptual outcomes. Conceptual behavior is characterized by task-specific representations, efficient learning, and insensitivity to spurious perceptual details. Perceptual behavior is characterized by strong sensitivity to spurious perceptual details, accompanied by the need for exhaustive training to learn the task. We develop a mathematical theory to show that an MLP's behavior is driven by learning richness. Rich-regime MLPs exhibit conceptual behavior, whereas lazy-regime MLPs exhibit perceptual behavior. We validate our theoretical findings in vision SD experiments, showing that rich feature learning promotes success by encouraging hallmarks of conceptual behavior. Overall, our work identifies feature learning richness as a key parameter modulating equality reasoning, and suggests that equality reasoning in humans and animals may similarly depend on learning richness in neural circuits.</description>

      <title>DTA: Dual Temporal-channel-wise Attention for Spiking Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) present a more energy-efficient alternative to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) by harnessing spatio-temporal dynamics and event-driven spikes. Effective utilization of temporal information is crucial for SNNs, leading to the exploration of attention mechanisms to enhance this capability. Conventional attention operations either apply identical operation or employ non-identical operations across target dimensions. We identify that these approaches provide distinct perspectives on temporal information. To leverage the strengths of both operations, we propose a novel Dual Temporal-channel-wise Attention (DTA) mechanism that integrates both identical/non-identical attention strategies. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to concentrate on both the correlation and dependency of temporal-channel using both identical and non-identical attention operations. Experimental results demonstrate that the DTA mechanism achieves state-of-the-art performance on both static datasets (CIFAR10, CIFAR100, ImageNet-1k) and dynamic dataset (CIFAR10-DVS), elevating spike representation and capturing complex temporal-channel relationship. We open-source our code: https://github.com/MnJnKIM/DTA-SNN.</description>

      <title>ST-FlowNet: An Efficient Spiking Neural Network for Event-Based Optical Flow Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have emerged as a promising tool for event-based optical flow estimation tasks due to their ability to leverage spatio-temporal information and low-power capabilities. However, the performance of SNN models is often constrained, limiting their application in real-world scenarios. In this work, we address this gap by proposing a novel neural network architecture, ST-FlowNet, specifically tailored for optical flow estimation from event-based data. The ST-FlowNet architecture integrates ConvGRU modules to facilitate cross-modal feature augmentation and temporal alignment of the predicted optical flow, improving the network's ability to capture complex motion dynamics. Additionally, to overcome the challenges associated with training SNNs, we introduce a novel approach to derive SNN models from pre-trained artificial neural networks (ANNs) through ANN-to-SNN conversion or our proposed BISNN method. Notably, the BISNN method alleviates the complexities involved in biological parameter selection, further enhancing the robustness of SNNs in optical flow estimation tasks. Extensive evaluations on three benchmark event-based datasets demonstrate that the SNN-based ST-FlowNet model outperforms state-of-the-art methods, delivering superior performance in accurate optical flow estimation across a diverse range of dynamic visual scenes. Furthermore, the inherent energy efficiency of SNN models is highlighted, establishing a compelling advantage for their practical deployment. Overall, our work presents a novel framework for optical flow estimation using SNNs and event-based data, contributing to the advancement of neuromorphic vision applications.</description>

      <title>Towards Constraint-Based Adaptive Hypergraph Learning for Solving Vehicle Routing: An End-to-End Solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The application of learning based methods to vehicle routing problems has emerged as a pivotal area of research in combinatorial optimization. These problems are characterized by vast solution spaces and intricate constraints, making traditional approaches such as exact mathematical models or heuristic methods prone to high computational overhead or reliant on the design of complex heuristic operators to achieve optimal or near optimal solutions. Meanwhile, although some recent learning-based methods can produce good performance for VRP with straightforward constraint scenarios, they often fail to effectively handle hard constraints that are common in practice. This study introduces a novel end-to-end framework that combines constraint-oriented hypergraphs with reinforcement learning to address vehicle routing problems. A central innovation of this work is the development of a constraint-oriented dynamic hyperedge reconstruction strategy within an encoder, which significantly enhances hypergraph representation learning. Additionally, the decoder leverages a double-pointer attention mechanism to iteratively generate solutions. The proposed model is trained by incorporating asynchronous parameter updates informed by hypergraph constraints and optimizing a dual loss function comprising constraint loss and policy gradient loss. The experiment results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach not only eliminates the need for sophisticated heuristic operators but also achieves substantial improvements in solution quality.</description>

      <title>Populating cellular metamaterials on the extrema of attainable elasticity through neuroevolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11112v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The trade-offs between different mechanical properties of materials pose fundamental challenges in engineering material design, such as balancing stiffness versus toughness, weight versus energy-absorbing capacity, and among the various elastic coefficients. Although gradient-based topology optimization approaches have been effective in finding specific designs and properties, they are not efficient tools for surveying the vast design space of metamaterials, and thus unable to reveal the attainable bound of interdependent material properties. Other common methods, such as parametric design or data-driven approaches, are limited by either the lack of diversity in geometry or the difficulty to extrapolate from known data, respectively. In this work, we formulate the simultaneous exploration of multiple competing material properties as a multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem and employ a neuroevolution algorithm to efficiently solve it. The Compositional Pattern-Producing Networks (CPPNs) is used as the generative model for unit cell designs, which provide very compact yet lossless encoding of geometry. A modified Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) algorithm is employed to evolve the CPPNs such that they create metamaterial designs on the Pareto front of the MOO problem, revealing empirical bounds of different combinations of elastic properties. Looking ahead, our method serves as a universal framework for the computational discovery of diverse metamaterials across a range of fields, including robotics, biomedicine, thermal engineering, and photonics.</description>

      <title>The Society of HiveMind: Multi-Agent Optimization of Foundation Model Swarms to Unlock the Potential of Collective Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05473v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-agent systems address issues of accessibility and scalability of artificial intelligence (AI) foundation models, which are often represented by large language models. We develop a framework - the "Society of HiveMind" (SOHM) - that orchestrates the interaction between multiple AI foundation models, imitating the observed behavior of animal swarms in nature by following modern evolutionary theories. On the one hand, we find that the SOHM provides a negligible benefit on tasks that mainly require real-world knowledge. On the other hand, we remark a significant improvement on tasks that require intensive logical reasoning, indicating that multi-agent systems are capable of increasing the reasoning capabilities of the collective compared to the individual agents. Our findings demonstrate the potential of combining a multitude of diverse AI foundation models to form an artificial swarm intelligence capable of self-improvement through interactions with a given environment.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Recommendation System in E-commerce using Passer learning optimization based on Bi-LSTM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.00137v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Online reviews play a crucial role in shaping consumer decisions, especially in the context of e-commerce. However, the quality and reliability of these reviews can vary significantly. Some reviews contain misleading or unhelpful information, such as advertisements, fake content, or irrelevant details. These issues pose significant challenges for recommendation systems, which rely on user-generated reviews to provide personalized suggestions. This article introduces a recommendation system based on Passer Learning Optimization-enhanced Bi-LSTM classifier applicable to e-commerce recommendation systems with improved accuracy and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art models. It achieves as low as 1.24% MSE on the baby dataset. This lifts it as high as 88.58%. Besides, there is also robust performance of the system on digital music and patio lawn garden datasets at F1 of 88.46% and 92.51%, correspondingly. These results, made possible by advanced graph embedding for effective knowledge extraction and fine-tuning of classifier parameters, establish the suitability of the proposed model in various e-commerce environments.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Recurrent Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.04830v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a biologically plausible RL framework for solving tasks in partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs). The proposed algorithm combines three integral parts: (1) A Meta-RL architecture, resembling the mammalian basal ganglia; (2) A biologically plausible reinforcement learning algorithm, exploiting temporal difference learning and eligibility traces to train the policy and the value-function; (3) An online automatic differentiation algorithm for computing the gradients with respect to parameters of a shared recurrent network backbone. Our experimental results show that the method is capable of solving a diverse set of partially observable reinforcement learning tasks. The algorithm we call real-time recurrent reinforcement learning (RTRRL) serves as a model of learning in biological neural networks, mimicking reward pathways in the basal ganglia.</description>

      <title>Three tiers of computation in transformers and in brain architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04848v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Human language and logic abilities are computationally quantified within the well-studied grammar-automata hierarchy. We identify three hierarchical tiers and two corresponding transitions and show their correspondence to specific abilities in transformer-based language models (LMs). These emergent abilities have often been described in terms of scaling; we show that it is the transition between tiers, rather than scaled size itself, that determines a system's capabilities. Specifically, humans effortlessly process language yet require critical training to perform arithmetic or logical reasoning tasks; and LMs possess language abilities absent from predecessor systems, yet still struggle with logical processing. We submit a novel benchmark of computational power, provide empirical evaluations of humans and fifteen LMs, and, most significantly, provide a theoretically grounded framework to promote careful thinking about these crucial topics. The resulting principled analyses provide explanatory accounts of the abilities and shortfalls of LMs, and suggest actionable insights into the expansion of their logic abilities.</description>
