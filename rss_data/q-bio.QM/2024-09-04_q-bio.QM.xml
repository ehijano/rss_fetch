      <title>ProteinRPN: Towards Accurate Protein Function Prediction with Graph-Based Region Proposals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protein function prediction is a crucial task in bioinformatics, with significant implications for understanding biological processes and disease mechanisms. While the relationship between sequence and function has been extensively explored, translating protein structure to function continues to present substantial challenges. Various models, particularly, CNN and graph-based deep learning approaches that integrate structural and functional data, have been proposed to address these challenges. However, these methods often fall short in elucidating the functional significance of key residues essential for protein functionality, as they predominantly adopt a retrospective perspective, leading to suboptimal performance.
  Inspired by region proposal networks in computer vision, we introduce the Protein Region Proposal Network (ProteinRPN) for accurate protein function prediction. Specifically, the region proposal module component of ProteinRPN identifies potential functional regions (anchors) which are refined through the hierarchy-aware node drop pooling layer favoring nodes with defined secondary structures and spatial proximity. The representations of the predicted functional nodes are enriched using attention mechanisms and subsequently fed into a Graph Multiset Transformer, which is trained with supervised contrastive (SupCon) and InfoNCE losses on perturbed protein structures. Our model demonstrates significant improvements in predicting Gene Ontology (GO) terms, effectively localizing functional residues within protein structures. The proposed framework provides a robust, scalable solution for protein function annotation, advancing the understanding of protein structure-function relationships in computational biology.</description>

      <title>Associations between exposure to OPEs and rheumatoid arthritis risk among adults in NHANES, 2011-2018</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has an intricate etiology that includes environmental factors as well as genetics. Organophosphate esters (OPEs) are frequently used as chemical additives in many personal care products and household items. However, there has been limited research on their potential effects on rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The specific associations between OPEs and RA remain largely unexplored. This study investigates any potential associations between adult rheumatoid arthritis risk and exposure to OPEs. We investigated data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2011-2018 among participants over 20 years old. In two models, multivariable logistic regression was utilized to investigate the relationship between exposure to OPEs and RA. Furthermore, subgroup analyses stratified by age, gender, and dose exposure response were evaluated. Generalized additive models and smooth curve fits were used to characterize the nonlinear relationship between RA and OPEs. In conclusion, 5490 individuals (RA: 319, Non-RA: 5171) were analyzed. Higher quantiles (Q4) of DPHP and DBUP showed a higher prevalence of RA than the lowest quantiles. Our findings show that adult RA prevalence is higher in those who have been exposed to OPEs (DPHP, DBUP). These correlations seem to be stronger among women, the elderly, those with higher BMIs, and those who have diabetes. The dose-response curve for DPHP and DBUP demonstrated an upward-sloping trend. In contrast, BCEP and BCPP showed a U-shaped relationship and an inverted U-shaped relationship with the probability of RA. BDCPP demonstrates a complex relationship with a peak at lower concentrations followed by a decrease. Our study concludes that exposure to OPEs plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of RA.</description>

      <title>Exploring Neurofunctional Phase Transition Patterns in Autism Spectrum Disorder: A Thermodynamics Parameters Analysis Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing network parameters that can effectively represent complex networks is of significant importance for the analysis of time-varying complex networks. This paper introduces a novel thermodynamic framework for analyzing complex networks, focusing on Spectral Core Entropy (SCE), Node Energy, internal energy and temperature to measure structural changes in dynamic complex network. This framework provides a quantitative representation of network characteristics, capturing time-varying structural changes. We apply this framework to study brain activity in autism versus control subjects, illustrating its potential to identify significant structural changes and brain state transitions. By treating brain networks as thermodynamic systems, important parameters such as node energy and temperature are derived to depict brain activities. Our research has found that in our designed framework the thermodynamic parameter-temperature, is significantly correlated with the transitions of brain states. Statistical tests confirm the effectiveness of our approach. Moreover, our study demonstrates that node energy effectively captures the activity levels of brain regions and reveals biologically proven differences between autism patients and controls, offering a powerful tool for exploring the characteristics of complex networks in various applications.</description>

      <title>MRI-based and metabolomics-based age scores act synergetically for mortality prediction shown by multi-cohort federated learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biological age scores are an emerging tool to characterize aging by estimating chronological age based on physiological biomarkers. Various scores have shown associations with aging-related outcomes. This study assessed the relation between an age score based on brain MRI images (BrainAge) and an age score based on metabolomic biomarkers (MetaboAge). We trained a federated deep learning model to estimate BrainAge in three cohorts. The federated BrainAge model yielded significantly lower error for age prediction across the cohorts than locally trained models. Harmonizing the age interval between cohorts further improved BrainAge accuracy. Subsequently, we compared BrainAge with MetaboAge using federated association and survival analyses. The results showed a small association between BrainAge and MetaboAge as well as a higher predictive value for the time to mortality of both scores combined than for the individual scores. Hence, our study suggests that both aging scores capture different aspects of the aging process.</description>

      <title>Bumblebees Exhibit Adaptive Flapping Responses to Air Disturbances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Insects excel in trajectory and attitude handling during flight, yet the specific kinematic behaviours they use for maintaining stability in air disturbances are not fully understood. This study investigates the adaptive strategies of bumblebees when exposed to gust disturbances directed from three different angles within a plane cross-sectional to their flight path. By analyzing characteristic wing motions during gust traversal, we aim to uncover the mechanisms that enable bumblebees to maintain control in unsteady environments. We utilised high-speed cameras to capture detailed flight paths, allowing us to extract dynamic information. Our results reveal that bees make differential bilateral kinematic adjustments based on gust direction: sideward gusts elicit posterior shifts in the wing closest to the gust, while upward gusts trigger coordinated posterior shifts in both wings. Downward gusts prompted broader flapping and increased flapping frequencies, along with variations in flap timing and sweep angle. Stroke sweep angle was a primary factor influencing recovery responses, coupled with motion around the flap axis. The adaptive behaviours strategically position the wings to optimize gust reception and enhance wing-generated forces. These strategies can be distilled into specific behavioural patterns for analytical modelling to inform the design of robotic flyers. We observed a characteristic posterior shift of wings when particular counteractive manoeuvres were required. This adjustment reduced the portion of the stroke during which the wing receiving gust forces was positioned in front of the centre of gravity, potentially enhancing manoeuvrability and enabling more effective recovery manoeuvres. These findings deepen our understanding of insect flight dynamics and offer promising strategies for enhancing the stability and manoeuvrability of MAVs in turbulent environments.</description>

      <title>Taming Randomness in Agent-Based Models using Common Random Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Random numbers are at the heart of every agent-based model (ABM) of health and disease. By representing each individual in a synthetic population, agent-based models enable detailed analysis of intervention impact and parameter sensitivity. Yet agent-based modeling has a fundamental signal-to-noise problem, in which small differences between simulations cannot be reliably differentiated from stochastic noise resulting from misaligned random number realizations. We introduce a novel methodology that eliminates noise due to misaligned random numbers, a first for agent-based modeling. Our approach enables meaningful individual-level analysis between ABM scenarios because all differences are driven by mechanistic effects rather than random number noise. A key result is that many fewer simulations are needed for some applications. We demonstrate the benefits of our approach on three disparate examples and discuss limitations.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Quantification of Antibody Measurements: Physical Principles and Implications for Standardization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Harmonizing serology measurements is critical for identifying reference materials that permit standardization and comparison of results across different diagnostic platforms. However, the theoretical foundations of such tasks have yet to be fully explored in the context of antibody thermodynamics and uncertainty quantification (UQ). This has restricted the usefulness of standards currently deployed and limited the scope of materials considered as viable reference material. To address these problems, we develop rigorous theories of antibody normalization and harmonization, as well as formulate a probabilistic framework for defining correlates of protection. We begin by proposing a mathematical definition of harmonization equipped with structure needed to quantify uncertainty associated with the choice of standard, assay, etc. We then show how a thermodynamic description of serology measurements (i) relates this structure to the Gibbs free-energy of antibody binding, and thereby (ii) induces a regression analysis that directly harmonizes measurements. We supplement this with a novel, optimization-based normalization (not harmonization!) method that checks for consistency between reference and sample dilution curves. Last, we relate these analyses to uncertainty propagation techniques to estimate correlates of protection. A key result of these analyses is that under physically reasonable conditions, the choice of reference material does not increase uncertainty associated with harmonization or correlates of protection. We provide examples and validate main ideas in the context of an interlab study that lays the foundation for using monoclonal antibodies as a reference for SARS-CoV-2 serology measurements.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models-Enabled Digital Twins for Precision Medicine in Rare Gynecological Tumors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rare gynecological tumors (RGTs) present major clinical challenges due to their low incidence and heterogeneity. The lack of clear guidelines leads to suboptimal management and poor prognosis. Molecular tumor boards accelerate access to effective therapies by tailoring treatment based on biomarkers, beyond cancer type. Unstructured data that requires manual curation hinders efficient use of biomarker profiling for therapy matching. This study explores the use of large language models (LLMs) to construct digital twins for precision medicine in RGTs.
  Our proof-of-concept digital twin system integrates clinical and biomarker data from institutional and published cases (n=21) and literature-derived data (n=655 publications with n=404,265 patients) to create tailored treatment plans for metastatic uterine carcinosarcoma, identifying options potentially missed by traditional, single-source analysis. LLM-enabled digital twins efficiently model individual patient trajectories. Shifting to a biology-based rather than organ-based tumor definition enables personalized care that could advance RGT management and thus enhance patient outcomes.</description>

      <title>Adapting Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Bifurcation Detection in Ecological Migration Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the application of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to the analysis of bifurcation phenomena in ecological migration models. By integrating the fundamental principles of diffusion-advection-reaction equations with deep learning techniques, we address the complexities of species migration dynamics, particularly focusing on the detection and analysis of Hopf bifurcations. Traditional numerical methods for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) often involve intricate calculations and extensive computational resources, which can be restrictive in high-dimensional problems. In contrast, PINNs offer a more flexible and efficient alternative, bypassing the need for grid discretization and allowing for mesh-free solutions. Our approach leverages the DeepXDE framework, which enhances the computational efficiency and applicability of PINNs in solving high-dimensional PDEs. We validate our results against conventional methods and demonstrate that PINNs not only provide accurate bifurcation predictions but also offer deeper insights into the underlying dynamics of diffusion processes. Despite these advantages, the study also identifies challenges such as the high computational costs and the sensitivity of PINN performance to network architecture and hyperparameter settings. Future work will focus on optimizing these algorithms and expanding their application to other complex systems involving bifurcations. The findings from this research have significant implications for the modeling and analysis of ecological systems, providing a powerful tool for predicting and understanding complex dynamical behaviors.</description>

      <title>Living porous ceramics for bacteria-regulated gas sensing and carbon capture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microorganisms hosted in abiotic structures have led to engineered living materials that can grow, sense and adapt in ways that mimic biological systems. Although porous structures should favor colonization by microorganisms, they have not yet been exploited as abiotic scaffolds for the development of living materials. Here, we report porous ceramics that are colonized by bacteria to form an engineered living material with self-regulated and genetically programmable carbon capture and gas-sensing functionalities. The carbon capture capability is achieved using wild-type photosynthetic cyanobacteria, whereas the gas-sensing function is generated utilizing genetically engineered E. coli. Hierarchical porous clay is used as ceramic scaffold and evaluated in terms of bacterial growth, water uptake and mechanical properties. Using state-of-the-art chemical analysis techniques, we demonstrate the ability of the living porous ceramics to capture CO2 directly from the air and to metabolically turn minute amounts of a toxic gas into a benign scent detectable by humans.</description>

      <title>Algebraic and diagrammatic methods for the rule-based modeling of multi-particle complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The formation, dissolution, and dynamics of multi-particle complexes is of fundamental interest in the study of stochastic chemical systems. In 1976, Masao Doi introduced a Fock space formalism for modeling classical particles. Doi's formalism, however, does not support the assembly of multiple particles into complexes. Starting in the 2000's, multiple groups developed rule-based methods for computationally simulating biochemical systems involving large macromolecular complexes. However, these methods are based on graph-rewriting rules and/or process algebras that are mathematically disconnected from the statistical physics methods generally used to analyze equilibrium and nonequilibrium systems. Here we bridge these two approaches by introducing an operator algebra for the rule-based modeling of multi-particle complexes. Our formalism is based on a Fock space that supports not only the creation and annihilation of classical particles, but also the assembly of multiple particles into complexes, as well as the disassembly of complexes into their components. Rules are specified by algebraic operators that act on particles through a manifestation of Wick's theorem. We further describe diagrammatic methods that facilitate rule specification and analytic calculations. We demonstrate our formalism on systems in and out of thermal equilibrium, and for nonequilibrium systems we present a stochastic simulation algorithm based on our formalism. The results provide a unified approach to the mathematical and computational study of stochastic chemical systems in which multi-particle complexes play an important role.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16196v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The global decline in bee populations poses significant risks to agriculture, biodiversity, and environmental stability. To bridge the gap in existing data, we introduce ApisTox, a comprehensive dataset focusing on the toxicity of pesticides to honey bees (Apis mellifera). This dataset combines and leverages data from existing sources such as ECOTOX and PPDB, providing an extensive, consistent, and curated collection that surpasses the previous datasets. ApisTox incorporates a wide array of data, including toxicity levels for chemicals, details such as time of their publication in literature, and identifiers linking them to external chemical databases. This dataset may serve as an important tool for environmental and agricultural research, but also can support the development of policies and practices aimed at minimizing harm to bee populations.

      <title>From Static to Dynamic Structures: Improving Binding Affinity Prediction with Graph-Based Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.10230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.10230v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of protein-ligand binding affinities is an essential challenge in structure-based drug design. Despite recent advances in data-driven methods for affinity prediction, their accuracy is still limited, partially because they only take advantage of static crystal structures while the actual binding affinities are generally determined by the thermodynamic ensembles between proteins and ligands. One effective way to approximate such a thermodynamic ensemble is to use molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. Here, an MD dataset containing 3,218 different protein-ligand complexes is curated, and Dynaformer, a graph-based deep learning model is further developed to predict the binding affinities by learning the geometric characteristics of the protein-ligand interactions from the MD trajectories. In silico experiments demonstrated that the model exhibits state-of-the-art scoring and ranking power on the CASF-2016 benchmark dataset, outperforming the methods hitherto reported. Moreover, in a virtual screening on heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) using Dynaformer, 20 candidates are identified and their binding affinities are further experimentally validated. Dynaformer displayed promising results in virtual drug screening, revealing 12 hit compounds (two are in the submicromolar range), including several novel scaffolds. Overall, these results demonstrated that the approach offer a promising avenue for accelerating the early drug discovery process.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Cell Tracking with a Time-Symmetric Deep Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.03887v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The accurate tracking of live cells using video microscopy recordings remains a challenging task for popular state-of-the-art image processing based object tracking methods. In recent years, several existing and new applications have attempted to integrate deep-learning based frameworks for this task, but most of them still heavily rely on consecutive frame based tracking embedded in their architecture or other premises that hinder generalized learning. To address this issue, we aimed to develop a new deep-learning based tracking method that relies solely on the assumption that cells can be tracked based on their spatio-temporal neighborhood, without restricting it to consecutive frames. The proposed method has the additional benefit that the motion patterns of the cells can be learned completely by the predictor without any prior assumptions, and it has the potential to handle a large number of video frames with heavy artifacts. The efficacy of the proposed method is demonstrated through biologically motivated validation strategies and compared against multiple state-of-the-art cell tracking methods.</description>

      <title>Bivariate change point detection in movement direction and speed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02489v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Biological movement patterns can sometimes be quasi linear with abrupt changes in direction and speed, as in plastids in root cells investigated here. For the analysis of such changes we propose a new stochastic model for movement along linear structures. Maximum likelihood estimators are provided, and due to serial dependencies of increments, the classical MOSUM statistic is replaced by a moving kernel estimator. Convergence of the resulting difference process and strong consistency of the variance estimator are shown. We estimate the change points and propose a graphical technique to distinguish between change points in movement direction and speed.</description>
