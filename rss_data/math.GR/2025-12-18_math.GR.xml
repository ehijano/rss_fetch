      <title>A reduction theorem for the blockwise Galois Alperin weight conjecture via H-triples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Galois Alperin weight (GAW) conjecture has been reduced to the inductive GAW condition for simple groups. We proceed in two steps to refine this reduction. First, we propose the blockwise Galois Alperin weight (BGAW) conjecture and define its associated inductive BGAW condition. Second, assuming the inductive GAW (respectively, BGAW) condition for simple groups, we establish a stronger version of the GAW (respectively, BGAW) conjecture in terms of central (respectively, block) isomorphism of H-triples.</description>

      <title>Uniform spectral gaps, non-abelian Littlewood-Offord and anti-concentration for random walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that random walks on semisimple algebraic groups do not concentrate on proper algebraic subvarieties with uniform exponential rate of anti-concentration. This is achieved by proving a uniform spectral gap for quasi-regular representations of countable linear groups. The method makes key use of Diophantine heights and the Height Gap theorem. We also deduce a non-abelian version of the Littlewood--Offord inequalities and prove logarithmic bounds for escape from subvarieties. In a sequel to this paper, we will show how to transform this uniform gap into uniform expansion for Cayley graphs of finite simple groups of bounded rank $G(p)$ over almost all primes $p$.</description>

      <title>Remarks on approximability and stability for groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide several instances in which interesting approximation and stability properties are inherited by quotients with respect to finitely generated normal subgroups or, more strongly, normal subgroups with Kazhdan's property (T). Applications arise when these observations are combined with variations of the Rips construction due to Wise and Belegradek--Osin.</description>

      <title>Symmetric polytopes whose automorphism groups are 2-groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present work investigates regular, semiregular, and chiral polytopes of any rank $d\geq 3$, whose automorphism groups are 2-groups. There is a large variety of rather small finite regular or alternating semiregular polytopes with automorphism groups of 2-power order: for such polytopes with toroidal sections of rank 3, the various sections of rank 3 can be entirely prescribed (possibly with one exception in the semiregular case). It is also shown that having a 2-group as automorphism group is hereditary under taking universal extensions: the universal extension of a given regular, chiral, or alternating semiregular polytope with a finite or infinite 2-group as automorphism group, is a polytope of one rank higher with an infinite 2-group an automorphism group.</description>

      <title>On right units of special inverse monoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the class of monoids that arise as the submonoid of right units of finitely presented special inverse monoids (SIMs). Gray and Ru\v{s}kuc (2024) gave the first example of a finitely presented SIM whose submonoid of right units does not admit a decomposition into a free product of the group of units and a finite rank free monoid. In the first part of this paper we prove a general result which shows that the only instances where the right units of a finitely presented SIM can admit such a free product decomposition is when their group of units is finitely presented. In showing this, we establish some general results about finite generation and presentability of subgroups of SIMs. In particular, we give an exact characterisation of when an arbitrary subgroup is finitely generated in terms of connectedness properties of unions of its cosets in its $\mathscr{R}$-class, and also a characterisation of when an arbitrary subgroup is finitely presented. We also give a sufficient condition for finite generation and presentability of an arbitrary subgroup given in terms of a geometric finiteness property called boundary width. As a consequence, we show that the classes of monoids of right units of finitely presented SIMs and prefix monoids of finitely presented groups are independent. In the second part of the paper, we show that every finitely generated submonoid of a finitely RC-presented monoid is isomorphic to a submonoid $N$ of a finitely presented SIM $M$ such that $N$ is a submonoid of the right units of $M$, and $N$ contains the group of units of $M$. This result generalises and extends the classification of groups of units of finitely presented SIMs recently obtained by Gray and Kambites (2025). From this, we derive a number of surprising properties of RC-presentations for right cancellative monoids contrasting the classical theory of monoid presentations.</description>

      <title>Abelian structure in approximate groups and Alon's conjecture on Ramsey Cayley graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A result of Pyber states that every finite group $G$ contains an abelian subgroup whose order is quasi-polynomially large in $\lvert G\rvert$. We prove a similar result for $K$-approximate subgroups of solvable groups under only modest restrictions on $K$. We show that, if $A$ is a finite $K$-approximate group contained in some solvable group, then some abelian group intersects $A^4$ in at least $\exp(\Omega(\log^{1/6}\lvert A\rvert/\log 2K))$ elements. We also prove a similar result for approximate subgroups of finite groups with no large alternating subquotients. Along the way, we obtain polynomial (instead of quasi-polynomial) bounds for the same statement of approximate subgroups of linear groups.
  We give two applications. Firstly, we consider the conjecture of Alon that every finite group $G$ admits a Cayley graph with clique number and independence number $O(\log\lvert G\rvert)$. Conlon, Fox, Pham, and Yepremyan have recently proven that, for almost all positive integers $N$, every abelian group of order $N$ satisfies Alon's conjecture. Extending their result, we verify Alon's conjecture for all (not necessarily abelian) groups of almost all orders. Secondly, we prove a "local" version of Roth's theorem in (many) non-abelian settings with quasi-polynomial bounds, using the recent breakthroughs of Kelley and Meka on Roth's theorem and of Jaber, Liu, Lovett, Ostuni, and Sawhney on the corners problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the sheaf of $\mathbb A^1$-connected components of a quasi-split group over a perfect field is a strictly $\mathbb A^1$-invariant sheaf with (Voevodsky) transfers. As a consequence, we show that the norm principle holds for any quasi-split group over a perfect field.</description>

      <title>On quasimorphisms and distortion in homeomorphism groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a smooth compact oriented manifold, and $Homeo_0(M,\mu)$ the group of homeomorphisms of $M$ supported away from $\partial M$, which preserve a Borel probability measure $\mu$ induced by a volume form on $M$, and are isotopic to the identity.
  In this paper, we identify those Gambaudo-Ghys and Polterovich quasimorphisms $\Psi\colon Diff_0(M,\mu)\to R$ which extend $C^0$-continuously to $Homeo_0(M,\mu)$ as quasimorphisms, and to $Homeo_0(M)$ as group cochains whose differentials are semi-bounded cocycles. We present several applications of this result which include unboundedness of certain bi-invariant metric on the commutator subgroup of $Homeo_0(M,\mu)$, and conditions under which a homeomorphism in $Homeo_0(M)$ is undistorted.</description>

      <title>On the $1$-cohomology of $\mathrm{SL}(n,{\mathbb K})$ on the dual of its adjoint module</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11808v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a field $\mathbb K$, for any $n\geq 3$ the first cohomology group $H^1(G_n,A^*_n)$ of the special linear group $G_n = \mathrm{SL}(n,{\mathbb K})$ over the dual $A^*_n$ of its adjoint module $A_n$ is isomorphic to the space $\mathrm{Der}({\mathbb K})$ of the derivations of $\mathbb K$, except possibly when $|{\mathbb K}| \in \{2, 4\}$ and $n$ is even. This fact is stated by S. Smith and H. V\"{o}lklein in their paper "A geometric presentation for the adjont module of $\mathrm{SL}_3(k)$" (J. Algebra 127 (1989), 127--138). They claim that when $|{\mathbb K}| &gt; 9$ this fact follows from the main result of V\"{o}lklein's paper "The 1-cohomology of the adjoint module of a Chevalley group" (Forum Math. 1 (1989), 1--13), but say nothing that can help the reader to deduce it from that result. When $|{\mathbb K}| \leq 9$ they obtain the isomorphism $H^1(G_n,A^*_n) \cong \mathrm{Der}({\mathbb K})$ by means of other results from homological algebra, which however miss the case $|{\mathbb K}| \in\{2, 4\}$ with $n $ even. In the present paper we shall provide a straightforward proof of the isomorphism $H^1(G_n,A^*_n) \cong \mathrm{Der}({\mathbb K})$ under the hypothesis $n &gt; 3$. Our proof also covers the above mentioned missing case.</description>

      <title>New constructions of free products and geodetic Cayley graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22188v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A connected graph is called \emph{geodetic} if there is a unique shortest path between each pair of vertices. We introduce a systematic method for constructing new presentations of free products that give rise to previously unknown geodetic Cayley graphs. Our approach adapts subdivision techniques of Parthasarathy and Srinivasan (J. Combin. Theory Ser. B, 1982), which preserve geodecity at the graph level, to the setting of group presentations and rewriting systems. Specifically, given a group $G$ with geodetic Cayley graph with respect to generating set $\Sigma$ and an integer $n$, our construction produces a rewriting system presenting the free product of $G$ with a free group of rank $n|\Sigma|$ with geodetic Cayley graph with respect to a new generating set. This framework provides new infinite families of geodetic Cayley graphs and extends the toolkit for investigating long-standing conjectures on geodetic groups.</description>

      <title>Jordan and Cartan spectra in higher rank with applications to correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.16329v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a given $d$-tuple $\rho=(\rho_1,\dots,\rho_d):\Gamma \to G$ of faithful Zariski dense convex cocompact representations of a finitely generated group $\Gamma$, we study the correlations of length spectra $\{\ell_{\rho_i(\gamma)}\}_{[\gamma]\in[\Gamma]}$ and correlations of displacement spectra $\{\mathsf{d}(\rho_i(\gamma)o,o)\}_{\gamma\in\Gamma}$.
  We prove that for any interior vector $\mathsf v=(v_1,\dots,v_d)$ in the {\it{spectrum cone}}, there exists $\delta_\rho(\mathsf v) &gt; 0$ such that for any $\varepsilon_1, \dots, \varepsilon_d&gt;0$, there exist $c_1,c_2&gt; 0$ such that
  \begin{align*} &amp;\#\{[\gamma]\in [\Gamma]: v_iT \le \ell_{\rho_i(\gamma)} \le v_i T+\varepsilon_i, \;1 \le i \le d \} \sim c_1 \frac{e^{\delta_\rho (\mathsf{v})T}}{ T^{{(d+1)}/{2}}};\\ &amp;\#\{\gamma\in \Gamma: v_iT \le \mathsf{d}(\rho_i(\gamma)o,o) \le v_i T+\varepsilon_i, \;1 \le i \le d \} \sim c_2 \frac{e^{\delta_\rho (\mathsf v)T}}{ T^{{(d-1)}/{2}}}.
  \end{align*} We deduce this result as a special case of our main theorem on the distribution of Jordan projections with holonomies and Cartan projections {\it{in tubes}} of an Anosov subgroup $\Gamma$ of a semisimple real algebraic group $G$. We also show that the growth indicator of $\Gamma$ remains the same when we use Jordan projections instead of Cartan projections and tubes instead of cones, except possibly on the boundary of the limit cone.</description>
