      <title>Schadenfreude in the Digital Public Sphere: A cross-national and decade-long analysis of Facebook news engagement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Schadenfreude, or the pleasure derived from others' misfortunes, has become a visible and performative feature of online news engagement, yet little is known about its prevalence, dynamics, or social patterning. We examine schadenfreude on Facebook over a ten-year period across nine major news publishers in the United States, the United Kingdom, and India (one left-leaning, one right-leaning, and one centrist per country). Using a combination of human annotation and machine-learning classification, we identify posts describing misfortune and detect schadenfreude in nearly one million associated comments. We find that while sadness and anger dominate reactions to misfortune posts, laughter and amusement form a substantial and patterned minority. Schadenfreude is most frequent in moralized and political contexts, higher among right-leaning audiences, and more pronounced in India than in the United States or United Kingdom. Temporal and regression analyses further reveal that schadenfreude generally increases when groups are politically out of power, but these patterns differ across party lines. Together, our findings move beyond anecdotal accounts to map schadenfreude as a dynamic, context-dependent feature of digital discourse, revealing how it evolves over time and across ideological and cultural divides.</description>

      <title>TGSBM: Transformer-Guided Stochastic Block Model for Link Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Link prediction is a cornerstone of the Web ecosystem, powering applications from recommendation and search to knowledge graph completion and collaboration forecasting. However, large-scale networks present unique challenges: they contain hundreds of thousands of nodes and edges with heterogeneous and overlapping community structures that evolve over time. Existing approaches face notable limitations: traditional graph neural networks struggle to capture global structural dependencies, while recent graph transformers achieve strong performance but incur quadratic complexity and lack interpretable latent structure. We propose \textbf{TGSBM} (Transformer-Guided Stochastic Block Model), a framework that integrates the principled generative structure of Overlapping Stochastic Block Models with the representational power of sparse Graph Transformers. TGSBM comprises three main components: (i) \emph{expander-augmented sparse attention} that enables near-linear complexity and efficient global mixing, (ii) a \emph{neural variational encoder} that infers structured posteriors over community memberships and strengths, and (iii) a \emph{neural edge decoder} that reconstructs links via OSBM's generative process, preserving interpretability. Experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate competitive performance (mean rank 1.6 under HeaRT protocol), superior scalability (up to $6\times$ faster training), and interpretable community structures. These results position TGSBM as a practical approach that strikes a balance between accuracy, efficiency, and transparency for large-scale link prediction.</description>

      <title>Distributed Learning over Noisy Communication Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study binary coordination games over graphs under log-linear learning when neighbor actions are conveyed through explicit noisy communication links. Each edge is modeled as either a binary symmetric channel (BSC) or a binary erasure channel (BEC). We analyze two operational regimes. For binary symmetric and binary erasure channels, we provide a structural characterization of the induced learning dynamics. In a fast-communication regime, agents update using channel-averaged payoffs; the resulting learning dynamics coincide with a Gibbs sampler for a scaled coordination potential, where channel reliability enters only through a scalar attenuation coefficient. In a snapshot regime, agents update from a single noisy realization and ignore channel statistics; the induced Markov chain is generally nonreversible, but admits a high-temperature expansion whose drift matches that of the fast Gibbs sampler with the same attenuation. We further formalize a finite-$K$ communication budget, which interpolates between snapshot and fast behavior as the number of channel uses per update grows. This viewpoint yields a communication-theoretic interpretation in terms of retransmissions and repetition coding, and extends naturally to heterogeneous link reliabilities via effective edge weights. Numerical experiments illustrate the theory and quantify the tradeoff between communication resources and steady-state coordination quality.</description>

      <title>A Scalable Inter-edge Correlation Modeling in CopulaGNN for Link Sign Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19175v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Link sign prediction on a signed graph is a task to determine whether the relationship represented by an edge is positive or negative. Since the presence of negative edges violates the graph homophily assumption that adjacent nodes are similar, regular graph methods have not been applicable without auxiliary structures to handle them. We aim to directly model the latent statistical dependency among edges with the Gaussian copula and its corresponding correlation matrix, extending CopulaGNN (Ma et al., 2021). However, a naive modeling of edge-edge relations is computationally intractable even for a graph with moderate scale. To address this, we propose to 1) represent the correlation matrix as a Gramian of edge embeddings, significantly reducing the number of parameters, and 2) reformulate the conditional probability distribution to dramatically reduce the inference cost. We theoretically verify scalability of our method by proving its linear convergence. Also, our extensive experiments demonstrate that it achieves significantly faster convergence than baselines, maintaining competitive prediction performance to the state-of-the-art models.</description>
