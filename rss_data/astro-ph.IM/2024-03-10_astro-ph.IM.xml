      <title>Expected Impact of Glints from Space Debris in the LSST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the simple model put forth in a recent note by Loeb 2024 regarding the brightness of space debris in the size range of 1-10 cm and their impact on the Rubin Observatory LSST transient object searches. Their main conclusion was that "image contamination by untracked space debris might pose a bigger challenge [than large commercial satellite constellations in LEO]". Following corrections and improvements to this model, we calculate the apparent brightness of tumbling Low Earth Orbit (LEO) debris of various sizes, and we briefly discuss the likely impact and potential mitigations of glints from space debris in LSST. The largest difference from the Loeb 2024 estimates is that 1-10 cm debris in LEO pose no threat to LSST transient object alert generation because their signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for detection will be much lower than estimated by Loeb 2024. Most of the difference in predicted SNR, about a factor of six, arises from defocus of LEO objects due to the large Simonyi Survey Telescope primary mirror. We find that only tumbling LEO debris larger than 10 cm or with significantly greater reflectivity, which give 1 ms glints, might be detected with high confidence (SNR&gt;5). We estimate that only one in five LSST exposures low on the sky during twilight might be affected. More slowly tumbling objects of larger size can give flares in brightness that are easily detected, however these will not be cataloged by the LSST Science Pipelines Bosch et al. 2019 because of the resulting long streak.</description>

      <title>Multicolor photometry of LEO mega-constellations Starlink and OneWeb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of low earth orbit (LEO) mega-constellation fundamentally threatens ground-based optical astronomical observations. To study the photometric properties of the LEO mega-constellations, we used the Xinglong 50 cm telescope to conduct a large-sample, high-precision, and multicolor target-tracking photometry of two typical LEO Mega-constellations: Starlink and OneWeb. Over a three-month observation period starting on 2022 January 1st, we collected 1,447 light curves of 404 satellites in four typical versions: Starlink v1.0, DarkSat, VisorSat, Starlink v1.5, and OneWeb. According to data statistics, Starlink v1.0 has the smallest median magnitude at clear and SDSS $gri$ band, and OneWeb is the dimmest bus. The brightness of Starlink v1.5 is slightly brighter than VisorSat. We construct a detailed photometric model with solar phase angle variations by calculating the illumination-visibility geometry based on the orbital parameters. Our data analysis shows that the solar phase angle is the significant characteristic which influencing Starlink satellites' brightness, but it is not sensitive to OneWeb satellites. VisorSat and Starlink v1.5 version, which are equipped with deployable visors, have significantly reduced scattered light compared to the previous Starlink v1.0 version. The multiband LOWESS and color-index are analyzed in characterizing the energy and color features of LEO mega-constellation satellites. This work found that the proportion of scattered sunlight mitigation achieved with VisorSat and Starlink v1.5 was 55.1\% and 40.4\%, respectively. The color index of different buses shows an evident clustering feature. Our observation and analysis could provide valuable quantitative data and photometric models, which can contribute to assessing the impact of LEO mega-constellations on astronomical observations.</description>

      <title>The Wide-field Spectroscopic Telescope (WST) Science White Paper</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Wide-field Spectroscopic Telescope (WST) is proposed as a new facility dedicated to the efficient delivery of spectroscopic surveys. This white paper summarises the initial concept as well as the corresponding science cases. WST will feature simultaneous operation of a large field-of-view (3 sq. degree), a high multiplex (20,000) multi-object spectrograph (MOS) and a giant 3x3 sq. arcmin integral field spectrograph (IFS). In scientific capability these requirements place WST far ahead of existing and planned facilities. Given the current investment in deep imaging surveys and noting the diagnostic power of spectroscopy, WST will fill a crucial gap in astronomical capability and work synergistically with future ground and space-based facilities. This white paper shows that WST can address outstanding scientific questions in the areas of cosmology; galaxy assembly, evolution, and enrichment, including our own Milky Way; origin of stars and planets; time domain and multi-messenger astrophysics. WST's uniquely rich dataset will deliver unforeseen discoveries in many of these areas. The WST Science Team (already including more than 500 scientists worldwide) is open to the all astronomical community.

      <title>Radiation transport methods in star formation simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radiation transport plays a crucial role in star formation models, as certain questions within this field cannot be accurately addressed without taking it into account. Given the high complexity of the interstellar medium from which stars form, numerical simulations are frequently employed to model the star formation process. This study reviews recent methods for incorporating radiation transport into star formation simulations, discussing them in terms of the used algorithms, treatment of radiation frequency dependence, the interaction of radiation with the gas, and the parallelization of methods for deployment on supercomputers. Broadly, the algorithms fall into two categories: (i) moment-based methods, encompassing the flux-limited diffusion approximation, M1 closure, and variable Eddington tensor methods, and (ii) methods directly solving the radiation transport equation, including forward and reverse ray tracing, characteristics-based methods, and Monte Carlo techniques. Beyond discussing advantages and disadvantages of these methods, the review also lists recent radiation hydrodynamic codes implemented the described methods.</description>

      <title>The R2D2 deep neural network series paradigm for fast precision imaging in radio astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio-interferometric (RI) imaging entails solving high-resolution high-dynamic range inverse problems from large data volumes. Recent image reconstruction techniques grounded in optimization theory have demonstrated remarkable capability for imaging precision, well beyond CLEAN's capability. These range from advanced proximal algorithms propelled by handcrafted regularization operators, such as the SARA family, to hybrid plug-and-play (PnP) algorithms propelled by learned regularization denoisers, such as AIRI. Optimization and PnP structures are however highly iterative, which hinders their ability to handle the extreme data sizes expected from future instruments. To address this scalability challenge, we introduce a novel deep learning approach, dubbed ``Residual-to-Residual DNN series for high-Dynamic range imaging'. R2D2's reconstruction is formed as a series of residual images, iteratively estimated as outputs of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) taking the previous iteration's image estimate and associated data residual as inputs. It thus takes a hybrid structure between a PnP algorithm and a learned version of the matching pursuit algorithm that underpins CLEAN. We present a comprehensive study of our approach, featuring its multiple incarnations distinguished by their DNN architectures. We provide a detailed description of its training process, targeting a telescope-specific approach. R2D2's capability to deliver high precision is demonstrated in simulation, across a variety of image and observation settings using the Very Large Array (VLA). Its reconstruction speed is also demonstrated: with only few iterations required to clean data residuals at dynamic ranges up to 105, R2D2 opens the door to fast precision imaging. R2D2 codes are available in the BASPLib library on GitHub.</description>

      <title>VIRA: An Exoplanet Atmospheric Retrieval Framework for JWST Transmission Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: JWST observations are leading to important new insights into exoplanetary atmospheres through transmission spectroscopy. In order to harness the full potential of the broad spectral range and high sensitivity of JWST, atmospheric retrievals of exoplanets require a high level of robustness and accuracy in the underlying models. We present the VIRA retrieval framework which implements a range of modelling and inference capabilities motivated by early JWST observations of exoplanet transmission spectra. This includes three complementary approaches to modelling atmospheric composition, three atmospheric aerosol models, including a physically-motivated Mie scattering approach, and consideration of correlated noise. VIRA enables a cascading retrieval architecture involving a sequence of retrievals with increasing sophistication. We demonstrate VIRA using a JWST transmission spectrum of the hot Saturn WASP-39 b in the $\sim$1-5 $\mu$m range. In addition to confirming prior chemical inferences, we retrieve molecular abundances for H$_2$O, CO, CO$_2$, SO$_2$ and H$_2$S, resulting in super-solar elemental abundances of log(O/H)=$-2.0\pm0.2$, log(C/H)=$-2.1\pm0.2$ and log(S/H)=$-3.6\pm0.2$, along with C/O and S/O ratios of $0.83^{+0.05}_{-0.07}$ and $0.029^{+0.012}_{-0.009}$, respectively, in the free chemistry case. The abundances correspond to $20.1^{+10.5}_{-8.1}\times$, $28.2^{+16.3}_{-12.1}\times$ and $20.8^{+10.3}_{-7.5}\times$ solar values for O/H, C/H and S/H, respectively, compared to C/H $= 8.67\pm0.35 \times$ solar for Saturn. Our results demonstrate how JWST transmission spectroscopy combined with retrieval frameworks like VIRA can measure multi-elemental abundances for giant exoplanets and enable comparative characterisation with solar system planets.</description>

      <title>Concerning S$H_0$ES Data: Discrepant $W_{0,VI}$ Absolute Magnitudes for Cepheids in the Keystone Galaxy NGC4258</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: S$H_0$ES $VI$-band photometry for classical Cepheids in the keystone galaxy NGC4258 yield discrepant absolute magnitudes. Specifically, the 2016 and 2022 published S$H_0$ES Cepheid data for NGC4258 exhibit a substantial offset of $\Delta W_{0,VI}\simeq0^{\rm m}.3$. That adds to a suite of existing concerns associated with the S$H_0$ES analysis, which in sum imply that their relatively non-changing Hubble constant for nearly twenty years should be viewed with caution.</description>

      <title>The New Horizons Extended Mission Target: Arrokoth Search and Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Following the Pluto fly-by of the New Horizons spacecraft, the mission provided a unique opportunity to explore the Kuiper Belt in-situ. The possibility existed to fly-by a Kuiper Belt object (KBO) as well as to observe additional objects at distances closer than are feasible from earth-orbit facilities. However, at the time of launch no KBOs were known about that were accessible by the spacecraft. In this paper we present the results of 10 years of observations and three uniquely dedicated efforts -- two ground-based using the Subaru Suprime Camera, the Magellan MegaCam and IMACS Cameras, and one with the Hubble Space Telescope -- to find such KBOs for study. In this paper we overview the search criteria and strategies employed in our work and detail the analysis efforts to locate and track faint objects in the galactic plane. We also present a summary of all of the KBOs that were discovered as part of our efforts and how spacecraft targetability was assessed, including a detailed description of our astrometric analysis which included development of an extensive secondary calibration network. Overall, these efforts resulted in the discovery of 89 KBOs including 11 which became objects for distant observation by New Horizons and (486958) Arrokoth which became the first post-Pluto fly-by destination.</description>

      <title>Improving the Cosmological Constraints by Inferring the Formation Channel of Extreme-mass-ratio Inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extreme-mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs) could be detected by space-borne gravitational-wave (GW) detectors, such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), TianQin and Taiji. In general, locating EMRIs by space-borne GW detectors can help us select the candidate host galaxies which can be used to infer the cosmic expansion history. In this paper, we show that the localization information of EMRIs can also be used to select the candidate host AGNs which can be used to infer the formation channel of the EMRIs and extract more precisely the redshift probability distributions of the EMRIs. Using the EMRIs that are expected to be detected by TianQin and LISA and the galaxy catalog that can be provided by the Chinese Space Station Telescope for the analysis, we find that TianQin can constrain the Hubble-Lema\^itre constant $H_0$ to a precision of about $3\%-8\%$ and the dark energy equation of state parameter $w_0$ to about $10\%-40\%$, the network composed of TianQin and LISA can improve the precisions of $H_0$ and $w_0$ to about $0.4\% - 7\%$ and $4\%-20\%$, respectively, without considering the effects of AGNs. Furthermore, combining the detected EMRIs with AGN catalog by the statistical framework of likelihood-ratio-based, we find TianQin can establish the EMRI-AGN correlation with about $500$ EMRIs if all of the EMRIs indeed originate in AGNs, and the TianQin+LISA network can reduce this required number to about $30$. Once the EMRI-AGN correlation is confirmed, the combination of the EMRIs and AGN catalog can significantly improve the constraints on the cosmological parameters. These results demonstrate the potentials of using EMRIs as well as galaxy and AGN catalogs to constrain the cosmological parameters and astrophysical models.</description>

      <title>High-energy extension of the gamma-ray band observable with an electron-tracking Compton camera</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although the MeV gamma-ray band is a promising energy-band window in astrophysics, the current situation of MeV gamma-ray astronomy significantly lags behind those of the other energy bands in angular resolution and sensitivity. An electron-tracking Compton camera (ETCC), a next-generation MeV detector, is expected to revolutionize the situation. An ETCC tracks each Compton-recoil electron with a gaseous electron tracker and determines the incoming direction of each gamma-ray photon; thus, it has a strong background rejection power and yields a better angular resolution than classical Compton cameras. Here, we study ETCC events in which the Compton-recoil electrons do not deposit all energies to the electron tracker but escape and hit the surrounding pixel scintillator array (PSA). We developed an analysis method for this untapped class of events and applied it to laboratory and simulation data. We found that the energy spectrum obtained from the simulation agreed with that of the actual data within a factor of 1.2. We then evaluated the detector performance using the simulation data. The angular resolution for the new-class events was found to be twice as good as in the previous study at the energy range 1.0--2.0~MeV, where both analyses overlap. We also found that the total effective area is dominated by the contribution of the double-hit events above an energy of 1.5~MeV. Notably, applying this new method extends the sensitive energy range with the ETCC from 0.2--2.1 MeV in the previous studies to up to 3.5~MeV. Adjusting the PSA dynamic range should improve the sensitivity in even higher energy gamma-rays. The development of this new analysis method would pave the way for future observations by ETCC to fill the MeV-band sensitivity gap in astronomy.</description>

Abstract: Recently Loeb et al. (2024, "Recovery and Classification of Spherules from the Pacific Ocean Site of the CNEOS 2014 January 8 (IM1) Bolide", Res. Notes. Amer. Astron. Soc. 8, 39) reported the magnetic collection of millimeter-sized spherules from the seafloor near Papua New Guinea. About 22% had Mg/Si &lt; 1/3 and were identified as a new "differentiated" variety of cosmic spherule ("D-type"). In a subset of 26 of these "D-type" spherules, 12 "BeLaU" spherules were found to be dominated by Fe and Al, marked by low Si and even lower Mg content, depletions of volatile species like Pb and Cs, and remarkable enrichments of Be, La, U, Ba, and other elements. Loeb et al. claimed these have exotic compositions different from other Solar System materials. We show that in fact samples with these compositions are not just found on Earth, they are from Earth; specifically, we identify them as microtektites of terrestrial lateritic sandstone. Based on the location of the sample site, we associate them with the Australasian tektite strewn field, generated 788 kyr ago by an impactor that melted and ejected ~10^8 tons of sandstone, including a lateritic layer, from Indochina. A tektite origin for the spherules is corroborated by their terrestrial Fe isotopic compositions and the compound, non-spherical nature of many of them, which preclude formation as ablation spherules from a bolide. Due to the restriction of laterites to the tropics, iron-rich tektites may be uncommon, but we predict they should comprise ~3% of the Australasian microtektites.</description>

      <title>The Simons Observatory: impact of bandpass, polarization angle and calibration uncertainties on small-scale power spectrum analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the effects due to mismatches in passbands, polarization angles, and temperature and polarization calibrations in the context of the upcoming cosmic microwave background experiment Simons Observatory (SO). Using the SO multi-frequency likelihood, we estimate the bias and the degradation of constraining power in cosmological and astrophysical foreground parameters assuming different levels of knowledge of the instrumental effects. We find that incorrect but reasonable assumptions on the values of all the systematics examined here can have important effects in cosmological analyses, hence requiring marginalization approaches at likelihood level. When doing so, we find that the most relevant effect is due to bandpass shifts. When marginalizing over them, the posteriors of parameters describing astrophysical microwave foregrounds (such as radio point sources or dust) get degraded, while cosmological parameters constraints are not significantly affected. Marginalization over polarization angles with up to 0.25$^\circ$ uncertainty causes an irrelevant bias $\lesssim 0.05 \sigma$ in all parameters. Marginalization over calibration factors in polarization broadens the constraints on the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom $N_\mathrm{eff}$ by a factor 1.2, interpreted here as a proxy parameter for non standard model physics targeted by high-resolution CMB measurements.</description>

      <title>An implicit algorithm for simulating the dynamics of small dust grains with smoothed particle hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an implicit method for solving the diffusion equation for the evolution of the dust fraction in the terminal velocity approximation using dust-as-mixture smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). The numerical scheme involves casting the dust diffusion equation into implicit form, rearranging into its resolvent cubic equation and solving analytically. This method is relevant for small grains that are tightly coupled to the gas, such as sub-micron dust grains in the interstellar medium or millimetre-sized dust grains in protoplanetary discs. The method avoids problems with the variable used to evolve the dust fraction becoming negative when evolved explicitly and is fast and accurate, avoiding the need for dust stopping time limiters and significantly reducing computational expense. Whilst this method is an improvement over using the explicit terminal velocity approximation method, as with any dust-as-mixture method it still fails to give accurate solutions in the limit of large (weakly coupled) grains.</description>

      <title>Modelling Triatomic Biosignatures: Ozone and Isotopomers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we present a new approach to produce spectroscopic constants and model first-principles synthetic spectra for all molecules of astrophysical interest. We have generalized our previous diatomic molecule simulation framework, employing Transition-Optimised Shifted Hermite (TOSH) theory, thereby enabling the modelling of polyatomic rotational constants for molecules with three or more atoms. These capabilities, are now provided by our new code Epimetheus.
  As a first validation of our approach, we confront our predictions and assess their accuracy against the well-studied triatomic molecule, ozone 666 ($^{16}$O$_3$), in addition to eight of its potential isotopomers: ozone 668 ($^{16}$O$^{16}$O$^{18}$O), 686 ($^{16}$O$^{18}$O$^{16}$O), 667 ($^{16}$O$^{16}$O$^{17}$O), 676 ($^{16}$O$^{17}$O$^{16}$O), 688 ($^{16}$O$^{18}$O$^{18}$O), 868 ($^{18}$O$^{16}$O$^{18}$O), 888 ($^{18}$O$_3$), and 777 ($^{17}$O$_3$). We then assess the accuracy of these rotational constants using the Epimetheus data in our code Pandora, and generate synthetic molecular spectra.
  The ozone spectra presented here are purely infrared and not Raman. Epimetheus builds upon the work from our previous code Prometheus, which used the TOSH theory to account for anharmonicity for the fundamental $\nu=0 \rightarrow \nu=1$ band, going further to now account for triatomic molecules. This is combined with thermal profile modeling for the rotational transitions. We have found that this extended method performs promisingly, typically approximating the spectroscopic constants and spectra well. Some issues do arise depending on the symmetry group of the ozone isotopomer. In general, we show that Epimetheus can provide the data to produce appreciable molecular spectra, to help drive future high-resolution studies.</description>

      <title>Bayesian mass mapping with weak lensing data using KARMMA -- validation with simulations and application to Dark Energy Survey Year 3 data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We update the field-level inference code KARMMA to enable tomographic forward-modelling of shear maps. Our code assumes a lognormal prior on the convergence field, and properly accounts for the cross-covariance in the lensing signal across tomographic source bins. We use mock weak lensing data from N-body simulations to validate our mass-mapping forward model by comparing our posterior maps to the input convergence fields. We find that KARMMA produces more accurate reconstructions than traditional mass-mapping algorithms. More-over, the KARMMA posteriors reproduce all statistical properties of the input density field we tested -- one- and two-point functions, and the peak and void number counts -- with $\lesssim~10\%$ accuracy. Our posteriors exhibit a small bias that increases with decreasing source redshift, but these biases are small compared to the statistical uncertainties of current (DES) cosmic shear surveys. Finally, we apply KARMMA to Dark Energy Survey Year 3 (DES-Y3) weak lensing data, and verify that the two point shear correlation function $\xi_+$ is well fit by the correlation function of the reconstructed convergence field. This is a non-trivial test that traditional mass mapping algorithms fail. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/Supranta/KaRMMa.git. KARMMA DES-Y3 mass maps are publicly available at https://zenodo.org/records/10672062.</description>

Abstract: Hera represents the European Space Agency's inaugural planetary defense space mission and plays a pivotal role in the Asteroid Impact and Deflection Assessment international collaboration with NASA DART mission that performed the first asteroid deflection experiment using the kinetic impactor techniques. With the primary objective of conducting a detailed post-impact survey of the Didymos binary asteroid following the DART impact on its small moon called Dimorphos, Hera aims to comprehensively assess and characterize the feasibility of the kinetic impactor technique in asteroid deflection while conducting an in-depth investigation of the asteroid binary, including its physical and compositional properties as well as the effect of the impact on the surface and shape of Dimorphos. In this work, we describe the Hera radio science experiment, which will allow us to precisely estimate critical parameters, including the mass, which is required to determine the momentum enhancement resulting from the DART impact, mass distribution, rotational states, relative orbits, and dynamics of the asteroids Didymos and Dimorphos. Through a multi-arc covariance analysis, we present the achievable accuracy for these parameters, which consider the full expected asteroid phase and are based on ground radiometric, Hera optical images, and Hera to CubeSats InterSatellite Link radiometric measurements. The expected formal uncertainties for Didymos and Dimorphos GM are better than 0.01% and 0.1%, respectively, while their J2 formal uncertainties are better than 0.1% and 10%, respectively.

      <title>Automated chemical reaction network generation and its application to exoplanet atmospheres</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14784v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the advent of JWST and spectroscopic characterization of exoplanet atmospheres with unprecedented detail, there is a demand for a more complete picture of chemical and photochemical reactions and their impact on atmospheric composition. Traditionally, building reaction networks for (exo)planetary atmospheres involves manually tracking relevant species and reactions, a time-consuming and error-prone process. This approach's applicability is also often limited to specific conditions, making it less versatile for different planetary types. (i.e., photochemical networks for Jupiters may not be directly applicable to water-rich exoplanets). We introduce an automated approach using a computer-aided chemical reaction network generator, combined with a one-dimensional photochemical kinetic-transport model, offering significant advantages. This approach automatically selects reaction rates through a rate-based iterative algorithm and refinement steps, enhancing model reliability. Also, this approach allows for the efficient simulation of diverse chemical environments, from hydrogen to water, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen-dominated atmospheres. Using WASP-39b and WASP-80b as examples, we demonstrate our approach's effectiveness. Our WASP-39b model aligns with prior studies and JWST observations, capturing photochemically produced sulfur dioxide. The WASP-80b model reveals an atmosphere influenced by deep interior thermochemistry and vertical mixing, consistent with JWST NIRCam observations. Furthermore, our model identifies a novel initial step for the N2-NH3-HCN pathway that enhances the conversion efficiency in high-temperature/pressure environments. This automated chemical network generation offers a novel, efficient, and precise framework for studying exoplanetary atmospheres, marking a significant advancement over traditional modeling techniques.</description>

      <title>Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST) Science: Planetary and Cometary Atmospheres</title>

Abstract: The study of planets and small bodies within our Solar System is fundamental for understanding the formation and evolution the Earth and other planets. Compositional and meteorological studies of the giant planets provide a foundation for understanding the nature of the most commonly observed exoplanets, while spectroscopic observations of the atmospheres of terrestrial planets, moons, and comets provide insights into the past and present-day habitability of planetary environments, and the availability of the chemical ingredients for life. While prior and existing (sub)millimeter observations have led to major advances in these areas, progress is hindered by limitations in the dynamic range, spatial and temporal coverage, as well as sensitivity of existing telescopes and interferometers. Here, we summarize some of the key planetary science use cases that factor into the design of the Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST), a proposed 50-m class single dish facility: (1) to more fully characterize planetary wind fields and atmospheric thermal structures, (2) to measure the compositions of icy moon atmospheres and plumes, (3) to obtain detections of new, astrobiologically relevant gases and perform isotopic surveys of comets, and (4) to perform synergistic, temporally-resolved measurements in support of dedicated interplanetary space missions. The improved spatial coverage (several arcminutes), resolution ($\sim1.2''-12''$), bandwidth (several tens of GHz), dynamic range ($\sim10^5$) and sensitivity ($\sim1$ mK km s$^{-1}$) required by these science cases would enable new insights into the chemistry and physics of planetary environments, the origins of prebiotic molecules and the habitability of planetary systems in general.</description>
