      <title>Local and nonlocal stochastic control of quantum chaos: Measurement- and control-induced criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically study the topology of the phase diagram of a family of quantum models inspired by the classical Bernoulli map under stochastic control. The quantum models inherit a control-induced phase transition from the classical model and also manifest an entanglement phase transition intrinsic to the quantum setting. This measurement-induced phase transition has been shown in various settings to either coincide or split off from the control transition, but a systematic understanding of the necessary and sufficient conditions for the two transitions to coincide in this case has so far been lacking. In this work, we generalize the control map to allow for either local or global control action. While this does not affect the classical aspects of the control transition that is described by a random walk, it significantly influences the quantum dynamics, leading to the universality class of the measurement-induced transition being dependent on the locality of the control operation. In the presence of a global control map, the two transitions coincide and the control-induced phase transition dominates the measurement-induced phase transition. Contrarily, the two transitions split in the presence of the local control map or additional projective measurements and generically take on distinct universality classes. For local control, the measurement-induced phase transition recovers the Haar logarithmic conformal field theory universality class found in feedback-free models. However, for global control, a novel universality class with correlation length exponent $\nu \approx 0.7$ emerges from the interplay of control and projective measurements. This work provides a more refined understanding of the relationship between the control- and measurement-induced phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Spread complexity in saddle-dominated scrambling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12593v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, the concept of spread complexity, Krylov complexity for states, has been introduced as a measure of the complexity and chaoticity of quantum systems. In this paper, we study the spread complexity of the thermofield double state within \emph{integrable} systems that exhibit saddle-dominated scrambling. Specifically, we focus on the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model and the inverted harmonic oscillator as representative examples of quantum mechanical systems featuring saddle-dominated scrambling. Applying the Lanczos algorithm, our numerical investigation reveals that the spread complexity in these systems exhibits features reminiscent of \emph{chaotic} systems, displaying a distinctive ramp-peak-slope-plateau pattern. Our results indicate that, although spread complexity serves as a valuable probe, accurately diagnosing true quantum chaos generally necessitates additional physical input. We also explore the relationship between spread complexity, the spectral form factor, and the transition probability within the Krylov space. We provide analytical confirmation of our numerical results, validating the Ehrenfest theorem of complexity and identifying a distinct quadratic behavior in the early-time regime of spread complexity.</description>
