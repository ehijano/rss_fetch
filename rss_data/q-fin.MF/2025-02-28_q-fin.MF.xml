      <title>Optimal risk-aware interest rates for decentralized lending protocols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decentralized lending protocols within the decentralized finance ecosystem enable the lending and borrowing of crypto-assets without relying on traditional intermediaries. Interest rates in these protocols are set algorithmically and fluctuate according to the supply and demand for liquidity. In this study, we propose an agent-based model tailored to a decentralized lending protocol and determine the optimal interest rate model. When the responses of the agents are linear with respect to the interest rate, the optimal solution is derived from a system of Riccati-type ODEs. For nonlinear behaviors, we propose a Monte-Carlo estimator, coupled with deep learning techniques, to approximate the optimal solution. Finally, after calibrating the model using block-by-block data, we conduct a risk-adjusted profit and loss analysis of the liquidity pool under industry-standard interest rate models and benchmark them against the optimal interest rate model.</description>

      <title>A quickest detection problem with false negatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.01844v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formulate and solve a variant of the quickest detection problem which features false negatives. A standard Brownian motion acquires a drift at an independent exponential random time which is not directly observable. Based on the observation in continuous time of the sample path of the process, an optimizer must detect the drift as quickly as possible after it has appeared. The optimizer can inspect the system multiple times upon payment of a fixed cost per inspection. If a test is performed on the system before the drift has appeared then, naturally, the test will return a negative outcome. However, if a test is performed after the drift has appeared, then the test may fail to detect it and return a false negative with probability $\epsilon\in(0,1)$. The optimisation ends when the drift is eventually detected. The problem is formulated mathematically as an optimal multiple stopping problem, and it is shown to be equivalent to a recursive optimal stopping problem. Exploiting such connection and free boundary methods we find explicit formulae for the expected cost and the optimal strategy. We also show that when $\epsilon = 0$ our expected cost is an affine transformation of the one in Shiryaev's classical optimal detection problem with a rescaled model parameter.</description>

      <title>The not-so-hidden risks of 'hidden-to-maturity' accounting: on depositor runs and bank resilience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03285v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We build a balance sheet-based model to capture run risk, i.e., a reduced potential to raise capital from liquidity buffers under stress, driven by depositor scrutiny and further fueled by fire sales in response to withdrawals. The setup is inspired by the Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) meltdown in March 2023 and we apply our model to assess the build-up of balance sheet vulnerabilities before its default. More generally, we analyze which characteristics of the balance sheet are critical for banking system regulators to adequately assess run risk and resilience. By bringing a time series of SVB's balance sheet data to our model, we are able to demonstrate how changes in the funding and respective asset composition made SVB prone to run risk, as they were increasingly relying on held-to-maturity accounting standards, masking revaluation losses in securities portfolios. Next, we formulate a tractable optimization problem to address the designation of held-to-maturity assets and quantify banks' ability to hold these assets without resorting to remarking. By calibrating this to SVB's balance sheet data, we shed light on the bank's funding risk and implied risk tolerance in the years 2020--22 leading up to its collapse. We conclude by validating our model on the balance sheets of First Republic Bank, US Bancorp, and PNC Financial Services Group Inc.</description>
