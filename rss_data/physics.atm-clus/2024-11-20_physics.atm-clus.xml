      <title>High-precision minmax solution of the two-center Dirac equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a high-precision solution of Dirac equation by numerically solving the minmax two-center Dirac equation with the finite element method (FEM). The minmax FEM provide a highly accurate benchmark result for systems with light or heavy atomic nuclear charge $Z$. A result is shown for the molecular ion ${\rm H}_2^+$ and the heavy quasi-molecular ion ${\rm Th}_2^{179+}$, with estimated fractional uncertainties of $\sim 10^{-23}$ and $\sim 10^{-21}$, respectively. The result of the minmax-FEM high-precision of the solution of the two-center Dirac equation, allows solid control over the required accuracy level and is promising for the application and extension of our method.</description>

      <title>Features of the Contact Angle Hysteresis at the Nanoscale: A Molecular Dynamics Insight</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.14986v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the physics of a three-phase contact line between gas, liquid, and solid is important for numerous applications. At the macroscale, the three-phase contact line response to an external force action is often characterized by a contact angle hysteresis, and several models are presented in the literature for its description. Yet, there is still a need for more information about such model applications at the nanoscale. In this study, a molecular dynamics approach was used to investigate the shape of a liquid droplet under an external force for different wetting regimes. In addition, an analytic model for describing the droplet shape was developed. It gives us the possibility to evaluate the receding and advancing wetting angle accurately. With our modeling, we found that the interplay between capillary forces and viscous forces is crucial to characterize the droplet shape at the nanoscale. In this frame, the importance of the rolling movement of the interface between liquid and vapor was pointed out. We also demonstrate that in the range of the external forces when capillary forces are most significant compared to others, hysteresis is well described by the macroscale Cox-Voinov model.</description>

      <title>SPRING: an effective and reliable framework for image reconstruction in single-particle Coherent Diffraction Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07413v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coherent Diffraction Imaging (CDI) is an experimental technique to gain images of isolated structures by recording the light scattered off the sample. In principle, the sample density can be recovered from the scattered light field through a straightforward Fourier Transform operation. However, only the amplitude of the field is recorded, while the phase is lost during the measurement process and has to be retrieved by means of suitable, well-established, phase retrieval algorithms. In this work we present SPRING, an analysis framework tailored on X-ray Free Electron Laser (XFEL) diffraction data that implements the Memetic Phase Retrieval method to mitigate the shortcomings of conventional algorithms. We benchmark the approach on experimental data acquired in two experimental campaigns at SwissFEL and European XFEL. Imaging results on isolated nanostructures reveal unprecedented stability and resilience of the algorithm's behavior on the input parameters, as well as the capability of identifying the solution in conditions hardly treatable so far with conventional methods. A user-friendly implementation of SPRING is released as open-source software, aiming at being a reference tool for the coherent diffraction imaging community at XFEL and synchrotron facilities.</description>
