      <title>Could Ball Lightning Be Magnetic Monopoles?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While magnetic monopoles have extensive theoretical justification for their existence, but have proved elusive to observe, ball lightning is both relatively frequently observed and largely unexplained theoretically. It was first proposed in 1990 that ball lightning might result from the catalysis of nuclear fission by a magnetic monopole. The observed frequency of ball lightning does not conflict with current upper theoretical or observational bounds for magnetic monopole flux. Some possible mechanisms to account for the association of magnetic-monopole-caused ball lightning with thunderstorms are described, and proposals for further observational and theoretical research are made.</description>

      <title>High-Quality Axions from Higher-Form Symmetries in Extra Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The extra-dimensional axion solves the strong CP problem while largely circumventing the quality problem that plagues its four-dimensional counterparts. Such high quality can be clearly understood in terms of the generalized global symmetries of the higher-dimensional theory. We emphasize that an electric one-form symmetry is entirely responsible for protecting the potential of axions arising from 5D gauge theories and use this to systematically characterize the extra-dimensional axion quality problem. We identify three ways of breaking this one-form symmetry to generate an axion potential: adding electrically charged matter, gauging a magnetic higher-form symmetry, and turning on an ABJ anomaly. In the latter case, we identify new ways of generating an axion potential via extra-dimensional magnetic monopoles. We also discuss how the axion is modified if the protective electric one-form symmetry is itself gauged. Finally, we relate these effects to gravitational expectations for the quality problem via generalized weak gravity conjectures. The clarity that generalized symmetries bring to the extra-dimensional axion quality problem highlights their relevance to particle phenomenology.</description>

      <title>Star Shearing Season -- Transient Signals in Wave-like Dark Matter Experiments from Black Hole Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ordinary matter coupled to light weakly interacting bosons can lead to the formation of a macroscopic bosonic field in the vicinity of large matter concentrations such as ordinary or neutron stars. When these objects are turned into black holes due to a supernova or a binary merger this ''hair'' could be ''shorn'' off. Part of the field configuration would then be released leading to an outgoing field wave. For small masses this field transient remains rather compact and can induce a transient signal in experiments, in particular those that look for wave-like dark matter. This signal can be correlated with the corresponding astrophysical signal of the event. In this note, we consider a variety of couplings and the associated signals and estimate the corresponding sensitivities.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous symmetry breaking, gauge hierarchy and electroweak vacuum metastability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The so-called metastability bound asserts that an unnaturally small Higgs mass is a necessary condition for electroweak vacuum metastability, offering a new approach towards solving the hierarchy problem. So far, this result relies on the assumption of a negative Higgs mass parameter, or equivalently, on electroweak spontaneous symmetry breaking. We derive a new, corresponding bound for the case of a positive mass parameter. When the new bound is significantly more restrictive than or comparable to its established counterpart, it may offer an explanation for the sign of the Higgs mass parameter, and thus, spontaneous symmetry breaking itself. New physics at scales $\mathcal{O} (1-10)$ TeV can lower these bounds as far as the TeV-scale. As an illustration, we consider vacuum stability in the presence of additional TeV-scale fermions with Yukawa couplings to the Higgs, as well as a dimension-six term parameterizing new physics in the UV. This scenario requires new physics that couples strongly to the Higgs, and can potentially be probed at future colliders. Finally, to allow for comparison with concrete mechanisms predicting metastability, we provide the mass-dependent lifetime of the electroweak vacuum for this model.</description>

      <title>Factorization restoration through Glauber gluons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the low-energy dynamics of gap-between-jets cross sections at hadron colliders, for which phase factors in the hard amplitudes spoil collinear cancellations and lead to double (``super-leading'') logarithmic behavior. Based on a method-of-regions analysis, we identify three-loop contributions from perturbative active-active Glauber-gluon exchanges with the right structure to render the cross section consistent with PDF factorization below the gap veto scale. The Glauber contributions we identify are unambiguously defined without regulators beyond dimensional regularization.</description>

      <title>Toward a first-principles description of transverse momentum dependent Drell-Yan production in proton-nucleus collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the parton dynamics in Drell-Yan collisions involving proton-nuclei interactions in the limit of small transverse momentum, emphasizing the role of the cold nuclear matter effects. The distribution of transverse momentum that enter into these collisions differs from that in Drell-Yan collisions with free nucleons in two distinct ways: the intrinsic parton structure of the TMDs are altered, the perturbative dynamics undergo additional modification due to interactions with the nuclear medium. In this paper, we focus on the perturbative dynamics, which we demonstrate enter from forward scattering between the parton constituents of the proton and the nuclear medium. We then derive these partonic contributions to the TMD Drell-Yan cross section up to next-to-leading order in the strong coupling constant and to the first order in the medium opacity. We demonstrate that the collinear and rapidity divergences related to parton showers in matter lead to i) an in-medium renormalization group equation that encodes the transverse momentum dependence of parton energy loss, and ii) a Balitsky-Fadin-Kuraev-Lipatov evolution equation for the forward scattering cross section. We discuss the relation of our results to the phenomenological extraction of nuclear TMDs and apply the new formalism to Drell-Yan production at small transverse momenta in $p$+$A$ reactions.</description>

      <title>Positivity Bounds in Scalar Effective Field Theories at One-loop Level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parameters in an effective field theory can be subject to certain positivity bounds if one requires a UV completion that obeys the fundamental principles of quantum field theory. These bounds are relatively straight forward at the tree level, but would become more obscure when loop effects are important. Using scalar theories as examples, we carefully exam the positivity bounds in a case where the leading contribution to a forward elastic amplitude arises at the one-loop level, and point out certain subtleties in terms of the implications of positivity bounds on the theory parameter space. In particular, the one-loop generated dimension-8 operator coefficients (that would be positive if generated at the tree level), as well as their $\beta$-functions are generally not subject to positivity bounds as they might correspond to interference terms of the cross sections under the optical theorem, which could have either sign. A strict positivity bound can only be implied when all contributions at the same loop order are considered, including the ones from dim-4 and dim-6 operator coefficients, which have important effects at the one-loop level. Our results may have important implications on the robustness of experimental tests of positivity bounds.</description>

      <title>Search for fast-oscillating fundamental constants with space missions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While it is possible to estimate the dark matter density at the Sun distance from the galactic center, this does not give information on actual dark matter density in the Solar system. There can be considerable local enhancement of dark matter density in the vicinity of gravitating centers, including the Sun, the Earth, as well as other planets in the solar system. Generic mechanisms for the formation of such halos were recently elucidated. In this work, we studies the possible halo dark matter overdensities and corresponding dark matter masses allowed for various objects in the solar system. We explore spacecraft missions to detect such halos with instruments such as quantum clocks, atomic and molecular spectrometers designed to search for fast (tens of hertz to gigahertz) oscillations of fundamental constants, highly sensitive comagnetometers, and other quantum sensors and sensor networks.</description>

      <title>Flavor invariants for the SM with one singlet vector-like quark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the flavor invariants of the SM augmented by one singlet vector-like quark. Aided by the Hilbert series, we construct all the basic invariants with which any flavor invariant can be written as a polynomial. In special, this theory contains one CP odd invariant of degree six which has degree much lower than the usual Jarlskog invariant of the SM. We find the nonlinear polynomial relations (syzygies) of lowest degrees involving these basic invariants, including the expression of the square of the CP odd invariant of lowest degree in terms of CP even invariants. The $SU(3)$ identity underlying this syzygy is uncovered in terms of invariant tensors, which can be applied to rewrite any square of a CP odd invariant of the same form, involving three hermitean matrices of size three. We demonstrate by an example that there is CP violation that is not detected by the CP odd invariants proposed in the literature so far but it can be detected with the full list of CP odd invariants found here.</description>

      <title>Exact NNLO corrections vs K-factors in PDF fits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parton distribution functions (PDFs) often include datasets corresponding to processes whereby the theoretical predictions at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in peturbative QCD have to be approximated, and this approximation may be performed using K-factors, which in turn depend on the PDF set used to compute them. In this study, we investigate the impact of K-factors produced with various PDF sets, namely CT18, MSHT20 and NNPDF4.0 on (differential) cross sections of top pair production at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Furthermore, we perform a new fit (otherwise analogous to NNPDF4.0 with MHOUs) where the exact NNLO corrections are used in the fitting procedure and compare the K-factors obtained from this fit with those obtained from the above mentioned PDF sets. We find good agreement amongst K-factors obtained from these different PDF sets.</description>

      <title>Probing Non-Thermal Gravitinos Through Large-Scale Structure Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10585v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of non-thermally produced dark matter on large-scale structure formation, focusing on the gravitino dark matter. Our analysis shows that large-scale structure measurements from the SDSS LRG data offer a promising approach to probing non-thermally produced gravitinos. Specifically, if gravitinos resulting from neutralino decay constitute a fraction $F_\text{dec}=0.35~(0.1)$ of the dark matter component, the data exclude bino-like neutralino with a mass $m_{\chi_1^0}\lesssim25~(11)\text{ GeV}$. Furthermore, this constraint appears to be largely independent of the gravitino mass.</description>

      <title>Analyses of Neutrino Masses in the CP-Violating Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article examines the patterns of neutrino masses within the framework of an analytically solvable, CP-violating Standard Model (CPVSM). Using two experimentally determined mass-squared differences (MSDs), $\Delta_a$ and $\Delta_b$, three neutrino masses are predicted.
  In the CPVSM, when $\bf C$ = 0, or equivalently $\gamma$ = 0, two of the three mass eigenvalues within a fermion type become degenerate. This suggests that the splitting of these masses may have resulted from a symmetry-breaking event in the early universe.
  The study explores all six possible correspondences between the experimentally observed $\Delta_a$ and $\Delta_b$ and three quantities $\Delta_{hl}$, $\Delta_{ml}$, and $\Delta_{hm}$. Of these six scenarios, four provide reasonable predictions for the neutrino masses, while two are logically excluded. The model predicts similar values for the heaviest neutrino mass, $m_h \approx 5.0 \cdot 10^{-2}$ eV, and the lightest mass, $m_l \approx 6.091 \cdot 10^{-3}$ eV. However, it offers two possible values for the middle mass: $m_m \approx 4.973 \cdot 10^{-2}$ eV or $m_m \approx 1.055 \cdot 10^{-2}$ eV. Additionally, CP violation in the lepton sector is predicted to be about 73 orders of magnitude weaker than that in the quark sector.</description>

      <title>Neutrino Mass Origin and Flavored-QCD axion in an Extra-Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a unified flavor model with the Standard Model fields on two 3-branes within an extra-dimensional setup, incorporating $\Gamma_N\times U(1)_X$ symmetry with a modulus and scalar field responsible for symmetry breaking. When compactified to four dimensions, Yukawa couplings, initially expressed as modular forms with mass dimensions, are normalized to conform to canonical four-dimensional theory, with the Yukawa coefficients being complex numbers of unit absolute value. We show that this model naturally explains the mass and mixing hierarchies of quarks and leptons, solves the strong CP problem, provides a natural solution to the hierarchy problem, and can inherently satisfy no axionic domain-wall problem. The $U(1)_X$ mixed gravitational anomaly-free condition necessitates that electrically neutral mirror bulk fermions couple to the normal neutrino field on the 3-brane, consistent with the boundary condition. Consequently, we demonstrate a mechanism for generating light neutrino masses, similar to the Weinberg operator, by transmitting the information of $U(1)_X$ breakdown between the two 3-branes. The scale of $U(1)_X$ breaking is estimated from neutrino data to be around $10^{15}$ GeV, leading to a QCD axion mass of approximately $2.5\times10^{-9}$ eV. Through numerical analysis, we demonstrate that the model yields results consistent with current experimental data on quarks and leptons, and it also provides predictions for neutrinos.</description>

      <title>Productions of bottom and bottom-strange mesons in pion and kaon induced reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work, we propose to explore the productions of the bottom and bottom-strange mesons in the high-energy pion and kaon-induced reactions on a proton target. The cross sections are evaluated with an effective Lagrangian constructed by the heavy-quark limit and chiral symmetry. Our estimations show that at $P_\pi=80$ GeV, the cross sections for $B(5279)$, $B^\ast (5325)$, $B_0^\ast (5738)$, $B_1^\prime (5757)$, $B_1(5721)$ and $B_2^\ast (5747)$ production processes are estimated to be $3.19 \sim 86.26$, $1.86\sim 51.29$, $0.87 \sim 24.25$, $0.84 \sim 23.14$, $162.35 \sim 4477.66$, and $57.16 \sim 1604.43$ nb, respectively, where uncertainties arise from the model parameter. In addition, the cross sections for the corresponding bottom-strange mesons production processes are very similar. Moreover, our estimations indicate that the ratios of these cross sections are almost independent on the model parameters. In particular, the cross-section ratios related to the states in the same doublets are of order one, which is consistent with the expectation of heavy-quark limit. The cross sections related to the states in the $T$ doublets are about two orders larger than those related to the states in the $S$ doublets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the family of Feynman integrals related to the H-graph with unequal masses in relativistic quantum field theory. We present an $\varepsilon$-factorised differential equation for the 40 master integrals. The alphabet consists of 29 dlog-forms with algebraic arguments, involving six square roots. As these square roots are not simultaneously rationalizable, we express the master integrals in terms of iterated integrals. In addition, we express the H-graph with unit powers of the propagators up to weight four in terms of multiple polylogarithms in compact form.</description>

      <title>QCD corrections to the Golden decay channel of the Higgs boson</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precision studies within the Higgs sector of the Standard Model are crucial to deepen our understanding of the fundamental interactions and uncovering new physics phenomena beyond the Standard Model. To fully leverage the potential of future precision machines aiming to provide highly precise experimental measurements of the Higgs properties, it is crucial to minimize theoretical errors in the Higgs sector observables, such as production and decay rates.
  In this thesis, we focus on providing precise predictions for observables associated with the Golden decay channel of the Higgs boson. We improve theoretical predictions for the partial decay width of this channel, specifically $H \to Z^{(*)}Z^{(*)} \to e^+ e^- \mu^+ \mu^-$, by incorporating NNLO mixed QCD-electroweak corrections in perturbation theory. We also describe the full analytical evaluation of the two-loop master integrals appearing in the $\mathcal{O}(\alpha \alpha_s)$ corrections to the $HZZ$ vertex with both $Z$-bosons being off-shell, employing the method of differential equations retaining full mass dependence. The analytic results for all the master integrals are obtained in terms of Chen's iterated integrals with logarithmic kernels order-by-order in the dimensional regularization parameter $\epsilon$, along with analytic boundary constants.
  This thesis also presents a phenomenological study of the $H \to e^+ e^- \mu^+ \mu^-$ decay at $\mathcal{O}(\alpha \alpha_s)$ by implementing the entire calculation of the decay amplitude in the public code Hto4l to perform the phase space integration over final state leptons. We study the impact of these mixed QCD-electroweak corrections on the invariant mass distribution of the final-state leptons and angular variables, specifically the angle between the decay planes of the intermediate $Z$-bosons relative to leading-order predictions and NLO electroweak corrections.</description>

      <title>Excluding Primordial Black Holes as Dark Matter Based on Solar System Ephemeris</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current cosmological constraints allow primordial black holes (PBHs) to constitute dark matter in the mass range of 10^{18}-10^{22}g. We show that a major portion of this logarithmic window can be ruled-out based on the Solar System ephemeris, given that the external mass enclosed within 50 au from the Sun did not change by more than ~5x10^{-14} solar masses per year in recent decades.</description>

      <title>Stability of the Standard Model Vacuum with Vector-Like Leptons: A Critical Examination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stability of the Standard Model (SM) Higgs vacuum is a long-standing issue in particle physics. The SM Higgs quartic coupling parameter is expected to become negative at high scales, potentially generating an unstable vacuum well before reaching the Planck scale. We investigate whether the introduction of vector-like leptons (VLLs) in six distinct gauge anomaly-independent representations can stabilize the SM vacuum without introducing additional scalar fields. By analyzing the mass spectrum and mixing angles of these VLLs with the SM leptons, we identify conditions under which the Higgs potential remains stable. We demonstrate that there exists a set of allowed but narrowed VLL spectra that can indeed stabilize the SM vacuum. We also study the effect of these VLLs on electroweak precision observables, particularly the oblique parameters S and T to ensure fit within global experimental constraints. Finally, we perform a comprehensive analysis of the parameter space allowed by electroweak precision data and the parameter space required for stability, highlighting cases that accommodate both. This study opens up new avenues for understanding the role of vector-like leptons in extending the validity of the Standard Model up to the Planck scale.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the jet angular broadening with $\gamma-$jet in high-energy nuclear collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medium modification of jet substructure within the hot and dense nuclear matter has attracted enormous interest from the heavy-ion physics community in recent years. Measurements of inclusive jet show the angular narrowing in nucleus-nucleus collisions, while the recent CMS results of the photon-tagged jets ($\gamma-$jet) indicate hints of broadening. In this work, we conduct a theoretical study on the angular structure of inclusive jet and $\gamma-$jet with a transport approach considering the jet energy loss and the medium response in the quark-gluon plasma. We carry out the girth modification of $\gamma-$jet in $0-30\%$ PbPb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$ 5.02 TeV, which shows a satisfactory agreement with the recent CMS measurement. We explore the connection between the selection bias and the jet kinematics when choosing different $x_{j\gamma}=p_T^{\rm jet}/p_T^{\gamma}$ threshold. Importantly, we quantitatively demonstrate that $\gamma-$jet provides significant advantages to reduce the selection bias and can effectively collect jets sufficiently quenched in PbPb collisions compared to the inclusive jet, which is critical to capture the jet angular broadening observed by CMS. We further estimate the contributions of the medium-induced gluon radiation and the medium response to the broadening of the jet angular substructure.</description>

      <title>Lambda transverse polarization in NA61\SHINE at the CERN SPS: feasibility studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spin polarization of $\Lambda$ hyperons produced in inclusive reactions with unpolarized protons on unpolarized targets has been studied for almost 40 years. The NA61\SHINE experiment at the CERN SPS has a great potential to study transverse polarization in p-p and p-A collisions. In this work, we discuss the impact of magnetic field and limited detector acceptance on the possible polarization measurement by this experiment. Our analysis shows that the magnetic field impact on the $\Lambda$ polarization due to precession is one order of magnitude smaller than the detector acceptance-based polarization bias, and the identification of an experimental signal similar to that observed before by other experiments is possible.</description>

      <title>Theory-agnostic searches for non-gravitational modes in black hole ringdown</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In any extension of General Relativity (GR), extra fundamental degrees of freedom couple to gravity. Besides deforming GR forecasts in a theory-dependent way, this coupling generically introduces extra modes in the gravitational-wave signal. We propose a novel theory-agnostic test of gravity to search for these nongravitational modes in black hole merger ringdown signals. To leading order in the GR deviations, their frequencies and damping times match those of a test scalar or vector field in a Kerr background, with only amplitudes and phases as free parameters. This test will be highly valuable for future detectors, which will achieve signal-to-noise ratios higher than 100 (and as high as 1000 for space-based detectors such as LISA). Such sensitivity will allow measurement of these modes with amplitude ratios as low as 0.05 for ground-based detectors (and as low as 0.008 for LISA), relative to the fundamental mode, enabling stringent agnostic constraints or detection of scalar/vector modes. By applying this test to GW150914, GW190521, and GW200129, we find that the current evidence for an extra mode is comparable to that for the first gravitational overtone, but its inclusion modifies the inferred remnant spin.</description>

      <title>Gravitational effects on fluid dynamics in cosmological first-order phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmological first-order phase transition (FOPT) sources the stochastic gravitational wave background (SWGB) through bubble collisions, sound waves, and turbulence. So far, most studies on the fluid profile of an expanding bubble are limited to transitions that complete in a much shorter time scale than the cosmic expansion. In this study, we investigate gravitational effects on the fluid profile beyond the self-similar regime. For this purpose we combine a hydrodynamic scheme in the presence of gravity with a fluid computation scheme under energy injection from the bubble wall. By performing (1+1)d simulations of spherical bubble for constant wall velocities, we find that the fluid generally develops a thinner shell in our cosmological setup, which qualitatively agrees with previous studies discussing the late-time behavior of fluid in expanding spacetime. We also observe reduction in the energy budget for the fluid kinetic energy. Furthermore, we find that the fluid profile develops sub-structure for accelerating bubble walls. We also comment on the possible broadening of the SGWB spectral plateau.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from graviton Bremsstrahlung with kination phase</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) from gravitational three-body decay (graviton Bremsstrahlung process) can leave an indelible signal at ultrahigh frequencies. We focus on a scenario where superheavy particles are produced gravitationally at a transition between the inflationary and kination phases and analyze the detectability of the signal in the presence of GWs generated from the vacuum fluctuations during inflation. We find that, in many cases, GWs from the graviton Bremsstrahlung are buried in the stochastic gravitational wave background originating from inflation. However, if the superheavy particles are as heavy as the Planck scale, the graviton Bremsstrahlung can produce a sizable amount of GWs, surpassing the inflationary ones.</description>

      <title>CMB Implications of Multi-field Axio-dilaton Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Axio-dilaton models are among the simplest scalar-tensor theories that contain the two-derivative interactions that naturally compete at low energies with the two-derivative inter-actions of General Relativity. Such models are well-motivated as the low energy fields arising from string theory compactification. We summarize these motivations and compute their cosmological evolution, in which the dilaton acts as dark energy and its evolution provides a framework for dynamically evolving particle masses. The derivative axion-dilaton couplings play an important role in the success of these cosmologies. We derive the equations for fluctuations needed to study their implications for the CMB anisotropy, matter spectra and structure growth. We use a modified Boltzmann code to study in detail four benchmark parameter choices, including the vanilla Yoga model, and identify couplings that give viable cosmologies, including some with surprisingly large matter-scalar interactions. The axion has negligible potential for most of the cosmologies we consider but we also examine a simplified model for which the axion potential plays a role, using axion-matter couplings motivated by phenomenological screening considerations. We find such choices can also lead to viable cosmologies.</description>

      <title>Search for the Hawking radiation of primordial black holes: prospective sensitivity of LHAASO</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) with initial mass $\sim5\times10^{14}$ g are evaporating due to Hawking radiation, leading to bursts of very-high-energy gamma rays. In this work, we investigate the prospective sensitivity of the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) to measure the local burst rate density of PBHs. Our findings reveal that LHAASO is capable of searching for the PBH bursts within a distance $\sim0.1$ pc from the sun and thereby measure the local burst rate density $\sim$ 1164 (or 699)$\,\mathrm{pc}^{-3}\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ at $99\%$ confidence level during a 3 (or 5) year observing run. This stands for a sensitivity that is one order of magnitude stronger than the strongest observational constraint from the High Altitude Water Cherenkov Observatory (HAWC). In addition, we further suggest an observing strategy to search for the PBH bursts during upcoming observing runs of LHAASO.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The operation of upcoming ultra-high-energy cosmic-ray, gamma-ray, and neutrino radio-detection experiments, like the Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection (GRAND), poses significant computational challenges involving the production of numerous simulations of particle showers and their detection, and a high data throughput. GRANDlib is an open-source software tool designed to meet these challenges. Its primary goal is to perform end-to-end simulations of the detector operation, from the interaction of ultra-high-energy particles, through -- by interfacing with external air-shower simulations -- the ensuing particle shower development and its radio emission, to its detection by antenna arrays and its processing by data-acquisition systems. Additionally, GRANDlib manages the visualization, storage, and retrieval of experimental and simulated data. We present an overview of GRANDlib to serve as the basis of future GRAND analyses.</description>

Abstract: The initial phase of the inspiral process of a binary system producing gravitational waves can be described by perturbation theory. At the third post-Minkowskian order a two-loop double box graph, known as H-graph contributes. We consider the case where the two objects making up the binary system have equal masses. We express all master integrals related to the equal-mass H-graph up to weight four in terms of multiple polylogarithms. We provide a numerical program which evaluates all master integrals up to weight four in the physical regions with arbitrary precision.</description>

      <title>Large $N_c$ QCD phase diagram at $\mu_B = 0$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07333v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lattice studies suggest that at zero baryon chemical potential and increasing temperature there are three characteristic regimes in QCD that are connected by smooth analytical crossovers: a hadron gas regime at T &lt; T_ch ~ 155 MeV, an intermediate regime, called stringy fluid, at T_ch &lt; T &lt; ~ 3 T_ch, and a quark-gluon plasma regime at higher temperatures. These regimes have been interpreted to reflect different approximate symmetries and effective degrees of freedom. In the hadron gas the effective degrees of freedom are hadrons and the approximate chiral symmetry of QCD is spontaneously broken. The intermediate regime has been interpreted as lacking spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking along with the emergence of new approximate symmetry, chiral spin symmetry, that is not a symmetry of the Dirac Lagrangian, but is a symmetry of the confining part of the QCD Lagrangian. While the high temperature regime is the usual quark-gluon plasma which is often considered to reflect "deconfinement" in some way. This paper explores the behavior of these regimes of QCD as the number of colors in the theory, N_c, gets large. In the large N_c limit the theory is center-symmetric and notions of confinement and deconfinement are unambiguous. The energy density is O(N_c^0) in the meson gas, O(N_c^1) in the intermediate regime and O(N_c^2) in the quark-gluon plasma regime. In the large N_c limit these regimes may become distinct phases separated by first order phase transitions. The intermediate phase has the peculiar feature that glueballs should exist and have properties that are unchanged from what is seen in the vacuum (up to 1/N_c corrections), while the ordinary dilute gas of mesons with broken chiral symmetry disappears and approximate chiral spin symmetry should emerge.</description>

      <title>Bayesian method for fitting the low-energy constants in chiral perturbation theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.10423v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The values of the low-energy constants (LECs) are very important in the chiral perturbation theory. This paper adopts a Bayesian method with the truncation errors to globally fit eight next-to-leading order (NLO) LECs $L_i^r$ and next-to-next-leading order (NNLO) LECs $C_i^r$. With the estimation of the truncation errors, the fitting results of $L_i^r$ in the NLO and NNLO are very close. The posterior distributions of $C_i^r$ indicate the boundary-dependent relations of these $C_i^r$. Ten $C_i^r$ are weakly dependent on the boundaries and their values are reliable. The other $C_i^r$ are required more experimental data to constrain their boundaries. Some linear combinations of $C_i^r$ are also fitted with more reliable posterior distributions. If one knows some more precise values of $C_i^r$, some other $C_i^r$ can be obtained by these values. With these fitting LECs, most observables provide a good convergence, except for the $\pi K$ scattering lengths $a_0^{3/2}$ and $a_0^{1/2}$. An example is also introduced to test the improvement of the method. All the computations indicate that considering the truncation errors can improve the global fit greatly, and more prior information can obtain better fitting results. This fitting method can be extended to the other effective field theories and the perturbation theory.</description>

Abstract: We propose a method for remotely detecting backward reflection via induced decay of cold dark matter such as axion in the background of a propagating coherent photon field. This method can be particularly useful for probing concentrated dark matter streams by Earth's gravitational lensing effect. Formulae for the stimulated reflection process and the expected sensitivities in local and remote experimental approaches are provided for testing eV scale axion models using broad band lasers. The generic axion-photon coupling is expected to be explorable up to ${\cal O}(10^{-12})$ GeV${}^{-1}$ and ${\cal O}(10^{-22})$ GeV${}^{-1}$ for the idealized local and remote setups, respectively.</description>

Abstract: One of the celebrated tools in explaining the Hydrogen atom is Born-Oppenheimer approximation. The resemblance of $QQ\bar{q}\bar{q}$ tetraquarks to Hydrogen atom within Quantum chromodynamics (QCD) implies usage of Born-Oppenheimer approximation for these multiquark states. In this work, we use dynamical diquark model to calculate mass spectra and sizes of doubly charmed and charged tetraquark states denoted as $T_{cc}^{++}$. Our results for mass spectra indicate some bound state candidates with respect to corresponding two-meson thresholds. Calculation of expectation values of $\sqrt{\langle r^2 \rangle}$ reflects that doubly charmed and charged tetraquark states are compact.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14229v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we illustrate how to use the newly proposed $\tau$ re-clustering algorithm to select jets with different degrees of quenching without biasing their initial transverse momentum spectrum. Our study is based on Z+jet simulated events using the JEWEL Monte Carlo event generator to account for jet quenching effects. We apply the $\tau$ re-clustering algorithm to extract a proxy for a time axis (formation time) within the evolving medium. This information allows us to label jets according to their fragmentation pattern and select populations with enhanced sensitivity to quenching effects. Our results illustrate the potential of jets as precision tools for QGP tomography. Further, we show that the discussed method minimizes the biases stemming from $p_{T}$-, $dR$- or mass-based jet selection.</description>

Abstract: This study introduces a novel Graph Neural Network (GNN) architecture that leverages infrared and collinear (IRC) safety and equivariance to enhance the analysis of collider data for Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) discoveries. By integrating equivariance in the rapidity-azimuth plane with IRC-safe principles, our model significantly reduces computational overhead while ensuring theoretical consistency in identifying BSM scenarios amidst Quantum Chromodynamics backgrounds. The proposed GNN architecture demonstrates superior performance in tagging semi-visible jets, highlighting its potential as a robust tool for advancing BSM search strategies at high-energy colliders.</description>

      <title>Perturbative QCD meets phase quenching: The pressure of cold quark matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02180v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonperturbative inequalities constrain the thermodynamic pressure of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) with its phase-quenched version, a Sign-Problem-free theory amenable to lattice treatment. In the perturbative regime with a small QCD coupling constant $\alpha_s$, one of these inequalities manifests as an $O(\alpha_s^3)$ difference between the phase-quenched and QCD pressures at large baryon chemical potential. In this work, we generalize state-of-the-art algorithmic techniques used in collider physics in vacuum quantum field theory to address large-scale multiloop computations at finite chemical potential, by direct numerical integration of Feynman diagrams in momentum space. Using this novel approach, we evaluate this $O(\alpha_s^3)$ difference and show that it is a gauge-independent and small positive number compared to the known perturbative coefficients at this order. This implies that at high baryon densities, phase-quenched lattice simulations can provide a complementary nonperturbative method for accurately determining the pressure of cold quark matter at $O(\alpha_s^3)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18872v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a QCD analysis of the twist-three parton distribution functions associated with the spin-orbit correlation of quarks and gluons in spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ and spin-0 hadrons. We derive exact non-perturbative identities decomposing the spin-orbit correlations into the Wandzura-Wilczek part and the genuine twist-three part. In the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ case, the result is partially related to the kinematical twist-three part of the $g_T(x)$ distribution familiar in the context of transverse spin physics. We use these identities to obtain a novel longitudinal momentum sum rule which may be regarded as the momentum version of the Jaffe-Manohar spin sum rule.
  We explore the physical interpretation of the sum rule and make a connection to the color Lorentz forces and their associated potential energies.</description>

The function to be transformed needs to be evaluated on a grid of points that is independent of the argument of the Bessel function.

Abstract: This paper proposes a method to determine the effective potential using the multicritical-point principle (MPP) under the additional scalar field. The MPP is applied to the model in which a singlet dark fermion and a singlet real scalar field are added to the Standard Model (SM) to predict the dark fermion mass. As a result, the dark fermion mass is predicted to be about $901$--$972$ GeV.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12301v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Measuring vector-boson scattering beyond the fully-leptonic final state is becoming possible at the LHC, which demands to have a solid control on the theory predictions for all final states of this class of processes. In this work we present a full off-shell leading-order calculation for the process $\mathrm{p}\mathrm{p} \to \ell \nu_\ell + 4\mathrm{j}$ in two fiducial regions which are particularly relevant for its experimental measurement. In addition to the fully electroweak order, i.e. $\mathcal{O}(\alpha^6)$, we complement our results with $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_\mathrm{s}\alpha^5)$ and $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_\mathrm{s}^2\alpha^4)$ for inclusive predictions. At $\mathcal{O}(\alpha^6)$ we present for the first time a systematic treatment of the process in double-pole approximation and we perform a detailed study of its range of validity by considering inclusive and differential predictions compared to the full off-shell calculation.</description>

      <title>The Fate of Weakly Bound Light Nuclei in Central Collider Experiments: a Challenge in Favor of a Late Continuous Decoupling Mechanism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02486v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Arguments are presented that the reaction products of central high energy nuclear collisions up to collider energies can rigorously be interpreted in terms of a continuous decoupling mechanism based on continuous equations of motion. The various aspects of the collision dynamics are investigate in terms of the individual decoupling processes. Thereby each observed particle decouples during its own temporal decoupling window. This includes a ``very late'' decoupling of the faintly bound Hypertritons observed in recent ALICE experiments. The success of the strategy is based upon 200 years old wisdom and leads to a revised interpretation of the entire decoupling process.</description>

      <title>Searching for light long-lived particles at SHiNESS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05995v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently Soleti et al. [JHEP03(2024)148] proposed a new experiment called SHiNESS at the upcoming European Spallation Source (ESS) facility, making use of the 2-GeV proton beam there impinging on a fixed target, in order to search for hidden sterile neutrinos that could lie in different mass ranges and arise with distinct signatures. Such signatures include excesses in electron-positron pairs that may originate from displaced decays of long-lived particles (LLPs). At the ESS, the dominant sources of such LLPs are decays at rest of $\pi^+$ mesons and $\mu^+$ leptons. We choose to investigate theoretical scenarios of long-lived light binos in the R-parity-violating supersymmetry and long-lived weak-violating electrophilic axionlike particles, as these LLPs can be produced from decays of $\pi^+$ and $\mu^+$. Since the $\pi^+$'s and $\mu^+$'s decay at rest at the ESS, we compute the spectra of the therefrom produced LLPs, and thus estimate the expected sensitivity reach of SHiNESS to the LLPs in these two scenarios. Our calculation shows that in most of the relevant benchmark scenarios, SHiNESS can probe large parameter regions of these models beyond the existing bounds, in just a couple of years of data-collection time.</description>

      <title>GalaxyFlow: Upsampling Hydrodynamical Simulations for Realistic Mock Stellar Catalogs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.11765v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmological N-body simulations of galaxies operate at the level of "star particles" with a mass resolution on the scale of thousands of solar masses. Turning these simulations into stellar mock catalogs requires "upsampling" the star particles into individual stars following the same phase-space density. In this paper, we introduce two new upsampling methods. First, we describe GalaxyFlow, a sophisticated upsampling method that utilizes normalizing flows to both estimate the stellar phase space density and sample from it. Second, we improve on existing upsamplers based on adaptive kernel density estimation, using maximum likelihood estimation to fine-tune the bandwidth for such algorithms in a way that improves both the density estimation accuracy and upsampling results. We demonstrate our upsampling techniques on a neighborhood of the Solar location in two simulated galaxies: Auriga 6 and h277. Both yield smooth stellar distributions that closely resemble the stellar densities seen in the Gaia DR3 catalog. Furthermore, we introduce a novel multi-model classifier test to compare the accuracy of different upsampling methods quantitatively. This test confirms that GalaxyFlow estimates the density of the underlying star particles more accurately than methods based on kernel density estimation, at the cost of being more computationally intensive.</description>

      <title>No massive black holes in the Milky Way halo</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02386v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The gravitational wave detectors have unveiled a population of massive black holes that do not resemble those observed in the Milky Way. They may have formed due to the evolution of massive low-metallicity stars, dynamical interactions in dense stellar environments, or density fluctuations in the very early Universe (primordial black holes). If the latter hypothesis is correct, primordial black holes should comprise from several to 100% of dark matter to explain the black hole merger rates observed by gravitational wave detectors. If such black holes existed in the Milky Way dark matter halo, they would cause long-timescale gravitational microlensing events lasting years. Here, we present the results of the search for the long-timescale microlensing events among the light curves of 78.7 million stars located in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) that were monitored for 20 years (2001-2020) by the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) survey. We did not find any events with timescales longer than one year. The properties of all thirteen microlensing events with timescales shorter than one year detected by OGLE toward the LMC can be explained by astrophysical objects located either in the LMC itself or in the Milky Way disk, without the need to invoke dark matter in the form of compact objects. We find that compact objects in the mass range from $1.8 \times 10^{-4}\,M_{\odot}$ to $6.3\,M_{\odot}$ cannot compose more than 1% of dark matter, and compact objects in the mass range from $1.3 \times 10^{-5}\,M_{\odot}$ to $860\,M_{\odot}$ cannot make up more than 10% of dark matter. This conclusively rules out primordial black hole mergers as a dominant source of gravitational waves.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we first derive the evolution equation for the general energy-momentum moment of $\delta f$, where $\delta f$ is the deviation from the local equilibrium phase space density. We then introduce a relativistic extension of regularized hydrodynamics developed in the non-relativistic case by Struchtrup and Torrilhon that combines the method of moments and Chapman-Enskog expansion. Hydrodynamic equations up to the third-order in gradients are then systematially derived within the context of a single species system and the relaxation time approximation. This is followed by a series of linear stability and causality analysis. For the system of massless particles without any charge conservation, the third-order hydrodynamics is shown to be linearly stable and causal.</description>

Abstract: Analyzes of astrophysical data provide first hints on the self-interactions of dark matter at low energies. Lattice calculations of dark matter theories can be used to investigate them, especially in the case of strongly-interacting dark matter. We consider Sp(4) gauge theory with two fundamental fermions as a candidate theory. We compute the scattering phase shift for the scattering of two identical dark pions and determine the parameters of the effective range expansion. Our exploratory results in the supposedly most common interaction channel provide a lower limit for the dark matter mass when compared to astrophysical data. We also provide first benchmarks of velocity-weighted cross-sections in the relevant non-relativistic domain.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09323v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the possibility that our universe's current accelerated expansion is explained by a quintessence model with an exponential scalar potential, $V =V_0\, e^{-\lambda\, \phi}$, keeping an eye towards $\lambda \geq \sqrt{2}$ and an open universe, favorable to a string theory realisation and with no cosmological horizon. We work out the full cosmology of the model, including matter, radiation, and optionally negative spatial curvature, for all $\lambda&gt;0$, performing an extensive analysis of the dynamical system and its phase space. The minimal physical requirements of a past epoch of radiation domination and an accelerated expansion today lead to an upper bound $\lambda \lesssim \sqrt{3}$, which is driven slightly up in the presence of observationally allowed spatial curvature. Cosmological solutions start universally in a kination epoch, go through radiation and matter dominated phases and enter an epoch of acceleration, which is only transient for $\lambda&gt;\sqrt{2}$. Field distances traversed between BBN and today are sub-Planckian. We discuss possible string theory origins and phenomenological challenges, such as time variation of fundamental constants. We provide theoretical predictions for the model parameters to be fitted to data, most notably the varying dark energy equation of state parameter, in light of recent results from DES-Y5 and DESI.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave signatures of cogenesis from a burdened PBH</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15858v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the possibility of explaining the observed dark matter (DM) relic abundance, along with matter-antimatter asymmetry, entirely from the evaporation of primordial black holes (PBH) beyond the semi-classical approximation. We find that, depending on the timing of modification to the semi-classical approximation and the efficiency of the backreaction, it is possible to produce the correct DM abundance for PBHs with masses $\gtrsim\mathcal{O}(10^3)$ g, whereas producing the right amount of baryon asymmetry requires light PBHs with masses $\lesssim\mathcal{O}(10^3)$ g, satisfying bounds on the PBH mass from the Cosmic Microwave Background and Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. However, in a simplistic scenario, achieving both {\it simultaneously} is not feasible, typically because of the stringent Lyman-$\alpha$ constraint on warm dark matter mass. In addition to DM and baryon asymmetry, we also investigate the impact of memory burden on dark radiation, evaporated from PBH, constrained by the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$. Furthermore, we demonstrate how induced gravitational waves from PBH density fluctuations can provide a window to test the memory-burden effects, thereby placing constraints on either the DM mass scale or the scale of leptogenesis.</description>

Abstract: The quantum kinetic equation for the gauge-invariant Wigner function, constructed from spinor fields that obey the Dirac equation modified by CPT and Lorentz symmetry-violating terms, is presented. The equations for the components of the Wigner function in the Clifford algebra basis are accomplished. Focusing on the massless case, an extended semiclassical chiral kinetic theory in the presence of external electromagnetic fields is developed. We calculate the chiral currents and establish the anomalous magnetic and separation effects in a Lorentz-violating background. The chiral anomaly within the context of extended quantum electrodynamics is elucidated. Finally, we derive the semiclassical Lorentz-violating extended chiral transport equation.</description>

      <title>Every Poincar\'e gauge theory is conformal: a compelling case for dynamical vector torsion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12826v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Poincar\'e gauge theory (PGT) of gravity provides a viable formulation of general relativity (Einstein-Cartan theory), and a popular model-building framework for modified gravity with torsion. Notoriously, however, the PGT terms which propagate vector torsion lead to strongly-coupled ghosts: the modern view is that only scalar torsion can propagate. To fix this, we revisit the concept of embedding explicit mass scales in scale-invariant theories, showing how the Klein-Gordon theory naturally leads to a slowly-rolling inflaton. We then show that the unique scale-invariant embedding of PGT leads to two new terms, one of which is the Maxwell term for vector torsion. We provide the full spectrum of quantum particles in the resulting theory. Our result means that every PGT is conformal and - after a two-decade hiatus - vector torsion is back on the menu.</description>

      <title>The mass effect -- Variations of masses and their impact on cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16845v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We summarize and explain the current status of variations of fundamental masses in cosmology, with a particular focus on variations of the electron mass. We show that electron mass variations not only allow for significant easing of the Hubble tension but are also preferred at a decent level of significance using the latest DESI data (between $2\sigma$ and $3.6\sigma$ depending on the model and the data). This extreme success of the model is neither tightly constrained from light element abundances generated during big bang nucleosynthesis nor from post-recombination observations using quasars and atomic clocks, though future data is expected to give strong evidence in favor of or against this model. Models of baryon mass variations, on the other hand, are shown to generally not be cosmologically interesting.</description>

      <title>Nuclear Fragmentation at the Future Electron-Ion Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10157v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study low-energy nuclear physics at the future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) at Brookhaven. By comparing the standard theory of electron-nucleus scattering with the equivalent photon method applied to Ultraperipheral Collisions (UPC) at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, we extract valuable insights into both processes. In the limit of extremely high beam energies and small energy transfers, very transparent equations emerge. We apply these equations to analyze nuclear fragmentation in UPCs at the LHC and eA scattering at the EIC, demonstrating that the EIC could facilitate unique photonuclear physics studies.</description>
