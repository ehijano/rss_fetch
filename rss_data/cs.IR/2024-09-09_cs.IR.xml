      <title>A Unified Framework for Cross-Domain Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In addressing the persistent challenges of data-sparsity and cold-start issues in domain-expert recommender systems, Cross-Domain Recommendation (CDR) emerges as a promising methodology. CDR aims at enhancing prediction performance in the target domain by leveraging interaction knowledge from related source domains, particularly through users or items that span across multiple domains (e.g., Short-Video and Living-Room). For academic research purposes, there are a number of distinct aspects to guide CDR method designing, including the auxiliary domain number, domain-overlapped element, user-item interaction types, and downstream tasks. With so many different CDR combination scenario settings, the proposed scenario-expert approaches are tailored to address a specific vertical CDR scenario, and often lack the capacity to adapt to multiple horizontal scenarios. In an effect to coherently adapt to various scenarios, and drawing inspiration from the concept of domain-invariant transfer learning, we extend the former SOTA model UniCDR in five different aspects, named as UniCDR+. Our work was successfully deployed on the Kuaishou Living-Room RecSys.</description>

      <title>QueryBuilder: Human-in-the-Loop Query Development for Information Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frequently, users of an Information Retrieval (IR) system start with an overarching information need (a.k.a., an analytic task) and proceed to define finer-grained queries covering various important aspects (i.e., sub-topics) of that analytic task. We present a novel, interactive system called $\textit{QueryBuilder}$, which allows a novice, English-speaking user to create queries with a small amount of effort, through efficient exploration of an English development corpus in order to rapidly develop cross-lingual information retrieval queries corresponding to the user's information needs. QueryBuilder performs near real-time retrieval of documents based on user-entered search terms; the user looks through the retrieved documents and marks sentences as relevant to the information needed. The marked sentences are used by the system as additional information in query formation and refinement: query terms (and, optionally, event features, which capture event $'triggers'$ (indicator terms) and agent/patient roles) are appropriately weighted, and a neural-based system, which better captures textual meaning, retrieves other relevant content. The process of retrieval and marking is repeated as many times as desired, giving rise to increasingly refined queries in each iteration. The final product is a fine-grained query used in Cross-Lingual Information Retrieval (CLIR). Our experiments using analytic tasks and requests from the IARPA BETTER IR datasets show that with a small amount of effort (at most 10 minutes per sub-topic), novice users can form $\textit{useful}$ fine-grained queries including in languages they don't understand. QueryBuilder also provides beneficial capabilities to the traditional corpus exploration and query formation process. A demonstration video is released at https://vimeo.com/734795835</description>

      <title>Debias Can be Unreliable: Mitigating Bias Issue in Evaluating Debiasing Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work has improved recommendation models remarkably by equipping them with debiasing methods. Due to the unavailability of fully-exposed datasets, most existing approaches resort to randomly-exposed datasets as a proxy for evaluating debiased models, employing traditional evaluation scheme to represent the recommendation performance. However, in this study, we reveal that traditional evaluation scheme is not suitable for randomly-exposed datasets, leading to inconsistency between the Recall performance obtained using randomly-exposed datasets and that obtained using fully-exposed datasets. Such inconsistency indicates the potential unreliability of experiment conclusions on previous debiasing techniques and calls for unbiased Recall evaluation using randomly-exposed datasets. To bridge the gap, we propose the Unbiased Recall Evaluation (URE) scheme, which adjusts the utilization of randomly-exposed datasets to unbiasedly estimate the true Recall performance on fully-exposed datasets. We provide theoretical evidence to demonstrate the rationality of URE and perform extensive experiments on real-world datasets to validate its soundness.</description>

      <title>Incorporate LLMs with Influential Recommender System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recommender systems have achieved increasing accuracy over the years. However, this precision often leads users to narrow their interests, resulting in issues such as limited diversity and the creation of echo chambers. Current research addresses these challenges through proactive recommender systems by recommending a sequence of items (called influence path) to guide user interest in the target item. However, existing methods struggle to construct a coherent influence path that builds up with items the user is likely to enjoy. In this paper, we leverage the Large Language Model's (LLMs) exceptional ability for path planning and instruction following, introducing a novel approach named LLM-based Influence Path Planning (LLM-IPP). Our approach maintains coherence between consecutive recommendations and enhances user acceptability of the recommended items. To evaluate LLM-IPP, we implement various user simulators and metrics to measure user acceptability and path coherence. Experimental results demonstrate that LLM-IPP significantly outperforms traditional proactive recommender systems. This study pioneers the integration of LLMs into proactive recommender systems, offering a reliable and user-engaging methodology for future recommendation technologies.</description>

      <title>Sequential Recommendation via Adaptive Robust Attention with Multi-dimensional Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sequential recommendation models have achieved state-of-the-art performance using self-attention mechanism. It has since been found that moving beyond only using item ID and positional embeddings leads to a significant accuracy boost when predicting the next item. In recent literature, it was reported that a multi-dimensional kernel embedding with temporal contextual kernels to capture users' diverse behavioral patterns results in a substantial performance improvement. In this study, we further improve the sequential recommender model's robustness and generalization by introducing a mix-attention mechanism with a layer-wise noise injection (LNI) regularization. We refer to our proposed model as adaptive robust sequential recommendation framework (ADRRec), and demonstrate through extensive experiments that our model outperforms existing self-attention architectures.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Diffusion Models for Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While traditional recommendation techniques have made significant strides in the past decades, they still suffer from limited generalization performance caused by factors like inadequate collaborative signals, weak latent representations, and noisy data. In response, diffusion models (DMs) have emerged as promising solutions for recommender systems due to their robust generative capabilities, solid theoretical foundations, and improved training stability. To this end, in this paper, we present the first comprehensive survey on diffusion models for recommendation, and draw a bird's-eye view from the perspective of the whole pipeline in real-world recommender systems. We systematically categorize existing research works into three primary domains: (1) diffusion for data engineering &amp; encoding, focusing on data augmentation and representation enhancement; (2) diffusion as recommender models, employing diffusion models to directly estimate user preferences and rank items; and (3) diffusion for content presentation, utilizing diffusion models to generate personalized content such as fashion and advertisement creatives. Our taxonomy highlights the unique strengths of diffusion models in capturing complex data distributions and generating high-quality, diverse samples that closely align with user preferences. We also summarize the core characteristics of the adapting diffusion models for recommendation, and further identify key areas for future exploration, which helps establish a roadmap for researchers and practitioners seeking to advance recommender systems through the innovative application of diffusion models. To further facilitate the research community of recommender systems based on diffusion models, we actively maintain a GitHub repository for papers and other related resources in this rising direction https://github.com/CHIANGEL/Awesome-Diffusion-for-RecSys.</description>

      <title>NLLB-E5: A Scalable Multilingual Retrieval Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite significant progress in multilingual information retrieval, the lack of models capable of effectively supporting multiple languages, particularly low-resource like Indic languages, remains a critical challenge. This paper presents NLLB-E5: A Scalable Multilingual Retrieval Model. NLLB-E5 leverages the in-built multilingual capabilities in the NLLB encoder for translation tasks. It proposes a distillation approach from multilingual retriever E5 to provide a zero-shot retrieval approach handling multiple languages, including all major Indic languages, without requiring multilingual training data. We evaluate the model on a comprehensive suite of existing benchmarks, including Hindi-BEIR, highlighting its robust performance across diverse languages and tasks. Our findings uncover task and domain-specific challenges, providing valuable insights into the retrieval performance, especially for low-resource languages. NLLB-E5 addresses the urgent need for an inclusive, scalable, and language-agnostic text retrieval model, advancing the field of multilingual information access and promoting digital inclusivity for millions of users globally.</description>

      <title>Replicability Measures for Longitudinal Information Retrieval Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Information Retrieval (IR) systems are exposed to constant changes in most components. Documents are created, updated, or deleted, the information needs are changing, and even relevance might not be static. While it is generally expected that the IR systems retain a consistent utility for the users, test collection evaluations rely on a fixed experimental setup. Based on the LongEval shared task and test collection, this work explores how the effectiveness measured in evolving experiments can be assessed. Specifically, the persistency of effectiveness is investigated as a replicability task. It is observed how the effectiveness progressively deteriorates over time compared to the initial measurement. Employing adapted replicability measures provides further insight into the persistence of effectiveness. The ranking of systems varies across retrieval measures and time. In conclusion, it was found that the most effective systems are not necessarily the ones with the most persistent performance.</description>

      <title>Recommender Systems Algorithm Selection for Ranking Prediction on Implicit Feedback Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recommender systems algorithm selection problem for ranking prediction on implicit feedback datasets is under-explored. Traditional approaches in recommender systems algorithm selection focus predominantly on rating prediction on explicit feedback datasets, leaving a research gap for ranking prediction on implicit feedback datasets. Algorithm selection is a critical challenge for nearly every practitioner in recommender systems. In this work, we take the first steps toward addressing this research gap. We evaluate the NDCG@10 of 24 recommender systems algorithms, each with two hyperparameter configurations, on 72 recommender systems datasets. We train four optimized machine-learning meta-models and one automated machine-learning meta-model with three different settings on the resulting meta-dataset. Our results show that the predictions of all tested meta-models exhibit a median Spearman correlation ranging from 0.857 to 0.918 with the ground truth. We show that the median Spearman correlation between meta-model predictions and the ground truth increases by an average of 0.124 when the meta-model is optimized to predict the ranking of algorithms instead of their performance. Furthermore, in terms of predicting the best algorithm for an unknown dataset, we demonstrate that the best optimized traditional meta-model, e.g., XGBoost, achieves a recall of 48.6%, outperforming the best tested automated machine learning meta-model, e.g., AutoGluon, which achieves a recall of 47.2%.</description>

      <title>Federated Transfer Learning Based Cooperative Wideband Spectrum Sensing with Model Pruning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For ultra-wideband and high-rate wireless communication systems, wideband spectrum sensing (WSS) is critical, since it empowers secondary users (SUs) to capture the spectrum holes for opportunistic transmission. However, WSS encounters challenges such as excessive costs of hardware and computation due to the high sampling rate, as well as robustness issues arising from scenario mismatch. In this paper, a WSS neural network (WSSNet) is proposed by exploiting multicoset preprocessing to enable the sub-Nyquist sampling, with the two dimensional convolution design specifically tailored to work with the preprocessed samples. A federated transfer learning (FTL) based framework mobilizing multiple SUs is further developed to achieve a robust model adaptable to various scenarios, which is paved by the selective weight pruning for the fast model adaptation and inference. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed FTL-WSSNet achieves the fairly good performance in different target scenarios even without local adaptation samples.</description>

      <title>RBoard: A Unified Platform for Reproducible and Reusable Recommender System Benchmarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recommender systems research lacks standardized benchmarks for reproducibility and algorithm comparisons. We introduce RBoard, a novel framework addressing these challenges by providing a comprehensive platform for benchmarking diverse recommendation tasks, including CTR prediction, Top-N recommendation, and others. RBoard's primary objective is to enable fully reproducible and reusable experiments across these scenarios. The framework evaluates algorithms across multiple datasets within each task, aggregating results for a holistic performance assessment. It implements standardized evaluation protocols, ensuring consistency and comparability. To facilitate reproducibility, all user-provided code can be easily downloaded and executed, allowing researchers to reliably replicate studies and build upon previous work. By offering a unified platform for rigorous, reproducible evaluation across various recommendation scenarios, RBoard aims to accelerate progress in the field and establish a new standard for recommender systems benchmarking in both academia and industry. The platform is available at https://rboard.org and the demo video can be found at https://bit.ly/rboard-demo.</description>

      <title>End-to-End Learnable Item Tokenization for Generative Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, generative recommendation has emerged as a promising new paradigm that directly generates item identifiers for recommendation. However, a key challenge lies in how to effectively construct item identifiers that are suitable for recommender systems. Existing methods typically decouple item tokenization from subsequent generative recommendation training, likely resulting in suboptimal performance. To address this limitation, we propose ETEGRec, a novel End-To-End Generative Recommender by seamlessly integrating item tokenization and generative recommendation. Our framework is developed based on the dual encoder-decoder architecture, which consists of an item tokenizer and a generative recommender. In order to achieve mutual enhancement between the two components, we propose a recommendation-oriented alignment approach by devising two specific optimization objectives: sequence-item alignment and preference-semantic alignment. These two alignment objectives can effectively couple the learning of item tokenizer and generative recommender, thereby fostering the mutual enhancement between the two components. Finally, we further devise an alternating optimization method, to facilitate stable and effective end-to-end learning of the entire framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework compared to a series of traditional sequential recommendation models and generative recommendation baselines.</description>

      <title>Rs4rs: Semantically Find Recent Publications from Top Recommendation System-Related Venues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rs4rs is a web application designed to perform semantic search on recent papers from top conferences and journals related to Recommender Systems. Current scholarly search engine tools like Google Scholar, Semantic Scholar, and ResearchGate often yield broad results that fail to target the most relevant high-quality publications. Moreover, manually visiting individual conference and journal websites is a time-consuming process that primarily supports only syntactic searches. Rs4rs addresses these issues by providing a user-friendly platform where researchers can input their topic of interest and receive a list of recent, relevant papers from top Recommender Systems venues. Utilizing semantic search techniques, Rs4rs ensures that the search results are not only precise and relevant but also comprehensive, capturing papers regardless of variations in wording. This tool significantly enhances research efficiency and accuracy, thereby benefitting the research community and public by facilitating access to high-quality, pertinent academic resources in the field of Recommender Systems. Rs4rs is available at https://rs4rs.com.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Graph Contrastive Learning with Reliable and Informative Augmentation for Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph neural network (GNN) has been a powerful approach in collaborative filtering (CF) due to its ability to model high-order user-item relationships. Recently, to alleviate the data sparsity and enhance representation learning, many efforts have been conducted to integrate contrastive learning (CL) with GNNs. Despite the promising improvements, the contrastive view generation based on structure and representation perturbations in existing methods potentially disrupts the collaborative information in contrastive views, resulting in limited effectiveness of positive alignment. To overcome this issue, we propose CoGCL, a novel framework that aims to enhance graph contrastive learning by constructing contrastive views with stronger collaborative information via discrete codes. The core idea is to map users and items into discrete codes rich in collaborative information for reliable and informative contrastive view generation. To this end, we initially introduce a multi-level vector quantizer in an end-to-end manner to quantize user and item representations into discrete codes. Based on these discrete codes, we enhance the collaborative information of contrastive views by considering neighborhood structure and semantic relevance respectively. For neighborhood structure, we propose virtual neighbor augmentation by treating discrete codes as virtual neighbors, which expands an observed user-item interaction into multiple edges involving discrete codes. Regarding semantic relevance, we identify similar users/items based on shared discrete codes and interaction targets to generate the semantically relevant view. Through these strategies, we construct contrastive views with stronger collaborative information and develop a triple-view graph contrastive learning approach. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.</description>

Abstract: Numerous algorithms have been developed for online product rating prediction, but the specific influence of user and product information in determining the final prediction score remains largely unexplored. Existing research often relies on narrowly defined data settings, which overlooks real-world challenges such as the cold-start problem, cross-category information utilization, and scalability and deployment issues. To delve deeper into these aspects, and particularly to uncover the roles of individual user taste and collective wisdom, we propose a unique and practical approach that emphasizes historical ratings at both the user and product levels, encapsulated using a continuously updated dynamic tree representation. This representation effectively captures the temporal dynamics of users and products, leverages user information across product categories, and provides a natural solution to the cold-start problem. Furthermore, we have developed an efficient data processing strategy that makes this approach highly scalable and easily deployable. Comprehensive experiments in real industry settings demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Notably, our findings reveal that individual taste dominates over collective wisdom in online product rating prediction, a perspective that contrasts with the commonly observed wisdom of the crowd phenomenon in other domains. This dominance of individual user taste is consistent across various model types, including the boosting tree model, recurrent neural network (RNN), and transformer-based architectures. This observation holds true across the overall population, within individual product categories, and in cold-start scenarios. Our findings underscore the significance of individual user tastes in the context of online product rating prediction and the robustness of our approach across different model architectures.</description>

      <title>Late Chunking: Contextual Chunk Embeddings Using Long-Context Embedding Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many use cases require retrieving smaller portions of text, and dense vector-based retrieval systems often perform better with shorter text segments, as the semantics are less likely to be "over-compressed" in the embeddings. Consequently, practitioners often split text documents into smaller chunks and encode them separately. However, chunk embeddings created in this way can lose contextual information from surrounding chunks, resulting in suboptimal representations. In this paper, we introduce a novel method called "late chunking," which leverages long context embedding models to first embed all tokens of the long text, with chunking applied after the transformer model and just before mean pooling. The resulting chunk embeddings capture the full contextual information, leading to superior results across various retrieval tasks without the need for additional training. Moreover, our method is generic enough to be applied to any long-context embedding model.</description>

      <title>OneGen: Efficient One-Pass Unified Generation and Retrieval for LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), which have significantly enhanced the generative capabilities for various NLP tasks, LLMs still face limitations in directly handling retrieval tasks. However, many practical applications demand the seamless integration of both retrieval and generation. This paper introduces a novel and efficient One-pass Generation and retrieval framework (OneGen), designed to improve LLMs' performance on tasks that require both generation and retrieval. The proposed framework bridges the traditionally separate training approaches for generation and retrieval by incorporating retrieval tokens generated autoregressively. This enables a single LLM to handle both tasks simultaneously in a unified forward pass. We conduct experiments on two distinct types of composite tasks, RAG and Entity Linking, to validate the pluggability, effectiveness, and efficiency of OneGen in training and inference. Furthermore, our results show that integrating generation and retrieval within the same context preserves the generative capabilities of LLMs while improving retrieval performance. To the best of our knowledge, OneGen is the first to enable LLMs to conduct vector retrieval during the generation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the real world, where information is abundant and diverse across different modalities, understanding and utilizing various data types to improve retrieval systems is a key focus of research. Multimodal composite retrieval integrates diverse modalities such as text, image and audio, etc. to provide more accurate, personalized, and contextually relevant results. To facilitate a deeper understanding of this promising direction, this survey explores multimodal composite editing and retrieval in depth, covering image-text composite editing, image-text composite retrieval, and other multimodal composite retrieval. In this survey, we systematically organize the application scenarios, methods, benchmarks, experiments, and future directions. Multimodal learning is a hot topic in large model era, and have also witnessed some surveys in multimodal learning and vision-language models with transformers published in the PAMI journal. To the best of our knowledge, this survey is the first comprehensive review of the literature on multimodal composite retrieval, which is a timely complement of multimodal fusion to existing reviews. To help readers' quickly track this field, we build the project page for this survey, which can be found at https://github.com/fuxianghuang1/Multimodal-Composite-Editing-and-Retrieval.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Regulatory documents, issued by governmental regulatory bodies, establish rules, guidelines, and standards that organizations must adhere to for legal compliance. These documents, characterized by their length, complexity and frequent updates, are challenging to interpret, requiring significant allocation of time and expertise on the part of organizations to ensure ongoing compliance.Regulatory Natural Language Processing (RegNLP) is a multidisciplinary subfield aimed at simplifying access to and interpretation of regulatory rules and obligations. We define an Automated Question-Passage Generation task for RegNLP, create the ObliQA dataset containing 27,869 questions derived from the Abu Dhabi Global Markets (ADGM) financial regulation document collection, design a baseline Regulatory Information Retrieval and Answer Generation system, and evaluate it with RePASs, a novel evaluation metric that tests whether generated answers accurately capture all relevant obligations and avoid contradictions.</description>

      <title>Extracting the U.S. building types from OpenStreetMap data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building type information is crucial for population estimation, traffic planning, urban planning, and emergency response applications. Although essential, such data is often not readily available. To alleviate this problem, this work creates a comprehensive dataset by providing residential/non-residential building classification covering the entire United States. We propose and utilize an unsupervised machine learning method to classify building types based on building footprints and available OpenStreetMap information. The classification result is validated using authoritative ground truth data for select counties in the U.S. The validation shows a high precision for non-residential building classification and a high recall for residential buildings. We identified various approaches to improving the quality of the classification, such as removing sheds and garages from the dataset. Furthermore, analyzing the misclassifications revealed that they are mainly due to missing and scarce metadata in OSM. A major result of this work is the resulting dataset of classifying 67,705,475 buildings. We hope that this data is of value to the scientific community, including urban and transportation planners.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Chinese Knowledge Rectification in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable generative capabilities, they are not without flaws, particularly in the form of hallucinations. This issue is even more pronounced when LLMs are applied to specific languages and domains. For example, LLMs may generate nonsense information when handling Chinese ancient poetry, proverbs, or idioms, owing to the lack of specific knowledge. To this end, this paper introduces a benchmark for rectifying Chinese knowledge in LLMs via knowledge editing. Specifically, we introduce a new Chinese dataset, CKnowEdit, by collecting seven type of knowledge from various sources, including classical texts, idioms, and content from Baidu Tieba Ruozhiba, thereby accounting for the unique polyphony, antithesis, and logical constructs inherent in the Chinese language. Through the analysis of this dataset, we uncover the challenges faced by current LLMs in mastering Chinese. Furthermore, our evaluation of state-of-the-art knowledge editing techniques on this dataset unveil the substantial scope for advancement in the rectification of Chinese knowledge. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/zjunlp/EasyEdit.</description>

Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the dire necessity to improve public health literacy for societal resilience. YouTube, the largest video-sharing social media platform, provides a vast repository of user-generated health information in a multi-media-rich format which may be easier for the public to understand and use if major concerns about content quality and accuracy are addressed. This study develops an automated solution to identify, retrieve and shortlist medically relevant and understandable YouTube videos that domain experts can subsequently review and recommend for disseminating and educating the public on the COVID-19 pandemic and similar public health outbreaks. Our approach leverages domain knowledge from human experts and machine learning and natural language processing methods to provide a scalable, replicable, and generalizable approach that can also be applied to enhance the management of many health conditions.</description>

      <title>DREAM: A Dual Representation Learning Model for Multimodal Recommendation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11119v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimodal recommendation focuses primarily on effectively exploiting both behavioral and multimodal information for the recommendation task. However, most existing models suffer from the following issues when fusing information from two different domains: (1) Previous works do not pay attention to the sufficient utilization of modal information by only using direct concatenation, addition, or simple linear layers for modal information extraction. (2) Previous works treat modal features as learnable embeddings, which causes the modal embeddings to gradually deviate from the original modal features during learning. We refer to this issue as Modal Information Forgetting. (3) Previous approaches fail to account for the significant differences in the distribution between behavior and modality, leading to the issue of representation misalignment. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel Dual REpresentAtion learning model for Multimodal Recommendation called DREAM. For sufficient information extraction, we introduce separate dual lines, including Behavior Line and Modal Line, in which the Modal-specific Encoder is applied to empower modal representations. To address the issue of Modal Information Forgetting, we introduce the Similarity Supervised Signal to constrain the modal representations. Additionally, we design a Behavior-Modal Alignment module to fuse the dual representations through Intra-Alignment and Inter-Alignment. Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that the proposed DREAM method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results. The source code will be available upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>CoST: Contrastive Quantization based Semantic Tokenization for Generative Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14774v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Embedding-based retrieval serves as a dominant approach to candidate item matching for industrial recommender systems. With the success of generative AI, generative retrieval has recently emerged as a new retrieval paradigm for recommendation, which casts item retrieval as a generation problem. Its model consists of two stages: semantic tokenization and autoregressive generation. The first stage involves item tokenization that constructs discrete semantic tokens to index items, while the second stage autoregressively generates semantic tokens of candidate items. Therefore, semantic tokenization serves as a crucial preliminary step for training generative recommendation models. Existing research usually employs a vector quantizier with reconstruction loss (e.g., RQ-VAE) to obtain semantic tokens of items, but this method fails to capture the essential neighborhood relationships that are vital for effective item modeling in recommender systems. In this paper, we propose a contrastive quantization-based semantic tokenization approach, named CoST, which harnesses both item relationships and semantic information to learn semantic tokens. Our experimental results highlight the significant impact of semantic tokenization on generative recommendation performance, with CoST achieving up to a 43% improvement in Recall@5 and 44% improvement in NDCG@5 on the MIND dataset over previous baselines.</description>

      <title>Keyword-driven Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Models for Cold-start User Recommendations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19612v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant potential in enhancing recommender systems. However, addressing the cold-start recommendation problem, where users lack historical data, remains a considerable challenge. In this paper, we introduce KALM4Rec (Keyword-driven Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Models for Cold-start User Recommendations), a novel framework specifically designed to tackle this problem by requiring only a few input keywords from users in a practical scenario of cold-start user restaurant recommendations. KALM4Rec operates in two main stages: candidates retrieval and LLM-based candidates re-ranking. In the first stage, keyword-driven retrieval models are used to identify potential candidates, addressing LLMs' limitations in processing extensive tokens and reducing the risk of generating misleading information. In the second stage, we employ LLMs with various prompting strategies, including zero-shot and few-shot techniques, to re-rank these candidates by integrating multiple examples directly into the LLM prompts. Our evaluation, using a Yelp restaurant dataset with user reviews from three English-speaking cities, shows that our proposed framework significantly improves recommendation quality. Specifically, the integration of in-context instructions with LLMs for re-ranking markedly enhances the performance of the cold-start user recommender system.</description>

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has achieved significant success in information retrieval to assist large language models LLMs because it builds an external knowledge database. However, it also has many problems, it consumes a lot of memory because of the enormous database, and it cannot update the established index database in time when confronted with massive streaming data. To reduce the memory required for building the database and maintain accuracy simultaneously, we proposed a new approach integrating a streaming algorithm with k-means clustering into RAG. Our approach applied a streaming algorithm to update the index dynamically and reduce memory consumption. Additionally, the k-means algorithm clusters highly similar documents, and the query time would be shortened. We conducted comparative experiments on four methods, and the results indicated that RAG with streaming algorithm and k-means clusters outperforms traditional RAG in accuracy and memory, particularly when dealing with large-scale streaming data.</description>

      <title>Reformulating Conversational Recommender Systems as Tri-Phase Offline Policy Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06809v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing Conversational Recommender Systems (CRS) predominantly utilize user simulators for training and evaluating recommendation policies. These simulators often oversimplify the complexity of user interactions by focusing solely on static item attributes, neglecting the rich, evolving preferences that characterize real-world user behavior. This limitation frequently leads to models that perform well in simulated environments but falter in actual deployment. Addressing these challenges, this paper introduces the Tri-Phase Offline Policy Learning-based Conversational Recommender System (TCRS), which significantly reduces dependency on real-time interactions and mitigates overfitting issues prevalent in traditional approaches. TCRS integrates a model-based offline learning strategy with a controllable user simulation that dynamically aligns with both personalized and evolving user preferences. Through comprehensive experiments, TCRS demonstrates enhanced robustness, adaptability, and accuracy in recommendations, outperforming traditional CRS models in diverse user scenarios. This approach not only provides a more realistic evaluation environment but also facilitates a deeper understanding of user behavior dynamics, thereby refining the recommendation process.</description>

      <title>Deep Tree-based Retrieval for Efficient Recommendation: Theory and Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11345v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the development of deep learning techniques, deep recommendation models also achieve remarkable improvements in terms of recommendation accuracy. However, due to the large number of candidate items in practice and the high cost of preference computation, these methods also suffer from low efficiency of recommendation. The recently proposed tree-based deep recommendation models alleviate the problem by directly learning tree structure and representations under the guidance of recommendation objectives. However, such models have shortcomings. The max-heap assumption in the hierarchical tree, in which the preference for a parent node should be the maximum between the preferences for its children, is difficult to satisfy in their binary classification objectives. To this end, we propose Tree-based Deep Retrieval (TDR for short) for efficient recommendation. In TDR, all the trees generated during the training process are retained to form the forest. When learning the node representation of each tree, we have to satisfy the max-heap assumption as much as possible and mimic beam search behavior over the tree in the training stage. This is achieved by TDR to regard the training task as multi-classification over tree nodes at the same level. However, the number of tree nodes grows exponentially with levels, making us train the preference model with the guidance of the sampled-softmax technique. The experiments are conducted on real-world datasets, validating the effectiveness of the proposed preference model learning method and tree learning method.</description>

      <title>GraphEx: A Graph-based Extraction Method for Advertiser Keyphrase Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03140v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Online sellers and advertisers are recommended keyphrases for their listed products, which they bid on to enhance their sales. One popular paradigm that generates such recommendations is Extreme Multi-Label Classification (XMC), which involves tagging/mapping keyphrases to items. We outline the limitations of using traditional item-query based tagging or mapping techniques for keyphrase recommendations on E-Commerce platforms. We introduce GraphEx, an innovative graph-based approach that recommends keyphrases to sellers using extraction of token permutations from item titles. Additionally, we demonstrate that relying on traditional metrics such as precision/recall can be misleading in practical applications, thereby necessitating a combination of metrics to evaluate performance in real-world scenarios. These metrics are designed to assess the relevance of keyphrases to items and the potential for buyer outreach. GraphEx outperforms production models at eBay, achieving the objectives mentioned above. It supports near real-time inferencing in resource-constrained production environments and scales effectively for billions of items.</description>

      <title>FiNER-ORD: Financial Named Entity Recognition Open Research Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.11157v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over the last two decades, the development of the CoNLL-2003 named entity recognition (NER) dataset has helped enhance the capabilities of deep learning and natural language processing (NLP). The finance domain, characterized by its unique semantic and lexical variations for the same entities, presents specific challenges to the NER task; thus, a domain-specific customized dataset is crucial for advancing research in this field. In our work, we develop the first high-quality English Financial NER Open Research Dataset (FiNER-ORD). We benchmark multiple pre-trained language models (PLMs) and large-language models (LLMs) on FiNER-ORD. We believe our proposed FiNER-ORD dataset will open future opportunities to use FiNER-ORD as a benchmark for financial domain-specific NER and NLP tasks. Our dataset, models, and code are publicly available on GitHub and Hugging Face under CC BY-NC 4.0 license.</description>

      <title>Video Editing for Video Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02335v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Though pre-training vision-language models have demonstrated significant benefits in boosting video-text retrieval performance from large-scale web videos, fine-tuning still plays a critical role with manually annotated clips with start and end times, which requires considerable human effort. To address this issue, we explore an alternative cheaper source of annotations, single timestamps, for video-text retrieval. We initialise clips from timestamps in a heuristic way to warm up a retrieval model. Then a video clip editing method is proposed to refine the initial rough boundaries to improve retrieval performance. A student-teacher network is introduced for video clip editing. The teacher model is employed to edit the clips in the training set whereas the student model trains on the edited clips. The teacher weights are updated from the student's after the student's performance increases. Our method is model agnostic and applicable to any retrieval models. We conduct experiments based on three state-of-the-art retrieval models, COOT, VideoCLIP and CLIP4Clip. Experiments conducted on three video retrieval datasets, YouCook2, DiDeMo and ActivityNet-Captions show that our edited clips consistently improve retrieval performance over initial clips across all the three retrieval models.</description>

      <title>ChatQA 2: Bridging the Gap to Proprietary LLMs in Long Context and RAG Capabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14482v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce ChatQA 2, an Llama 3.0-based model with a 128K context window, designed to bridge the gap between open-source LLMs and leading proprietary models (e.g., GPT-4-Turbo) in long-context understanding and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) capabilities. These two capabilities are essential for LLMs to process large volumes of information that cannot fit into a single prompt and are complementary to each other, depending on the downstream tasks and computational budgets. We present a detailed continued training recipe to extend the context window of Llama3-70B-base from 8K to 128K tokens, along with a three-stage instruction tuning process to enhance the model's instruction-following, RAG performance, and long-context understanding capabilities. Our results demonstrate that the Llama3-ChatQA-2-70B model outperforms most existing state-of-the-art models, including GPT-4-Turbo-2024-04-09, Qwen2-72B-Instruct, and Llama3.1-70B-Instruct, on ultra-long tasks beyond 100K tokens, as well as on the RAG benchmark using only a 4K context window, showing the strong long context capability across varying sequence lengths. We further provide extensive comparisons between direct long-context and RAG solutions using the same state-of-the-art long-context LLMs. Interestingly, we find that the performance of strong long-context LLMs using RAG improves when retrieving a larger number of chunks. With a large set of top-k chunks, RAG consistently outperforms direct long-context solution using the same state-of-the-art long-context models (e.g., Llama3-ChatQA-2-70B and Qwen2-72B-Instruct) on both 32K benchmarks and real-world 128K tasks. To advance research in this field, we open-sourced the model weights, training data, and the evaluation setup for the for the community: https://chatqa2-project.github.io/</description>

      <title>WildVis: Open Source Visualizer for Million-Scale Chat Logs in the Wild</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03753v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The increasing availability of real-world conversation data offers exciting opportunities for researchers to study user-chatbot interactions. However, the sheer volume of this data makes manually examining individual conversations impractical. To overcome this challenge, we introduce WildVis, an interactive tool that enables fast, versatile, and large-scale conversation analysis. WildVis provides search and visualization capabilities in the text and embedding spaces based on a list of criteria. To manage million-scale datasets, we implemented optimizations including search index construction, embedding precomputation and compression, and caching to ensure responsive user interactions within seconds. We demonstrate WildVis' utility through three case studies: facilitating chatbot misuse research, visualizing and comparing topic distributions across datasets, and characterizing user-specific conversation patterns. WildVis is open-source and designed to be extendable, supporting additional datasets and customized search and visualization functionalities.</description>

      <title>Understanding Fairness in Recommender Systems: A Healthcare Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03893v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fairness in AI-driven decision-making systems has become a critical concern, especially when these systems directly affect human lives. This paper explores the public's comprehension of fairness in healthcare recommendations. We conducted a survey where participants selected from four fairness metrics -- Demographic Parity, Equal Accuracy, Equalized Odds, and Positive Predictive Value -- across different healthcare scenarios to assess their understanding of these concepts. Our findings reveal that fairness is a complex and often misunderstood concept, with a generally low level of public understanding regarding fairness metrics in recommender systems. This study highlights the need for enhanced information and education on algorithmic fairness to support informed decision-making in using these systems. Furthermore, the results suggest that a one-size-fits-all approach to fairness may be insufficient, pointing to the importance of context-sensitive designs in developing equitable AI systems.</description>
