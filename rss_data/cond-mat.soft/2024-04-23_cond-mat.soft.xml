      <title>Primitive chain network simulations for double peaks in shear stress under fast flows of bidisperse entangled polymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A few experiments have reported that the time development of shear stress under fast start-up shear deformations exhibits double peaks before reaching the steady state for bimodal blends of entangled linear polymers in specific conditions. To analyze the molecular origin of this phenomenon, multi-chain slip-link simulations based on the primitive chain network model were conducted for the data of a bimodal polystyrene solution reported by Osaki et al. [J Pol Sci B Pol Phys, 38, 2043 (2000)] Owing to the reasonable agreement with the data and the simulation results, the stress was decomposed into contributions from long and short-chain components and decoupled into segment number, stretch, and orientation. The analysis revealed that the first and second peaks correspond to the short-chain orientation and the long-chain stretch, respectively. The results also imply that the peak positions are not affected by the mixing of short and long chains, whereas the second peak intensity depends on the mixing conditions in a complicated manner, dominating the emergence of double peaks.</description>

      <title>Reversal in Thermally Driven Rotation of Chiral Liquid Crystal Droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For chiral liquid crystals that express topologically protected defects and thermally driven mechanical rotation, the size- and temperature-driven reversal of the rotational direction of their droplets was demonstrated even under a fixed temperature gradient. This unconventional reversal indicates the dependence of thermomechanical coupling on the molecular orientational order, this dependence is justified through an examination of the size, temperature, and molecular structure as well as by phenomenological arguments on the order parameter.</description>

      <title>Experimental measurement of mean transition path velocities of colloidal particles surmounting energy barriers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transition paths are rare events occurring when a system, thanks to the effect of fluctuations, crosses successfully from one stable state to another by surmounting an energy barrier. Even though they are of great significance in many mesoscale processes, their direct determination is often challenging due to their short duration as compared to other relevant time-scales. Here, we measure the local average velocity along transition paths of a colloidal bead embedded in a glycerol/water mixture that hops over a barrier separating two optical potential wells. Owing to the slow dynamics of the bead in this viscous medium, we can spatially resolve the mean velocity profiles of the transition paths for distinct potentials, which agree with theoretical predictions of a model for the motion of a Brownian particle traversing a parabolic barrier. This allows us to experimentally verify various expressions linking the behavior of such mean velocities with equilibrium and transition path position distributions, mean transition-path times and mean escape times from the wells. We also show that artifacts in the mean velocity profiles arise when reducing the experimental time resolution, thus highlighting the importance of the sampling rate in the characterization of the transition path dynamics. Our results confirm that mean transition path velocity establishes a fundamental relationship between mean transition path times and equilibrium rates in thermally activated processes of small-scaled systems.</description>

      <title>Irreversible Boltzmann samplers in dense liquids: weak-coupling approximation and mode-coupling theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exerting a nonequilibrium drive on an otherwise equilibrium Langevin process brings the dynamics out of equilibrium but can also speedup the approach to the Boltzmann steady-state. Transverse forces are a minimal framework to achieve dynamical acceleration of the Boltzmann sampling. We consider a simple liquid in three space dimensions subjected to additional transverse pairwise forces, and quantify the extent to which transverse forces accelerate the dynamics. We first explore the dynamics of a tracer in a weak coupling regime describing high temperatures. The resulting acceleration is correlated with a monotonous increase of the magnitude of odd transport coefficients (mobility and diffusivity) with the amplitude of the transverse drive. We then develop a nonequilibrium version of the mode-coupling theory able to capture the effect of transverse forces, and more generally of forces created by additional degrees of freedom. Based on an analysis of transport coefficients, both odd and longitudinal, both for the collective modes and for a tracer particle, we find a systematic acceleration of the dynamics. Quantitatively, the gain, which is guaranteed throughout the ergodic phase, turns out to be a decreasing function of temperature beyond a temperature crossover, in particular as the glass transition is approached. Our theoretical results are in good agreement with available numerical results.</description>

      <title>Pressure-Gated Microfluidic Memristor for Pulsatile Information Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A hitherto unexploited characteristic feature of emerging iontronic devices for information processing is the intrinsic mobility of the medium (water) of dissolved ions in aqueous electrolytes, which therefore not only respond to voltage but also to pressure. Here we study a microfluidic memristor, in the form of a conical channel, exposed to simultaneously applied time-dependent voltage and pressure drops, through numerical solutions of the Poisson-Nernst-Planck-Stokes equations for ion and fluid transport. We show that the channel's memristive properties can be enhanced, reduced or instantaneously reset by a suitable pressure, and we leverage this finding with two examples of time series processing of simultaneously applied voltage and pressure pulses. We not only show that the distinction between different voltage time series can be improved by enhancing the conductance response with corresponding pressure pulses, but also that the bandwidth of information transfer through the channel can be doubled by letting the pressure pulses represent a second independent time series.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric rectified electric fields for symmetric electrolytes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, building upon the discovery of asymmetric rectified electric fields (AREF) in recent experiments [S.H. Hashemi et al., Physical Review Letters 121, 185504 (2018)], we explore the generation of AREF by applying a sawtooth-like voltage to 1:1 electrolytes with equal diffusion coefficients confined between two planar blocking electrodes. This differs from an earlier approach based on a sinusoidal AC voltage applied to 1:1 electrolytes with unequal diffusion coefficients. By numerically solving the full Poisson-Nernst-Planck equations, we demonstrate that AREF can be generated by a slow rise and a fast drop of the potential (or vice versa), even for electrolytes with equal diffusion coefficients of the cations and anions. We employ an analytically constructed equivalent electric circuit to explain the underlying physical mechanism. Importantly, we find that the strength of AREF can be effectively tuned from zero to its maximal value by only manipulating the time-dependence of the driving voltage, eliminating the necessity to modify the electrolyte composition between experiments. This provides valuable insights to control the manipulation of AREF, which facilitates enhanced applications in diverse electrochemical systems.</description>

      <title>Designing athermal disordered solids with automatic differentiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to control forces between sub-micron-scale building blocks offers considerable potential for designing new materials through self-assembly. A typical paradigm is to first identify a particular (crystal) structure that has some desired property, and then design building-block interactions so that this structure assembles spontaneously. While significant theoretical and experimental progress has been made in assembling complicated structures in a variety of systems, this two-step paradigm fundamentally fails for structurally disordered solids, which lack a well-defined structure to use as a target. Here we show that disordered solids can still be treated from an inverse self-assembly perspective by targeting material properties directly. Using the Poisson's ratio, $\nu$, as a primary example, we show how differentiable programming connects experimentally relevant interaction parameters with emergent behavior, allowing us to iteratively "train" the system until we find the set of interactions that leads to the Poisson's ratio we desire. Beyond the Poisson's ratio, we also tune the pressure and a measure of local 8-fold structural order, as well as multiple properties simultaneously, demonstrating the potential for nontrivial design in disordered solids. This approach is highly robust, transferable, and scalable, can handle a wide variety of model systems, properties of interest, and preparation dynamics, and can optimize over 100s or even 1000s of parameters. This result connects the fields of disordered solids and inverse self-assembly, indicating that many of the tools and ideas that have been developed to understand the assembly of crystals can also be used to control the properties of disordered solids.</description>

      <title>Overlapping plastic events as a mechanism for irreversible dynamics in amorphous solids under oscillatory shear</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of the transition from asymptotically reversible to asymptotically irreversible response in amorphous solids subject to oscillatory shear is still unknown. It is known that the plastic events that result from shearing always involve localized particle rearrangements, but it is unclear why some are reversible while others are not. Here we show, using simulations and models, that overlaps between particle rearrangements caused by straining the solid in alternating directions can cause the response to become irreversible when they occur frequently. As the forcing amplitude increases, plastic events become more frequent, the number of such overlaps increases, and the probability of the system returning to previous states diminishes.</description>

      <title>A unified analytical prediction for steady-state behavior of confined drop with interface viscosity under shear flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this Letter, we fill in the blanks in the theory of drops under shear flow by unifying analytical predictions for steady-state behavior proposed by Flumerfelt [R. W. Flumerfelt, J. Colloid Interface Sci. 76, 330 (1980)] for unconfined drops with interface viscosity with the one of Shapira &amp; Haber [M. Shapira and S. Haber, Int. J. Multiph. Flow. 16, 305 (1990)] for confined drops without interface viscosity. Our predictions for both steady-state drop deformation and inclination angle are broadly valid for situations involving confined/unconfined drops, with/without interface viscosity and viscosity ratio, thus making our model so general that it can include any of the above conditions.</description>

      <title>Geometric measures of uniaxial solids of revolution in ${\mathbb{R}^{4}}$ and their relation to the second virial coefficient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide analytical expressions for the second virial coefficients of hard, convex, monoaxial solids of revolution in ${\mathbb{R}^{4}}$. The excluded volume per particle and thus the second virial coefficient is calculated using quermassintegrals and rotationally invariant mixed volumes based on the Brunn-Minkowski theorem. We derive analytical expressions for the mutual excluded volume of four-dimensional hard solids of revolution in dependence on their aspect ratio $\nu$ including the limits of infinitely thin oblate and infinitely long prolate geometries. Using reduced second virial coefficients $B_2^{\ast}=B_2/V_{\mathrm{P}}$ as size-independent quantities with $V_{\mathrm{P}}$ denoting the $D$-dimensional particle volume, the influence of the particle geometry to the mutual excluded volume is analyzed for various shapes. Beyond the aspect ratio $\nu$, the detailed particle shape influences the reduced second virial coefficients $B_2^{\ast}$. We prove that for $D$-dimensional spherocylinders in arbitrary-dimensional Euclidean spaces ${\mathbb{R}^{D}}$ their excluded volume solely depends on at most three intrinsic volumes, whereas for different convex geometries $D$ intrinsic volumes are required. For $D$-dimensional ellipsoids of revolution, the general parity $B_2^{\ast}(\nu)=B_2^{\ast}(\nu^{-1})$ is proven.</description>

      <title>Unifying the Temperature Dependent Dynamics of Glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strong changes in bulk properties, such as modulus and viscosity, are observed near the glass transition temperature, T_{g}, of amorphous materials. For more than a century, intense efforts have been made to define a microscopic origin for these macroscopic changes in properties. Using transition state theory, we delve into the atomic/molecular level picture of how microscopic localized relaxations, or "cage rattles," translate to macroscopic structural relaxations above T_{g}. Unit motion is broken down into two populations: (1) simultaneous rearrangement occurs among a critical number of units, n_{\alpha}, which ranges from 1 to 4, allowing a systematic classification of glasses that is compared to fragility; (2) near T_{g}, adjacent units provide additional free volume for rearrangement, not simultaneously, but within the "primitive" lifetime, {\tau}_{1}, of one unit rattling in its cage. Relaxation maps illustrate how Johari-Goldstein \{beta} relaxations stem from the rattle of n_{\alpha} units. We analyzed a wide variety of glassy materials, and materials with glassy response, using literature data. Our four-parameter equation fits "strong" and "weak" glasses over the entire range of temperatures and also extends to other glassy systems, such as ion-transporting polymers and ferroelectric relaxors. The role of activation entropy in boosting preexponential factors to high "unphysical" apparent frequencies is discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08964v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Grain boundaries in extremely confined colloidal smectics possess a topological fine structure with coexisting nematic and tetratic symmetry of the director field. An alternative way to approach the problem of smectic topology is via the layer structure, which is typically more accessible in experiments on molecular liquid crystals. Here, we consider exemplary density functional theory results for two-dimensional hard rods to illustrate how the concept of endpoint defects, which appear as tetratic disclinations of quarter charge in director topology, translates to smectic layer topology built around the networks formed by density maxima and minima. By doing so, we elaborate on further advantages of a topological concept evolving around the layer structure rather than the director field, such as providing insight in the structure of edge dislocations or virtual defects at the confining walls.</description>

      <title>A Unified Model for Non-Fickian Diffusion and Anomalous Swelling of Glassy Polymer Gels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03844v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A sheet of glassy polymers placed in a solvent shows swelling behaviors quite different from that of soft polymers (rubbers and gels). (1) Non-Fickian diffusion (called case II diffusion): As solvent permeates into the sample, a sharp front is created between the swollen part and the glassy part, and it moves toward the center at constant speed. (2) Nonmonotonous swelling: The thickness of the sample first increases and then decreases toward the equilibrium value. Here we propose a theory to explain such anomalous behavior by extending the previous theory for swelling of soft gels. We regard the material as a continuum mixture of a glassy polymer network and solvent. We assume that the polymer network is a viscoelastic gel of glassy polymers, and its relaxation time depends strongly on solvent concentration. We show that this theory explains the above two characteristics of glassy polymers in a simple and unified framework. The theory predicts how the permeation speed of the solvent and the characteristic times of the swelling process depend on material parameters and experimental conditions, which can be checked experimentally.</description>

      <title>Effect of the presence of pinned particles on the structural parameters of a liquid and correlation between structure and dynamics at the local level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10353v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pinning particles at the equilibrium configuration of the liquid is expected not to affect the structure and any property that depends on the structure while slowing down the dynamics. This leads to a breakdown of the structure dynamics correlation. Here, we calculate two structural quantities, the pair excess entropy, $S_2$, and the mean field caging potential, the inverse of which is our structural order parameter (SOP). We show that when the pinned particles are treated the same way as the mobile particles, both $S_2$ and SOP of the mobile particles remain the same as that of the unpinned system, and the structure dynamics correlation decreases with an increase in pinning density, "c". However, when we treat the pinned particles as a different species, even if we consider that the structure does not change, the expression of $S_2$ and SOP changes. The microscopic expressions show that interaction between a pinned and mobile particle affects $S_2$ and SOP more than the interaction between two mobile particles. We show that a similar effect is also present in the calculation of the excess entropy and the primary reason for the well-known vanishing of the configurational entropy at high temperatures. We further show that contrary to common belief, the pinning process does change the structure. When these two effects are considered, both $S_2$ and SOP decrease with an increase in "c", and the correlation between the structural parameters and the dynamics continues even for higher values of "c".</description>
