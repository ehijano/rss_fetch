      <title>Strategic Planning of Stealthy Backdoor Attacks in Markov Decision Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates backdoor attack planning in stochastic control systems modeled as Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). In a backdoor attack, the adversary provides a control policy that behaves well in the original MDP to pass the testing phase. However, when such a policy is deployed with a trigger policy, which perturbs the system dynamics at runtime, it optimizes the attacker's objective instead. To solve jointly the control policy and its trigger, we formulate the attack planning problem as a constrained optimal planning problem in an MDP with augmented state space, with the objective to maximize the attacker's total rewards in the system with an activated trigger, subject to the constraint that the control policy is near optimal in the original MDP. We then introduce a gradient-based optimization method to solve the optimal backdoor attack policy as a pair of coordinated control and trigger policies. Experimental results from a case study validate the effectiveness of our approach in achieving stealthy backdoor attacks.</description>

      <title>A Model Predictive Control Approach for Quadrotor Cruise Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the application of a Model Predictive Controller (MPC) for the cruise control system of a quadrotor, focusing on hovering point stabilization and reference tracking. Initially, a full-state-feedback MPC is designed for the ideal scenario. To account for real-world conditions, a constant disturbance is introduced to the quadrotor, simulating a gust of wind in a specific direction. In response, an output-feedback offset-free MPC is developed to stabilize the quadrotor while rejecting the disturbance. We validate the design of the controller by conducting stability analysis, as well as numerical simulations under different circumstances. It is shown that the designed controller can achieve all the expected goals for the cruise control, including reference tracking and disturbance rejection. This project was implemented using Python and the CVXPY library for convex optimization.</description>

      <title>Integrated Control and Active Perception in POMDPs for Temporal Logic Tasks and Information Acquisition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the synthesis of a joint control and active perception policy for a stochastic system modeled as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), subject to temporal logic specifications. The POMDP actions influence both system dynamics (control) and the emission function (perception). Beyond task completion, the planner seeks to maximize information gain about certain temporal events (the secret) through coordinated perception and control. To enable active information acquisition, we introduce minimizing the Shannon conditional entropy of the secret as a planning objective, alongside maximizing the probability of satisfying the temporal logic formula within a finite horizon. Using a variant of observable operators in hidden Markov models (HMMs) and POMDPs, we establish key properties of the conditional entropy gradient with respect to policy parameters. These properties facilitate efficient policy gradient computation. We validate our approach through graph-based examples, inspired by common security applications with UAV surveillance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The operation of CMOS Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) at extremely cold environments as low as 4 K is demonstrated. Various FPGA and periphery hardware design techniques spanning from HDL design to improvements of peripheral circuitry such as discrete voltage regulators are displayed, and their respective performances are reported. While general operating conditions for voltage regulators are widened, FPGAs see a broader temperature range with improved jitter performance, reduced LUT delays, and enhanced transceiver performance at extremely low temperatures.</description>

      <title>Robust Estimation of Battery State of Health Using Reference Voltage Trajectory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate estimation of state of health (SOH) is critical for battery applications. Current model-based SOH estimation methods typically rely on low C-rate constant current tests to extract health parameters like solid phase volume fraction and lithium-ion stoichiometry, which are often impractical in real-world scenarios due to time and operational constraints. Additionally, these methods are susceptible to modeling uncertainties that can significantly degrade the estimation accuracy, especially when jointly estimating multiple parameters. In this paper, we present a novel reference voltage-based method for robust battery SOH estimation. This method utilizes the voltage response of a battery under a predefined current excitation at the beginning of life (BOL) as a reference to compensate for modeling uncertainty. As the battery degrades, the same excitation is applied to generate the voltage response, which is compared with the BOL trajectory to estimate the key health parameters accurately. The current excitation is optimally designed using the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm to maximize the information content of the target parameters. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed method significantly improves parameter estimation accuracy under different degradation levels, compared to conventional methods relying only on direct voltage measurements. Furthermore, our method jointly estimates four key SOH parameters in only 10 minutes, making it practical for real-world battery health diagnostics, e.g., fast testing to enable battery repurposing.</description>

      <title>Integration of a Graph-Based Path Planner and Mixed-Integer MPC for Robot Navigation in Cluttered Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to update a path plan is a required capability for autonomous mobile robots navigating through uncertain environments. This paper proposes a re-planning strategy using a multilayer planning and control framework for cases where the robot's environment is partially known. A medial axis graph-based planner defines a global path plan based on known obstacles where each edge in the graph corresponds to a unique corridor. A mixed-integer model predictive control (MPC) method detects if a terminal constraint derived from the global plan is infeasible, subject to a non-convex description of the local environment. Infeasibility detection is used to trigger efficient global re-planning via medial axis graph edge deletion. The proposed re-planning strategy is demonstrated experimentally.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Encrypted controllers offer secure computation by employing modern cryptosystems to execute control operations directly over encrypted data without decryption. However, incorporating cryptosystems into dynamic controllers significantly increases the computational load. This paper aims to provide an accessible guideline for running encrypted controllers using an open-source library Lattigo, which supports an efficient implementation of Ring-Learing With Errors (LWE) based encrypted controllers, and our explanations are assisted with example codes that are fully available at https://github.com/CDSL-EncryptedControl/CDSL.</description>

      <title>Inverse Inference on Cooperative Control of Networked Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent years have witnessed the rapid advancement of understanding the control mechanism of networked dynamical systems (NDSs), which are governed by components such as nodal dynamics and topology. This paper reveals that the critical components in continuous-time state feedback cooperative control of NDSs can be inferred merely from discrete observations. In particular, we advocate a bi-level inference framework to estimate the global closed-loop system and extract the components, respectively. The novelty lies in bridging the gap from discrete observations to the continuous-time model and effectively decoupling the concerned components. Specifically, in the first level, we design a causality-based estimator for the discrete-time closed-loop system matrix, which can achieve asymptotically unbiased performance when the NDS is stable. In the second level, we introduce a matrix logarithm based method to recover the continuous-time counterpart matrix, providing new sampling period guarantees and establishing the recovery error bound. By utilizing graph properties of the NDS, we develop least square based procedures to decouple the concerned components with up to a scalar ambiguity. Furthermore, we employ inverse optimal control techniques to reconstruct the objective function driving the control process, deriving necessary conditions for the solutions. Numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Functional Encryption and Deep Learning for Privacy-Preserving Traffic Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the past few years, traffic congestion has continuously plagued the nation's transportation system creating several negative impacts including longer travel times, increased pollution rates, and higher collision risks. To overcome these challenges, Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) aim to improve mobility and vehicular systems, ensuring higher levels of safety by utilizing cutting-edge technologies, sophisticated sensing capabilities, and innovative algorithms. Drivers' participatory sensing, current/future location reporting, and machine learning algorithms have considerably improved real-time congestion monitoring and future traffic management. However, each driver's sensitive spatiotemporal location information can create serious privacy concerns. To address these challenges, we propose in this paper a secure, privacy-preserving location reporting and traffic forecasting system that guarantees privacy protection of driver data while maintaining high traffic forecasting accuracy. Our novel k-anonymity scheme utilizes functional encryption to aggregate encrypted location information submitted by drivers while ensuring the privacy of driver location data. Additionally, using the aggregated encrypted location information as input, this research proposes a deep learning model that incorporates a Convolutional-Long Short-Term Memory (Conv-LSTM) module to capture spatial and short-term temporal features and a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) module to recover long-term periodic patterns for traffic forecasting. With extensive evaluation on real datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme with less than 10% mean absolute error for a 60-minute forecasting horizon, all while protecting driver privacy.</description>

      <title>Stability of Polling Systems for a Large Class of Markovian Switching Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a polling system with two queues, where a single server is attending the queues in a cyclic order and requires non-zero switching times to switch between the queues. Our aim is to identify a fairly general and comprehensive class of Markovian switching policies that renders the system stable. Potentially a class of policies that can cover the Pareto frontier related to individual-queue-centric performance measures like the stationary expected number of waiting customers in each queue; for instance, such a class of policies is identified recently for a polling system near the fluid regime (with large arrival and departure rates), and we aim to include that class. We also aim to include a second class that facilitates switching between the queues at the instance the occupancy in the opposite queue crosses a threshold and when that in the visiting queue is below a threshold (this inclusion facilitates design of `robust' polling systems). Towards this, we consider a class of two-phase switching policies, which includes the above mentioned classes. In the maximum generality, our policies can be represented by eight parameters, while two parameters are sufficient to represent the aforementioned classes. We provide simple conditions to identify the sub-class of switching policies that ensure system stability. By numerically tuning the parameters of the proposed class, we illustrate that the proposed class can cover the Pareto frontier for the stationary expected number of customers in the two queues.</description>

      <title>A Model-Based Approach to Imitation Learning through Multi-Step Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Imitation learning is a widely used approach for training agents to replicate expert behavior in complex decision-making tasks. However, existing methods often struggle with compounding errors and limited generalization, due to the inherent challenge of error correction and the distribution shift between training and deployment. In this paper, we present a novel model-based imitation learning framework inspired by model predictive control, which addresses these limitations by integrating predictive modeling through multi-step state predictions. Our method outperforms traditional behavior cloning numerical benchmarks, demonstrating superior robustness to distribution shift and measurement noise both in available data and during execution. Furthermore, we provide theoretical guarantees on the sample complexity and error bounds of our method, offering insights into its convergence properties.</description>

      <title>An Addendum to NeBula: Towards Extending TEAM CoSTAR's Solution to Larger Scale Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an appendix to the original NeBula autonomy solution developed by the TEAM CoSTAR (Collaborative SubTerranean Autonomous Robots), participating in the DARPA Subterranean Challenge. Specifically, this paper presents extensions to NeBula's hardware, software, and algorithmic components that focus on increasing the range and scale of the exploration environment. From the algorithmic perspective, we discuss the following extensions to the original NeBula framework: (i) large-scale geometric and semantic environment mapping; (ii) an adaptive positioning system; (iii) probabilistic traversability analysis and local planning; (iv) large-scale POMDP-based global motion planning and exploration behavior; (v) large-scale networking and decentralized reasoning; (vi) communication-aware mission planning; and (vii) multi-modal ground-aerial exploration solutions. We demonstrate the application and deployment of the presented systems and solutions in various large-scale underground environments, including limestone mine exploration scenarios as well as deployment in the DARPA Subterranean challenge.</description>

      <title>Risk-aware black-box portfolio construction using Bayesian optimization with adaptive weighted Lagrangian estimator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing portfolio management approaches are often black-box models due to safety and commercial issues in the industry. However, their performance can vary considerably whenever market conditions or internal trading strategies change. Furthermore, evaluating these non-transparent systems is expensive, where certain budgets limit observations of the systems. Therefore, optimizing performance while controlling the potential risk of these financial systems has become a critical challenge. This work presents a novel Bayesian optimization framework to optimize black-box portfolio management models under limited observations. In conventional Bayesian optimization settings, the objective function is to maximize the expectation of performance metrics. However, simply maximizing performance expectations leads to erratic optimization trajectories, which exacerbate risk accumulation in portfolio management. Meanwhile, this can lead to misalignment between the target distribution and the actual distribution of the black-box model. To mitigate this problem, we propose an adaptive weight Lagrangian estimator considering dual objective, which incorporates maximizing model performance and minimizing variance of model observations. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our approach over five backtest settings with three black-box stock portfolio management models. Ablation studies further verify the effectiveness of the proposed estimator.</description>

      <title>Robot Navigation in Dynamic Environments using Acceleration Obstacles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the issue of motion planning in dynamic environments by extending the concept of Velocity Obstacle and Nonlinear Velocity Obstacle to Acceleration Obstacle AO and Nonlinear Acceleration Obstacle NAO. Similarly to VO and NLVO, the AO and NAO represent the set of colliding constant accelerations of the maneuvering robot with obstacles moving along linear and nonlinear trajectories, respectively. Contrary to prior works, we derive analytically the exact boundaries of AO and NAO. To enhance an intuitive understanding of these representations, we first derive the AO in several steps: first extending the VO to the Basic Acceleration Obstacle BAO that consists of the set of constant accelerations of the robot that would collide with an obstacle moving at constant accelerations, while assuming zero initial velocities of the robot and obstacle. This is then extended to the AO while assuming arbitrary initial velocities of the robot and obstacle. And finally, we derive the NAO that in addition to the prior assumptions, accounts for obstacles moving along arbitrary trajectories. The introduction of NAO allows the generation of safe avoidance maneuvers that directly account for the robot's second-order dynamics, with acceleration as its control input. The AO and NAO are demonstrated in several examples of selecting avoidance maneuvers in challenging road traffic. It is shown that the use of NAO drastically reduces the adjustment rate of the maneuvering robot's acceleration while moving in complex road traffic scenarios. The presented approach enables reactive and efficient navigation for multiple robots, with potential application for autonomous vehicles operating in complex dynamic environments.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Pothole Detection and Characterization: Integrated Segmentation and Depth Estimation in Road Anomaly Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Road anomaly detection plays a crucial role in road maintenance and in enhancing the safety of both drivers and vehicles. Recent machine learning approaches for road anomaly detection have overcome the tedious and time-consuming process of manual analysis and anomaly counting; however, they often fall short in providing a complete characterization of road potholes. In this paper, we leverage transfer learning by adopting a pre-trained YOLOv8-seg model for the automatic characterization of potholes using digital images captured from a dashboard-mounted camera. Our work includes the creation of a novel dataset, comprising both images and their corresponding depth maps, collected from diverse road environments in Al-Khobar city and the KFUPM campus in Saudi Arabia. Our approach performs pothole detection and segmentation to precisely localize potholes and calculate their area. Subsequently, the segmented image is merged with its depth map to extract detailed depth information about the potholes. This integration of segmentation and depth data offers a more comprehensive characterization compared to previous deep learning-based road anomaly detection systems. Overall, this method not only has the potential to significantly enhance autonomous vehicle navigation by improving the detection and characterization of road hazards but also assists road maintenance authorities in responding more effectively to road damage.</description>

      <title>Joint Oscillation Damping and Inertia Provision Service for Converter-Interfaced Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.01321v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Power systems dominated by converter-interfaced distributed energy resources (DERs) typically exhibit weaker damping capabilities and lower inertia, compromising system stability. Although individual DER controllers are evolving to provide superior oscillation damping capabilities and inertia supports, there is a lack of network-wide coordinated management measures for multiple DERs, potentially leading to unexpected instability and cost-effectiveness problems. To address this gap, this paper introduces a hybrid oscillation damping and inertia management strategy for multiple DERs, considering network coupling effects, and seeks to encourage DERs to provide enhanced damping and inertia with appropriate economic incentives. We first formulate an optimization problem to tune and allocate damping and inertia coefficients for DERs, minimizing associated power and energy costs while ensuring hard constraints for system frequency stability and small-signal stability. The problem is built upon a novel convex parametric formulation that integrates oscillation mode location and frequency trajectory requirements, equipped with a theoretical guarantee, and eliminating the need for iterative tuning and computation burdens. Furthermore, to increase the willingness of DERs to cooperate, we further design appropriate economic incentives to compensate for DERs' costs based on the proposed cost minimization problem, and assess its impact on system cost-efficiency. Numerical tests highlight the effectiveness of the proposed method in promoting system stability and offer insights into potential economic benefits.</description>

      <title>Friedkin-Johnsen Model with Diminishing Competition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12601v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This letter studies the Friedkin-Johnsen (FJ) model with diminishing competition, or stubbornness. The original FJ model assumes that each agent assigns a constant competition weight to its initial opinion. In contrast, we investigate the effect of diminishing competition on the convergence point and speed of the FJ dynamics. We prove that, if the competition is uniform across agents and vanishes asymptotically, the convergence point coincides with the nominal consensus reached with no competition. However, the diminishing competition slows down convergence according to its own rate of decay. We study this phenomenon analytically and provide upper and lower bounds on the convergence rate. Further, if competition is not uniform across agents, we show that the convergence point may not coincide with the nominal consensus point. Finally, we evaluate our analytical insights numerically.</description>

      <title>Pricing is All You Need to Improve Traffic Routing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13077v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the design of pricing policies that enhance driver adherence to route guidance, ensuring effective routing control. The major novelty lies in that we adopt a Markov chain to model drivers' compliance rates conditioned on both traffic states and tolls. By formulating the managed traffic network as a nonlinear stochastic dynamical system, we can quantify in a more realistic way the impacts of driver route choices and thus determine appropriate tolls. Specially, we focus on a network comprised of one corridor and one local street. We assume that a reasonable routing policy is specified in advance. However, drivers could be reluctant to be detoured. Thus a fixed toll is set on the corridor to give drivers incentives to choose the local street. We evaluate the effectiveness of the given routing and pricing policies via stability analysis. We suggest using the stability and instability conditions to establish lower and upper bounds on throughput. This allows us to select suitable tolls that maximize these bounds.</description>

      <title>Block Backstepping for Isotachic Hyperbolic PDEs and Multilayer Timoshenko Beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11416v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the rapid stabilization of N-layer Timoshenko composite beams with anti-damping and anti-stiffness at the uncontrolled boundaries. The problem of stabilization for a two-layer composite beam has been previously studied by transforming the model into a 1-D hyperbolic PIDE-ODE form and then applying backstepping to this new system. In principle this approach is generalizable to any number of layers. However, when some of the layers have the same physical properties (as e.g. in lamination of repeated layers), the approach leads to isotachic hyperbolic PDEs (i.e. where some states have the same transport speed). This particular yet physical and interesting case has not received much attention beyond a few remarks in the early hyperbolic design. Thus, this work starts by extending the theory of backstepping control of (m + n) hyperbolic PIDEs and m ODEs to blocks of isotachic states, leading to a block backstepping design. Then, returning to multilayer Timoshenko beams, the Riemann transformation is used to transform the states of N-layer Timoshenko beams into a 1-D hyperbolic PIDE-ODE system. The block backstepping method is then applied to this model, obtaining closed-loop stability of the origin in the L2 sense. An arbitrarily rapid convergence rate can be obtained by adjusting control parameters. Finally, numerical simulations are presented corroborating the theoretical developments.</description>

      <title>SysCaps: Language Interfaces for Simulation Surrogates of Complex Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19653v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Surrogate models are used to predict the behavior of complex energy systems that are too expensive to simulate with traditional numerical methods. Our work introduces the use of language descriptions, which we call ``system captions'' or SysCaps, to interface with such surrogates. We argue that interacting with surrogates through text, particularly natural language, makes these models more accessible for both experts and non-experts. We introduce a lightweight multimodal text and timeseries regression model and a training pipeline that uses large language models (LLMs) to synthesize high-quality captions from simulation metadata. Our experiments on two real-world simulators of buildings and wind farms show that our SysCaps-augmented surrogates have better accuracy on held-out systems than traditional methods while enjoying new generalization abilities, such as handling semantically related descriptions of the same test system. Additional experiments also highlight the potential of SysCaps to unlock language-driven design space exploration and to regularize training through prompt augmentation.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Trajectory Optimization for Robotic Skill Acquisition From a Suboptimal Demonstration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03131v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning from Demonstration (LfD) has emerged as a crucial method for robots to acquire new skills. However, when given suboptimal task trajectory demonstrations with shape characteristics reflecting human preferences but subpar dynamic attributes such as slow motion, robots not only need to mimic the behaviors but also optimize the dynamic performance. In this work, we leverage optimization-based methods to search for a superior-performing trajectory whose shape is similar to that of the demonstrated trajectory. Specifically, we use Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) to quantify the difference between two trajectories and combine it with additional performance metrics, such as collision cost, to construct the cost function. Moreover, we develop a multi-policy version of the Stochastic Trajectory Optimization for Motion Planning (STOMP), called MSTOMP, which is more stable and robust to parameter changes. To deal with the jitter in the demonstrated trajectory, we further utilize the gain-controlling method in the frequency domain to denoise the demonstration and propose a computationally more efficient metric, called Mean Square Error in the Spectrum (MSES), that measures the trajectories' differences in the frequency domain. We also theoretically highlight the connections between the time domain and the frequency domain methods. Finally, we verify our method in both simulation experiments and real-world experiments, showcasing its improved optimization performance and stability compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning with Graph Attention for Routing and Wavelength Assignment with Lightpath Reuse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14741v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many works have investigated reinforcement learning (RL) for routing and spectrum assignment on flex-grid networks but only one work to date has examined RL for fixed-grid with flex-rate transponders, despite production systems using this paradigm. Flex-rate transponders allow existing lightpaths to accommodate new services, a task we term routing and wavelength assignment with lightpath reuse (RWA-LR). We re-examine this problem and present a thorough benchmarking of heuristic algorithms for RWA-LR, which are shown to have 6% increased throughput when candidate paths are ordered by number of hops, rather than total length. We train an RL agent for RWA-LR with graph attention networks for the policy and value functions to exploit the graph-structured data. We provide details of our methodology and open source all of our code for reproduction. We outperform the previous state-of-the-art RL approach by 2.5% (17.4 Tbps mean additional throughput) and the best heuristic by 1.2% (8.5 Tbps mean additional throughput). This marginal gain highlights the difficulty in learning effective RL policies on long horizon resource allocation tasks.</description>
