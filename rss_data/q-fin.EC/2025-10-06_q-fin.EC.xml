      <title>Same old story: Hungary's development over the 2000-2020 period</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hungary's convergence to the developed western economies have been much slower than initially expected. Applying the FOI model, this study investigates whether there were any changes in the convergence process during the second decade of the 21st century. It is found that the future (influencing the long-term competitiveness of the economy), and inside (determining the current well-being of the country) potential of the Hungarian economy did not improve at all compared to the 34 countries that were OECD members in 2010. Hungary's position is in fact really bad, it is ranked 33rd in both areas. The country does somewhat better in the outside potential (characterising the world market position), prompting that Hungary follows a growth model that is focused on external resources. This feature is not new, however: the same development model patterns were detected in 2010, too.</description>

      <title>Top OECD performers in green growth -- an FOI model analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With rising concerns about climate change, the issue of green growth have been growing in importance. The aim of this study is to establish a measurement method for green growth, and to identify the best performing countries in this field. The Future, Outside, and Inside (FOI) development model was used to measure the performance of the 38 OECD countries. Based on their 2019-20 scores, the countries that are top performers in green growth are the members of the so called Welfare-participatory cluster (Austria, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Ireland, Isra-el, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden), and two outliers (Iceland, and Luxembourg).</description>

      <title>The Optimal Magnitude of Government Spending: Evidence from Cambodia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scholars and policymakers have vigorously debated what the impact of government spending on economic growth is. Some current research and theoretical models suggest that the reaction of economic growth to the extension of government spending can be either positive or negative. This article intends to investigate the inverted-U shaped relationship between output growth and government spending (i.e., government fixed capital formation [GFCF] and government final consumption expenditure [GFCE]). Ordinary least squares (OLS) is employed as an approach to annual data for Cambodia obtained from 1971 to 2015. The result reveals that GFCF and GFCE have an inverted-U shaped relation with economic growth and that 5.40% and 7.23% are the optimal values of GFCF and GFCE, respectively. The labour growth rate and export growth rate contribute positively to the growth rate of output. This study indicates that the increasing level of government expenditure reduces the efficacy of government spending, and also helps Cambodia's policymakers to control fiscal policy more efficiently.</description>

      <title>Can GenAI Improve Academic Performance? Evidence from the Social and Behavioral Sciences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper estimates the effect of Generative AI (GenAI) adoption on scientific productivity and quality in the social and behavioral sciences. Using matched author-level panel data and a difference-in-differences design, we find that GenAI adoption is associated with sizable increases in research productivity, measured by the number of published papers. It also leads to moderate gains in publication quality, based on journal impact factors. These effects are most pronounced among early-career researchers, authors working in technically complex subfields, and those from non-English-speaking countries. The results suggest that GenAI tools may help lower some structural barriers in academic publishing and promote more inclusive participation in research.</description>

      <title>An Economic Analysis of Electricity Consumption and Electric Vehicle Adoption in California from 2010 to 2021</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines the impact of electric vehicles on total annual electricity consumption across 58 counties in California from 2010 to 2021. Employing a log linear model to analyze the relationship between electricity consumption and EV ownership, alongside a linear log model with an instrumental variable approach, the study finds that annual per capita electricity consumption increased by 0.23% for each additional electric vehicle per 10,000 residents over the 12 years period. The analysis identifies partisanship, measured as the annual percentage of voter registration for the Democratic Party by county, as a robust instrumental variable. Specifically, a 1% increase in Democratic voter registration corresponds to the adoption of approximately two additional EVs per 10,000 residents.</description>

      <title>Attributing excess conflict risk in Syria to anthropogenic climate change</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Some analyses suggest that drought in Syria during 2007-10 may have contributed to the 2011 onset of its civil war and that anthropogenic climate change had a detectable impact on the severity of that drought. Yet these qualitative statements alone do not allow us to estimate {how much} anthropogenic climate change amplified the risk of civil war in Syria. Climate policy is increasingly relying on global-scale cost-benefit analyses to inform major decisions, and any excess conflict risk imposed on future populations should be considered in this accounting because of its substantial human and economic impact. In order for this excess conflict risk to be accounted for, it must be quantified and its uncertainty characterized. Here we build on multiple recent findings in the literature to construct a best estimate for the excess conflict risk borne by Syria in 2010 that was attributable to anthropogenic climate change. We estimate that the baseline risk of conflict in Syria, which was likely already high, was amplified roughly 3.6% (90% confidence interval: 1.1-7.3%) due to the anthropogenic component of the drought. The effect of climate change was thus discernible but unlikely responsible for the bulk of Syrian conflict risk. Nevertheless, the magnitude of similar excess risk around the globe is expected to grow as climate change progresses, and its human cost could be large because most populations will face positive excess risk. Our approach to quantifying this risk is applicable to these other settings.</description>

      <title>Does FOMC Tone Really Matter? Statistical Evidence from Spectral Graph Network Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the relationship between Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) announcements and financial market network structure through spectral graph theory. Using hypergraph networks constructed from S\&amp;P 100 stocks around FOMC announcement dates (2011--2024), we employ the Fiedler value -- the second eigenvalue of the hypergraph Laplacian -- to measure changes in market connectivity and systemic stability. Our event study methodology reveals that FOMC announcements significantly alter network structure across multiple time horizons. Analysis of policy tone, classified using natural language processing, reveals heterogeneous effects: hawkish announcements induce network fragmentation at short horizons ($k=6$) followed by reconsolidation at medium horizons ($k=14$), while neutral statements show limited immediate impact but exhibit delayed fragmentation. These findings suggest that monetary policy communication affects market architecture through a network structural transmission, with effects varying by announcement timing and policy stance.</description>
