      <title>Abundance Measurements of the Metal-poor M subwarf LHS 174 Using High-resolution Optical Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metal-poor M subdwarfs are among the oldest stellar populations and carry valuable information about the chemical enrichment history of the Milky Way. The measurements of chemical abundances of these stars therefore provide essential insights into the nucleosynthesis in the early stages of the Galaxy's formation. We present the detailed spectroscopic analysis of a nearby metal-poor M subdwarf, LHS 174 from its high-resolution optical spectrum, and apply our previously developed spectral fitting code, \texttt{AutoSpecFit}, to measure the abundances of five elements:[O/H]=$-$0.519$\pm$0.081, [Ca/H]=$-$0.753$\pm$0.177, [Ti/H]=$-$0.711$\pm$0.144, [V/H]=$-$1.026$\pm$0.077, and [Fe/H]=$-$1.170$\pm$0.135. We compare the abundances of O, Ti, and Fe derived from this work and those from previous studies and demonstrate the observed data is clearly better matched with the synthetic model generated based on our abundances than those from the other analyses. The accuracy of inferred stellar abundances strongly depends on the accuracy of physical parameters, which motivates us to develop a reliable technique to determine the parameters of low-mass M dwarfs more accurately ever than before and infer abundances with smaller uncertainties.</description>

      <title>The Gaia Catalogue of Galactic AGB Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper describes the identification of Gaia counterparts of a sample of oxygen-rich AGB stars with OH maser emission as a first step towards the compilation of a general Gaia Catalogue of Galactic AGB stars. With this catalogue, tests of evolutionary models for the AGB star population in the solar neighbourhood will become feasible. We cross-matched AGB star candidates showing OH maser emission with Gaia DR3 using a cross-match with AllWISE and 2MASS as intermediate steps to avoid ambiguities. With the help of the Virtual Observatory, we retrieved photometric data from the near-ultraviolet to the far-infrared and built spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of the sources. The SEDs were fitted with theoretical models. The fit results, together with information from the literature, allowed us to clean the sample from non-AGB stars and to obtain bolometric fluxes for the AGB stars. Distances based on Gaia parallaxes were used to derive the stellar luminosities. We identified unique Gaia counterparts for 1487 OH masers. Of these, 1172 had an unambiguous classification as AGB stars; they make up the Gaia OH/IR star sample. Parallaxes with relative errors $&lt;$20\% and astrometric excess noise $&lt;$1.5 mas were available for 222 OH/IR stars. We conclude that the study of the AGB population in the solar neighbourhood is limited by the obscuration by circumstellar dust, as \G\ DR3 only provides parallaxes for a few of our candidates. The location of the OH/IR stars matches that of LPV discovered by \G\ in the (BP$-$RP; G$_{abs}$) diagram, but the OH/IR star sample is biased towards redder colours (BP$-$RP$&gt;$4) mag and larger amplitudes ($&gt;$1 mag in the G-band), which are typical for periodic large-amplitude Mira variables.</description>

      <title>Two Decades of Dust Evolution in SN 2005af through JWST, Spitzer, and Chemical Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of dust in core-collapse supernovae (SNe), in general, is poorly constrained owing to a lack of infrared observations after a few years from explosion. Most theories of dust formation in SNe heavily rely only on SN 1987A. In the last two years, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has enabled us to probe the dust evolution in decades-old SNe, such as SN 2004et, SN 2005ip, and SN 1980K. In this paper, we present two decades of dust evolution in SN 2005af, combining early-time infrared observations with Spitzer Space Telescope and recent detections by JWST. We have used a chemical kinetic model of dust synthesis in SN ejecta to develop a template of dust evolution in SN 2005af. Moreover, using this approach, for the first time, we have separately quantified the dust formed in the pre-explosion wind that survived after the explosion, and the dust formed in the metal-rich SN ejecta post-explosion. We report that in SN 2005af, predominantly carbon-rich dust is formed in the ejecta, where the total mass of ejecta dust is about 0.02-0.03 Msun, while in the circumstellar medium the amount of surviving oxygen-rich dust is 0.001-0.004 Msun.</description>

      <title>Is the Symbiotic Recurrent Nova T CrB Late? Recent Photometric Evolution and Comparison with Past Pre-Outburst Behaviour</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: T CrB is a symbiotic recurrent nova that last erupted in 1946. Given its recurrence timescale of approximately 80 years, the next outburst is eagerly anticipated by the astronomical community. In this work, we analyse the optical light curves of T CrB, comparing recent photometric evolution with historical data to evaluate potential predictive indicators of nova eruptions. Although the "super-active" phases preceding both the 1946 and anticipated eruptions are strikingly similar, the subsequent photometric behaviour differs. We find that the decline in brightness observed in 2023, interpreted by some as a "pre-eruption dip", deviates from the deep minimum recorded prior to the 1946 event and does not reliably predict the eruption timing. Recent photometric and spectroscopic observations indicate that the system is returning to a high-accretion state. Given this, an eruption may be imminent, even without distinct precursors. While the next eruption of T CrB will be a major scientific event, its expected peak brightness of $V \sim 2$ mag highlights the importance of setting realistic public expectations for what will be a visually modest, yet astrophysically very significant, celestial event.</description>

      <title>Quasiperiodic Slow-Propagating EUV "Wave" Trains After the Filament Eruption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The eruption of the filament/flux rope generates the coronal perturbations, which further form EUV waves. There are two types of EUV waves, including fast-mode magnetosonic waves and slow waves. In this paper, we first report an event showing the Quasiperiodic Slow-Propagating (QSP) EUV "wave" trains during an M6.4-class flare (SOL2023-02-25T18:40), using multiple observations from SDO/AIA, CHASE/HIS, ASO-S/FMG, SUTRI, and LASCO/C2. The QSP "wave" trains occurred as the filament showed a rapid rise. The QSP "wave" trains have the projected speeds of 50-130 km s$^{-1}$ on the plane of the sky, which is slower than the fast-mode magnetosonic speed in the solar corona. And the calculated period of the QSP wave trains is 117.9 s, which is in good agreement with the associated flare Quasi-Periodic Pulsation (140.3 s). The QSP wave trains could be observed during the entire impulsive phase of the flare and lasted about 30 minutes in the field of view (FOV) of SDO/AIA. About 30 minutes later, they appeared in the FOV of LASCO/C2 and propagated to the northwest. We suggest that the QSP wave trains are probably apparent waves that are caused by the successive stretching of the inclined field lines overlying the eruptive filament. The periodic pattern of the QSP wave trains may be related to the intermittent energy release during the flare.</description>

      <title>Reconnection nanojets in an erupting solar filament with unprecedented high speeds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar nanojets are small-scale jets generated by component magnetic reconnection, characterized by collimated plasma motion perpendicular to the reconnecting magnetic field lines. As an indicator of nanoflare events, they are believed to play a significant role in coronal heating. Using high-resolution extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) imaging observations from the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI) onboard the Solar Orbiter mission, we identified 27 nanojets in an erupting filament on September 30, 2024. They are potentially associated with the untwisting of magnetic field lines of the filament. Most nanojets exhibit velocities around 450 km s$^{-1}$, with the fastest reaching approximately 800 km s$^{-1}$, significantly higher than previously reported but comparable to the typical coronal Alfv\'en speed. To our knowledge, these are the highest speeds ever reported for small-scale jets (less than ~1 Mm wide) in the solar atmosphere. Our findings suggest that these nanoflare-type phenomena can be more dynamic than previously recognized and may contribute to the energy release process of solar eruptions and the heating of coronal active regions.</description>

      <title>Detection of $J$-band photometric periodicity in the T8 dwarfs 2MASS J09393548-2448279 and EQ J1959-3338</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aims: We aim to study the near-infrared variability of the T8 dwarfs 2MASS J09393548-2448279 and EQ J1959-3338 by analyzing their $J$-band photometric signal, which can provide new insights into the atmospheric dynamics of cold brown dwarfs. Methods: We used FLAMINGOS-2 on the Gemini South telescope to perform $J$-band differential photometry continuously over 4 h for each target. The resulting light curves have a cadence of 20 s and a photometric uncertainty of 2-4 mmag. Results: We detect periodic variability in both T8 dwarfs, with an amplitude of $16.6\pm0.9$ mmag and a period of $1.364\pm0.012$ h for EQ J1959-3338, which we attribute to rotational modulation. For 2MASS J09393548-2448279, we observe an amplitude of $4.6\pm0.4$ mmag and a period of $1.733\pm0.040$ h, though this periodicity could represent a fraction of a longer period. Conclusions: With the detection of variability in 2MASS J09393548-2448279 and EQ J1959-3338, the number of known variable T8 dwarfs has doubled, making them prime candidates for infrared space-based monitoring and radio observations to investigate atmospheric dynamics and the influence of the magnetic field in very cool atmospheres.</description>

      <title>ASASSN-24hd; a dwarf nova bridging WZ Sge-type and SU UMa-type superoutbursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: WZ Sge-type dwarf novae (DNe) form a subclass in cataclysmic variables, characterized by short-period variations called superhumps during an outburst. Here we present optical ground-based and TESS observations of ASASSN-24hd in its 2024-2025 outburst. ASASSN-24hd is the first reported WZ Sge-type DN outburst fully covered by TESS, providing a great opportunity to study the evolution of superhumps. Our observations establish its early and stage-A ordinary superhumps as 0.05711(4) and 0.05919(5) d, respectively, resulting in its mass ratio of 0.098(4). The TESS observations confirm that the evolution of its superhump period, amplitude, and profile after the appearance of ordinary superhumps is generally consistent with those of SU UMa-type DNe observed with Kepler and TESS. Furthermore, we find that ASASSN-24hd in outburst shares a great similarity to the 2010 superoutburst of an SU UMa-type DN V585 Lyr, observed by Kepler, particularly including the superhump evolution and the long waiting time ($\gtrsimeq$ 5 d) before the stage A--B transition of ordinary superhumps. The shorter superoutburst cycles and smaller outburst amplitude in V585 Lyr than those of ASASSN-24hd disfavor the interpretation that V585 Lyr is, in fact, a face-on WZ Sge-type DN where early superhumps are undetectable. Instead, one possibility of their critical differences is either low quiescence viscosity or inner disk truncation, which has been invoked to explain the extreme nature of WZ Sge-type DNe, but future observations in quiescence are vital to conclude. These findings emphasize the borderline between SU UMa-type and WZ Sge-type DNe.</description>

      <title>Wave Particle Interaction in the Upstream of ICME Shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shocks associated with Interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejections are known to energize charged particles and give rise to Solar Energetic Particles. Many of these energetic particles move ahead of the shock to create a foreshock region. The foreshock region primarily consists of solar wind plasma, exhibiting turbulent velocity and magnetic fields. Such turbulent behavior results from inherent solar wind turbulence modified by energetic particles. We analyze magnetic field data from six such ICME shocks observed by the Wind spacecraft. The analysis of the shock upstream shows that the magnetic power spectral density (PSD) maintains a power-law slope of $-5/3$. We also identify clear intermittent peaks in the PSD. After characterizing these peaks, we investigate various possibilities for their generation. Our analysis indicates that these peaks in the PSD are due to the resonant interaction of Alfv\'en waves with the bulk solar wind protons and protons with energy up to $10$~keV. However, evidence of Alfv\'en wave interaction with highly energetic protons is not evident in our analysis, and we anticipate that such evidence is obscured by the prevailing solar wind turbulence in the shock upstream.</description>

      <title>21 years of Astronomy at Warwick: celebrating the legacy of Prof. Tom Marsh</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Between the 4th and 6th of September 2024, the Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics group at the University of Warwick held a meeting to celebrate 21 years of astronomy at Warwick and the scientific legacy of the late Prof. Tom Marsh, the group founder. More than a hundred people attended the meeting, with about half of the attendees being external delegates and coming from as far afield as the USA and South Africa. Tom Marsh moved to the University of Warwick from Southampton in 2003, after the Department of Physics decided to expand the scope of its research. From its humble beginnings with only two staff members, Tom himself and Boris G\"ansicke, one postdoc and a couple of PhD students, the group has now grown to more than 95 members, including 25 staff. Tom pioneered the development of Doppler tomography, led key discoveries in the field of double-degenerate binary systems and made extensive contributions to instrumentation, primarily to developing the high-speed imaging photometers ULTRACAM, ULTRASPEC and HiPERCAM. This article provides a summary of Tom's legacy and Warwick's history as presented in the 21 years of Astronomy at Warwick meeting.</description>

      <title>Expanding Ejecta Method: I. Mapping Supernova Morphology with Intensity Interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the potential of optical intensity interferometry to extract angularly resolved information from supernova explosions, introducing the "expanding ejecta method" (EEM) as a robust alternative to the classical expanding photosphere method (EPM). Foreseeing future improvements to intensity interferometers of large light collection area ($25\pi\,\rm{m}^2$ per telescope) equipped with spectral multiplexing ($10^4$ spectral resolution) and fast photodetectors ($10\,\mathrm{ps}$ timing resolution, $50\%$ overall efficiency), we demonstrate that high signal-to-noise measurements of the visibility modulus are achievable for Type IIP (Type Ia) supernovae out to $3~(12)\,\mathrm{Mpc}$. By focusing on generic line emission and absorption in ballistic ejecta, the EEM can relax assumptions about spherical symmetry, blackbody radiation, and extinction. The EEM enables angular diameter distances to be determined with $\sim2\%$ precision for supernovae of apparent magnitude $m = 12$ from a 60-hour observation by an intensity interferometer with those same instrumental specifications. We argue that the EEM is significantly more robust to modeling uncertainties and systematic effects than (variants of) the EPM. In a companion paper, we show how the EEM can be used to provide geometric anchors for cosmic distance ladder calibration, or to construct a wholly independent Hubble diagram based on angular diameter distances.</description>

Abstract: We report the analysis of four unambiguous planets and one possible planet from the subprime fields ($\Gamma \leq 1~{\rm hr}^{-1}$) of the 2017 Korea Microlensing Telescope Network (KMTNet) microlensing survey, to complete the KMTNet AnomalyFinder planetary sample for the 2017 subprime fields. They are KMT-2017-BLG-0849, KMT-2017-BLG-1057, OGLE-2017-BLG-0364, and KMT-2017-BLG-2331 (unambiguous), as well as KMT-2017-BLG-0958 (possible). For the four unambiguous planets, the mean planet-host mass ratios, $q$, are $(1.0, 1.2, 4.6, 13) \times 10^{-4}$, the median planetary masses are $(6.4, 24, 76, 171)~M_{\oplus}$ and the median host masses are $(0.19, 0.57, 0.49, 0.40)~M_{\odot}$ from a Bayesian analysis. We have completed the AnomalyFinder planetary sample from the first 4-year KMTNet data (2016--2019), with 112 unambiguous planets in total, which nearly tripled the microlensing planetary sample. The ``sub-Saturn desert'' ($\log q = \left[-3.6, -3.0\right]$) found in the 2018 and 2019 KMTNet samples is confirmed by the 2016 and 2017 KMTNet samples.</description>

      <title>Microlensing events indicate that super-Earth exoplanets are common in Jupiter-like orbits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exoplanets classified as super-Earths are commonly observed on short period orbits, close to their host stars, but their abundance on wider orbits is poorly constrained. Gravitational microlensing is sensitive to exoplanets on wide orbits. We observed the microlensing event OGLE-2016-BLG-0007, which indicates an exoplanet with a planet-to-star mass ratio roughly double the Earth-Sun mass-ratio, on an orbit longer than Saturn's. We combine this event with a larger sample from a microlensing survey to determine the distribution of mass ratios for planets on wide orbits. We infer there are $\sim 0.35$ super-Earth planets per star on Jupiter-like orbits. The observations are most consistent with a bimodal distribution, with separate peaks for super-Earths and gas giants. We suggest that this reflects differences in their formation processes.</description>

Abstract: We model the light HESS J1731-347 compact object (of known stellar mass and radius) within Einstein's General Relativity imposing the Karmarkar condition in gravity for anisotropic stars. The three free parameters of the analytic solution are determined imposing the matching conditions at the surface of the star for objects of known stellar mass and radius. Finally, using well established criteria it is shown that the solution is compatible with all requirements for well behaved and realistic solutions. Furthermore, we study the radial oscillation modes, and we compare to the ones corresponding to an isotropic star modeled by the Tolman IV exact analytic solution obtained long time ago. A comparison between the large frequency separations is made as well.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a variable yellow supergiant progenitor for the Type IIb SN 2024abfo</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the discovery of a progenitor candidate for the Type IIb SN 2024abfo using multi-epoch pre-explosion images from the Hubble Space Telescope and the Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey. The progenitor exhibited a ~0.7 mag decline in F814W from 2001 to 2013, followed by significant brightness and color fluctuations in the g, r and z bands. This is the first time that a variable progenitor has been found for a SN IIb. We suggest that the variability is caused by intrinsic changes in the progenitor star instead of varying obscuration by circumstellar dust. Our results show that the progenitor of SN 2024abfo was likely a yellow supergiant star with an initial mass of 12--14, 14--15 and 15--18 Msun for different assumed values of circumstellar reddening of E(B-V)_CSM = 0, 0.1 and 0.2 mag. Our study underscores the critical role of multi-epoch imaging surveys in revealing the final stages of core-collapse supernovae progenitors.</description>

Abstract: We present the construction and early results of ESPARTACO 2, the new stellar spectrograph built for research and education at the Astronomical Observatory of the Universidad de los Andes in Bogot\'a, Colombia. This instrument offers several resolutions from 20,000 in first order using a 50 $\mu$m fiber, to 100,000 in second order in the near infrared. Precise radial-velocity measurements are made possible by simultaneous wavelength calibration. Combined with the 40-cm Meade telescope located at our facilities, a limiting magnitude of 6 is reached. This instrument is a considerable improvement over its predecessor in throughput, reliability and ease.</description>

      <title>Possible evidence for the 478 keV emission line from $^7$Be decay during the outburst phases of V1369 Cen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: After decades of uncertainty about the origin of lithium, recent evidence suggests Galactic novae as its main astrophysical source. In this work, we present possible evidence for the first detection of the $^7$Be line at 478 keV, observed with the INTEGRAL satellite. The emission is temporally and spatially coincident with the outburst of the bright nova V1369 Cen, and line significance ranges from 2.5$\sigma$ to $\sim$1.9$\sigma$, depending on the detection methodology. A bootstrap analysis, assuming a fixed FWHM of 8 keV, provides a flux of $(4.9 \pm 2.0) \times 10^{-4}$ ph/cm$^2$/s centered at 479.0 $\pm$ 2.5 keV, with a 2.5$\sigma$ significant excess. This flux implies a total $^7$Be mass of $M_{^7Be} = (1.2^{+2.0}_{-0.6})$ $\times 10^{-8}$ M$_{\odot}$ at the distance determined using several indicators including the {\em Gaia} satellite. For a nova ejected mass estimated from radio observations, this result implies a $^7$Be=Li yield corresponding to $A(Li) = 7.1^{+0.7}_{-0.3}$. This value is comparable to those measured in a dozen novae through optical observations. Crucially, we confirm optically derived $^7$Li yields and demonstrate the groundbreaking potential of using gamma-ray data to measure Li abundances.</description>

Abstract: In our Bayesian and Statistical Analysis investigation of the open cluster NGC 6416, we utilized Gaia EDR3 astrometry data and ensemble-based unsupervised machine learning techniques to identify 406 cluster members. Using the MESA Isochrones and Stellar Tracks (MIST) with Gaia EDR3 data, we determined the following parameters for NGC 6416: a distance of approximately 1021pc, an age of about $12.58\pm 0.1$ Myr, a metallicity (z) of roughly $0.032\pm0.0015$, a binarity fraction near $0.419\pm0.021$, and an extinction ($A_V$) of approximately $0.995\pm0.058$ mag for an $R_V$ value of around $3.064\pm0.102$. We also fitted the radial surface density profile and conducted orbit analysis of the cluster using galpy. And finally found that the star formation scenarios are not observed in the open star cluster NGC 6416.</description>

      <title>WR + O binaries as probes of the first phase of mass transfer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00938v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context. Wolf-Rayet (WR) and O-star binaries can be the progenitors of X-ray binaries and double black hole binaries. Their formation is not yet fully understood, however. For 21 observed WR+O systems, we aim to infer whether the mass transfer started on the main sequence (Case A) or later (Case B). We also calculated (limits on) the mass-transfer efficiency {\beta}, that is, the fraction of transferred mass that is accreted, and the parameter {\gamma}, which denotes the fraction of angular momentum of the binary that is lost per unit mass in units of the average angular momentum of the binary per unit mass. Aims. We inferred the possible values for the initial masses based on the observed WR masses and models for WR from the literature. With these initial primary masses, we created a grid of possible periods and secondary masses for which we determined the values that {\beta} and {\gamma} would have taken for either Case A or Case B mass transfer. Based on this, we also determined the case of mass transfer that is most likely for each system. Methods. Taking into account the progenitor distribution of WR+O binaries, we find that highly non-conservative Case A mass transfer seems to be the most likely scenario for the majority of systems as this can explain 14 out of 21 systems. The angular momentum loss is likely relatively high (typically {\gamma} &gt; 1). Our finding that most systems in our sample experienced Case A mass transfer contradicts the expectation that most massive binaries go through Case B mass transfer. This suggests that post-case-B systems are significantly underrepresented in the observed WR+O binary population, either intrinsically or due to severe selection effects.</description>

      <title>Testing the Rossby Paradigm: Weakened Magnetic Braking in early K-type Stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.19169v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is an intricate relationship between the organization of large-scale magnetic fields by a stellar dynamo and the rate of angular momentum loss due to magnetized stellar winds. An essential ingredient for the operation of a large-scale dynamo is the Coriolis force, which imprints organizing flows on the global convective patterns and inhibits the complete cancellation of bipolar magnetic regions. Consequently, it is natural to expect a rotational threshold for large-scale dynamo action and for the efficient angular momentum loss that it mediates through magnetic braking. Here we present new observational constraints on magnetic braking for an evolutionary sequence of six early K-type stars. To determine the wind braking torque for each of our targets, we combine spectropolarimetric constraints on the large-scale magnetic field, Ly-alpha or X-ray constraints on the mass-loss rate, as well as uniform estimates of the stellar rotation period, mass, and radius. As identified previously from similar observations of hotter stars, we find that the wind braking torque decreases abruptly by more than an order of magnitude at a critical value of the stellar Rossby number. Given that all of the stars in our sample exhibit clear activity cycles, we suggest that weakened magnetic braking may coincide with the operation of a subcritical stellar dynamo.</description>

      <title>Modelling the impact of circumbinary disk accretion on post-AGB binary evolution and surface chemistry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04660v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Post-asymptotic giant branch (post-AGB) binaries are surrounded by dusty circumbinary disks, and exhibit unexpected orbital properties resulting from poorly understood binary interaction processes. Re-accreted gas from the circumbinary disk alters the photospheric chemistry of the post-AGB star, producing a characteristic underabundance of refractory elements that correlates with condensation temperature $\unicode{x2013}$a phenomenon known as chemical depletion. This work investigates how re-accretion from a disk drives chemical depletion, and the impact accreted matter has on post-AGB evolution. We used the MESA code to evolve 0.55 and 0.60 M$_{\odot}$ post-AGB stars with the accretion of refractory element-depleted gas from a circumbinary disk. Our study adopts observationally-constrained initial accretion rates and disk masses to reproduce the chemical depletion patterns of six well-studied post-AGB binary stars: EP Lyr, HP Lyr, IRAS 17038-4815, IRAS 09144-4933, HD 131356, and SX Cen. We find high accretion rates ($&gt;\,$10$^{-7}$ M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$) and large disk masses ($\geq\,$10$^{-2}$ M$_{\odot}$) necessary to reproduce observed depletion, particularly in higher-mass, hotter post-AGB stars (T$_{\textrm{eff}}\geq$ 6000 K). A slower evolution (lower core mass) is required to reproduce cooler (T$_{\textrm{eff}}\leq$ 5000 K) depleted post-AGB stars. Rapid accretion significantly impacts post-AGB evolution, stalling stars at cooler effective temperatures and extending post-AGB lifetimes by factors of around 3 to 10. Despite this, extended post-AGB timescales remain within or below the planetary nebula (PN) visibility timescale, suggesting accretion cannot account for the observed lack of ionised PNe in post-AGB binaries. Our findings constrain accretion-flow parameters and advance our understanding of disk-binary interactions in post-AGB systems.</description>

      <title>Multi-mode Pulsations in AGB Stars: Insights from 3D RHD CO5BOLD Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11978v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stars on the AGB can exhibit acoustic pulsation modes of different radial orders, along with non-radial modes. These pulsations are essential to the mass-loss process and influence the evolutionary pathways of AGB stars. P-L relations serve as a valuable diagnostic for understanding stellar evolution along the AGB. 3D RHD simulations provide a powerful tool for investigating pulsation phenomena driven by convective processes and their non-linear coupling with stellar oscillations. We investigate multi-mode pulsations in AGB stars using advanced 3D 'star-in-a-box' simulations with the CO5BOLD code. Signatures of these multi-mode pulsations were weak in our previous 3D models. Our focus is on identifying and characterising the various pulsation modes, examining their persistence and transitions, and comparing the results with 1D model predictions and observational data where applicable. We produced a new model grid comprising AGB stars with current masses of $0.7$, $0.8$, and $1\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$. Fourier analysis was applied to dynamic, time-dependent quantities to extract dominant pulsation modes and their corresponding periods. Additionally, wavelet transforms were employed to identify mode-switching behaviour over time. The models successfully reproduce the P-L sequences found in AGB stars. Mode-switching phenomena are found in both the models and wavelet analyses of observational data, allowing us to infer similarities in the underlying pulsation dynamics. These 3D simulations highlight the natural emergence of multi-mode pulsations, including both radial and non-radial modes, driven by the self-consistent interplay of convection and oscillations. Our findings underscore the value of 3D RHD models in capturing the non-linear behaviour of AGB pulsations, providing insights into mode switching, envelope structures, and potential links to episodic mass-loss events.</description>

      <title>Small-scale dynamic phenomena associated with interacting fan-spine topologies: quiet-Sun Ellerman bombs, UV brightenings, and chromospheric inverted-Y-shaped jets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15996v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: QSEBs are small-scale magnetic reconnection events in lower solar atmosphere. Sometimes, they exhibit transition region counterparts, known as UV brightenings. Magnetic field extrapolations suggest that QSEBs can occur at various locations of a fan-spine topology, with UV brightening occurring at null point through a common reconnection process. We aim to understand how complex magnetic configurations like interacting fan-spine topologies can cause small-scale dynamic phenomena in lower atmosphere. QSEBs were detected using k-means clustering on Hbeta observations from Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope (SST). Further, chromospheric inverted-Y-shaped jets were identified in the Hbeta blue wing. Magnetic field topologies were determined through potential field extrapolations from photospheric magnetograms using the Fe I 6173 A line. UV brightenings were detected in IRIS 1400 A SJI. We identify two distinct magnetic configurations associated with QSEBs, UV brightenings, and chromospheric inverted-Y-shaped jets. The first involves a nested fan-spine structure where, due to flux emergence, an inner 3D null forms inside fan surface of an outer 3D null with some overlap. QSEBs occur at two footpoints along the shared fan surface, with UV brightening located near the outer 3D null point. The jet originates close to the two QSEBs and follows the path of high squashing factor Q. We discuss a comparable scenario using a numerical simulation. In second case, two adjacent fan-spine topologies share fan footpoints at a common positive polarity patch, with the QSEB, along with a chromospheric inverted-Y-shaped jet, occurring at the intersection having high Q values. This study demonstrates through observational and modelling support that associated QSEBs, UV brightenings, and chromospheric inverted-Y-shaped jets share a common origin driven by magnetic reconnection between interacting fan-spine topologies.</description>

      <title>In Situ Measurements of Dark Photon Dark Matter Using Parker Solar Probe: Going beyond the Radio Window</title>

Abstract: Dark photon dark matter (DPDM) emerges as a compelling candidate for ultralight bosonic dark matter, detectable through resonant conversion into photons within a plasma environment. This study employs in-situ measurements from the Parker Solar Probe (PSP), the first spacecraft to venture into the solar corona, to probe for DPDM signatures. The PSP in-situ measurements go beyond the traditional radio window, spanning frequencies between about 10 kHz and 20 MHz, a challenging range inaccessible to Earth-based radio astronomy. Additionally, the proximity of PSP to the resonant conversion location enhances the signal flux, providing a distinct advantage over ground-based observations. As a result, the PSP data establishes the most stringent constraints on the kinetic mixing parameter $\epsilon$ for DPDM frequencies between 70 kHz and 20 MHz, with values of $\epsilon \lesssim 10^{-14}-10^{-13}$. Investigating the data from STEREO satellites resulted in weaker constraints compared to those obtained from PSP. By utilizing state-of-the-art solar observations from space, we have surpassed the cosmic microwave background limits derived from early-universe observations.</description>

      <title>Stellar Tidal Disruptions by Newborn Neutron Stars or Black Holes: A Mechanism for Hydrogen-poor (Super)luminous Supernovae and Fast Blue Optical Transients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03316v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hydrogen-poor supernovae (SNe) of Type Ibc are explosions of massive stars that lost their hydrogen envelopes, typically due to interactions with a binary companion. We consider the case where the natal kick imparted to the neutron star (NS) or black hole (BH) remnant brings the compact object to a collision with a main-sequence companion, eventually leading to full tidal disruption of the companion. Subsequently, super-Eddington accretion onto the NS/BH launches a powerful, fast wind which collides with the SN ejecta and efficiently converts the kinetic energy of the wind into radiation. The radiation is reprocessed by the surrounding ejecta into a luminous ($\sim 10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$ at peak), days to months-long transient with optical peaks from $-19$ to $-21$ mag, comparable to (super)luminous Type Ibc SNe and fast blue optical transients (FBOTs) like AT2018cow. From a Monte-Carlo analysis we estimate the fraction of tidal disruptions following SNe in binaries to be $\sim 0.1$--$1$\%, roughly compatible with the event rates of these luminous SNe. At the broad-brush level, our model reproduces the multi-wavelength and spectral observations of FBOTs, and has the potential to explain peculiar features seen in some (super)luminous SNe which are difficult to reproduce by the conventional magnetar spindown mechanism, such as late-time hydrogen lines, bumpy light curves, and pre-peak excess.</description>

      <title>Numerical simulations of the interaction between the stellar magnetic field and a planet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09390v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kepler and TESS observations led to the discovery of many close-in super Earths, including some with ultra-short orbital periods ($\lesssim 1$ day). During and shortly after their multi-Myr formation epoch, their GKM host stars generally have kilogauss magnetic fields which can exert torques on the orbits of nearby super-Earths. In this work, we examine one aspect of this interaction: the magnetic torque resulting from Alfv\'en-wing drag on non-corotating, non-magnetized planets engulfed by the host stars' stellar wind. We compute the magnitude of this torque for a range of stellar magnetic field strengths, and planetary orbital velocities. We also model the planets' orbital evolution, taking into account for stellar spin down and magnetic field decay, and derive the boundaries within which ultra-short-period super-Earths can survive.</description>
