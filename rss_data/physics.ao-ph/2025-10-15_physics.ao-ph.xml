      <title>Probabilistic Super-Resolution for Urban Micrometeorology via a Schr\"odinger Bridge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study employs a neural network that represents the solution to a Schr\"odinger bridge problem to perform super-resolution of 2-m temperature in an urban area. Schr\"odinger bridges generally describe transformations between two data distributions based on diffusion processes. We use a specific Schr\"odinger-bridge model (SM) that directly transforms low-resolution data into high-resolution data, unlike denoising diffusion probabilistic models (simply, diffusion models; DMs) that generate high-resolution data from Gaussian noise. Low-resolution and high-resolution data were obtained from separate numerical simulations with a physics-based model under common initial and boundary conditions. Compared with a DM, the SM attains comparable accuracy at one-fifth the computational cost, requiring 50 neural-network evaluations per datum for the DM and only 10 for the SM. Furthermore, high-resolution samples generated by the SM exhibit larger variance, implying superior uncertainty quantification relative to the DM. Owing to the reduced computational cost of the SM, our results suggest the feasibility of real-time ensemble micrometeorological prediction using SM-based super-resolution.</description>

      <title>The stochastic skeleton model for the Madden-Julian Oscillation with time-dependent observation-based forcing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16060v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze solutions to the stochastic skeleton model, a minimal nonlinear oscillator model for the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO). This model has been recognized for its ability to reproduce several large-scale features of the MJO. In previous studies, the model's forcings were predominantly chosen to be mathematically simple and time-independent. Here, we present solutions to the model with time-dependent observation-based forcing functions. Our results show that the model, with these more realistic forcing functions, successfully replicates key characteristics of MJO events, such as their lifetime, extent, and amplitude, whose statistics agree well with observations. However, we find that the seasonality of MJO events and the spatial variations in the MJO properties are not well reproduced. Having implemented the model in the presence of time-dependent forcings, we can analyze the impact of temporal variability at different time scales. In particular, we study the model's ability to reflect changes in MJO characteristics under the different phases of ENSO. We find that it does not capture differences in studied characteristics of MJO events in response to differences in conditions during El Ni\~no, La Ni\~na, and neutral ENSO.</description>

      <title>Project Severe Weather Archive of the Philippines (SWAP) Part 2: Baseline Climatology of Close Proximity Soundings in Hailstorm Environments across Luzon, Philippines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09530v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The environments of severe thunderstorms that produced hail were examined using 171 proximity soundings (2005-2024) archived in the 3rd Data Release of Project SWAP. These soundings were categorized based on their geographical occurrence into three hail-prone environments across Luzon, Philippines. For each case, key parameters describing instability, vertical wind shear, and moisture were calculated to assess the conditions for hail production. The probability of hail occurrence, expressed as a function of W$_{\text{MAX}}$ ($\sqrt{2 \times \text{CAPE}}$) and 0-6 km bulk shear (DLS), revealed patterns distinct from those reported in other regions. Hail events in Luzon were most likely under high CAPE conditions, where boundary-layer moisture was sufficient, mid- and low-level lapse rates were steep, and lifting condensation levels were high. Surprisingly, weak DLS was common across Luzon hail environments, diverging from existing severe weather climatologies, yet large DCAPE indicated environments conducive to damaging wind events. When DLS was replaced with the shear magnitude between the cloud base and equilibrium level, the probability of hail occurrence increased, better aligning with global severe weather climatologies. This finding is supported by hodograph analyses, which show largely unidirectional wind profiles: strong speed shear aloft but weak directional shear in the low-levels. Parameters such as W$_{\text{MAX}}$SHEAR, W$_{\text{MAX}}$SHEAR$_{\text{LCL-EL}}$, and BWD$_{\text{LCL-EL}}$ emerge as potential discriminators between non-severe and severe thunderstorms capable of producing hail, and as useful metrics for assessing convective storm severity in Luzon and possibly countrywide. Finally, two recurring severe setups conducive to hail were identified: (1) an easterly regime associated with trade winds, and (2) a westerly regime linked to the Asian summer monsoon.</description>
