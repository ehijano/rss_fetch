Abstract: Recently uncovered archives at the University of Franche-Comt\'e in Besan\c{c}on (France) reveal a rich history of research and teaching in physics since the Faculty of Science was first established in 1845. Here, we describe a selection of notable activities conducted by the named Chairs of Physics during the period 1845-1970. We uncover a long tradition of major contributions to physics education and research, including the production of highly regarded physics textbooks that were widely used in Europe, as well as pioneering contributions to electron diffraction and microscopy, Fourier optics, and holography. These discoveries yield valuable insights into the historical development of physics research in France, and show how even a small provincial university was able to stay up-to-date with international developments across several areas of physics.</description>
