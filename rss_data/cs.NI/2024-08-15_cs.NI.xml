      <title>A Stability-first Approach to Running TCP over Starlink</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The end-to-end connectivity patterns between two points on Earth are highly volatile if mediated via a Low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellation. This is rooted in the enormous speeds at which satellites in LEO must travel relative to the Earth's surface. While changes in end-to-end routes are rare events in stationary and terrestrial applications, they are a dominating factor for connection-oriented services running over LEO constellations and mega-constellations. This paper discusses how TCP-over-constellations is affected by the need for rerouting and how orbital route selection algorithms impact the end-to-end performance of communication. In contrast to the state of the art that primarily optimizes for instantaneous shortest routes (i.e. lowest delay), we propose several algorithms that have route stability and longevity in their focus. We show that this shift in focus comes with vastly improved end-to-end communication performance, and we discuss peculiar effects of the typical TCP-like implementations, taking inspiration from the Starlink constellation in our empirical investigations. The spectrum of algorithms proposed provides a basis for co-designing suitable orbital route selection algorithms and tailored transport control algorithms.</description>

      <title>A First Look at Related Website Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first measurement of the user-effect and privacy impact of "Related Website Sets," a recent proposal to reduce browser privacy protections between two sites if those sites are related to each other. An assumption (both explicitly and implicitly) underpinning the Related Website Sets proposal is that users can accurately determine if two sites are related via the same entity. In this work, we probe this assumption via measurements and a user study of 30 participants, to assess the ability of Web users to determine if two sites are (according to the Related Website Sets feature) related to each other. We find that this is largely not the case. Our findings indicate that 42 (36.8%) of the user determinations in our study are incorrect in privacy-harming ways, where users think that sites are not related, but would be treated as related (and so due less privacy protections) by the Related Website Sets feature. Additionally, 22 (73.3%) of participants made at least one incorrect evaluation during the study. We also characterise the Related Website Sets list, its composition over time, and its governance.</description>

      <title>Context-aware Container Orchestration in Serverless Edge Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adopting serverless computing to edge networks benefits end-users from the pay-as-you-use billing model and flexible scaling of applications. This paradigm extends the boundaries of edge computing and remarkably improves the quality of services. However, due to the heterogeneous nature of computing and bandwidth resources in edge networks, it is challenging to dynamically allocate different resources while adapting to the burstiness and high concurrency in serverless workloads. This article focuses on serverless function provisioning in edge networks to optimize end-to-end latency, where the challenge lies in jointly allocating wireless bandwidth and computing resources among heterogeneous computing nodes. To address this challenge, We devised a context-aware learning framework that adaptively orchestrates a wide spectrum of resources and jointly considers them to avoid resource fragmentation. Extensive simulation results justified that the proposed algorithm reduces over 95% of converge time while the end-to-end delay is comparable to the state of the art.</description>

      <title>FedMADE: Robust Federated Learning for Intrusion Detection in IoT Networks Using a Dynamic Aggregation Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices across multiple sectors has escalated serious network security concerns. This has prompted ongoing research in Machine Learning (ML)-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) for cyber-attack classification. Traditional ML models require data transmission from IoT devices to a centralized server for traffic analysis, raising severe privacy concerns. To address this issue, researchers have studied Federated Learning (FL)-based IDSs that train models across IoT devices while keeping their data localized. However, the heterogeneity of data, stemming from distinct vulnerabilities of devices and complexity of attack vectors, poses a significant challenge to the effectiveness of FL models. While current research focuses on adapting various ML models within the FL framework, they fail to effectively address the issue of attack class imbalance among devices, which significantly degrades the classification accuracy of minority attacks. To overcome this challenge, we introduce FedMADE, a novel dynamic aggregation method, which clusters devices by their traffic patterns and aggregates local models based on their contributions towards overall performance. We evaluate FedMADE against other FL algorithms designed for non-IID data and observe up to 71.07% improvement in minority attack classification accuracy. We further show that FedMADE is robust to poisoning attacks and incurs only a 4.7% (5.03 seconds) latency overhead in each communication round compared to FedAvg, without increasing the computational load of IoT devices.</description>

      <title>A MAC Protocol with Time Reversal for Wireless Networks within Computing Packages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wireless Network-on-Chip (WNoC) is a promising concept which provides a solution to overcome the scalability issues in prevailing networks-in-package for many-core processors. However, the electromagnetic propagation inside the chip package leads to energy reverberation, resulting in Inter-Symbol Interference (ISI) with high delay spreads. Time Reversal (TR) is a technique that benefits the unique time-invariant channel with rich multipath effects to focus the energy to the desired transceiver. TR mitigates both ISI and co-channel interference, hence providing parallel communications in both space and time. Thus, TR is a versatile candidate to improve the aggregate bandwidth of wireless on-chip networks provided that a Medium Access Control (MAC) is used to efficiently share the wireless medium. In this paper, we explore a simple yet resilient TR-based MAC protocol (TR-MAC) design for WNoC. We propose to manage multiple parallel transmissions with simultaneous spatial channels in the same time slot with TR precoding and focused energy detection at the transceiver. Our results show that TR-MAC can be employed in massive computing architectures with improved latency and throughput while matching with the stringent requirements of the physical layer.</description>

      <title>Offline to Online Learning for Personalized Bandwidth Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13481v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we tackle the problem of bandwidth estimation (BWE) for real-time communication systems through expert personalization. While expert heuristic-based methods have been widely adopted, tailoring these methods for each and every end user environment is cumbersome due to the level of domain expertise and manual effort required to adjust the carefully tuned heuristic parameters. Thus. we propose Merlin, a data-driven solution to BWE that harnesses expert demonstrations from prior heuristic-based methods to extract an expert BWE policy. The extracted policy can then be finetuned to end user network conditions to improve user quality of experience (QoE). In real-world videoconferencing calls, Merlin matches our expert's policy with no statistically significant movements in terms of objective QoE metrics. Additionally, we show that personalizing Merlin's control policy is possible through a small number of online data-driven parameter updates.</description>

      <title>System-Level Simulation Framework for NB-IoT: Key Features and Performance Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17691v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Narrowband Internet of Things (NB-IoT) is a technology specifically designated by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) to meet the explosive demand for massive machine-type communications (mMTC), and it is evolving to RedCap. Industrial companies have increasingly adopted NB-IoT as the solution for mMTC due to its lightweight design and comprehensive technical specifications released by 3GPP. This paper presents a system-level simulation framework for NB-IoT networks to evaluate their performance. The system-level simulator is structured into four parts: initialization, pre-generation, main simulation loop, and post-processing. Additionally, three essential features are investigated to enhance coverage, support massive connections, and ensure low power consumption, respectively. Simulation results demonstrate that the cumulative distribution function curves of the signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio fully comply with industrial standards. Furthermore, the throughput performance explains how NB-IoT networks realize massive connections at the cost of data rate. This work highlights its practical utility and paves the way for developing NB-IoT networks.</description>

      <title>Minimizing Age of Information with Generate at Will Status Updates and Age-Agnostic Cyclic Scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18791v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the scheduling problem for a multi-source single-server generate-at-will (GAW) status update system with sources having heterogeneous service times and weights, with the goal of minimizing the weighted sum age of information (AoI). In particular, we study \emph{age-agnostic} schedulers which rely only on the first two moments of the source service times and they are relatively easier to implement than their age-aware counterparts which make use of the actual realizations of the service times. In particular, we focus on age-agnostic cyclic schedulers with $O(1)$ runtime complexity where status updates from multiple sources are scheduled according to a fixed finite transmission pattern. We first develop an analytical method to obtain the exact average AoI of each source when a transmission pattern is given. Then, we derive the optimum transmission pattern in closed form for the specific case of two sources. For general number of sources, we propose a novel algorithm, called IS (Insertion Search), for constructing transmission patterns, and we show that IS is capable of producing the optimum pattern for two-source systems, and it outperforms other existing age-agnostic schemes, for the case of more than two sources. Numerical examples are presented to showcase the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description>
