      <title>Evolved stars with inconsistent age estimates: Abundance outliers or mass transfer products?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the Milky Way disk there is a strong trend linking stellar age to surface element abundances. Here we explore this relationship with a dataset of 8,803 red-giant and red-clump stars with both asteroseismic data from NASA Kepler Mission and surface abundances from the SDSS-V MWM. We find, with a k-nearest-neighbors approach, that the [Mg/H] and [Fe/Mg] abundance ratios predict asteroseismic ages to an accuracy of about 2 Gyr for the majority of stars. That said, there are substantial outlier stars whose surface abundances do not match their asteroseismic ages. Because asteroseismic ages for these stars are fundamentally based on density or mass, these outliers are mass-transfer candidates. Stars whose surface abundances predict a younger age (higher mass) than what's seen in the asteroseismology are mass accretor candidates (MAC); stars whose abundances predict an older age (lower mass) than the asteroseismology age are mass donor candidates (MDC). We create precise control samples, matched according to (1) surface abundances and (2) asteroseismic ages, for both the MAC and MDC stars; we use these to find slight differences in rotational velocity, [C/N], and [Na/Mg] between the mass-transfer candidates and their abundance neighbors. We find no drastic differences in kinematics, orbital invariants, UV excess, or other stellar abundances between outliers and their abundance neighbors. We deliver 377 mass-transfer candidates for follow-up observations. This project implicitly suggests a fundamental limit on the reliability of asteroseismic ages, and supports existing evidence that age-abundance outliers are products of binary mass transfer.</description>

      <title>Observation and Modeling of Shear Evolution of Post-reconnection Flare Loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A solar flare releases magnetic energy by reconnecting field lines across a current sheet, thereby allowing their relaxation to a lower energy state. The maximum possible energy is released if all field lines relax to a current-free (potential) state. The progress of a flare's reconnection is often measured as the angle-complement between the observed post-reconnection flare loops and the polarity inversion line of the photospheric magnetic field: shear angle. Many observations have shown strong-to-weak shear evolution over the course of a flare. A field line's shear angle is, however, an imperfect measure of its relaxation. We develop a new technique for observationally inferring the three-dimensional structure of post-reconnection field lines, including their local twist, $\alpha$, which will vanish for potential fields. Our method fits loops in EUV images to extrapolations subject to constraints such as matching the feet of model field lines to observed flare ribbons. We apply the new method to an eruptive two-ribbon flare (SOL2014-12-18T22) which exhibits strong-to-weak shear-angle evolution. We find that, as the flare progresses, $\alpha$ decreases in post reconnection loops anchored to newly brightened ribbons. Our study demonstrates that post-reconnection magnetic field is neither potential nor linear force-free. The method quantifies, for the first time, the time-history of a flare's energetic relaxation. It also quantifies the increasing height of subsequently reconnected field, and the time delay between reconnection forming a flare loop and its appearance in EUV passbands. These results promise to enable improvements in both magnetic modeling and hydrodynamic modeling of flares.</description>

      <title>Zeeman Doppler mapping deconstructed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aims. Magnetic and abundance maps of chemically peculiar (CP) stars, derived with the help of Zeeman Doppler mapping, have invariably been used as arguments against theories, in particular atomic diffusion theory. We intend to expose the fallacy of these claims.
  Methods. We have identified in the literature those (5) CP stars for which multiple maps have been published, all based on the same Zeeman Doppler mapping strategy. For each of these stars we have then carried out inter comparisons between the recovered distributions of magnetic field and of abundances.
  Results. Agreement between maps often turns out to be quite poor in regard to both abundances, field topology and absolute field strengths. Maps based on the same set of observations can differ considerably, even when they are coming from the same authors.
  Conclusions. It becomes clear that Zeeman Doppler mapping cannot be guaranteed to yield unique results. When a number of physically impossible magnetic geometries all provide good fits to the observed Stokes $IQUV$ profiles, these solutions must necessarily be spurious and cannot be used as constraints to diffusion theory.</description>

      <title>When Magnetic Field Lines Stretch, Snap, and Expand: A New Look at Solar Flares with L-maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the three-dimensional evolution of coronal magnetic fields during solar flares remains challenging due to the lack of direct coronal field measurements. Here we combine data-driven MHD simulations of NOAA AR 11158 (Fan et al., 2024) with flare-ribbon and coronal-dimming observations to investigate realistic coronal magnetic-field evolution during an X-class flare. We introduce L-maps, maps of the logarithm of magnetic field line lengths, as a diagnostic tool to track the dynamics of simulated coronal magnetic structures. Variations in L-maps identify flare ribbons through field-line shortening and coronal dimmings through field-line lengthening. Comparison with SDO/AIA observations demonstrates strong morphological and temporal agreement, validating the simulated field evolution. Applying K-means clustering to the L-map temporal profiles, we distinguish three stages of coronal evolution: (1) slow pre-flare rise phase, (2) flare reconnection accompanied by CME rise, and (3) post-reconnection CME expansion. We detect a slow pre-flare rise phase of magnetic field lines rooted in ribbon footpoints and identify a new phenomenon, reconnection dimming, a rapid expansion of reconnected inner flux-rope field lines during the impulsive phase. Our results show that L-maps provide a powerful and physically intuitive framework for bridging simulations and observations and for tracking the full three-dimensional evolution of coronal magnetic fields during flares.</description>

      <title>The He I D3 Line as a Proxy for Magnetic Activity using EXPRES Solar Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar activity remains one of the primary challenges in the detection and characterization of low-mass exoplanets, as it can induce radial velocity (RV) variations that mask or mimic planetary signals. Identifying reliable activity proxies is essential in order to distinguish stellar variability from genuine planetary signatures. In this study, we examine the variability of the chromospheric He I D3 line in high-resolution solar spectra and assess its potential as an activity indicator. We find a strong correlation between the He I D3 line intensity variation and the Sun's unsigned magnetic flux derived from SDO HMI data as well as with the solar RVs. Our results suggest that the He I D3 line offers a promising and straightforward proxy for magnetic activity, which may complement existing stellar activity indicators. Its inclusion could help disentangle stellar signals in RV measurements and ultimately improve the detection of Earth-like exoplanets.</description>

      <title>The Physical Origin of Periodic Density Structures in the Solar Wind: Coronal Streamers as Magnetohydrodynamic Resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive physical model explaining the origin of Periodic Density Structures (PDS) observed in white-light coronagraphs with characteristic periods of approximately 45, 80, and 120 minutes. Through systematic investigation of potential resonant cavities in the solar atmosphere, we demonstrate that traditional large-scale cavities yield fundamentally incompatible periods: photosphere-transition region (3.3 minutes), transition region-sonic point (10.3 hours), and transition region-heliopause (7.7 years). We establish that coronal streamers act as natural magnetohydrodynamic resonators, with calculated harmonic periods of 122, 61, and 41 minutes that precisely match observations. The physical mechanism involves slow magnetoacoustic standing waves that create periodic density enhancements through wave compression, with the streamer resonator having quality factor Q ~ 10-100, enabling natural amplification of broadband coronal noise. At streamer cusps, these density enhancements trigger magnetic reconnection, releasing plasma blobs into the solar wind at resonant periods. The model provides complete energy budget calculations, wave amplitude estimates, and explains all key observational features including spatial localization, period coherence, and the relationship between remote sensing and in situ measurements. This work establishes streamer resonators as fundamental structures shaping solar wind variability and provides a new framework for understanding the emergence of coherent structures in turbulent astrophysical plasmas.</description>

      <title>Two-Stage Nature of a Solar Flare with Parallel and Semi-Circular Ribbons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flare ribbons with parallel and circular morphologies are typically associated with different magnetic reconnection models, and the simultaneous observation of both types in a single event remains rare. Using multi-wavelength observations from a tandem of instruments, we present an M8.2-class flare that occurred on 2023 September 20, which produced quasi-parallel and semi-circular ribbons. The complex evolution of the flare includes two distinct brightening episodes in the quasi-parallel ribbons, corresponding to the two major peaks in the hard X-ray (HXR) light curve. In contrast, the brightening of semi-circular ribbons temporally coincides with the local minimum between the two peaks. Using potential field extrapolation, we reconstruct an incomplete dome-like magnetic structure with a negative polarity embedded within the northwestern part of the semi-circular positive polarity. Consequently, the magnetic configuration comprises two sets of field lines with distinct magnetic connectivities. We suggest that the standard flare reconnection accounts for the two-stage brightening of quasi-parallel ribbons associated with the two HXR peaks. Between the two stages, this process is constrained by the interaction of eruptive structures with the dome. The interaction drives the quasi-separatrix layer reconnection, leading to the brightening of semi-circular ribbons. It also suppresses the standard flare reconnection, resulting in a delayed second HXR peak.</description>

      <title>Dense Circumstellar Medium around Pulsating Massive Stars Powering Interacting Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the evolution of red supergiant (RSG) progenitors of core-collapse (CC) supernovae (SNe) with initial masses between $12-20~M_\odot$ focusing on the effects of enhanced mass loss due to pulsation-driven instabilities in their envelopes and subsequent dynamical ejections during advanced stages of nuclear burning. Using time-dependent mass loss from detailed MESA stellar evolution models, including a parameterized prescription for pulsation-driven superwinds and time-averaged mass loss rates attributed to resulting shock-induced ejections, we construct the circumstellar medium (CSM) before the SN explosion. We calculate resulting CSM density profiles and column densities considering the acceleration of the stellar wind. Our models produce episodes of enhanced mass loss $10^{-4}-10^{-2}~M_\odot~\rm{yr}^{-1}$ in the last centuries-decades before explosion forming dense CSM ($&gt;10^{-15}~\rm{gcm}^{-3}$ at distances $&lt;10^{15}$ cm) -- consistent with those inferred from multi-wavelength observations of Type II SNe such as SN~2023ixf and SN~2020ywx.</description>

      <title>Evolution of stellar magnetic activity: probing planet engulfment by red giants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fraction of low-mass (LM) stars (M &lt;= 1.5 Msun) showing photospheric activity in their light curve is larger on the horizontal branch (HB) than during the previous red giant branch (RGB) phase, while the opposite trend has been observed for intermediate-mass (IM) stars (M &gt; 1.5 Msun). One hypothesis is that LM red giants (RGs) engulf more planets than IM RGs, which results in a faster surface rotation and a higher magnetic activity. Indeed, LM stars reach a maximum radius at the RGB tip that is much larger than for IM stars, making them more likely to engulf planets. However, we need to study the evolution of the active star fraction along the RGB to firmly check this hypothesis. I use independent indicators tracing the activity level in the chromosphere based on the Ca II H&amp;K, Halpha, Mg I and infrared Ca II spectral lines from LAMOST data for about 3000 RGs whose evolutionary stage has been identified by asteroseismology with the Kepler mission. I find that the fraction of active stars decreases for IM stars along the RGB but unexpectedly increases for LM stars. Such an increase is not explained by models of single-star evolution and is consistent with the fact that LM stars are more susceptible than IM stars of engulfing planets. Indeed, data shows that IM main-sequence stars exhibit a dearth of planets, consistently with predictions from planet formation theory. I also observe that the fraction of active stars tends to increase for both LM and IM stars on the HB, in partial contrast with previous findings. Finally, I discover that the IM RGB star KIC 9780154 may have engulfed one or more planet(s) as its surface rotation from photometry is twice faster than its envelope rotation from asteroseismology. Characterizing planet engulfment by RGs provides insights into the evolution and fate of most planetary systems, since about 97 % of stars pass through the RG evolution stage.</description>

      <title>Rediscussion of eclipsing binaries. Paper XXVII. The totally-eclipsing system UZ Draconis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: UZ Dra is a detached and totally-eclipsing binary containing two late-F stars in a circular orbit of period 3.261 d. It has been observed by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite in 41 sectors, yielding a total of 664,809 high-quality flux measurements. We model these data and published radial velocities to determine the physical properties of the system to high precision. The masses of the stars are 1.291 +/- 0.012 Msun and 1.193 +/- 0.009 Msun, and their radii are 1.278 +/- 0.004 Rsun and 1.122 +/- 0.003 Rsun. The high precision of the radius measurements is made possible by the (previously unrecorded) total eclipses and the extraordinary amount of data available. The light curves show spot modulation at the orbital period, and both stars rotate synchronously. Our determination of the distance to the system, 185.7 +/- 2.4 pc, agrees very well with the parallax distance of 185.39 +/- 0.39 pc from Gaia DR3. The properties of the system are consistent with theoretical predictions for an age of 600 +/- 200 Myr and a slightly super-solar metallicity.</description>

      <title>Solar Polar Field Reversals as the Result of the Global Magnetic field Meridional Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on data obtained from Wilcox Solar Observatiry the solar polar magnetic fields reversals in cycles 21\,--\,25 were considered. The results indicate that the polarity reversal occurs at the maximum of sunspot activity of each cycle, but the beginning, end, and duration of the reversals did not demonstrate any association with the Wolf numbers, which are characteristics of local magnetic fields. Moreover, during the periods of polarity reversal, the correlation between global magnetic field (GMF) parameters and Wolf numbers decreased and even moved into anti-correlation mode.
  The polar field reversals are determined by the GMF flows of positive- and negative-polarity magnetic fields, which cyclically migrate from one pole to the opposite pole. The new polarity magnetic fields are delivered to the poles by a certain flow, and then carried away by the same flow to the opposite pole. The increase in the polar magnetic field strength to its maximal values at the solar activity minimum and following decrees to the next cycle maximum coincides with the latitudinal changes in corresponding magnetic field flow.
  Formulas for calculating the meridional circulation of positive- and negative-polarity magnetic field flows were proposed. They allow predict the time of polarity reversals, and since polarity reversals occur at the maxima of cycles, then also the time of maxima of both the future and past cycles.</description>

      <title>52 Eclipsing Quadruple Star Candidates Discovered in TESS Full Frame Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the discovery of 52 eclipsing quadruple star candidates detected in TESS Full Frame Image eleanor data by machine learning and citizen scientists. The uniformly-vetted and -validated targets exhibit two sets of eclipses following two distinct periods, representing quadruple systems with a 2+2 hierarchical configuration. Detailed photocenter measurements confirmed that both sets of eclipses originate within ~0.1-0.2 pixels (~2-4 arcsec) of the corresponding target, and ruled out resolved nearby field stars. The catalog includes a number of systems producing prominent eclipse timing variations and/or apsidal motion, a quadruple with an outer period of ~1,400 days, and even a 2+2 quadruple in a likely wide quintuple with a resolved co-moving star. Additionally, two systems have complete astrometric solutions for the outer orbits from Gaia. We provide the measured ephemerides, eclipse depths and durations, overall statistical properties, and highlight potentially interesting systems that merit further investigations.</description>

      <title>Uniturbulence and Alfv\'en Wave Solar Model in MPI-AMRVAC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coronal heating problem remains a fundamental challenge in solar physics. While AWSoM-type models (Alfv\'en Wave Solar Model) have proven highly successful in reproducing the large-scale structure of the solar corona, they inherently neglect contributions from additional wave modes that arise when the effects of transverse structuring is fully incorporated into the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations. In this paper, we compare the roles of kink wave- and Alfv\'en wave-driven heating in sustaining a region of the solar atmosphere, using newly developed physics and radiative cooling modules within MPI-AMRVAC. We extend the existing MHD physics module in MPI-AMRVAC by incorporating additional Alfv\'en and kink wave energy contributions to the MHD equations. We examine their roles in heating the solar atmosphere and driving the solar wind. To validate our approach, we compare numerical results from Python-based simulations with those obtained using the UAWSoM module in MPI-AMRVAC. Furthermore, we assess the heating efficiency of kink waves relative to that of pure Alfv\'en waves through two parameter studies: (1) exploring how different Alfv\'en wave reflection rates impact the simulated atmosphere, and (2) varying the relative magnitudes of Alfv\'en and kink wave energy injections. Finally, we present results from a larger-scale domain, sustained entirely by kink wave-driven heating. Our results show that kink wave-driven (UAWSoM) models are able to sustain a stable atmosphere without requiring any artificial background heating terms, unlike traditional Alfv\'en-only models. We attribute this to the increased heating rate associated with kink waves compared with Alfv\'en waves, given the same energy injection. Kink waves can sustain a model plasma with temperature and density values representative of coronal conditions without resorting to ad hoc heating terms.</description>

      <title>Multi-band infrared imaging reveals dusty spiral arcs around the binary B[e] star 3 Puppis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3 Puppis is the brightest known B[e] star. Recent work classifies this A-type object as a supergiant, yet the impact of its binarity on the circumstellar environment (CE) remains hard to characterize. To resolve its dusty region at 5-10 mas, we obtained mid-IR interferometric observations with VLTI/MATISSE over 3-12 {\mu}m. Because the (u,v) coverage supports imaging, we introduce a statistical interferometric-imaging workflow based on MiRA to generate averaged images: this systematic approach enables the selection of an optimal set of reconstructions, improving the robustness and fidelity of the recovered features. We also use SPARCO, an independent tool well suited to bright central objects embedded in fainter extended emission. Images from both tools in the L, M, and N bands agree and reveal an asymmetric, elongated feature ~17 mas (~10 au at 631 pc) southeast of the star with ~20% density contrast. A second northwest asymmetry and a skewed inner rim are detected. Simple geometric modelling, guided by the MATISSE images, constrains the morphology, location, and flux of the CE and its asymmetries. The images are consistent with earlier VLTI measurements but expose a more complex CE with large-scale clumps in the southeast and northwest parts of the disc. Hydrodynamic modelling indicates that tidal spiral-wake perturbations from the central binary, dynamically excited at Lindblad resonances in the circumbinary disc, best explain the radial extent and curvature of the elongated structures seen in all bands.</description>

      <title>A Decade of Solar High-Fidelity Spectroscopy and Precise Radial Velocities from HARPS-N</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We recently released 10 years of HARPS-N solar telescope and the goal of this manuscript is to present the different optimisations made to the data reduction, to describe data curation, and to perform some analyses that demonstrate the extreme RV precision of those data.
  By analysing all the HARPS-N wavelength solutions over 13 years, we bring to light instrumental systematics at the 1 m/s level. After correction, we demonstrate a peak-to-peak precision on the HARPS-N wavelength solution better than 0.75 m/s over 13 years. We then carefully curate the decade of HARPS-N re-reduced solar observations by rejecting 30% of the data affected either by clouds, bad atmospheric conditions or well-understood instrumental systematics. Finally, we correct the curated data for spurious sub-m/s RV effects caused by erroneous instrumental drift measurements and by changes in the spectral blaze function over time.
  After curation and correction, a total of 109,466 HARPS-N solar spectra and respective RVs over a decade are available. The median photon-noise precision of the RV data is 0.28 m/s and, on daily timescales, the median RV rms is 0.49 m/s, similar to the level imposed by stellar granulation signals. On 10-year timescales, the large RV rms of 2.95 m/s results from the RV signature of the Sun's magnetic cycle. When modelling this long-term effect using the Magnesium II activity index, we demonstrate a long-term RV precision of 0.41 m/s. We also analysed contemporaneous HARPS-N and NEID solar RVs and found the data from both instruments to be of similar quality and precision, with an overall RV differece rms of 0.79 m/s.
  This decade of high-cadence HARPS-N solar observations with short- and long-term precision below 1 m/s represents a crucial dataset to further understand stellar activity signals in solar-type stars , and to advance other science cases requiring such an extreme precision.</description>

      <title>X-ray and UV Observations of the Young Sun HIP~67522: Evidence of Lyman-alpha Absorption Within the Planetary System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present ultraviolet (UV) spectroscopy of the 17 Myr, G0V star, HIP 67522. The UV spectrum is characterized by strong chromospheric and transition region emission lines. There was moderate spectral variability during the observations consisting of 15% stochastic fluctuation and two small flares releasing $E_{UV} \simeq 2-4\times10^{32}$ ergs in each event. We compare the broadband spectral energy distribution (SED; 4.7 A - 13.0~$\mu$m) of the star first presented in Thao et al. (2024) to the solar SED and show that X-ray/UV (XUV) flux density at 1 AU is $10^{2}-10^{5}$ stronger (from 1000 A down to 5 A) in the young star compared to the present-day Sun. Attempts to reconstruct the intrinsic Ly-alpha emission of the star failed to return physically realistic results. The discrepancy appears to arise from a population of neutral hydrogen within the system itself, extending to $&gt; \pm500$ km/s. The absorption could be due to outflow from exoplanet atmospheric loss or from a stellar component; such a picture would require high spectral resolution observations and/or UV transit spectroscopy to confirm. Finally, we examine the evolution of the XUV emission from solar-type stars from ages of 17 Myr to 9.4 Gyr and derive a scaling relation between FUV Ly-alpha and EUV emission as a function of stellar age. X-ray (1--100 A) and EUV (100--900 A) contributions to high energy emission are 329 and 672 ergs/cm^2/s at 1 AU, respectively, suggesting that both may contribute to exoplanet heating at this epoch. The XUV emission levels at 17 Myr combined with the low density of the planet HIP67522b are consistent with models that predict that solar type stars born with high rotation and activity levels will drive substantial heating and escape on close-in, gaseous planets.</description>

      <title>First evidence for the J$&gt;$1 components of the pygmy dipole resonance in neutron-rich nuclei</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.27125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gamma ($\gamma$) decay shapes the synthesis of heavy elements in neutron-rich nuclear environments of neutron star mergers, supplying the Universe with heavy elements. The low-energy pygmy dipole resonance (PDR) influences nuclear reaction rates of the rapid nucleosynthesis through enhanced $\gamma$ transitions. However, since it is difficult to reproduce astrophysical conditions in laboratories, PDR was previously observed only in $J = 1$ spin states. Here we report the first experimental observation of $J &gt; 1$ components of PDR, identified in the $\beta$-delayed $\gamma$ decay of the J$^{\pi}$ = 3$^{-}$ spin-parity isomer of $^{80}$Ga. The data analysis, combined with decay information and theoretical calculations allows the identification of resonant structures below the neutron emission threshold of the neutron-rich germanium $^{80}$Ge as J$^{\pi} = (2,3)^-$ components of the PDR built on the low-lying J$^{\pi}$ = 2$^+$ quadrupole state. Our findings extend the concept of PDR beyond dipole states, with implications for nuclear structure theory and experiment, as well as the element production in the cosmos.</description>

      <title>Ionospheric responses over the Antarctic region to Intense Space Weather events: Plasma Convection vs. Auroral Precipitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The present investigation is directed at exploring southern polar ionospheric responses to intense space weather events and their correlations with plasma convection and auroral precipitation. The main phases of six geomagnetic storms occurring in the year 2023 (ascending phase of the present solar cycle) are considered for this study. The ionospheric Total Electron Content (TEC) measurements derived from GPS receivers covering the Antarctic region are used for probing the electron density perturbations during these events. Auroral precipitation maps are shown to illustrate the locations of the GPS stations relative to particle precipitation. SuperDARN maps are shown to understand the effects of plasma convection over these locations. Correlation between the enhanced TEC observations with the auroral precipitation (R $\sim$ 0.31) and the plasma convection (R $\sim$ 0.88) reveals that the latter is more responsible for causing significant enhancements in the diurnal maximum values of TEC over the Antarctic region in comparison to the former. Therefore, this work shows correlation studies between two physical processes and ionospheric density enhancements over the under-explored south polar region under strong levels of geomagnetic activity during 2023.</description>

      <title>Equation-of-state-informed pulse profile modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.27619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: NICER has enabled mass-radius inferences for pulsars using pulse profile modeling, providing constraints on the equation of state (EOS) of cold, dense matter. To date, PPM and EOS inference have been carried out as two separate steps, with the former using EOS-agnostic priors. This approach has several drawbacks. Ideally, one would perform a fully hierarchical Bayesian inference where the pulse profile and EOS model parameters are jointly fit, but implementing such a framework is complex and computationally demanding. Here, we present an intermediate solution introducing an EOS-informed prior on mass-radius into the existing PPM pipeline using normalizing flows. By focusing on the parameter space consistent with certain EOSs, this approach both tightens constraints on neutron star parameters while reducing computational costs and requiring minimal additional implementation effort. We test this approach on two pulsars, PSR J0740+6620 and PSR J0437-4715, and with two EOS model families: a model based on the speed of sound inside the neutron star interior (CS) and a piecewise-polytropic (PP) model. Both EOS models implement constraints from chiral effective field theory calculations of dense matter. For both pulsar datasets, the inferred radius credible intervals are narrower than in the EOS-agnostic case, with CS favoring smaller radii and PP favoring larger radii. For PSR J0437-4715, the EOS-informed priors reveal a new, more extreme geometric mode that is statistically favored but physically questionable. Including the PPM posteriors in the subsequent EOS inference further tightens the mass-radius posteriors through the chiral effective field theory constraints. However, there is also a sensitivity to the high-density extensions, where the PP (CS) model produces a shift towards larger (smaller) radii and corresponding stiffening (softening) of the pressure-energy density relation.</description>

      <title>SN 2024cld: unveiling the complex mass-loss histories of evolved supergiant progenitors to core collapse supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pre-explosion mass loss in supernova (SN) progenitors is a crucial unknown factor in stellar evolution, yet has been illuminated recently by the diverse zoo of interacting transients. We present SN2024cld, a transitional core-collapse SN at a distance of 39 Mpc, straddling the boundary between SN II and SN IIn, showing persistent interaction with circumstellar material (CSM) similar to H-rich SN1998S and PTF11iqb. The SN was discovered and classified just 12h post-explosion via the GOTO-FAST high-cadence program. Optical spectroscopy, photometry, and polarimetry over 220d chart the complex, long-lived interaction in this transient. Early evolution is dominated by CSM interaction, showing a 14d rise to a peak absolute magnitude of g=-17.6 mag, with clear flash-ionisation signatures. SN2024cld also shows a marked double-plateau light curve powered by CSM interaction, with high-velocity (6000 km/s) shoulders on a strong multi-component H-alpha profile. Dense polarimetric coverage reveals marked evolution in the photospheric geometry -- peaking at p=2% 10 days post-explosion, and rotating approx. 60 deg as the ejecta sweep more distant CSM. We observe a narrow 60 km/s H-alpha P Cygni feature throughout, associated with pre-shock CSM. SN2024cld represents among the best-observed 98S-like SNe to date, revealing a multi-component CSM structure: a dense, inner aspherical envelope, CSM disk/torus, and tenuous, extended wind. We propose this SN arose from an evolved supergiant progenitor experiencing multiple mass loss episodes in its terminal years, with binary interaction plausibly generating the CSM disk. SN2024cld constrains the progenitors and mass-loss paradigms of 98S-like SNe, unveiling the chaotic ends of evolved supergiant stars from afar.</description>

      <title>Modelling $\delta$ Scuti pulsations: A new grid of p, g, and f modes across pre-main-sequence to post-main-sequence evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03561v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Space-based photometry reveals regular high-frequency patterns in many young $\delta$ Scuti stars. These pulsations provide a powerful means of inferring stellar properties, particularly ages, for young $\delta$ Scuti stars for which traditional age-dating methods are poorly constrained. Realising this potential requires theoretical models that capture the complexities of stellar structure and evolution. We present a comprehensive grid of 25 million stellar pulsation models, computed using the mesa stellar evolution code and the gyre stellar oscillation code, tailored to $\delta$ Scuti stars. The grid spans a wide range of masses, metallicities and rotation velocities, and covers evolutionary phases from the early pre-main-sequence through the main sequence and into the post-main sequence contraction phase. For each model, we computed adiabatic pulsation frequencies for degrees $\ell$ = 0 to 3, capturing p modes, g modes, f modes and their interactions through avoided crossings. We find that f and low-order g modes have mode inertias comparable to or lower than the fundamental radial mode during the late pre-MS and early MS, implying that these modes should be observable. We revisit $\delta$ Scuti scaling relations and map asteroseismic observables, including the large frequency separation ($\Delta\nu$) and phase offset parameter ($\varepsilon$), across age, mass, metallicity, and rotation. This new model grid, which is publicly available, improves upon previous such model grids by facilitating interpretation of $\delta$ Scuti pulsations, allowing for more reliable age estimates and tighter constraints on stellar evolutionary pathways, and planet formation in A- and F-type stars.</description>

      <title>A Classification Scheme for X-ray Bright Type Ia Supernova Remnants Based on Their Circumstellar Interaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20828v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The parameter space for mass loss in Type Ia supernova progenitors is large, with different progenitor scenarios favoring different mass loss regimes. Here we focus on the impact that uniform and isotropic outflows have on the circumstellar environment of Type Ia supernova progenitors. We vary mass loss rate, wind velocity, and outflow duration, and evolve supernova remnant (SNR) models in this grid of circumstellar structures in order to compare the bulk properties of these models (ages, radii, and \feka\ centroids and luminosities) to observations. We find that roughly 55\% (7/13) of young X-ray bright Type Ia SNRs in the Milky Way and the Large Magellanic Cloud had progenitors that did not substantially modify their surroundings on $\sim$pc scales. This group includes SN Ia with a range of luminosities, and at least one likely product of a double detonation explosion in a sub-Chandrasekhar white dwarf. The other half of our sample can be divided in two distinct classes. A small subset of SNRs ($\sim$15\%, 2/13) have large radii and low \feka\ centroids and are likely expanding into large cavities that might have been excavated by fast ($\sim$1000 km/s), sustained progenitor outflows. The majority of the SNRs that are expanding into a modified medium ($\sim30\%$, 4/13) show evidence for dense material, likely associated with slow ($\sim$10 km/s) progenitor outflows, possibly a byproduct of accretion processes in near-Chandrasekhar white dwarfs spawned by younger stellar populations.</description>

      <title>A new photometric ephemeris for the 2M1510 AB double brown dwarf eclipsing binary system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14801v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Eclipsing brown dwarfs are important calibrators of sub-stellar evolution models used to infer the characteristics of directly imaged brown dwarfs and giant exoplanets. Only two double brown dwarf eclipsing binary systems are known, among them 2MASS J15104786-2818174 (2M1510 AB), published in 2020 with a poorly constrained orbital period. Here we analyse TESS full-frame image (FFI) photometry of this faint ($T=15.9$) binary and detect a significant (${&gt;}10\sigma$) periodic signal spanning TESS Cycles 1-7, consistent with previous data. We refine the orbital period to $20.897782 \pm 0.000036$ d, reducing its present-day uncertainty from 18 h to 8 min. Our work is crucial for scheduling follow-up observations of this system for detailed study with other photometric facilities. We also find that a recent orbital solution from Doppler data is inconsistent with existing photometry. A timing offset in the Doppler data may have produced a spurious signal mimicking retrograde apsidal precession, from which the claimed circumbinary planet 2M1510 ABb was inferred. From our best attempt at correcting the data we were unable to reconcile the radial velocity data with the photometry, suggesting that the radial velocity uncertainties are underestimated, and that the circumbinary planet 2M1510 ABb may be a false positive.</description>

Abstract: The solar wind is a dynamic plasma outflow that shapes heliospheric conditions and drives space weather. Identifying its large-scale phenomena is crucial, yet the increasing volume of high-cadence Parker Solar Probe (PSP) observations poses challenges for scalable, interpretable analysis. We present a pipeline combining symbolic compression, density-based clustering, and human-in-the-loop validation. Applied to 2018-2024 PSP data, it efficiently processes over 150 GB of magnetic and plasma measurements, recovering known structures, detecting uncatalogued CMEs and transient events, and demonstrating robustness across multiple time scales. A key outcome is the systematic use of the magnetic deflection angle ($\theta_B$) as a unifying metric across solar wind phenomena. This framework provides a scalable, interpretable, expert-validated approach to solar wind analysis, producing expanded event catalogs and supporting improved space weather forecasting. The code and configuration files used in this study are publicly available to support reproducibility.</description>

      <title>SPHEREx: Aromatics, Aliphatics and PAH Size across the Iris Nebula</title>

Abstract: Observations by the SpectroPhotometer for the History of the Universe, Epoch of Reionization, and Ices Explorer (SPHEREx) are combined with Spitzer spectral map data to study the aromatic, aliphatic, and PAH size evolution across the northwest photo-dissociation region (PDR) of the Iris Nebula (NGC7023). The 3.3-3.4 $\mu$m complex (I$_{3.3}$) and 11.2 $\mu$m (I$_{11.2}$) PAH band strength are determined through direct integration. In addition, the former is decomposed into a 3.3 (I'$_{3.3}$) and 3.4 $\mu$m (I'$_{3.4}$) sub-feature by fitting SPHEREx bandpass-integrated photometry using a modeled, highly sampled, multi-component spectrum. I$_{3.3}$, I$_{11.2}$, I'$_{3.3}$, and I'$_{3.4}$ all peak at the PDR. The NASA Ames PAH IR Spectroscopic Database is used to obtain the average number of carbon atoms ($\overline{\rm N_{C}}$) and small PAH fraction ($f_{\rm small}$) by fitting the isolated PAH component of the Spitzer segment; $70\lesssim\overline{N_{C}}\lesssim76$ and $0.24\lesssim\text{f}_{\rm small}\lesssim0.36$. I'$_{3.4}$/I'$_{3.4}$, I$_{11.2}$/I$_{3.3}$, $\overline{\rm N_{C}}$, and $f_{\rm small}$ all show a demarcation that matches the large-scale morphology of the region. For I'$_{3.3}$ and I'$_{3.4}$ this is reflected by two distinct trends when plotted against each other, one associated with the dense, the other with the diffuse medium; $[N_{\rm H,ali}/N_{\rm H,aro}]_{\rm dense}$ = 0.42$\pm$0.01 and $[N_{\rm H,ali}/N_{\rm H,aro}]_{\rm diffuse}$ = 0.10$\pm$0.01. $\overline{\rm N_{C}}$ and $f_{\rm small}$ are tentatively correlated with I$_{11.2}$/I$_{3.3}$ (R=0.54$\pm$0.05 and -0.45$\pm$0.05, respectively). A wider variety of large(r) extended interstellar medium objects is required to tighten the correlations, turn them into quantitative calibrators for PAH size, and pin down the discrepancy of correlations with I'$_{3.3}$ involved.</description>

      <title>The 2024 July 16 Solar Event: A Challenge To The Coronal Mass Ejection Origin Of Long-Duration Gamma-Ray Flares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26666</link>

Abstract: We present a multi-spacecraft analysis of the 2024 July 16 Long-Duration Gamma-Ray Flare (LDGRF) detected by the Large Area Telescope on the Fermi satellite. The measured &gt;100 MeV $\gamma$-ray emission persisted for over seven hours after the flare impulsive phase, and was characterized by photon energies exceeding 1 GeV and a remarkably-hard parent-proton spectrum. In contrast, the phenomena related to the coronal mass ejection (CME)-driven shock linked to this eruption were modest, suggesting an inefficient proton acceleration unlikely to achieve the energies well-above the 300 MeV pion-production threshold to account for the observed $\gamma$-ray emission. Specifically, the CME was relatively slow (~600 km/s) and the accompanying interplanetary type-II/III radio bursts were faint and short-duration, unlike those typically detected during large events. In particular, the type-II emission did not extend to kHz frequencies and disappeared ~5.5 hours prior to the LDGRF end time. Furthermore, the associated solar energetic particle (SEP) event was very weak, short-duration, and limited to a few tens of MeV, even at magnetically well-connected spacecraft. These findings demonstrate that a very-fast CME resulting in a high-energy SEP event is not a necessary condition for the occurrence of LDGRFs, challenging the idea that the high-energy $\gamma$-ray emission is produced by the back-precipitation of shock-accelerated ions into the solar surface. The alternative origin scenario based on local particle trapping and acceleration in large-scale coronal loops is instead favored by the observation of giant arch-like structures of hot plasma over the source region persisting for the entire duration of this LDGRF.</description>
