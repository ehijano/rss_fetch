      <title>Causal Fermion Systems as an Effective Collapse Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is shown that, in the non-relativistic limit, causal fermion systems give rise to an effective collapse theory. The nonlinear and stochastic correction terms to the Schr\"odinger equation are derived from the causal action principle. The dynamics of the statistical operator is described by a deterministic equation of Kossakowski-Lindblad form. Moreover, the quantum state undergoes a dynamical collapse compatible with Born's rule. The effective model has similarities with the continuous spontaneous localization model, but differs from it by a conservation law for the probability integral as well as a non-locality in time on a microscopic length scale $\ell_{\min}$.</description>

      <title>Higher gauge theory and integrability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, significant progress has been made in the study of integrable systems from a gauge theoretic perspective. This development originated with the introduction of $4$d Chern-Simons theory with defects, which provided a systematic framework for constructing two-dimensional integrable systems. In this article, we propose a novel approach to studying higher-dimensional integrable models employing techniques from higher category theory. Starting with higher Chern-Simons theory on the $4$-manifold $\mathbb{R}\times Y$, we complexify and compactify the real line to $\mathbb{C}P^1$ and introduce the disorder defect $\omega=z^{-1}\mathrm{d} z $. This procedure defines a holomorphic five-dimensional variant of higher Chern-Simons theory, which, when endowed with suitable boundary conditions, allows for the localisation to a three-dimensional theory on $Y$. The equations of motion of the resulting model are equivalent to the flatness of a $2$-connection $(L,H)$, that we then use to construct the corresponding higher holonomies. We prove that these are invariants of homotopies relative boundary, which enables the construction of conserved quantities. The latter are labelled by both the categorical characters of a Lie crossed-module and the infinite number of homotopy classes of surfaces relative boundary in $Y$. Moreover, we also demonstrate that the $3$d theory has left and right acting symmetries whose current algebra is given by an infinite dimensional centrally extended affine Lie 2-algebra. Both of these conditions are direct higher homotopy analogues of the properties satisfied by the 2d Wess-Zumino-Witten CFT, which we therefore interpret as facets of integrable structures.</description>

      <title>Propagation of Waves from Finite Sources Arranged in Line Segments within an Infinite Triangular Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper examines the propagation of time harmonic waves through a two-dimensional triangular lattice with sources located on line segments. Specifically, we investigate the discrete Helmholtz equation with a wavenumber $k \in \left( 0,2\sqrt{2} \right)$, where input data is prescribed on finite rows or columns of lattice sites. We focus on two main questions: the efficacy of the numerical methods employed in evaluating the Green's function, and the necessity of the cone condition. Consistent with a continuum theory, we employ the notion of radiating solution and establish a unique solvability result and Green's representation formula using difference potentials. Finally, we propose a numerical computation method and demonstrate its efficiency through examples related to the propagation problems in the left-handed 2D inductor-capacitor metamaterial.</description>

      <title>Fractional diffusion as the limit of a short range potential Rayleigh gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fractional diffusion equation is rigorously derived as a scaling limit from a deterministic Rayleigh gas, where particles interact via short range potentials with support of size $\varepsilon$ and the background is distributed in space $R^3$ according to a Poisson process with intensity $N$ and in velocity according some fat-tailed distribution. As an intermediate step a linear Boltzmann equation is obtained in the Boltzmann-Grad limit as $\varepsilon$ tends to zero and $N$ tends to infinity with $N \varepsilon^2 =c$. The convergence of the empiric particle dynamics to the Boltzmann-type dynamics is shown using semigroup methods to describe probability measures on collision trees associated to physical trajectories in the case of a Rayleigh gas. The fractional diffusion equation is a hydrodynamic limit for times $t \in [0,T]$, where $T$ and inverse mean free path $c$ can both be chosen as some negative rational power $\varepsilon^{-k}$.</description>

      <title>Diagrammatic Representations of Higher-Dimensional Topological Orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 3D spacetime, topologically ordered phases of matter feature emergent particles called anyons, whose properties like fusion rules and braiding statistics are schematically represented by diagrams. Important consistency conditions, such as pentagon and hexagon relations, are encoded in diagrams. In 4D and higher spacetimes, topological orders support not only point-like particles but also spatially extended excitations, such as loops and membranes, allowing for diverse topological data about braiding, fusion, and shrinking processes. Recently, these topological data have been explored through the path-integral formalism of topological quantum field theory. Analogous to the counterpart in 3D, in this work, we construct diagrammatic representations of higher-dimensional (4D and 5D) topological orders. We introduce basic fusion and shrinking diagrams and treat them as vectors in corresponding spaces, then build complex diagrams by stacking these basic diagrams. Within the same vector spaces, we use $F$-, $\Delta$-, and $\Delta^2$-symbols to transform between different bases. From these transformations, we derive consistency conditions like \textit{pentagon equations} and \textit{(hierarchical) shrinking-fusion hexagon equations}, which describe the consistent coexistence of fusion and shrinking data. We conjecture that all anomaly-free higher-dimensional topological orders must satisfy these conditions, with violations indicating a quantum anomaly. This work opens several promising avenues for future research such as the exploration of diagrammatic representations of braiding processes in higher dimensions as well as implications for noninvertible symmetries and Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT).</description>

      <title>Hilbert Series of Bipartite Field Theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the algebraic structure of the mesonic moduli spaces of bipartite field theories by computing the Hilbert series. Bipartite field theories form a large family of 4d N=1 supersymmetric gauge theories that are defined by bipartite graphs on Riemann surfaces with boundaries. By calculating the Hilbert series, we are able to identify the generators and defining generator relations of the mesonic moduli spaces of these theories. Moreover, we show that certain bipartite field theories exhibit enhanced global symmetries which can be identified through the computation of the corresponding refined Hilbert series. As part of our study, we introduce two one-parameter families of bipartite field theories defined on cylinders whose mesonic moduli spaces are all complete intersection toric Calabi-Yau 3-folds.</description>

      <title>Two dimensional potential theory with a view towards vortex motion: Energy, capacity and Green functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper reviews some parts of classical potential theory with applications to two dimensional fluid dynamics, in particular vortex motion. Energy and forces within a system of point vortices are similar to those for point charges when the vortices are kept fixed, but the dynamics is different in the case of free vortices. Starting from Bernoulli's equation we derive these laws. Letting the number of vortices tend to infinity leads in the limit to considerations of capacity, harmonic measure and many other notions in potential theory. In particular various kinds of Green functions have a central role in the paper, where we make a difference between electrostatic and hydrodynamic Green function.
  We also consider the corresponding concepts in the case of closed Riemann surfaces provided with a metric. From a canonically defined monopole Green function we rederive much of the classical theory of harmonic and analytic forms. In the final section of the paper we return to the planar case, then reappearing in form of a symmetric Riemann surface, the Schottky double. Bergman kernels, electrostatic and hydrodynamic, come up naturally, and associated to the Green function the is a certain Robin function which is important for vortex motion and which also relates to capacity functions in classical potential theory.</description>

      <title>Uniform-in-time estimates on the size of chaos for interacting Brownian particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a system of classical Brownian particles interacting via a smooth long-range potential in the mean-field regime, and we analyze the propagation of chaos in form of sharp, uniform-in-time estimates on many-particle correlation functions. Our results cover both the kinetic Langevin setting and the corresponding overdamped Brownian dynamics. The approach is mainly based on so-called Lions expansions, which we combine with new diagrammatic tools to capture many-particle cancellations, as well as with fine ergodic estimates on the linearized mean-field equation, and with discrete stochastic calculus with respect to initial data. In the process, we derive some new ergodic estimates for the linearized Vlasov-Fokker-Planck kinetic equation that are of independent interest. Our analysis also leads to uniform-in-time concentration estimates and to a uniform-in-time quantitative central limit theorem for the empirical measure associated with the particle dynamics.</description>

      <title>A "lifting" method for exponential large deviation estimates and an application to certain non-stationary 1D lattice Anderson models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.02274v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Proofs of localization for random Schr\"odinger operators with sufficiently regular distribution of the potential can take advantage of the fractional moment method introduced by Aizenman-Molchanov, or use the classical Wegner estimate as part of another method, e.g. the multi-scale analysis introduced by Fr\"ohlich-Spencer and significantly developed by Klein and his collaborators. When the potential distribution is singular, most proofs rely crucially on exponential estimates of events corresponding to finite truncations of the operator in question; these estimates in some sense substitute for the classical Wegner estimate. We introduce a method to "lift" such estimates, which have been obtained for many stationary models, to certain closely related non-stationary models. As an application, we use this method to derive Anderson localization on the 1-D lattice for certain non-stationary potentials along the lines of the non-perturbative approach developed by Jitomirskaya-Zhu in 2019.</description>

Abstract: We establish Diophantine type estimates on shifts of trigonometric polynomials on the torus $\mathbb{T}^d$, as well as that of their square roots. These estimates arise from the spectral analysis of the quasi-periodic Schr\"odinger and the quasi-periodic wave operators. They have applications to the nonlinear quasi-periodic Schr\"odinger equations (NLS) and the nonlinear quasi-periodic wave equations (NLW). One could now, for example, extend the result of Bourgain (Geom. Funct. Anal. 17(3): 682-706, 2007) to the nonlinear setting.</description>

      <title>From the Conformal Anomaly to the Virasoro Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09628v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The conformal anomaly and the Virasoro algebra are fundamental aspects of 2D conformal field theory and conformally covariant models in planar random geometry. In this article, we explicitly derive the Virasoro algebra from an axiomatization of the conformal anomaly in terms of real determinant lines, one-dimensional vector spaces associated to Riemann surfaces with analytically parametrized boundary components. Here, analytical orientation-preserving diffeomorphisms and deformations of the circle naturally act on the boundary components. We introduce a sewing operation on the real determinant lines over the semigroup of annuli, which then induces central extensions of the diffeomorphism group, as well as of the complex deformations.
  Our main theorem shows that on the one hand, the cocycle associated to the central extension of diffeomorphisms is trivial, while on the other hand, the Lie algebra cocycle associated to the central extension of complex deformations is nontrivial, yielding the imaginary part of the Gel'fand-Fuks cocycle. We thus answer a question, partly negatively and partly affirmatively, discussed by Andre Henriques and Dylan Thurston in 2011. The proof uses concrete computations, which we aim to be accessible to a wide audience.
  We also show an explicit relation to loop Loewner energy, anticipating the real determinant lines to be pertinent to locally conformally covariant (Malliavin-Kontsevich-Suhov) measures on curves and loops, as well as to K\"ahler geometry and geometric quantization of moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces. Inherently, the conformal anomaly and real determinant line bundles are expected to be universal, following a classification of modular functors.</description>

Abstract: Electric and magnetic waveguides are considered in planar Dirac materials like graphene as well as their classical version for relativistic particles of zero mass and electric charge. In order to solve the Dirac-Weyl equation analytically, we have assumed the displacement symmetry of the system along a direction. In these conditions we have examined the rest of symmetries relevant each type, magnetic or electric system, which will determine their similarities and differences. We have worked out waveguides with square profile in detail to show up some of the most interesting features also in quantum and classical complementary contexts. All the results have been visualized along a series of representative graphics showing explicitly the main properties for both types of waveguides.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17777v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, the asymptotic behaviors of the transition probability for two-level avoided crossings are studied under the limit where two parameters (adiabatic parameter and energy gap parameter) tend to zero. This is a continuation of our previous works where avoided crossings are generated by tangential intersections and obey a non-adiabatic regime. The main results elucidate not only the asymptotic expansion of transition probability but also a quantum interference caused by several avoided crossings and a coexistence of two-parameter regimes arising from different vanishing orders.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2109.14597v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give general conditions for the existence of a Hamiltonian operator whose discrete time evolution matches the partition function of certain solvable lattice models. In particular, we examine two classes of lattice models: the classical six-vertex model and a generalized family of $(2n+4)$-vertex models for each positive integer $n$. These models depend on a statistic called charge, and are associated to the quantum group $U_q(\widehat{\mathfrak{gl}}(1|n))$. Our results show a close and unexpected connection between Hamiltonian operators and the Yang-Baxter equation.
  The six-vertex model can be associated with Hamiltonians from classical Fock space, and we show that such a correspondence exists precisely when the Boltzmann weights are free fermionic. This allows us to prove that the free fermionic partition function is always a (skew) supersymmetric Schur function and then use the Berele-Regev formula to correct a result from of Brubaker, Bump, and Friedberg on the free fermionic domain-wall partition function. In this context, the supersymmetric function involution takes us between two lattice models that generalize the vicious walker and osculating walker models.
  Then, we prove a sharp solvability criterion for the six-vertex model with charge that provides the proper analogue of the free fermion condition. Building on results by Brubaker, Buciumas, Bump, and Gustafsson, we show that this criterion exactly dictates when a charged model has a Hamiltonian operator acting on a Drinfeld twist of $q$-Fock space. The resulting partition function is then a (skew) supersymmetric LLT polynomial, and almost all supersymmetric LLT polynomials appear as partition functions of our lattice models. We also prove a Cauchy identity for skew supersymmetric LLT polynomials. (see 2024 author's note below)</description>

Abstract: In the works of A. Ach\'ucarro and P. K. Townsend and also by E. Witten, a duality between three-dimensional Chern-Simons gauge theories and gravity was established. In all cases, the results made use of the field equations. In a previous work, we were capable to generalize Witten's work to the off-shell cases, as well as to four dimensional Yang-Mills theory with de Sitter gauge symmetry. The price we paid is that curvature and torsion must obey some constraints under the action of the interior derivative. These constraints implied on the partial breaking of diffeomorphism invariance. In the present work, we, first, formalize our early results in terms of fiber bundle theory by establishing the formal aspects of the map between a principal bundle (gauge theory) and a coframe bundle (gravity) with partial breaking of diffeomorphism invariance. Then, we study the effect of the constraints on the homology defined by the interior derivative. The main result is the emergence of a nontrivial homology in Riemann-Cartan manifolds.</description>

      <title>Anyonic Topological Order in Twisted Equivariant Differential (TED) K-Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.13563v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While the classification of non-interacting crystalline topological insulator phases by equivariant K-theory has become widely accepted, its generalization to anyonic interacting phases -- hence to phases with topologically ordered ground states supporting topological braid quantum gates -- has remained wide open. On the contrary, the success of K-theory with classifying non-interacting phases seems to have tacitly been perceived as precluding a K-theoretic classification of interacting topological order; and instead a mix of other proposals has been explored. However, only K-theory connects closely to the actual physics of valence electrons; and self-consistency demands that any other proposal must connect to K-theory.
  Here we provide a detailed argument for the classification of symmetry protected/enhanced su(2)-anyonic topological order, specifically in interacting 2d semi-metals, by the twisted equivariant differential (TED) K-theory of configuration spaces of points in the complement of nodal points inside the crystal's Brillouin torus orbi-orientifold.
  We argue, in particular, that: (1) topological 2d semi-metal phases modulo global mass terms are classified by the flat differential twisted equivariant K-theory of the complement of the nodal points; (2) n-electron interacting phases are classified by the K-theory of configuration spaces of n points in the Brillouin torus; (3) the somewhat neglected twisting of equivariant K-theory by "inner local systems" reflects the effective "fictitious" gauge interaction of Chen, Wilczeck, Witten &amp; Halperin (1989), which turns fermions into anyonic quanta; (4) the induced su(2)-anyonic topological order is reflected in the twisted Chern classes of the interacting valence bundle over configuration space, constituting the hypergeometric integral construction of monodromy braid representations.</description>

      <title>Efficient Error Certification for Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.10157v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent work provides promising evidence that Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN) can efficiently solve partial differential equations (PDE). However, previous works have failed to provide guarantees on the worst-case residual error of a PINN across the spatio-temporal domain - a measure akin to the tolerance of numerical solvers - focusing instead on point-wise comparisons between their solution and the ones obtained by a solver on a set of inputs. In real-world applications, one cannot consider tests on a finite set of points to be sufficient grounds for deployment, as the performance could be substantially worse on a different set. To alleviate this issue, we establish guaranteed error-based conditions for PINNs over their continuous applicability domain. To verify the extent to which they hold, we introduce $\partial$-CROWN: a general, efficient and scalable post-training framework to bound PINN residual errors. We demonstrate its effectiveness in obtaining tight certificates by applying it to two classically studied PINNs - Burgers' and Schr\"odinger's equations -, and two more challenging ones with real-world applications - the Allan-Cahn and Diffusion-Sorption equations.</description>

      <title>Volume Singularities in General Relativity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.16995v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new notion of singularity in General Relativity which complements the usual notions of geodesic incompleteness and curvature singularities. Concretely, we say that a spacetime has a volume singularity if there exist points whose future or past has arbitrarily small spacetime volume: in particular, smaller than a Planck volume. From a cosmological perspective, we show that the (geodesic) singularities predicted by Hawking's theorem are also volume singularities. In the black hole setting, we show that volume singularities are always hidden by an event horizon, prompting a discussion of Penrose's cosmic censorship conjecture.</description>

      <title>Noisy Quantum Trees: Infinite Protection Without Correction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.14294v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study quantum networks with tree structures, in which information propagates from a root to leaves. At each node in the network, the received qubit unitarily interacts with fresh ancilla qubits, after which each qubit is sent through a noisy channel to a different node in the next level. Therefore, as the tree depth grows, there is a competition between the irreversible effect of noise and the protection against such noise achieved by delocalization of information. In the classical setting, where each node simply copies the input bit into multiple output bits, this model has been studied as the broadcasting or reconstruction problem on trees, which has broad applications. In this work, we study the quantum version of this problem. We consider a Clifford encoder at each node that encodes the input qubit in a stabilizer code, along with a single qubit Pauli noise channel at each edge. Such noisy quantum trees describe a scenario in which one has access to a stream of fresh (low-entropy) ancilla qubits, but cannot perform error correction. Therefore, they provide a different perspective on quantum fault tolerance. Furthermore, they provide a useful model for describing the effect of noise within the encoders of concatenated codes. We prove that above certain noise thresholds, which depend on the properties of the code such as its distance, as well as the properties of the encoder, information decays exponentially with the depth of the tree. On the other hand, by studying certain efficient decoders, we prove that for codes with distance d&gt;=2 and for sufficiently small (but non-zero) noise, classical information and entanglement propagate over a noisy tree with infinite depth. Indeed, we find that this remains true even for binary trees with certain 2-qubit encoders at each node, which encode the received qubit in the binary repetition code with distance d=1.</description>

      <title>A Framework for Universality in Physics, Computer Science, and Beyond</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.06851v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Turing machines and spin models share a notion of universality according to which some simulate all others. Is there a theory of universality that captures this notion? We set up a categorical framework for universality which includes as instances universal Turing machines, universal spin models, NP completeness, top of a preorder, denseness of a subset, and more. By identifying necessary conditions for universality, we show that universal spin models cannot be finite. We also characterize when universality can be distinguished from a trivial one and use it to show that universal Turing machines are non-trivial in this sense. Our framework allows not only to compare universalities within each instance, but also instances themselves. We leverage a Fixed Point Theorem inspired by a result of Lawvere to establish that universality and negation give rise to unreachability (such as uncomputability). As such, this work sets the basis for a unified approach to universality and invites the study of further examples within the framework.</description>

      <title>Characterising semi-Clifford gates using algebraic sets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.15184v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by their central role in fault-tolerant quantum computation, we study the sets of gates of the third-level of the Clifford hierarchy and their distinguished subsets of `nearly diagonal' semi-Clifford gates. The Clifford hierarchy gates can be implemented via gate teleportation given appropriate magic states. The vast quantity of these resource states required for achieving fault-tolerance is a significant bottleneck for the practical realisation of universal quantum computers. Semi-Clifford gates are important because they can be implemented with far more efficient use of these resource states.
  We prove that every third-level gate of up to two qudits is semi-Clifford. We thus generalise results of Zeng-Chen-Chuang (2008) in the qubit case and of the second author (2020) in the qutrit case to the case of qudits of arbitrary prime dimension $d$.
  Earlier results relied on exhaustive computations whereas our present work leverages tools of algebraic geometry. Specifically, we construct two schemes corresponding to the sets of third-level Clifford hierarchy gates and third-level semi-Clifford gates. We then show that the two algebraic sets resulting from reducing these schemes modulo $d$ share the same set of rational points.</description>

      <title>Complexity and order in approximate quantum error-correcting codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.04710v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish rigorous connections between quantum circuit complexity and approximate quantum error correction (AQEC) properties, covering both all-to-all and geometric scenarios including lattice systems. To this end, we introduce a type of code parameter that we call subsystem variance, which is closely related to the optimal AQEC precision. Our key finding is that if the subsystem variance is below an $O(k/n)$ threshold then any state in the code subspace must obey certain circuit complexity lower bounds, which identify nontrivial ``phases'' of codes. Based on our results, we propose $O(k/n)$ as a boundary between subspaces that should and should not count as AQEC codes. This theory of AQEC provides a versatile framework for understanding the quantum complexity and order of many-body quantum systems, offering new insights for wide-ranging physical scenarios, in particular topological order and critical quantum systems which are of outstanding importance in many-body and high energy physics. We observe from various different perspectives that roughly $O(1/n)$ represents a common, physically significant ``scaling threshold'' of subsystem variance for features associated with nontrivial quantum order.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.09334v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We find a formula for the Virasoro fusion kernel at $c=25$, in terms of the connection coefficients of the Painlev\'e VI differential equation. Our formula agrees numerically with previously known integral representations of the kernel. The derivation of our formula relies on a duality $c\to 26-c$ that is obeyed by the shift equations for the fusion and modular kernels. We conjecture that for $c&lt;1$ the fusion and modular kernels are not smooth functions, but distributions.</description>

Abstract: Rotary dynamics of polarized composite particles as dipole rigid bodies is considered. It is described the Euler equations singularly perturbed by the radiation reaction torque. The Schott term is taken into account, and the reduction procedure lowering higher derivatives is applied. Asymptotic methods of nonlinear mechanics are used to analyze the rotary dynamics of askew-polarized spinning top. Numerical estimates are relevant to the hypothetical DAST-nanocrystals that might possess a huge dipole moment.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic bounds on generalized transport: From single-molecule to bulk observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00048v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the transport of any scalar observable in $d$-dimensional non-equilibrium systems is bounded from above by the total entropy production scaled by the amount the observation "stretches" microscopic coordinates. The result -- a time-integrated generalized speed limit -- reflects the thermodynamic cost of transport of observables, and places underdamped and overdamped stochastic dynamics on equal footing with deterministic motion. Our work allows for stochastic thermodynamics to make contact with bulk experiments, and fills an important gap in thermodynamic inference, since microscopic dynamics is, at least for short times, underdamped. Requiring only averages but not sample-to-sample fluctuations, the proven transport bound is practical and applicable not only to single-molecule but also bulk experiments where only averages are observed, which we demonstrate by examples. Our results may facilitate thermodynamic inference on molecular machines without an obvious directionality from bulk observations of transients probed, e.g. in time-resolved X-ray scattering.</description>

      <title>New cluster algebras from old: integrability beyond Zamolodchikov periodicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00721v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider discrete dynamical systems obtained as deformations of mutations in cluster algebras associated with finite-dimensional simple Lie algebras. The original (undeformed) dynamical systems provide the simplest examples of Zamolodchikov periodicity: they are affine birational maps for which every orbit is periodic with the same period. Following on from preliminary work by one of us with Kouloukas, here we present integrable maps obtained from deformations of cluster mutations related to the following simple root systems: $A_3$, $B_2$, $B_3$ and $D_4$. We further show how new cluster algebras arise, by considering Laurentification, that is, a lifting to a higher-dimensional map expressed in a set of new variables (tau functions), for which the dynamics exhibits the Laurent property. For the integrable map obtained by deformation of type $A_3$, which already appeared in our previous work, we show that there is a commuting map of Quispel-Roberts-Thompson (QRT) type which is built from a composition of mutations and a permutation applied to the same cluster algebra of rank 6, with an additional 2 frozen variables. Furthermore, both the deformed $A_3$ map and the QRT map correspond to addition of a point in the Mordell-Weil group of a rational elliptic surface of rank two, and the underlying cluster algebra comes from a quiver that mutation equivalent to the $q$-Painlev\'e III quiver found by Okubo. The deformed integrable maps of types $B_2$, $B_3$ and $D_4$ are also related to elliptic surfaces.
  From a dynamical systems viewpoint, the message of the paper is that special families of birational maps with completely periodic dynamics under iteration admit natural deformations that are aperiodic yet completely integrable.</description>

      <title>Six decades of the FitzHugh-Nagumo model: A guide through its spatio-temporal dynamics and influence across disciplines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11403v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The FitzHugh-Nagumo equation, originally conceived in neuroscience during the 1960s, became a key model providing a simplified view of excitable neuron cell behavior. Its applicability, however, extends beyond neuroscience into fields like cardiac physiology, cell division, population dynamics, electronics, and other natural phenomena. In this review spanning six decades of research, we discuss the diverse spatio-temporal dynamical behaviors described by the FitzHugh-Nagumo equation. These include dynamics like bistability, oscillations, and excitability, but it also addresses more complex phenomena such as traveling waves and extended patterns in coupled systems. The review serves as a guide for modelers aiming to utilize the strengths of the FitzHugh-Nagumo model to capture generic dynamical behavior. It not only catalogs known dynamical states and bifurcations, but also extends previous studies by providing stability and bifurcation analyses for coupled spatial systems.</description>

      <title>2d Ising Critical Couplings from Quantum Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01253v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using an exact holographic duality formula between the inhomogeneous 2d Ising model and 3d quantum gravity, we provide a formula for "real" zeroes of the 2d Ising partition function on finite trivalent graphs in terms of the geometry of a 2d triangulation embedded in the three-dimensional Euclidean space. The complex phase of those zeroes is given by the dihedral angles of the triangulation, which reflect its extrinsic curvature within the ambient 3d space, while the modulus is given by the angles within the 2d triangles, thus encoding the intrinsic geometry of the triangulation. Our formula can not cover the whole set of Ising zeroes, but we conjecture that a suitable complexification of these "real" zeroes would provide a more thorough formula. Nevertheless, in the thermodynamic limit, in the case of flat planar 2d triangulations, our Ising zeros' formula gives the critical couplings for isoradial graphs, confirming its generality. Finally, the formula naturally extends to graphs with arbitrary valence in terms of geometry of circle patterns embedded in 3d space. This approach shows an intricate, but precise, new relation between statistical mechanics and quantum geometry.</description>

      <title>Generalized cluster states from Hopf algebras: non-invertible symmetry and Hopf tensor network representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09277v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cluster states are crucial resources for measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC). It exhibits symmetry-protected topological (SPT) order, thus also playing a crucial role in studying topological phases. We present the construction of cluster states based on Hopf algebras. By generalizing the finite group valued qudit to a Hopf algebra valued qudit and introducing the generalized Pauli-X operator based on the regular action of the Hopf algebra, as well as the generalized Pauli-Z operator based on the irreducible representation action on the Hopf algebra, we develop a comprehensive theory of Hopf qudits. We demonstrate that non-invertible symmetry naturally emerges for Hopf qudits. Subsequently, for a bipartite graph termed the cluster graph, we assign the identity state and trivial representation state to even and odd vertices, respectively. Introducing the edge entangler as controlled regular action, we provide a general construction of Hopf cluster states. To ensure the commutativity of the edge entangler, we propose a method to construct a cluster lattice for any triangulable manifold. We use the 1d cluster state as an example to illustrate our construction. As this serves as a promising candidate for SPT phases, we construct the gapped Hamiltonian for this scenario and delve into a detailed discussion of its non-invertible symmetries. We also show that the 1d cluster state model is equivalent to the quasi-1d Hopf quantum double model. We also introduce the Hopf tensor network representation of Hopf cluster states by integrating the tensor representation of structure constants with the string diagrams of the Hopf algebra.</description>

      <title>GKLS Vector Field Dynamics for Gaussian States</title>

Abstract: We construct the vector field associated with the GKLS generator for systems described by Gaussian states. This vector field is defined on the dual space of the algebra of operators, restricted to operators quadratic in position and momentum. It is shown that the GKLS dynamics accepts a decomposition principle, that is, this vector field can be decomposed in three parts, a conservative Hamiltonian component, a gradient-like and a Choi-Krauss vector field. The last two terms are considered a "perturbation" associated with dissipation. Examples are presented for a harmonic oscillator with different dissipation terms.</description>

      <title>Klein-Gordon oscillators, RQM and quantum time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14349v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that turning on the interaction of relativistic spinless particles with the vacuum of relativistic quantum mechanics (RQM) leads to the replacement of the Klein-Gordon equation with the Klein-Gordon oscillator equation. In this case, coordinate time becomes an operator and free relativistic particles go into a virtual state. We discuss geometry associated with classical and quantum Klein-Gordon oscillators, and its relation to the geometry underlying the description of free particles.</description>
