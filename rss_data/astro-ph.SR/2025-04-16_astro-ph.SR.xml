      <title>A $\nu$ look at the Sun: Probing the conditions of the solar core using $^8$B neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the coming age of precision neutrino physics, neutrinos from the Sun become robust probes of the conditions of the solar core. Here, we focus on $^8$B neutrinos, for which there are already high precision measurements by the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory and Super-Kamiokande. Using only basic physical principles and straightforward statistical tools, we calculate projected constraints on the temperature and density of the $^8$B neutrino production zone compared to a reference solar model. We outline how to better understand the astrophysics of the solar interior using forthcoming neutrino data and solar models.</description>

      <title>TESS Light Curve of the Interacting Binary W Serpentis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The unusual light curve of the massive eclipsing binary W Ser was recently observed with high S/N and fast cadence by the NASA TESS mission. The TESS light curve records two eclipses and relatively fast variations outside of the eclipses. The eclipse timings verify the period increase of the binary, and the period derivative implies a mass transfer rate in excess of 10^{-5} solar masses per year.. The light curve shows a fading trend from just after an eclipse until the start of the next eclipse. The brightest flux source in the system is the accretion torus surrounding the mass gainer star, and we argue that these orbital-phase related fadings are the result of the injection of cooler gas from the mass donor entering the outskirts of the accretion torus. There are cyclic variations in the out-of-eclipse sections of the light curve that vary on a 2.8 day timescale. This equals the orbital period for gas in the outer regions of the accretion torus, so the photometric variations are probably the result of transitory, over-dense regions that form at the rim of the accretion torus.</description>

      <title>Probing progression of heating through the lower flare atmosphere via high-cadence IRIS spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent high-cadence flare campaigns by the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) have offered new opportunities to study rapid processes characteristic of flare energy release, transport, and deposition. Here, we examine high-cadence chromospheric and transition region spectra acquired by IRIS during a C-class flare from 2022 September 25. Within the flare ribbon, the intensities of the Si IV 1402.77, C II 1334.53 and Mg II k 2796.35 lines peaked at different times, with the transition region Si IV typically peaking before the chromospheric Mg II line by 1 - 6 seconds. To understand the nature of these delays, we probed a grid of radiative hydrodynamic flare simulations heated by electron beams, thermal conduction-only, or Alfv\'en waves. Electron beam parameters were constrained by hard X-ray observations from the Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) onboard the Fermi spacecraft. Reproducing lightcurves where Si IV peaks precede those in Mg II proved to be a challenge, as only a subset of Fermi/GBM-constrained electron beam models were consistent with the observations. Lightcurves with relative timings consistent with the observations were found in simulations heated by either high-flux electron beams or by Alfv\'en waves, while the thermal conduction heating does not replicate the observed delays. Our analysis shows how delays between chromospheric and transition region emission pose tight constraints on flare models and properties of energy transport, highlighting the importance of obtaining very high-cadence datasets with IRIS and other observatories.</description>

      <title>Transfer of Entropy between the Magnetic Field and Solar Energetic Particles during an Interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermodynamics of solar wind bulk plasma have been routinely measured and quantified, unlike those of solar energetic particles (SEPs), whose thermodynamic properties have remained elusive until recently. The thermodynamic kappa (\(\kappa_{\rm EP}\)) that parameterizes the statistical distribution of SEP kinetic energy contains information regarding the population's level of correlation and effective degrees of freedom (\({\rm d_{eff}}\)). At the same time, the intermittent kappa (\(\kappa_{\Delta B}\)) that parameterizes the statistical distribution of magnetic field increments contains information about the correlation and \({\rm d_{eff}}\) involved in magnetic field fluctuations. Correlations between particles can be affected by magnetic field fluctuations, leading to a relationship between \(\kappa_{\rm EP}\) and \(\kappa_{\Delta B}\). In this paper, we examine the relationship of \({\rm d_{eff}}\) and entropy between energetic particles and the magnetic field via the spatial variation of their corresponding parameter kappa values. We compare directly the values of \(\kappa_{\rm EP}\) and \(\kappa_{\Delta B}\) using Parker Solar Probe IS\(\odot\)IS and FIELDS measurements during an SEP event associated with an interplanetary coronal mass ejection (ICME). Remarkably, we find that \(\kappa_{\rm EP}\) and \(\kappa_{\Delta B}\) are anti-correlated via a linear relationship throughout the passing of the ICME, indicating a proportional exchange of \({\rm d_{eff}}\) from the magnetic field to energetic particles, i.e., \(\kappa_{\Delta B} \sim (-0.15 \pm 0.03)\kappa_{\rm EP}\), interpreted as an effective coupling ratio. This finding is crucial for improving our understanding of ICMEs and suggests that they help to produce an environment that enables the transfer of entropy from the magnetic field to energetic particles due to changes in intermittency of the magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Subspace Approximations to the Focused Transport Equation of Energetic Particles, I. The Standard Form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Fokker-Planck equation describing the transport of energetic particles interacting with turbulence is difficult to solve analytically. Numerical solutions are of course possible but they are not always useful for applications. In the past a subspace approximation was proposed which allows to compute important quantities such as the characteristic function as well as certain expectation values. This previous approach was applied to solve the one-dimensional Fokker-Planck equation which contains only a pitch-angle scattering term. In the current paper we extend this approach in order to solve the Fokker-Planck equation with a focusing term. We employ two- and three-dimensional subspace approximations to achieve a pure analytical description of particle transport. Additionally, we show that with higher dimensions, the subspace method can be used as a hybrid analytical-numerical method which produces an accurate approximation. Although the latter approach does not lead to analytical results, it is much faster compared to pure numerical solutions of the considered transport equation.</description>

      <title>A Sample of Extreme Eclipsing Binaries with Accretion Disks from LAMOST and ZTF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extreme eclipsing binaries may harbor peculiar physical properties. In this work, we aim to identify a sample of such systems by selecting binaries with pronounced eclipsing light curves, characterized of large variability ($\Delta \mathrm{mag} &gt; 0.3$ in ZTF $g$ band) and significant differences between primary and secondary eclipses (eclipse depth ratio $&gt;$ 20 in ZTF $g$ band). We identified 23 candidates by combining the photometric data and the LAMOST spectroscopic survey. Spectroscopic analysis revealed that all of these systems are dominated by A-type stars in the optical band. Further investigation confirmed that all 23 candidates are Algol-type binaries, with 22 of them being newly discovered. Their orbital periods range from 2.57 to 19.21 days. These systems consist of low-luminosity, highly stripped subgiant donors and accreting A-type stars. The donor stars, with radii of $2.5-8.9~R_\odot$ and effective temperatures around 4000 K, have typical masses of $M_2 \sim 0.3~M_\odot$, indicating substantial mass loss through Roche-lobe overflow. The presence of ellipsoidal variability and H$\alpha$ emission provides strong evidence for ongoing mass transfer. By fitting the spectral energy distributions, spectra, and light curves, we found that most of the accretors have luminosities lower than expected from the mass-luminosity relation, aligning with the predicted faint phase for mass-gaining stars. Three objects of our sample exhibit pulsations with periods from 18 minutes to 8 hours, providing opportunities for asteroseismic studies. The low mass transfer rates and stability make the sample excellent systems for studying mass accretion, advancing our understanding of the Algol-type binary evolution.</description>

      <title>Radiative-transfer models for dusty Type II supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dust is expected to form on a year timescale in core-collapse supernova (SN) ejecta. Its existence is revealed through an infrared brightening, an optical dimming, or a blue-red emission-line profile asymmetry. To investigate how the dust location and amount impact observations, we computed ultraviolet-to-optical spectra of interacting and standard, noninteracting Type II SNe using state-of-the-art models -- for simplicity we adopted 0.1micron silicate grains. These models account for the full ejecta and treat both radioactive decay and shock power that arises from interaction of the ejecta with circumstellar material. In a Type IIn SN such as 1998S at one year, approximately 3e-4Msun of dust within the dense shell reproduces the broad, asymmetric Halpha profile. It causes an optical dimming of ~2mag (which obscures any emission from the inner, metal-rich ejecta) but, paradoxically, a more modest dimming of the ultraviolet, which originates from the outer parts of the dense shell. In Type II SNe with late-time interaction, such as SN2017eaw, dust in the low-mass, fast outer ejecta dense shell tends to be optically thin, impacting little the optical spectrum for dust masses of order 1e-4Msun. In such SNe II with interaction, dust in the inner metal-rich ejecta has negligible effect on observed spectra in the ultraviolet and optical. In noninteracting SNe II, dust within the metal-rich ejecta preferentially quenches the [OI]6300,6364 and [CaII]7291,7323 metal lines, biasing the emission in favor of the H-rich material which generates the Halpha and FeII emission below 5500A. Our model with 5e-4Msun of dust below 2000km/s matches closely the optical spectrum of SN1987A at 714d. Modeling historical SNe requires treating both the ejecta material and the dust, as well as multiple power sources, although interaction power will generally dominate.</description>

      <title>Formation of Ba stars : impact of wind Roche lobe overflow and circumbinary disk in shaping the orbital parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: After more than three decades of investigation, the distribution of Ba stars in the e-log P diagram still defies our understanding. Recent smooth particle hydrodynamic simulations involving an asymptotic giant branch (AGB) primary have shown that a circumbinary disk (CB) can form around the binary and that the presence of dust in the wind of evolved low- and intermediate-mass stars can significantly affect the systemic angular momentum loss and mass accretion onto the companion through the wind Roche lobe overflow (WRLOF) phase. We used the binary evolution code BINSTAR, where we updated the modeling of the progenitors of Ba stars including a CB disk, the WRLOF, tidally enhanced wind mass loss, and non-conservative RLOF with their effects on the orbital evolution. In our approach, we considered that a CB disk forms when WRLOF is activated. The coupling between the CB disk and the binary follows the standard resonant interaction theory. We constructed grids of 2.0 + 1.0 $M_\odot{}$ and 1.2 + 0.8 $M_\odot{}$ binaries for initial orbital parameters that result in WRLOF, and evolved these systems until the end of the primary's AGB phase. WRLOF resulted in a significant shrinkage of the orbital separation during the AGB phase, leading to binaries with initial periods on the order of $\lesssim 12000$ d undergoing Roche lobe overflow (RLOF). The combination of WRLOF, eccentricity pumping from the CB disk, and/or tidally enhanced wind mass loss can lead to RLOF on eccentric orbits down to periods of $P_\mathrm{orb} \sim 3000$d. Non-conservative RLOF enabled a reduction of the period before circularization down to $\sim 2000$d, provided at least 50 percent of the transferred mass left the system. Our models still cannot account for the eccentricity distribution of Ba stars with periods shorter than $P_\mathrm{orb} \lesssim 2000$d, where a common envelope evolution appears unavoidable.</description>

      <title>Statistical complexity as a probe of mass and phase structure in compact objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a comprehensive and systematic study of the statistical complexity, originally introduced by L\'opez-Ruiz, Mancini, and Calbet [Phys. Lett. A 209, 321-326 (1995)], across a broad range of compact star models. We explore how complexity correlates not only with macroscopic observables such as mass and radius, but also with the microscopic characteristics of the underlying equation of state. By incorporating both realistic equations of state and analytical solutions to Einstein's field equations, we demonstrate that gravitational mass plays a dominant role in determining the behavior of complexity. Furthermore, we show that strong phase transitions within the stellar interior, such as those hypothesized in hybrid stars, can manifest as distinct features in the complexity profile, offering a potential informational signature of such transitions. This work offers new insights into the link between information theory and compact object physics, highlighting complexity's potential as a diagnostic tool in astrophysics.</description>

      <title>Observational Study of Recurrent Jets: Evolution of Magnetic Flux, Current, and Helicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We observed three recurrent blowout jets in an active regio with Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) aboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). Using Helioseismic Magnetic Imager (HMI) data. We found that the magnetic flux of an emerging negative pole increases steadily before declining just as the jets erupt. Certain physical quantities, like the total unsigned vertical current, align with the periodicity of the jets. The differential affine velocity of the vector magnetograms reveals strong shear around the negative pole. The Doppler velocity map, calculated from the H$\alpha$ spectra observed by the Chinese H$\alpha$ Solar Explorer (CHASE), shows upflows with large initial velocity before it can be observed by AIA. The magnetic field derived from the nonlinear force-free field (NLFFF) model suggests a topology akin to fan-spine structure, consistent with AIA images. We calculated the evolution of volumetric helicity ratio using the NLFFF model and found its phase aligns with the jet flux in AIA 171 \AA. These results suggest that recurrent jets may be triggered by the accumulation and release of energy and helicity, driven by emergence, shearing and cancellation of photospheric magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Gravitationally Induced Explosive Outflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past decade, there has been a significant increase in the reporting of extensive and luminous star-forming regions associated with explosive outflows. Nevertheless, there is still a lack of understanding of the possible physical mechanisms that produce such energetic and isotropic events. Then, we propose a gravitational interaction as a likely mechanism that could trigger explosive outflows in dense star-forming regions. This could constrain the physical conditions that generate an explosive outflow produced by the close dynamical encounter of a runaway star with a clump cluster in dynamical equilibrium. Then, we have produced a set of $N$-body simulations that account for the collision of a 10M$_\odot$ stellar object with a cluster of particles with a mass that ranges from 0 to 50 \msun. We propose a parameter to describe the interaction, the evaporation parameter, that represents the fraction of stars that become unbound. The main result is that, when the cluster mass is less than, or up to a few times the stellar mass, the collision will produce an explosive outflow, ejecting a significant fraction of the cluster members with velocities larger than the impact velocity. All of our models produce an explosive outflow, with different characteristics, which increases the probability that a close encounter could be responsible for producing the observed flows.</description>

      <title>Influence of the magnetic activity cycle on mean density and acoustic radius inversions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Asteroseismic modelling is crucial for upcoming missions like PLATO, CubeSpec, and Roman. Despite significant progress, discrepancies between observations and theoretical predictions introduce biases in stellar characterisation at the precision required by PLATO. Current models typically ignore magnetic activity, assuming its effects are hidden within surface effects. However, recent studies have shown significant impacts of magnetic activity on the Sun's asteroseismic characterisation using forward modelling. Using GOLF and BiSON observations of two full solar activity cycles, we quantified the impact of magnetic activity on solar mean density and acoustic radius inversions. Observations were segmented into yearly overlapping snapshots, each offset by 91.25 days. Inversions were performed for each snapshot to determine mean density and acoustic radius, tracking their temporal evolution and estimating systematic uncertainty due to magnetic activity. We observed a clear imprint of the magnetic activity cycle on solar mean density and acoustic radius through helioseismic inversions, consistent across GOLF and BiSON datasets. This imprint is the largest source of systematic uncertainty in solar asteroseismic characterisation. Including low radial-order modes mitigates these effects more significantly than previously measured for other stellar variables. We recommend asteroseismic values for solar mean density (1.4104 \pm 0.0051 g/cm3) and acoustic radius (3722.0 \pm 4.1 s), averaged over two activity cycles. These values account for major systematic errors, achieving high precision (0.36% for mean density and 0.11% for acoustic radius). These results are promising for high-precision characterisation of Sun-like stars, a better-constrained mean density being able to enhance the precision of stellar radius estimate, which is crucial for exoplanetary system characterisation.</description>

Abstract: We study the launching of magnetized jets from a resistive circumstellar disk within a binary system, employing a unique combination of 3D MHD jet launching simulations (PLUTO code) and post-processed 3D radiative transfer modeling (RADMC-3D code). Our findings reveal a well-defined jet originating from the inner region of the disk, extending to a larger disk area. While the model attains steady states for a single star, a binary system leads to the emergence of tidal effects such as the formation of ``spiral arms'' in the disk and inside the jet. Here we have consistently implemented a time-dependent Roche potential for the gravity of the binary. As a major step forward, we further present the first 3D radiation maps of the dust continuum for the disk-jet structure. In principle, this allows us to compare MHD simulation results to observed disk-outflow features. We, therefore, present convolved images of the dust continuum emission, employing exemplary point spread functions of the MIRI instrument (5~$\mu m$ band) and the ALMA array (320~$\mu m$ band). In these bands, we identify distinguishable features of the disk-jet structure, such as "spiral arms," which we have also seen in the MHD dynamics.For gas density increased by an order of magnitude, the disk become optically thick at 5~$\mu m$, but remains bright at 320~$\mu$m. At this wavelength, 320~$\mu$m, enhanced structural features in the disk and the base of the wind become more pronounced and are well resolved in the convolved image.</description>

      <title>Unified Solar Modulation Potential for Same-Charge Cosmic Rays and Implications for Local Interstellar Spectra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The energy spectra of cosmic rays (CRs) below tens of GeV are significantly modulated by solar activity within the heliosphere. To investigate the properties of Galactic CRs, it is important to determine the unmodulated local interstellar spectrum (LIS). Recent high-precision temporal measurements of CR energy spectra, released by the AMS-02 collaboration, provide a crucial observational foundation for this endeavor. In this study, we employ the widely used force-field approximation (FFA) model to analyze the AMS-02 data, and attempt to derive the LIS for CR protons and positrons. By applying a non-LIS method, we derive temporal variations of the relative solar modulation potential, $\Delta\phi$, for individual particle species. Our analysis demonstrates that the FFA provides sufficient accuracy in explaining the AMS-02 spectral measurements of all particles during the low solar activity period. Notably, the derived $\Delta\phi(t)$ for protons and positrons, as well as for electrons and antiprotons, exhibit excellent consistency, indicating that particles with the same charge sign can be effectively described within a unified FFA framework during the low solar activity period. Having established a well-constrained proton LIS and its associated modulation potential, we apply the common modulation behavior between positrons and protons to demodulate the AMS-02 positron measurements, and derive the positron LIS without necessitating prior knowledge of its characteristics. This LIS is useful for quantitative investigations into potential exotic origins of CR positrons.</description>

      <title>Unveiling a young thick disk in the Milky Way</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The thickness of a galaxy's disk provides a valuable probe of its formation and evolution history. Observations of the Milky Way and local galaxies have revealed an ubiquitous disk structure with two distinctive components: an old thick disk and a relatively young thin disk. The formation of this dual-disk structure and the mechanisms that develop the thickness of the disk are still unclear. Whether the disk thickness inherit from the birth environment or is established through secular dynamical heating after formation is under debate. In this work we identify a relatively young ($\sim$6.6 billion years old) geometric thick disk in the Milky Way, with a scale height of $0.64$ kpc at the Solar Circle. This young thick component exhibits comparable thickness and flaring strength to the canonical old thick disk but is more radially extended and systematically younger. We also identify thin disk components that formed before and after this young thick disk. Detailed analysis of the solar vicinity structure suggests that the young thick disk marks the onset of a new phase of upside-down disk formation. These findings strongly discount the role of secular dynamical heating and support a turbulent, bursty birth environment as the primary mechanism behind thick disk formation. The existence of two thick disk components suggests that the Milky Way has undergone at least two episodes of turbulent and bursty star formation, likely triggered by galaxy mergers.</description>

      <title>RedDots: Planetary masses in the GJ1061 system from planet-planet interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: GJ1061 is a very nearby M star hosting three low-mass temperate planets detected from radial velocity variations. The close to 4:2:1 period commensurability of the planets, the available long-term monitoring of the system and new very high-precision radial velocity measurements from ESPRESSO enable the determination of masses from the planet-planet interaction. Using nested sampling, we derived parameter distributions for a co-planar configuration. The three planets (Mb =1.07 +- 0.11M_Earth, Pb =3.2073 +- 0.0003 d, Mc=1.76 +- 0.13M_Earth, Pc=6.6821 +- 0.0008 d, Md =1.55 +- 0.17M_Earth, Pd =13.066 +- 0.002 d) are potentially all rocky with equilibrium temperatures between 360 K and 240 K. This makes the GJ1061 system one of the prime targets for future ground or space based instruments suitable for a direct detection of the planetary atmospheres.</description>

      <title>Tidal interactions in stellar and planetary systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational tidal interactions drive long-term rotational and orbital evolution in planetary systems, in multiple (particularly close binary) star systems and in planetary moon systems. Dissipation of tidal flows in Earth's oceans is primarily responsible for producing gradual expansion of the Moon's orbit at a few centimetres per year as the Earth's day lengthens by a few milliseconds per century. Similar processes occur in many astrophysical systems. For example, tidal dissipation inside (slowly rotating) stars hosting short-period planets can cause the orbits of these planets to decay, potentially leading to planetary destruction; tidal dissipation inside stars in close stellar binary systems -- and inside short-period planets such as hot Jupiters in planetary systems -- can cause initially eccentric orbits to become circular. To model these processes, explain many current observational results, and make predictions for future observations, we require a detailed theoretical understanding of tidal flows and the mechanisms by which -- and how efficiently -- they are dissipated inside stars and planets. This article will introduce our current understanding of tidal flows and dissipation inside stars (and to a lesser extent giant planets), as well as highlight some unsolved problems.</description>

      <title>Evidence of Nonlinear Signatures in Solar Wind Proton Density at the L1 Lagrange point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The solar wind is a medium characterized by strong turbulence and significant field fluctuations on various scales. Recent observations have revealed that magnetic turbulence exhibits a self-similar behavior. Similarly, high-resolution measurements of the proton density have shown comparable characteristics, prompting several studies into the multifractal properties of these density fluctuations. In this work, we show that low-resolution observations of the solar wind proton density over time, recorded by various spacecraft at Lagrange point L1, also exhibit non-linear and multifractal structures. The novelty of our study lies in the fact that this is the first systematic analysis of solar wind proton density using low-resolution (hourly) data collected by multiple spacecraft at the L1 Lagrange point over a span of 17 years. Furthermore, we interpret our results within the framework of non-extensive statistical mechanics, which appears to be consistent with the observed nonlinear behavior. Based on the data, we successfully validate the q-triplet predicted by non-extensive statistical theory. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the most rigorous and systematic validation to date of the q-triplet in the solar wind.</description>

      <title>Role of Matter Inhomogeneity on Fast Flavor Conversion of Supernova Neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigated the impact of a spatially varying matter potential $\lambda$, coming from neutrino-electron forward scattering, on the emergence of fast neutrino flavor conversion (FFC) triggered by the presence of zero crossings in the angular distribution of the neutrino electron lepton number (ELN). We find that FFC can be significantly affected as the spatial variation rate of $\lambda$ increases, and strong spatial variations can completely stabilize initially unstable systems. Using stability analysis based solely on initial conditions, we identified for the first time a critical variation rate above which no FFC occurs even if the flavor instability exists. By analyzing several representative matter profiles based on an 18 $M_{\odot}$ SN model, we show that spatially inhomogeneous $\lambda$ can suppress the occurrence of FFC associated with shallow ELN zero crossings in most of the SN's radial region, especially during the accretion phase. Our finding highlights the need to consider the impact of matter inhomogeneity in the development of improved SN models that aim to include the effect of neutrino flavor conversions.</description>

      <title>A magnetar powers the luminous supernova 2023pel, associated with a long gamma-ray burst</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore SN 2023pel, the most recent event associated with gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), specifically GRB 230812B. SN 2023pel has a high luminosity and low expansion velocities compared to other GRB-SNe. These properties seem difficult to reconcile with a single nickel power source. We searched for models that can explain the properties of this event. We calculated a grid of hydrodynamic models based on pre-SN structures derived from evolutionary calculations. We compared our models with observations of SN~2023pel and selected our preferred model using statistical analysis, taking both light curves and expansion velocities into account. This allowed us to derive a set of physical properties for SN~2023pel. Our models suggest that the most probable scenario involves a millisecond magnetar as the primary power source, supplemented by energy from radioactive decay. Our preferred model has a spin period of P = 3.2 ms, a magnetic field of B = 28 x 10^14 G, an explosion energy of 2.3 foe, a nickel mass of M_Ni= 0.24 solar masses, and an ejected mass of 3.4 solar masses. Alternatively, we find that a purely nickel-powered model also provides a good match with the observations, though M_Ni &gt; 0.8 solar masses are always required. However, the combination of such high values of M_Ni and low M_ej is difficult to reconcile, indicating that this scenario is less probable. We have also identified a specific region within the peak luminosity-velocity plane where an additional energy source beyond nickel may be necessary to power SNe with characteristics similar to SN~2023pel. Our study indicates that an additional energy source beyond radioactive decay is essential to explain the high brightness and relatively low expansion velocities of SN 2023pel. A magnetar-powered model, similar to the models proposed for the very luminous GRB-SN 2011kl, aligns well with these characteristics.</description>

      <title>MINDS. Anatomy of a water-rich, inclined, brown dwarf disk: lack of abundant hydrocarbons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 2MASS J04381486+2611399 (or J0438) is one of the few young brown dwarfs (BD) with a highly inclined ($i\!\sim\!70^\circ$) disk. Here we report results from JWST-MIRI MRS, HST-ACS and ALMA Band 7 observations. Despite its late spectral type (M7.25), the spectrum of J0438 resembles those of inner disks around earlier-type stars (K1-M5, T Tauri stars), with a volatile reservoir lacking hydrocarbons (except for acetylene, C$_2$H$_2$) and dominated by water. Other identified species are H$_2$, CO$_2$, HCN, [Ar$^{+}$], and [Ne$^{+}$]. The dominance of water over hydrocarbons is driven by multiple factors such as disk dynamics, young disk age, low accretion rate and possible inner disk clearing. J0438 appears highly dynamic, showing a seesaw-like variability and extended emission in H$_2 \,\,\, S$(1), $S$(3), $S$(5), [Ne$^{+}$] and CO ($J=3-2$). Interestingly, the CO emission reaches up to 400 au from the brown dwarf, suggesting ongoing infalling/outflowing activity impacting the disk chemistry. These observations underscore the combined power of JWST, HST and ALMA in characterizing the chemical diversity and dynamics of brown dwarf disks.</description>

      <title>MINDS: The very low-mass star and brown dwarf sample -- Hidden water in carbon-dominated protoplanetary disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Infrared observations of the inner disks around very low-mass stars (VLMS, $&lt;$0.3$\,M_{\odot}$) have revealed a carbon-rich gas composition in the terrestrial planet-forming regions. Contrary to the typically water-rich T Tauri disk spectra, only two disks around VLMS have been observed to be water-rich among more than ten VLMS disks observed so far with JWST/MIRI. In this letter, we systematically search for the presence of water and other oxygen-bearing molecules in the JWST/MIRI spectra of ten VLMS disks from the MIRI mid-INfrared Disk Survey (MINDS). In addition to the two previously reported detections of water emission in this VLMS sample, we detect water emission in the spectra of three other sources and tentatively in one source, and we provide strong evidence for water emission in the remaining disks in the MINDS sample, most of which have bright emission from carbon-bearing molecules. We show that the $\rm C_2H_2$ emission is much stronger than that of water for sources with low luminosities, and the hydrocarbons outshine the water emission in such conditions. We propose that the appearance of water-rich vs. hydrocarbon-rich spectra is related to the location of the water reservoir in the disk relative to the main hydrocarbon reservoir. Our findings indicate that the terrestrial planet forming regions in VLMS disks have high carbon-to-oxygen ratios (C/O$&gt;$1), but can still harbor ample water similar to those in the T Tauri disks.</description>

      <title>Hidden deep in the halo: selection of a reduced proper motion halo catalogue and mining retrograde streams in the velocity space</title>

Abstract: The Milky Way halo is one of the few galactic haloes that provides a unique insight into galaxy formation by resolved stellar populations. Here, we present a catalogue of $\sim$47 million halo stars selected independent of parallax and line-of-sight velocities, using a combination of Gaia DR3 proper motion and photometry by means of their reduced proper motion. We select high tangential velocity (halo) main sequence stars and fit distances to them using their simple colour-absolute-magnitude relation. This sample reaches out to $\sim$21 kpc with a median distance of $6.6$ kpc thereby probing much further out than would be possible using reliable Gaia parallaxes. The typical uncertainty in their distances is $0.57_{-0.26}^{+0.56}$ kpc. Using the colour range $0.45&lt;(G_0-G_\mathrm{RP,0})&lt;0.715$ where the main sequence is narrower, gives an even better accuracy down to $0.39_{-0.12}^{+0.18}$ kpc in distance. The median velocity uncertainty for stars within this colour range is 15.5 km/s. The distribution of these sources in the sky, together with their tangential component velocities, are very well-suited to study retrograde substructures. We explore the selection of two complex retrograde streams: GD-1 and Jhelum. For these streams, we resolve the gaps, wiggles and density breaks reported in the literature more clearly. We also illustrate the effect of the kinematic selection bias towards high proper motion stars and incompleteness at larger distances due to Gaia's scanning law. These examples showcase how the full RPM catalogue made available here can help us paint a more detailed picture of the build-up of the Milky Way halo.</description>

      <title>The Pristine survey: XXV. The very metal-poor Galaxy: Chemodynamics through the follow-up of the Pristine-Gaia synthetic catalogue</title>

Abstract: The Pristine-\textit{Gaia} synthetic catalogue provides reliable photometric metallicities for $\sim$30 million FGK stars using the Pristine survey model and Gaia XP spectra. We perform the first low-to-medium-resolution spectroscopic follow-up of bright (G&lt;15) and distant (up to 35 kpc) very and extremely metal-poor (V/EMP, [Fe/H]&lt;-2.5) red giant branch stars from this. We use Isaac Newton Telescope/Intermediate Dispersion Spectrograph (INT/IDS) observations centred around the calcium triplet region ideal for V/EMP stars. We find that 76\% of our stars indeed have [Fe/H]&lt;-2.5 with these inferred spectroscopic metallicities and only 3\% are outliers with [Fe/H] &gt; -2.0. We report a success rate of 77\% and 38\% in finding stars with [Fe/H]&lt;-2.5 and -3.0 respectively. This will allow for 10,000-20,000 homogeneously analysed EMP stars using the WEAVE survey follow-up of Pristine EMP candidates. We associate 20\%, 46\%, and 34\% of the stars to be confined to the disc plane, or to have inner and outer halo orbits, respectively. We also associate these V/EMP stars to known accretion events such as Gaia-Enceladus-Sausage (GES), LMS-1/Wukong, Thamnos, Helmi streams, Sagittarius, Sequoia, etc. For the stars that orbit close to the disc plane, we find that the prograde region with low vertical action is overdense with a significance of 4$\sigma$ as compared to its retrograde counterpart. We also find three new (brightest) members of the most metal-poor stellar stream, C-19, one of which is 50$^\circ$ away from the main body of the stream. Our measured mean metallicity, velocity dispersion, and stream width are consistent with the literature, but our results favour a higher distance ($\sim$21.5 kpc) for the stream. We publish a catalogue (and 1D spectra) of 215 V/EMP stars from this spectroscopic follow-up and showcase the power of chemokinematic analysis of V/EMP end.</description>

      <title>SynthPop: A New Framework for Synthetic Milky Way Population Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18821v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present SynthPop, a new open source, modular population synthesis Galactic modeling software to simulate catalogs of Milky Way stars along any sightline outward from the Sun. Motivated by a lack flexibility in existing Galactic models, SynthPop is coded entirely in python, can be run standalone or as an imported module, and is configured by json files that allow different model components to be switched out as desired. We describe the modular code structure, how the population generation process runs, and how to use the code. We also present model validation testing and known inaccuracies, and present an example of the code use, comparing Gaia data and the Gaia Universe Model Snapshot to a SynthPop implementation. The code is available now via GitHub with ReadTheDocs documentation and can be installed via pip.</description>

      <title>Long-term evolution of the temperature structure in magnetized protoplanetary disks and its implication for the dichotomy of planetary composition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08042v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The thermal structure and evolution of protoplanetary disks play a crucial role in planet formation. In addition to stellar irradiation, accretion heating is also thought to significantly affect the disk thermal structure and planet formation processes. We present the long-term evolution (from the beginning of Class II to disk dissipation) of thermal structures in laminar magnetized disks to investigate where and when accretion heating is a dominant heat source. In addition, we demonstrate that the difference in the disk structures affects the water content of forming planets. We considered the mass loss by magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) and photoevaporative disk winds to investigate the influence of wind mass loss on the accretion rate profile. Our model includes the recent understanding of accretion heating, that is, accretion heating in laminar disks is less efficient than that in turbulent disks because the surface is heated at optically thinner altitudes and energy is removed by disk winds. We find that accretion heating is weaker than irradiation heating at about 1--10 au even in the early Class II disk, but it can affect the temperature in the inner 1 au region. We also find that the magnetohydrodynamic wind mass loss in the inner region can significantly reduce the accretion rate compared with the rate in the outer region, which in turn reduces accretion heating. Furthermore, using evolving disk structures, we demonstrate that when accretion heating models are updated, the evolution of protoplanets is affected. In particular, we find that our model produces a dichotomy of the planetary water fraction of 1--10 $M_\oplus$.</description>
