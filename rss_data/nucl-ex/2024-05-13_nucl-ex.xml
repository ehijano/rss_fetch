      <title>Larmor Power Limit for Cyclotron Radiation of Relativistic Particles in a Waveguide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cyclotron radiation emission spectroscopy (CRES) is a modern technique for high-precision energy spectroscopy, in which the energy of a charged particle in a magnetic field is measured via the frequency of the emitted cyclotron radiation. The He6-CRES collaboration aims to use CRES to probe beyond the standard model physics at the TeV scale by performing high-resolution and low-background beta-decay spectroscopy of ${}^6\textrm{He}$ and ${}^{19}\textrm{Ne}$. Having demonstrated the first observation of individual, high-energy (0.1 -- 2.5 MeV) positrons and electrons via their cyclotron radiation, the experiment provides a novel window into the radiation of relativistic charged particles in a waveguide via the time-derivative (slope) of the cyclotron radiation frequency, $\mathrm{d}f_\textrm{c}/\mathrm{d}t$. We show that analytic predictions for the total cyclotron radiation power emitted by a charged particle in circular and rectangular waveguides are approximately consistent with the Larmor formula, each scaling with the Lorentz factor of the underlying $e^\pm$ as $\gamma^4$. This hypothesis is corroborated with experimental CRES slope data.</description>

      <title>White paper on (${\alpha}$, n) neutron yields calculation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the radiogenic neutron production rate through the (${\alpha}$, n) reaction is essential in many fields of physics like dark matter searches, neutrino studies, nuclear astrophysics and medical physics. This white paper provides a review of the current landscape of (${\alpha}$, n) yields, neutron spectra and correlated ${\gamma}$-rays calculations, and describes the existing tools and the available cross-sections. The uncertainties that contribute to (${\alpha}$, n) yield calculations are also discussed with plans for a program to improve the accuracy of these estimates. Novel ideas to measure (${\alpha}$, n) cross-sections for a variety of materials of interest are presented. The goal of this study is to reduce the uncertainty in the expected sensitivity of next-generation physics experiments in the keV--MeV regime.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of Bremsstrahlung {\gamma}-rays Spectrum in Heavy Ion Reactions with Richardson-Lucy Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The high momentum tail (HMT) in the momentum distribution of nucleons above the Fermi surface has been regarded as an evidence of short-range correlations (SRCs) in atomic nuclei. It has been showcased recently that the np Bremsstrahlung radiation in heavy ion reactions can be used to extract HMT information. The Richardson-Lucy (RL) algorithm is introduced to the reconstruction of the original Bremsstrahlung {\gamma}-ray energy spectrum from experimental measurements. By solving the inverse problem of the detector response to the {\gamma}-rays, the original energy spectrum of the Bremsstrahlung {\gamma} in 25 MeV/u 86Kr + 124Sn has been reconstructed and compared to the isospin- and momentum-dependent Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck (IBUU) simulations. The analysis based on hypothesis test suggests the existence of the HMT of nucleons in nuclei, in accordance with the previous conclusions. With its effectiveness being demonstrated, it is feasible to apply the RL algorithm in future experiments of measuring the Bremsstrahlung {\gamma}-rays in heavy ion reactions.</description>

      <title>Results from the CsI Calorimeter onboard the 2023 ComPair Balloon Flight</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ComPair gamma-ray telescope is a technology demonstrator for a future gamma-ray telescope called the All-sky Medium Energy Gamma-ray Observatory (AMEGO). The instrument is composed of four subsystems, a double-sided silicon strip detector, a virtual Frisch grid CdZnTe calorimeter, a CsI:Tl based calorimeter, and an anti-coincidence detector (ACD). The CsI calorimeter's goal is to measure the position and energy deposited from high-energy events. To demonstrate the technological readiness, the calorimeter has flown onboard a NASA scientific balloon as part of the GRAPE-ComPair mission and accumulated around 3 hours of float time at an altitude of 40 km. During the flight, the CsI calorimeter observed background radiation, Regener-Pfotzer Maximum, and several gamma-ray activation lines originating from aluminum.</description>

      <title>Second-Order Dissociation and Transition of Heavy Quarkonia in the Quark-Gluon Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the dissociation of heavy quarkonia by thermal partons at the next-to-leading order (NLO, also known as inelastic parton scattering dissociation) in the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP). Utilizing the chromo-electric dipole coupling from QCD multipole expansion as an effective Hamiltonian, this has been conducted in the approach of second-order quantum mechanical perturbation theory, which allows us to systematically incorporate the bound state wave functions. Employing the quarkonium wave functions and binding energies obtained from an in-medium potential model, we then numerically evaluate the dissociation cross sections and rates for various charmonia and bottomonia, where the infrared and collinear divergences are regularized by the thermal masses of medium partons. We demonstrate that distinct from the leading order (LO, also known as gluo-dissociation) counterparts peaking at relatively low gluon energy and falling off thereafter, the NLO cross sections first grow and then nearly saturate as the incident parton energy increases, as a result of the outgoing parton carrying away the excess energy. The resulting NLO dissociation rates increase with temperature and take over from the LO counterparts toward high temperatures, similar to pertinent findings from previous studies. We also evaluate the in-medium second-order transition between different bound states, which may contribute to the total thermal decay widths of heavy quarkonia in the QGP.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Structure of Hidden-Bottom Strange Pentaquarks via Magnetic Moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the discovery of hidden-charm strange pentaquarks, we conduct a systematic study of the magnetic moments of the hidden-bottom strange pentaquarks in molecular picture. We calculate magnetic moments of hidden-bottom strange pentaquarks with strangeness-1 and 2. Magnetic moment gives valuable information about the inner structure and shape of the hadron. The obtained results may be helpful to determine the inner structure of these new yet hypothetical states.</description>

      <title>Shell structure and shape transition in odd-$Z$ superheavy nuclei with proton numbers $Z=117, 119$: insights from deformed relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov in continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic study on the structural properties of odd-$Z$ superheavy nuclei with proton numbers $Z=117, 119$, and neutron numbers $N$ increasing from $N=170$ to the neutron dripline within the framework of axially deformed relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov theory in continuum (DRHBc). The results are compared with those of even-even superheavy nuclei with proton numbers $Z=118$ and $120$. We analyze various bulk properties of their ground states, including binding energies, quadrupole deformations, root-mean-square radii, nucleon separation energies, and $\alpha$-decay energies. The coexistence of competing prolate and oblate or spherical shapes leads to abrupt changes in both quadrupole deformations and charge radii as functions of neutron numbers. Compared to even-even nuclei, the odd-mass ones exhibit a more complicated transition picture, in which the quantum numbers of $K^\pi$ of the lowest-energy configuration may change with deformation. This may result in the change of angular momentum in the ground-state to ground-state $\alpha$-decay and thus quench the decay rate in odd-mass nuclei. Moreover, our results demonstrate a pronounced proton shell gap at $Z=120$, instead of $Z=114$, which is consistent with the predictions of most covariant density functional theories. Moreover, large neutron shell gaps are found at $N=172$ and $N=258$ in the four isotopic chains, as well as at $N=184$ in the light two isotopic chains with $Z=117$ and $Z=118$, attributed to the nearly-degenerate $3d$ and $4p$ spin-orbit doublet states due to the presence of bubble structure.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the $^{14}$C spectrum with Silicon Drift Detectors: towards the study of forbidden $\beta$ transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ASPECT-BET (An sdd-SPECTrometer for BETa decay studies) project aims to develop a novel technique for the precise measurement of forbidden $\beta$ spectra in the 10 keV - 1 MeV range. This technique uses a Silicon Drift Detector (SDD) as the main spectrometer, surrounded, if necessary, by a veto system to reject events with only partial energy deposition in the SDD. Accurate knowledge of the spectrometer's response to electrons is essential to reconstruct the theoretical shape of the $\beta$ spectrum. To compute this response, GEANT4 simulations optimized for low-energy electron interactions are used. In this article, we present the performance of these simulations in reconstructing the electron spectra, measured with SDDs, of a $^{109}$Cd monochromatic source, both in vacuum and in air. The allowed $\beta$ spectrum of a $^{14}$C source is also measured and analyzed, and it is shown that the experimental shape factor commonly used in the literature to reconstruct the measured spectrum is not necessary to explain the spectrum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The brief history for the prediction of the nuclear chirality is provided. The theoretical and experimental investigations of the nuclear chirality are reviewed, including the verification of chiral doublet bands, the chiral conundrum and its resolution, and the prediction and observation of the multiple chiral doublets (M$\chi$D). Some recent theoretical progresses are highlighted, including the chiral collective Hamiltonian, the A-plot and the K-plot, the nuclear chirality-parity (ChP) violation, the chiral rotation induced by the pairing correlations, as well as the chiral dynamics. The possibly emerging area, challenges that lie ahead, and opportunities for progress in the context of the nuclear chirality are discussed.</description>

      <title>A study of the nuclear structure of light nuclei at the Electron-Ion Collider</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The substructure of atomic nuclei resulting from the clustering of nucleons is crucial for understanding nuclear structure and dynamics. Various cluster configurations can emerge depending on excitation energy, the number and types of core clusters, and the presence of excess neutrons. Despite the prevalence of tightly bound cluster formations in low-lying states, understanding the correlation between clusters and their formation mechanisms remains incomplete. This exploring study investigates nuclear clustering at the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) using simulations based on the modified BeAGLE model. By simulating collisions involving $e$+$^{9}$Be, $e$+$^{12}$C, and $e$+$^{16}$O nuclei, we find that the average energy of particles $\langle E \rangle$ and the system size ratios of particles at forward rapidity exhibit sensitivity to alpha clustering and its various configurations. These findings offer valuable insights into the dynamics of nuclear clustering and its implications for future studies at the EIC.</description>

      <title>New insights on fission of 235U induced by high energy neutrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11711v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $^{235}$U(n,f) reaction cross section was measured relative to neutron-proton elastic scattering for the first time in the energy region from 10 MeV to 440 MeV at the CERN n\_TOF facility, extending the upper limit of the only previous measurement in the literature by more than 200 MeV. Two independent detection systems were used simultaneously to extract the fission cross section. For neutron energies below 200 MeV, the present results agree within one standard deviation with the data available in literature and are well reproduced by the IAEA evaluation. Above 200 MeV, the comparison of model calculations to the present data indicates the need to introduce a transient time in the description of the neutron-induced fission process in order to allow the simultaneous description of (n,f) and (p,f) reactions.</description>

      <title>Production of $p$-nuclei from $r$-process seeds: the $\nu r$-process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.11050v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new nucleosynthesis process that may take place on neutron-rich ejecta experiencing an intensive neutrino flux. The nucleosynthesis proceeds similarly to the standard $r$-process, a sequence of neutron-captures and beta-decays, however with charged-current neutrino absorption reactions on nuclei operating much faster than beta-decays. Once neutron capture reactions freeze-out the produced $r$-process neutron-rich nuclei undergo a fast conversion of neutrons into protons and are pushed even beyond the $\beta$-stability line producing the neutron-deficient $p$-nuclei. This scenario, which we denote as the $\nu r$-process, provides an alternative channel for the production of $p$-nuclei and the short-lived nucleus $^{92}$Nb. We discuss the necessary conditions posed on the astrophysical site for the $\nu r$-process to be realized in nature. While these conditions are not fulfilled by current neutrino-hydrodynamic models of $r$-process sites, future models, including more complex physics and a larger variety of outflow conditions, may achieve the necessary conditions in some regions of the ejecta.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.15508v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of a critical end point (CEP) on the experimentally accessible baryon number fluctuations of different orders. By now, its potential location has been constrained fairly accurately within first principles functional QCD, together with the location of the chiral crossover line and further thermodynamic observables. This information is incorporated in an advanced QCD-assisted low energy effective theory which is used for the computation of baryon number fluctuations at the chemical freeze-out. This computation also takes care of global baryon number conservation at larger density, where the system changes from grand-canonical to canonical statistics. We observe a prominent peak structure, whose amplitude depends on the location of the CEP, while its position is more sensitive to the location of the freeze-out curve. Our results provide guidance for future low energy heavy-ion experiments.</description>
