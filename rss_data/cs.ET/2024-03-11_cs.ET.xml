      <title>Paving the Way for Pass Disturb Free Vertical NAND Storage via A Dedicated and String-Compatible Pass Gate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a dual-port cell design to address the pass disturb in vertical NAND storage, which can pass signals through a dedicated and string-compatible pass gate. We demonstrate that: i) the pass disturb-free feature originates from weakening of the depolarization field by the pass bias at the high-${V}_{TH}$ (HVT) state and the screening of the applied field by channel at the low-${V}_{TH}$ (LVT) state; ii) combined simulations and experimental demonstrations of dual-port design verify the disturb-free operation in a NAND string, overcoming a key challenge in single-port designs; iii) the proposed design can be incorporated in a highly scaled vertical NAND FeFET string and the pass gate can be incorporated into the existing 3D NAND with the negligible overhead of the pass gate interconnection through a global bottom pass gate contact in the substrate.</description>

      <title>User Connection and Resource Allocation Optimization in Blockchain Empowered Metaverse over 6G Wireless Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The convergence of blockchain, Metaverse, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) brings transformative digital opportunities alongside challenges like privacy and resource management. Addressing these, we focus on optimizing user connectivity and resource allocation in an NFT-centric and blockchain-enabled Metaverse in this paper. Through user work-offloading, we optimize data tasks, user connection parameters, and server computing frequency division. In the resource allocation phase, we optimize communication-computation resource distributions, including bandwidth, transmit power, and computing frequency. We introduce the trust-cost ratio (TCR), a pivotal measure combining trust scores from users' resources and server history with delay and energy costs. This balance ensures sustained user engagement and trust. The DASHF algorithm, central to our approach, encapsulates the Dinkelbach algorithm, alternating optimization, semidefinite relaxation (SDR), the Hungarian method, and a novel fractional programming technique from a recent IEEE JSAC paper [2]. The most challenging part of DASHF is to rewrite an optimization problem as Quadratically Constrained Quadratic Programming (QCQP) via carefully designed transformations, in order to be solved by SDR and the Hungarian algorithm. Extensive simulations validate the DASHF algorithm's efficacy, revealing critical insights for enhancing blockchain-Metaverse applications, especially with NFTs.</description>

      <title>Enabling Developers, Protecting Users: Investigating Harassment and Safety in VR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Virtual Reality (VR) has witnessed a rising issue of harassment, prompting the integration of safety controls like muting and blocking in VR applications. However, the lack of standardized safety measures across VR applications hinders their universal effectiveness, especially across contexts like socializing, gaming, and streaming. While prior research has studied safety controls in social VR applications, our user study (n = 27) takes a multi-perspective approach, examining both users' perceptions of safety control usability and effectiveness as well as the challenges that developers face in designing and deploying VR safety controls. We identify challenges VR users face while employing safety controls, such as finding users in crowded virtual spaces to block them. VR users also find controls ineffective in addressing harassment; for instance, they fail to eliminate the harassers' presence from the environment. Further, VR users find the current methods of submitting evidence for reports time-consuming and cumbersome. Improvements desired by users include live moderation and behavior tracking across VR apps; however, developers cite technological, financial, and legal obstacles to implementing such solutions, often due to a lack of awareness and high development costs. We emphasize the importance of establishing technical and legal guidelines to enhance user safety in virtual environments.</description>

      <title>Probing Quantum Telecloning on Superconducting Quantum Processors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.15579v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum information can not be perfectly cloned, but approximate copies of quantum information can be generated. Quantum telecloning combines approximate quantum cloning, more typically referred as quantum cloning, and quantum teleportation. Quantum telecloning allows approximate copies of quantum information to be constructed by separate parties, using the classical results of a Bell measurement made on a prepared quantum telecloning state. Quantum telecloning can be implemented as a circuit on quantum computers using a classical co-processor to compute classical feed forward instructions using if statements based on the results of a mid-circuit Bell measurement in real time. We present universal, symmetric, optimal $1 \rightarrow M$ telecloning circuits, and experimentally demonstrate these quantum telecloning circuits for $M=2$ up to $M=10$, natively executed with real time classical control systems on IBM Quantum superconducting processors, known as dynamic circuits. We perform the cloning procedure on many different message states across the Bloch sphere, on $7$ IBM Quantum processors, optionally using the error suppression technique X-X sequence digital dynamical decoupling. Two circuit optimizations are utilized, one which removes ancilla qubits for $M=2, 3$, and one which reduces the total number of gates in the circuit but still uses ancilla qubits. Parallel single qubit tomography with MLE density matrix reconstruction is used in order to compute the mixed state density matrices of the clone qubits, and clone quality is measured using quantum fidelity. These results present one of the largest and most comprehensive NISQ computer experimental analyses on (single qubit) quantum telecloning to date. The clone fidelity sharply decreases to $0.5$ for $M &gt; 5$, but for $M=2$ we are able to achieve a mean clone fidelity of up to $0.79$ using dynamical decoupling.</description>
