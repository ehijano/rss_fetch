      <title>Electronic density of states as the descriptor of elastic bond strength, ductility, and local lattice distortion in BCC refractory alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although electronic density of states (DOS) is fundamental to materials properties, its general relationship to mechanical properties of alloys is not well established. In this paper, using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we show that the electronic occupancy at the Fermi level, N(Ef), obtained from DOS is a key descriptor of alloy strength and ductility. Our comprehensive analysis of numerous body centered cubic (BCC) refractory high entropy alloys (RHEAs) shows an overwhelming correlation that low N(Ef) indicates strong bonds that have high stiffness resulting in high elastic constants. High bond stiffness indicates presence of covalent nature of bonds that are directional in nature resulting in resistance to deformation leading to high bulk (B) and shear (G) moduli. Consequently, N(Ef) provides a direct correlation to the tendency of alloy ductility evidenced in the Pugh ratio (G/B). As stiffer bonds result in lower local lattice distortion (LLD), N(Ef) are LLD are also found to be corelated which opens up a correlation to solid solution strengthening and yield strength. Thus, this work unveils fundamental correlations between N(Ef) and (1) elastic bond strength, (2) ductility, and (3) LLD. These correlations open opportunities for the design of high strength high ductile RHEAs.</description>

      <title>Unconventional temperature evolution of quantum oscillations in Sn-doped Bi$_{1.1}$Sb$_{0.9}$Te$_{2}$S topological insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Among various topological insulators, Sn-doped Bi$_{1.1}$Sb$_{0.9}$Te$_{2}$S stands out for its exceptional properties. It has a wide energy gap and typically exhibits a well-isolated Dirac point and a Fermi level positioned within the gap. The samples we present display metallic-like low-temperature resistivity attributed to surface states, pronounced quantum oscillations observable even at 40 K, and a Fermi level located approximately 100 meV above the Dirac point. In this work, we report an unusual effect: a strong temperature dependence of the quantum oscillation frequency, which decreases by around 10\% between 2 and 40 K. This reduction significantly exceeds the expected effects of the Sommerfeld and topological corrections for Dirac quasi-particles, which could account for only one-eighth of the observed change. We attribute this change to the temperature-induced renormalization of the bulk band gap size due to electron-phonon interactions, which in turn affect the position of the surface Dirac point within the gap. Furthermore, we propose that in this compound, surface quantum oscillations can serve as a precise tool for investigating the low-temperature evolution of the bulk band gap size.</description>

      <title>Unusual magnetic and transport properties in the Zintl phase Eu$_{11}$Zn$_6$As$_{12}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Narrow-gap rare-earth Zintl phases frequently exhibit fascinating physical phenomena due to their various crystal structures, complex magnetic properties, and tunable transport behaviors. Here we report the synthesis, magnetic, thermodynamic, and transport properties of a Eu-containing Zintl arsenide, Eu$_{11}$Zn$_6$As$_{12}$, which consists of infinite chains of Eu cations and anionic frameworks constructed from corner-sharing ZnAs$_4$ tetrahedra. Eu$_{11}$Zn$_6$As$_{12}$ exhibits complicated magnetic behavior owing to intricate exchange interactions mediated by the discrete anionic fragments. Two long-range magnetic transitions at 22 K ($T_\mathrm{N}$) and 9 K ($T^*$), as well as exceptionally strong ferromagnetic fluctuations around 29 K ($T_\mathrm{F}$), are indicated by the susceptibility, heat capacity and resistivity measurements. Besides, Eu$_{11}$Zn$_6$As$_{12}$ displays metallic behavior, attributable to the hole carriers doped by slight Eu vacancies or the mixed valence of Eu$^{2+}$ and Eu$^{3+}$. A prominent resistivity peak occurs around $T_\mathrm{N}$, which is rapidly suppressed by the applied field, leading to a prominent negative magnetoresistance effect. A resistivity hysteresis is observed below 5 K, caused by a small net ferromagnetic component. Our study presents the distinct magnetic and transport properties of Eu$_{11}$Zn$_6$As$_{12}$, and further experiments are required to elucidate the origin of these novel behaviors. Moreover, our findings demonstrate that Eu-based Zintl phases are a fertile ground to study the interplay between magnetism and charge transport.</description>

      <title>Tuning magnetic anisotropy in Fe$_{5}$GeTe$_{2}$ monolayer through doping and strain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling magnetic anisotropy energy (MAE) in two-dimensional (2D) ferromagnetic materials is crucial for designing novel spintronic devices. Using first-principles calculations, we systematically investigate the magnetic properties of monolayer Fe$_5$GeTe$_2$ (F5GT) under two scenarios: (I) Co and Ni doping, and (II) compressive and tensile strains. Our results show that the F5GT monolayer exhibits a weak in-plane MAE, which can be significantly enhanced by Co doping. Additionally, a $1\%$ compressive strain switches the magnetic easy axis from in-plane to out-of-plane, while $4\%$ compressive strain can further enhance the out-of-plane MAE. Spin-orbit coupling (SOC) matrix analysis reveals that the enhancement of in-plane MAE in Co-doped F5GT (Co-F5GT) arises from changes in $ \left\langle {\it p}_{x} \left\vert L_z\right\vert {\it p}_{y} \right\rangle $ of Te and $ \left\langle {\it d}_{xy} \left\vert L_z\right\vert {\it d}_{x^2+y^2} \right\rangle $ of Fe(2) and Fe(3). The effect of compressive strain is primarily attributed to a substantial increase in the positive contribution from $ \left\langle {\it d}_{xy} \left\vert L_z\right\vert {\it d}_{x^2+y^2} \right\rangle $ of Fe(1).</description>

      <title>Designing for Cooperative Grain Boundary Segregation in Multicomponent Alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tailoring the nanoscale distribution of chemical species at grain boundaries is a powerful method to dramatically influence the properties of polycrystalline materials. However, classical approaches to the problem have tacitly assumed that only competition is possible between solute species. In this paper, we show that solute elements can cooperate in the way they segregate to grain boundaries: in properly targeted alloys, the different chemical species cooperate to each fill complementary grain boundary sites disfavored by the other. By developing a theoretical "spectral" approach to this problem based on quantum-accurate grain boundary site distributions, we show how grain boundaries can be cooperatively alloyed, whether by depletion or enrichment. We provide machine-learned co-segregation information for over 700 ternary aluminum-based alloys, and experimentally validate the concept in one ternary alloy where co-segregation is not expected by prior models, but is expected based on the cooperative model.</description>

      <title>Unconventional and Powerful Ion Sources for Solid-State Ion Exchange, Cu2SO4 and Cu3PO4: Exemplified by Synthesis of Metastable \beta-CuGaO2 from Stable \beta-LiGaO2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces a new method for synthesizing Cu+-containing metastable phases through ion exchange. Traditionally, CuCl has been used as a Cu+ ion source for solid-state ion exchanges; however, its thermodynamic driving force is often insufficient for complete ion exchange with Li+-containing precursors. First-principles calculations have identified Cu2SO4 and Cu3PO4 as more powerful alternatives, providing a higher driving force than CuCl. It has been experimentally demon-strated that these ion sources can open up new reaction pathways through experimental ion exchanges, such as from \beta-LiGaO2 to \beta-CuGaO2, which were previously unattainable. An important perspective provided by this study is that the poten-tial of such basic compounds to act as powerful ion sources has been overlooked, and that they were identified through straightforward first-principles calculations. This work presents the initial strategic design of an ion exchange reaction by exploring suitable ion sources, thereby expanding the potential for synthesizing metastable materials.</description>

      <title>Vacancy-Induced Quantum Properties in 2D Silicon Carbide: Atomistic insights from semi-local and hybrid DFT calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials have emerged as promising platforms for quantum technologies and optoelectronics, with defects playing a crucial role in their properties. We present a comprehensive density functional theory study of silicon and carbon vacancies in monolayer silicon carbide (1L-SiC), a wide-bandgap 2D semiconductor with potential for room-temperature quantum applications. Using PBE, SCAN, r$^2$SCAN, and HSE06 functionals, we reveal distinct characteristics between Si and C vacancies. Formation energies and charge transition levels show strong functional dependence, with HSE06 consistently predicting higher values and deeper transition levels compared to PBE calculations. Electronic structure analysis demonstrates contrasting behavior: silicon vacancies create highly localized states with strong spin polarization, while carbon vacancies produce more dispersed states with weaker magnetic properties. Vacancy migration studies reveal significantly lower barriers for silicon vacancies compared to carbon vacancies, indicating higher mobility for Si vacancies at moderate temperatures. Optical properties, calculated using PBE-DFPT, show distinct charge-state dependent absorption in the far-infrared region, with positively charged states of both vacancy types demonstrating the strongest response. The complementary characteristics of Si and C vacancies - localized versus dispersed states, different magnetic properties, and distinct optical responses - suggest possibilities for defect engineering in quantum and optoelectronic applications. Our results highlight the critical importance of advanced functionals in accurately describing defect properties and provide a comprehensive framework for understanding vacancy behavior in 2D materials.</description>

      <title>2D versus 3D-like electrical behavior of MXene thin films: insights from weak localization in the role of thickness, interflake coupling and defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MXenes stand out from other 2D materials because they combine very good electrical conductivity with hydrophilicity, allowing cost-effective processing as thin films. Therefore, there is a high fundamental interest in unraveling the electronic transport mechanisms at stake in multilayers of the most conducting MXene, Ti$_3$C$_2$T$_x$. Although weak localization (WL) has been proposed as the dominating low-temperature (LT) transport mechanism in Ti$_3$C$_2$T$_x$ thin films, there have been few attempts to model it quantitatively. In this paper, the role of important structural parameters -- thickness, interflake coupling, defects -- on the dimensionality of the LT transport mechanisms in spin-coated Ti$_3$C$_2$T$_x$ thin films is investigated through LT and magnetic field dependent resistivity measurements. A dimensional crossover from 2D to 3D WL is clearly evidenced when the film thickness exceeds the dephasing length $l_\phi$, which is in the $50-100\,\mathrm{nm}$ range. 2D WL can be restored by weakening the coupling between adjacent flakes, the intrinsic thickness of which is lower than $l_\phi$, hence acting as parallel 2D conductors. Alternatively, $l_\phi$ can be reduced down to the $10\,\mathrm{nm}$ range by defects. Our results clearly emphasize the ability of WL quantitative study to give deep insights in the physics of electron transport in MXene thin films.</description>

      <title>Composition-property extrapolation for compositionally complex solid solutions based on word embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mastering the challenge of predicting properties of unknown materials with multiple principal elements (high entropy alloys/compositionally complex solid solutions) is crucial for the speedup in materials discovery. We show and discuss three models, using property data from two ternary systems (Ag-Pd-Ru; Ag-Pd-Pt), to predict material performance in the shared quaternary system (Ag-Pd-Pt-Ru). First, we apply Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) based on composition, which includes both Ag and Pd, achieving an initial correlation coefficient for the prediction ($r$) of 0.63 and a determination coefficient ($r^2$) of 0.08. Second, we present a version of the GPR model using word embedding-derived materials vectors as representations. Using materials-specific embedding vectors significantly improves the predictive capability, evident from an improved $r^2$ of 0.65. The third model is based on a `standard vector method' which synthesizes weighted vector representations of material properties, then creating a reference vector that results in a very good correlation with the quaternary system's material performance (resulting $r$ of 0.89). Our approach demonstrates that existing experimental data combined with latent knowledge of word embedding-based representations of materials can be used effectively for materials discovery where data is typically sparse.</description>

      <title>Gentle tension stabilizes atomically thin metallenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metallenes are atomically thin two-dimensional (2D) materials lacking a layered structure in the bulk form. They can be stabilized by nanoscale constrictions like pores in 2D covalent templates, but the isotropic metallic bonding makes stabilization difficult. A few metallenes have been stabilized but comparison with theory predictions has not always been clear. Here, we use density-functional theory calculations to explore the energetics and dynamic stabilities of $45$ metallenes at six lattices (honeycomb, square, hexagonal, and their buckled counterparts) and varying atomic densities. We found that of the $270$ different crystalline lattices, 128 were dynamically stable at sporadic densities, mostly under tensile strain. At the energy minima, lattices were often dynamically unstable against amorphization and the breaking down of metallene planarity. Consequently, the results imply that crystalline metallenes should be seen through a novel paradigm: they should be considered not as membranes with fixed structures and lattice constants but as yielding membranes that can be stabilized better under tensile strain and low atomic density. Following this paradigm, we rank the most promising metallenes for 2D stability and hope that the paradigm will help develop new strategies to synthesize larger and more stable metallene samples for plasmonic, optical, and catalytic applications.</description>

      <title>Stability of the first-order character of phase transition in HoCo$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: HoCo$_2$ exhibits a giant magnetocaloric (MC) effect at its first-order magnetostructural phase transition around 77~K, and understanding the thermodynamic nature of this transition in response to external magnetic fields is crucial for its MC applications. In this study, we present a comprehensive investigation of specific heat and magnetization measurements of HoCo$_2$ under varying magnetic fields. The specific heat measurements qualitatively indicate a transformation from first- to second-order behavior of this phase transition at higher magnetic fields. However, analysis of the power-law dependence of the magnetic entropy change ($\Delta S_{\rm M} \propto$ H$^n$) and the breakdown of universal behavior in the temperature dependence of $\Delta S_{\rm M}$ suggest that the first-order nature remains intact, even up to 7 T. This stability of the first-order nature is further manifested through the distinctive non-linear behavior of modified Arrott plots, with a negative slope in the 6--7 T range.</description>

      <title>Piezovalley effect and magnetovalley coupling in altermagnetic semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05518v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clarifying the physical origin of valley polarization and exploring promising ferrovalley materials are conducive to the application of valley degrees of freedom in the field of information storage. Here, we explore two novel altermagnetic semiconductors (monolayers Nb2Se2O and Nb2SeTeO) with N\'eel temperature above room temperature based on first-principles calculations. It reveals that uniaxial strain induces valley polarization without spin-orbital coupling (SOC) in altermagnets owing to the piezovalley effect, while uniaxial compressive strain transforms the intrinsic ferrovalley semiconductor into a semimetal, half metal and metal. Moreover, moderate biaxial strain renders Janus monolayer Nb2SeTeO to robust Dirac-like band dispersion. The SOC and intrinsic in-plane magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy induce Dirac-like altermagnets to generate apparent valley polarization through magnetovalley coupling. In terms of SOC perturbation, we elucidate the physical mechanism behind in-plane-magnetization induced valley polarization and demonstrate the magnitude of valley polarization is positively correlated with the square of SOC strength and negatively correlated with the bandgap. The present work reveals the physical origin of valley polarization in altermagnets and expands the application of ferrovalley at room temperature in valleytronics.</description>

      <title>Shear Deformation of Nonmodulated Ni$_2$MnGa Martensite: An Ab Initio Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The impact of shear deformation in $(1\,0\,1)[1\,0\,\bar{1}]$ system of non-modulated (NM) martensite in Ni$_2$MnGa ferromagnetic shape memory alloy is investigated by means of ab initio atomistic simulations. The shear system is associated with twinning of NM lattice and intermatensitic transformation to modulated structures. The stability of the NM lattice increases with increasing content of Mn. The most realistic shear mechanism for twin reorientation can be approximated by the simple shear mechanism, although the lowest barriers were calculated for pure shear mechanism. The energy barrier between twin variants further reduces due to spontaneous appearance of lattice modulation or, in other words, the nanotwins with thickness of two atomic planes. Such nanotwins appear also on the generalized planar fault energy (GPFE) curve calculated using a newly developed advanced procedure and exhibits even lower energy than the defect free NM structure. These nanotwin doublelayers are also basic building blocks of modulated structures and play an important role in intermartensitic transformation.</description>

      <title>Bayesian exploration of the composition space of CuZrAl metallic glasses for mechanical properties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing metallic glasses in silico is a major challenge in materials science given their disordered atomic structure and the vast compositional space to explore. Here, we tackle this challenge by finding optimal compositions for target mechanical properties. We apply Bayesian exploration for the CuZrAl composition, a paradigmatic metallic glass known for its good glass forming ability. We exploit an automated loop with an online database, a Bayesian optimization algorithm, and molecular dynamics simulations. From the ubiquitous 50/50 CuZr starting point, we map the composition landscape changing the ratio of elements and adding aluminium to characterize the yield stress and the shear modulus. This approach demonstrates with relatively modest effort that the system has an optimal composition window for the yield stress around aluminium concentration $c_{\rm Al} = 15$ \% and zirconium concentration $c_{\rm Zr} = 30$ %. We also explore several cooling rates ("process parameters") and find that the best mechanical properties for a composition result from being most affected by the cooling procedure. Our Bayesian approach paves the novel way for the design of metallic glasses with "small data", with an eye toward both future in silico design and experimental applications exploiting this toolbox.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photoelectron diffraction (PED) is a powerful spectroscopic technique that combines elemental resolution with a high sensitivity to the local atomic arrangement at crystal surfaces, thus providing unique fingerprints of selected atomic sites in matter. Stimulated by the rapid innovation in the development of various analysis methods for probing the atomic and electronic structures of van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures of two-dimensional materials, we present a theoretical assessment of the capacity of PED for extracting structural properties such as stacking, twist angles and interlayer distances. We provide a complete description of PED for the benchmark vdW heterostructure bilayer graphene (BLG), by calculating and analyzing the PED of BLG in Bernal and AA-stacking as well as twisted BLG for a wide range of the twist angle.</description>

      <title>Realizing Intrinsically Glass-like Thermal Transport via Weakening the Ag-Ag Bonds in Ag$_{6}$ Octahedra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crystals exhibiting glass-like and low lattice thermal conductivity ($\kappa_{\rm L}$) are not only scientifically intriguing but also practically valuable in various applications, including thermal barrier coatings, thermoelectric energy conversion, and thermal management. However, such unusual $\kappa_{\rm L}$ are typically observed only in compounds containing heavy elements, with large unit cells, or at high temperatures, primarily due to significant anharmonicity. In this study, we utilize chemical bonding principles to weaken the Ag-Ag bonds within the Ag$_6$ octahedron by introducing a ligand in the bridge position. Additionally, the weak Ag-chalcogen bonds, arising from fully filled $p$-$d$ antibonding orbitals, provide an avenue to further enhance lattice anharmonicity. We propose the incorporation of a chalcogen anion as a bridge ligand to promote phonon rattling in Ag$_6$-octahedron-based compounds. Guided by this design strategy, we theoretically identified five Ag$_6$ octahedron-based compounds, $A$Ag$_3X_2$ ($A$ = Li, Na, and K; $X$ = S and Se), which are characterized by low average atomic masses and exhibit exceptionally strong four-phonon scattering. Consequently, these compounds demonstrate ultralow thermal conductivities (0.3 $\sim$ 0.6 Wm$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$) with minimal temperature dependence (T$^{-0.1}$) across a wide temperature range. Experimental validation confirmed that the $\kappa_{\rm L}$ of NaAg$_3$S$_2$ is 0.45 Wm$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$ within the temperature range of 200 to 550 K. Our results clearly demonstrate that weak chemical bonding plays a crucial role in designing compounds with glass-like $\kappa_{\rm L}$, highlighting the effectiveness of chemical bonding engineering in achieving desired thermal transport properties.</description>

      <title>How grain structure evolution affects kinetics of a solid-state reaction: a case of interaction between iridium and zirconium carbide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the solid-state reaction between iridium and zirconium carbide, resulting in the formation of carbon and $\mathrm{ZrIr}_{3}$ -- an intermetallic compound of great interest for modern high-temperature materials science. We have found a transition of kinetic regimes in this reaction: from linear kinetics (when the chemical reaction is a limiting stage) at 1500 and 1550{\deg}C to `non-parabolic kinetics' at 1600{\deg}C. Non-parabolic kinetics is characterized by thickness of a product layer being proportional to a power of time less than 1/2. The nature of non-parabolic kinetics was still an open question, which motivated us to develop a model of this kinetic regime. The proposed model accounts for the grain growth in the product phase and how it leads to the time dependence of the interdiffusion coefficient. We have obtained a complete analytic solution for this model and an equation that connects the grain-growth exponent and the power-law exponent of non-parabolic kinetics. The measurements of the thickness of the product layer and the average grain size of the intermetallic phase confirm the results of the theoretical solution.</description>

      <title>A Novel Liquid-Liquid Interface Deposition Method for the Production of Thin Films and van der Waals Heterostructures of Two-Dimensional Solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thin films and van der Waals heterostructures derived from two-dimensional solids offer enormous potential for a broad range of novel, energy efficient devices, however, their use is currently hampered by slow, labor-intensive fabrication methods often employing hazardous chemicals. We demonstrate a novel technique for rapid, low-cost and environmentally-friendly production of ultra-thin films and van der Waals heterostructures of two-dimensional solids from aqueous surfactant-stabilized suspensions, which we term `Liquid Interface Deposition'. Films are produced by the transfer of platelets of two-dimensional materials assembled at the interface between two immiscible liquids (water and dicholoromethane), at which surfactants which stabilize the two-dimensional materials in the aqueous phase are `stripped' from the platelets due to preferential partitioning of the surfactant to the non-aqeuous phase. The approach is generic to two-dimensional materials which can be stabilized in aqueous suspension by a surfactant and the resulting films can then be transferred to an arbitrary substrate by a range of approaches. The generic applicability of this technique is demonstrated through production of thin films on a variety of substrates, deposition of transparent, highly conductive, graphene films with conductivities between $7.7 \times 10^{3} - 1.26\times 10^{5}~\textrm{S m}^{-1}$ and transmittances of 55-75%, and by the fabrication of van der Waals heterostructures of MoS$_2$, WS$_2$, and few-layer graphene.</description>

      <title>Model for Diffusion Limited Crystal Growth with and without Growth Rate Dispersion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show, in this report, how a population balance model differential equation describing batch crystal growth from solution can be solved in closed form for the case of diffusion limited growth with and without modeling the effects of growth rate dispersion. By letting the growth rate diffusivity be directly proportional to the supersaturation, a closed form solution can be found for the case of a separable distribution function of crystal sizes. This result requires that the ratio of the solute diffusion coefficient to the growth rate diffusivity coefficient, be restricted to odd integer values. This implies that when growth rate dispersion is present, varying the conditions of the solution can only lead to one or more equilibrium size distributions out of an infinite discrete set of possible size distribution functions. We deal with this restriction by letting the growth rate diffusivity coefficient be restricted to a spectrum of discrete values. Results are compared with experimental data for two cases of lactose crystal growth from solution, and one for sucrose, where it was suggested that there are two distinct types of kinetic behavior in the growing crystal ensemble; one of slow growing crystals and the other fast growing. Our model is able to describe the equilibrium distribution of these crystals as being composed of a combination of two size distribution functions, each with its own uniquely valued growth rate diffusivity coefficient.</description>

      <title>Experimental Investigation of Variations in Polycrystalline Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 (HZO)-based MFIM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Device-to-device variations in ferroelectric (FE) hafnium oxide-based devices pose a crucial challenge that limits the otherwise promising capabilities of this technology. Earlier simulation-based studies have identified polarization (P) domain nucleation and polycrystallinity as key contributors to these variations. In this work, we experimentally investigate the effect of these two factors on remanent polarization (PR) variation in Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 (HZO) based metal-ferroelectric-insulator-metal (MFIM) capacitors for different set voltages (VSET) and FE thicknesses (TFE). Our measurements reveal a non-monotonic behavior of PR variations with VSET, which is consistent with previous simulation-based predictions. For low and high-VSET regions, we find that PR variations are dictated primarily by saturation polarization (PS) variations and are associated with the polycrystallinity in HZO. Our measurements also reveal that PR variations peak near the coercive voltage (VC), defined as the mid-VSET region. We attribute the increase of PR variation around VC to the random nature and sharp P switching associated with domain nucleation, which is dominant near VC. Further, we observe a reduction in the peak PR variation as HZO thickness (TFE) is scaled. We validate our arguments by establishing the correlation between the measured values of PR with VC and PS. Our results display that a strong correlation exists between PR and VC in the mid-VSET region and between PR and PS in the low and high-VSET regions across various TFE.</description>

      <title>Effects of doping on polar order in SrTiO$_{3}$ from first-principles modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: SrTiO$_{3}$ is an incipient ferroelectric and an exceptionally dilute superconductor with a dome-like dependence on carrier concentration. Stabilization of a polar phase through chemical substitution or strain significantly enhances the superconducting critical temperature, suggesting a possible connection between the polar instability and unconventional Cooper pairing. To investigate the effects of doping on the polar order in SrTiO$_{3}$, we develop a simplified free energy model which includes only the degrees of freedom necessary to capture the relevant physics of a doped, biaxially compressively strained system. We simulate the polar and antiferrodistortive thermal phase transitions using Monte Carlo methods for different doping levels and comment on the doping dependence of the transition temperatures and the formation of polar nanodomains. In addition, the temperature-dependent phonon spectral function is calculated using Langevin simulations to investigate the lattice dynamics of the doped system. We also examine the effects of doping on the electronic structure within the polar phase, including the density of states and band splitting. Finally, we compute the polarization dependence of the Rashba parameter and the doping dependence of the Midgal ratio, and place our results in the broader context of proposed pairing mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Quantum magnetometry of transient signals with a time resolution of 1.1 nanoseconds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum magnetometers based on spin defects in solids enable sensitive imaging of various magnetic phenomena, such as ferro- and antiferromagnetism, superconductivity, and current-induced fields. Existing protocols primarily focus on static fields or narrow-band dynamical signals, and are optimized for high sensitivity rather than fast time resolution. Here, we report detection of fast signal transients, providing a perspective for investigating the rich dynamics of magnetic systems. We experimentally demonstrate our technique using a single nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center magnetometer at room temperature, reaching a best-effort time resolution of 1.1 ns, an instantaneous bandwidth of 0.9 GHz, and a time-of-flight precision better than 20 ps. The time resolution can be extended to the picosecond range by use of on-chip waveguides. At these speeds, NV quantum magnetometers will become competitive with time-resolved synchrotron X-ray techniques. Looking forward, adding fast temporal resolution to the spatial imaging capability further promotes single-spin probes as powerful research tools in spintronics, mesoscopic physics, and nanoscale device metrology.</description>

      <title>Magnetic structure and crystal field states of antiferromagnetic CeNiGe$_3$: Neutron scattering and $\mu$SR investigations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the results of microscopic investigations of antiferromagnetic CeNiGe$_3$, using neutron powder diffraction (NPD), inelastic neutron scattering (INS), and muon spin relaxation ($\mu$SR) measurements. CeNiGe$_3$ crystallizes in a centrosymmetric orthorhombic crystal structure (space group: $Cmmm$) and undergoes antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering. The occurrence of long-range AFM ordering at $T_{\rm N} \approx 5.2$~K is confirmed by magnetic susceptibility, heat capacity, neutron diffraction, and $\mu$SR measurements. The NPD data characterize the AFM state with an incommensurate helical magnetic structure having a propagation vector $k$ = (0, 0.41, 1/2). In addition, INS measurements at 10~K identified two crystal electric field (CEF) excitations at 9.17~meV and 18.42~meV. We analyzed the INS data using a CEF model for an orthorhombic environment of Ce$^{3+}$ ($J=5/2$) and determined the CEF parameters and ground state wavefunctions of CeNiGe$_3$. Moreover, zero-field $\mu$SR data for CeNiGe$_3$ at $T&lt; T_{\rm N}$ show long-range AFM ordering with three distinct oscillation frequencies corresponding to three different internal fields at the muon sites. The internal fields at the muon-stopping sites have been further investigated using density functional theory calculations.</description>

      <title>Giant spin Hall effect with multi-directional spin components in Ni4W</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin-orbit torque (SOT) can be used to efficiently manipulate the magnetic state of magnetic materials, which is an essential element for memory and logic applications. Due to symmetry constraints, only in-plane spins can be injected into the ferromagnet from the underlying SOT layer for conventional SOT materials such as heavy metals and topological materials. Through the use of materials with low symmetries, or other symmetry breaking approaches, unconventional spin currents with out-of-plane polarization has been demonstrated and enabled field-free deterministic switching of perpendicular magnetization. Despite this progress, the SOT efficiency of these materials has typically remained low. Here, we report a giant SOT efficiency of 0.85 in sputtered Ni4W/CoFeB heterostructure at room temperature, as evaluated by second harmonic Hall measurements. In addition, due to the low crystal symmetry of Ni4W, unconventional out-of-plane and Dresselhaus-like spin components were observed. Macro-spin simulation suggests our spin Hall tensor to provide about an order of magnitude improvement in the magnetization switching efficiency, thus broadening the path towards energy efficient spintronic devices using low-symmetry materials.</description>

      <title>Ising domain wall networks from intertwined charge density waves in single-layer TiSe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When the period of an incommensurate charge density wave (ICDW) approaches an integer multiple of a lattice vector, the energy gain obtained from locking the period to the lattice can lead to a fascinating transition into a commensurate state. This transition actually occurs through an intermediate near-commensurate (NC) phase, with locally commensurate regions separated by an ordered array of phase slips of a complex CDW order parameter. TiSe2 is a paradigmatic CDW system where incommensuration is believed to be induced by carrier doping, yet its putative NC state has never been imaged or its nature established. Here we report the observation of a striking NC state in ultraclean, slightly doped monolayers of TiSe2, displaying an intricate network of coherent, unidirectional CDW domain walls over hundreds of nanometers. Detailed analysis reveals these are not phase slips of a complex CDW, but rather sign-changing Ising-type domain walls of two coupled real CDWs of previously known symmetry, consistent with the period doubling nature of the parent commensurate state. In addition, we observe an unexpected nematic modulation at the original lattice Bragg peaks which couples to the CDW order parameters. A Ginzburg-Landau analysis naturally explains the couplings and relative modulations of all order parameters, unveiling TiSe2 as a rare example of an NC-CDW of two intertwined real modulations and emergent nematicity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12285v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an exact formula for the phonon linewidths involving only dressed electron-phonon couplings and ensuring the positivity property. The formula is designed to account for both nonadiabatic and correlation effects, and it provides an alternative proof that Density Functional Perturbation Theory calculations of phonon linewidths are not affected by a double counting of screening diagrams. Furthermore, we extend the treatment to nonequilibrium scenarios and offer a rigorous justification for employing the phononic Boltzmann equation.</description>

Abstract: Intrinsic spin currents are encountered in noncentrosymmetric crystals without any external electric fields; these currents are caused by spin-orbit interaction. In this paper, various theoretical aspects of this phenomenon in bulk ferromagnets are studied by using group theory, perturbation expansion, and calculations for model and real systems. The group-theoretical analysis of the spin-current tensor shows that the absence of space-inversion symmetry is not a sufficient condition for appearance of the intrinsic spin currents. The perturbation expansion proves that in the regime of exchange splitting dominating over spin-orbit interaction, the spin polarization of the intrinsic currents is nearly perpendicular to the direction of magnetization. First-principles calculations are carried out for NiMnSb and CoMnFeSi ferromagnetic compounds, both featured by a tetrahedral crystallographic point group. The dependence of the spin-current tensor on the direction of magnetization is approximated by a simple quadratic formula containing two constants; the relative error of this approximation is found as small as a few percent for both compounds.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectric Properties of Type-I and Type-II Nodal Line Semimetals: A Comparative Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16644v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the thermoelectric (TE) properties of nodal line semimetals (NLSs) using a combination of semi-analytical calculations within Boltzmann's linear transport theory and the relaxation time approximation, along with first-principles calculations for the so-called type-I and type-II NLSs. We consider the conduction and valence bands that cross near the Fermi level of these materials through first-principles calculations of typical type-I (TiS) and type-II (Mg$_3$Bi$_2$) NLSs and use the two-band model fit to find the Fermi velocity $v_{F}$ and effective mass $m$ that will be employed as the initial energy dispersion parameters. The optimum curvature value for each energy band is searched by tuning both $v_{F}$ and $m$ to improve the TE properties of the NLSs. By systematically comparing all of our calculation results, we observe that tuning $v_{F}$ significantly improves TE properties in both types of NLS compared to tuning $m$. We also find that in all TE metrics, the type-I NLS surprisingly can surpass the type-II NLS, which seems counter-intuitive to the fact that within the two-band model, the type-I NLS contains a parabolic band while the type-II NLS possesses a higher-order, Mexican-hat band. Our study demonstrates that optimizing the curvature of energy bands by tuning $v_F$ can significantly improve the TE performance of NLSs. This approach could guide future efforts in exploring other semimetals as potential TE materials by manipulating their band structures.</description>

      <title>Absence of altermagnetic spin splitting character in rutile oxide RuO$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13504v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rutile RuO$_2$ has been posited as a potential $d$-wave altermagnetism candidate, with a predicted significant spin splitting up to 1.4 eV. Despite accumulating theoretical predictions and transport measurements, direct spectroscopic observation of spin splitting has remained elusive. Here, we employ spin- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to investigate the band structures and spin polarization of thin-film and single-crystal RuO$_2$. Contrary to expectations of altermagnetism, our analysis indicates that RuO$_2$'s electronic structure aligns with those predicted under non-magnetic conditions, exhibiting no evidence of the hypothesized spin splitting. Additionally, we observe significant in-plane spin polarization of the low-lying bulk bands, which is antisymmetric about the high-symmetry plane and contrary to the $d$-wave spin texture due to time-reversal symmetry breaking in altermagnetism. These findings definitively challenge the altermagnetic order previously proposed for rutile RuO$_2$, prompting a reevaluation of its magnetic properties.</description>

      <title>LLM4Mat-Bench: Benchmarking Large Language Models for Materials Property Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00177v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being used in materials science. However, little attention has been given to benchmarking and standardized evaluation for LLM-based materials property prediction, which hinders progress. We present LLM4Mat-Bench, the largest benchmark to date for evaluating the performance of LLMs in predicting the properties of crystalline materials. LLM4Mat-Bench contains about 1.9M crystal structures in total, collected from 10 publicly available materials data sources, and 45 distinct properties. LLM4Mat-Bench features different input modalities: crystal composition, CIF, and crystal text description, with 4.7M, 615.5M, and 3.1B tokens in total for each modality, respectively. We use LLM4Mat-Bench to fine-tune models with different sizes, including LLM-Prop and MatBERT, and provide zero-shot and few-shot prompts to evaluate the property prediction capabilities of LLM-chat-like models, including Llama, Gemma, and Mistral. The results highlight the challenges of general-purpose LLMs in materials science and the need for task-specific predictive models and task-specific instruction-tuned LLMs in materials property prediction.</description>

      <title>Ising and regular solution models revisited for 2D open systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00584v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Ising model is well-known for illustrating the fundamental characteristics of phase transitions in closed systems. In this article, we propose a generalization of the two-dimensional Ising model to open systems, considering the divergence of external fluxes within a mean-field approximation, and explore its application for classifying steady states based on external flux (deposition rate), temperature, and composition. We focus on cases with positive mixing energy, which lead to the typical spinodal and binodal domes at the phase diagram under the regular solution approximation for closed systems. For open systems, we demonstrate that a supercritical external flux divergence stabilizes the system, preventing decomposition. We identify rate-dependent spinodal and binodal domes, as well as a subdivision of the instability region at subcritical rates into three distinct steady-state morphologies: spots (gepard-like), layers (zebra-like), and mixed patterns (a combination of gepard and zebra). This morphology map depends on the initial conditions, demonstrating memory effects and hysteresis.</description>

      <title>Towards Nanoscale and Element-Specific Lattice Temperature Measurements using Core-Loss Electron Energy-Loss Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01071v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Measuring nanoscale local temperatures, particularly in vertically integrated and multi-component systems, remains challenging. Spectroscopic techniques like X-ray absorption and core-loss electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) are sensitive to lattice temperature, but understanding thermal effects is nontrivial. This work explores the potential for nanoscale and element-specific core-loss thermometry by comparing the Si L2,3 edge's temperature-dependent redshift against plasmon energy expansion thermometry (PEET) in a scanning TEM. Using density functional theory (DFT), time-dependent DFT, and the Bethe-Salpeter equation, we ab initio model both the Si L2,3 and plasmon redshift. We find that the core-loss redshift is due to bandgap reduction from electron-phonon renormalization. Our results indicate that despite lower core-loss signal intensity and thus accuracy compared to PEET, core-loss thermometry still has important advantages. Specifically, we show that the Varshni equation easily interprets the core-loss redshift, which avoids plasmon spectral convolution for PEET in complex materials. We also find that core-loss thermometry is more accurate than PEET at modeling thermal lattice expansion unless the temperature-dependent effective mass and dielectric constant are known. Furthermore, core-loss thermometry has the potential to measure nanoscale heating in multi-component materials and stacked interfaces with elemental specificity at length scales smaller than the plasmon's wavefunction.</description>

      <title>Pressure tuning of intrinsic and extrinsic sources to the anomalous Hall effect in CrGeTe$_3$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09539v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The integrated Berry curvature is a geometric property that has dramatic implications for material properties. This study investigates the integrated Berry curvature and other contributions to the anomalous Hall effect in CrGeTe$_3$ as a function of pressure. The anomalous Hall effect is absent in the insulating phase of CrGeTe$_3$ and evolves with pressure in a dome-like fashion as pressure is applied. The dome's edges are characterized by Fermi surface deformations, manifested as mixed electron and hole transport. We corroborate the presence of bipolar transport by ab-initio calculations which also predict a nonmonotonic behavior of the Berry curvature as a function of pressure. Quantitative discrepancies between our calculations and experimental results indicate that additional scattering mechanisms, which are also strongly tuned by pressure, contribute to the anomalous Hall effect in CrGeTe$_3$.</description>

      <title>Origin of the hidden energy scale and the $f$-ratio in geometrically frustrated magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12966v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sufficiently clean geometrically frustrated (GF) magnets are the largest class of candidate materials that may host quantum spin liquids (QSLs). Some of them have been shown to exhibit spin-glass freezing, potentially precluding QSLs, at the "hidden energy scale", which is significantly lower than the microscopic energy scale of spin interactions. Here, we investigate the origin of the hidden energy scale and its relationship to the $f$-ratio, the figure of merit for the degree of frustration in GF magnetic materials. The available experimental and numerical data provide evidence that GF magnets display, universally, two distinct temperature scales in the specific heat, the lowest of which is of the order of the hidden energy scale $T^*$. We argue that this scale is determined by non-magnetic excitations, similar to spin exchanges in chains of spins. The collective entropy of such excitations matches the entropy of the ground states of the Ising model on the same lattice, which provides a way to verify the proposed scenario in experiment. We demonstrate that in the presence of quenched disorder, a broad class of materials exhibits spin-glass freezing at temperatures of order $T^*$, in accordance with experimental observations. As $T^*$ is a property of the clean GF medium, it leads to a constraint on the $f$-ratio.</description>

      <title>Modulation of Magnetic Anisotropy and Spin-Orbit Interaction by Electrical Current in FeCoB Nanomagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08170v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel method for measuring the modulation of magnetic anisotropy and the strength of spin-orbit interaction by an electrical current in nanomagnets. Our systematic study explores the current dependencies of these properties across a variety of nanomagnets with different structures, compositions, and sizes, providing unprecedented insights into the complex physical origins of this effect. We identified two distinct contributions to the observed current modulation: one proportional to the current and the other to the square of the current. The squared-current contribution, originating from the Spin Hall effect, uniquely accumulates strength with an increasing number of interfaces, resulting in exceptionally large current modulation of magnetic anisotropy and spin-orbit interaction in multi-layer nanomagnets. Conversely, the linear-current contribution stems from the Ordinary and Anomalous Hall effects and exhibits opposite polarity at different interfaces, making it significant only in asymmetrical single-layer nanomagnets. The squared-current contribution induces substantial anisotropy field changes, up to 30-50$\%$ at typical MRAM recording currents, leading to thermally-activated magnetization reversal and data recording. The linear-current contribution, while smaller, is effective for parametric magnetization reversal, providing sufficient modulation for efficient data recording through resonance mechanisms. This finding highlights the complex nature of spin accumulation and spin dynamics at the nanoscale, presenting an opportunity for further optimization of data recording in MRAM technology.</description>

Abstract: We present a mesoscale field theory unifying the modeling of growth, elasticity, and dislocations in quasicrystals. The theory is based on the amplitudes entering their density-wave representation. We introduce a free energy functional for complex amplitudes and assume non-conserved dissipative dynamics to describe their evolution. Elasticity, including phononic and phasonic deformations, along with defect nucleation and motion, emerges self-consistently by prescribing only the symmetry of quasicrystals. Predictions on the formation of semi-coherent interfaces and dislocation kinematics are given.</description>

      <title>On-Chip Terahertz Spectroscopy for Dual-Gated van der Waals Heterostructures at Cryogenic Temperatures</title>

Abstract: Van der Waals heterostructures have emerged as a versatile platform to study correlated and topological electron physics. Spectroscopy experiments in the THz regime are crucial, since the energy of THz photons matches that of relevant excitations and charge dynamics. However, their micron-size and complex (dual-)gated structures have challenged such measurements. Here, we demonstrate on-chip THz spectroscopy on a dual-gated bilayer graphene device at liquid helium temperature. To avoid unwanted THz absorption by metallic gates, we developed a scheme of operation by combining semiconducting gates and optically controlled gating. This allows us to measure the clean THz response of graphene without being affected by the gates. We observed the THz signatures of electric-field-induced bandgap opening at the charge neutrality. We measured Drude conductivities at varied charge densities and extracted key parameters, including effective masses and scattering rates. This work paves the way for studying novel emergent phenomena in dual-gated two-dimensional materials.</description>

      <title>Self-Healing in Dielectric Capacitors: a Universal Method to Computationally Rate Newly Introduced Energy Storage Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03721v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Metal-film dielectric capacitors provide lump portions of energy on demand. While the capacities of various capacitor designs are comparable in magnitude, their stabilities make a difference. Dielectric breakdowns - micro-discharges - routinely occur in capacitors due to the inevitable presence of localized structure defects. The application of polymeric dielectric materials featuring flexible structures helps obtain more uniform insulating layers. At the modern technological level, it is impossible to completely avoid micro-discharges upon device exploitation. Every micro-discharge results in the formation of a soot channel, which is empirically known to exhibit semiconductor behavior. Because of its capability to conduct electricity, the emerged soot channels harm the subsequent capacitor performance and decrease the amount of stored energy. The accumulation of the soot throughout a dielectric capacitor ultimately results in irreversible overall failure. In the context of the dielectric breakdown, self-healing designates a range of chemical processes, which spontaneously rearrange the atoms in the soot channels to partially return their insulative function. We developed a universal method capable of rating new capacitor designs including electrode and polymer material and their proportions. We found the best-performing designs produce abundant volatile by-products after micro-discharge, whereas the soot samples exhibit lower electronic conductivities. We proved the capability of the theoretical method to rate the empirical performance of the known capacitors. The method relies on various electronic-structure simulations and potential landscape explorations. The reported advance opens an impressive avenue to computationally probe thousands of hypothetical capacitor designs.</description>
