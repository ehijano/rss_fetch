      <title>Goodness-of-Fit for Conditional Distributions: An Approach Using Principal Component Analysis and Component Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel goodness-of-fit test technique for parametric conditional distributions. The proposed tests are based on a residual marked empirical process, for which we develop a conditional Principal Component Analysis. The obtained components provide a basis for various types of new tests in addition to the omnibus one. Component tests that based on each component serve as experts in detecting certain directions. Smooth tests that assemble a few components are also of great use in practice. To further improve testing efficiency, we introduce a component selection approach, aiming to identify the most contributory components. The finite sample performance of the proposed tests is illustrated through Monte Carlo experiments.</description>

      <title>A Big Data Approach to Understand Sub-national Determinants of FDI in Africa</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Various macroeconomic and institutional factors hinder FDI inflows, including corruption, trade openness, access to finance, and political instability. Existing research mostly focuses on country-level data, with limited exploration of firm-level data, especially in developing countries. Recognizing this gap, recent calls for research emphasize the need for qualitative data analysis to delve into FDI determinants, particularly at the regional level. This paper proposes a novel methodology, based on text mining and social network analysis, to get information from more than 167,000 online news articles to quantify regional-level (sub-national) attributes affecting FDI ownership in African companies. Our analysis extends information on obstacles to industrial development as mapped by the World Bank Enterprise Surveys. Findings suggest that regional (sub-national) structural and institutional characteristics can play an important role in determining foreign ownership.</description>

      <title>Partially identified heteroskedastic SVARs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06879v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the identification of Structural Vector Autoregressions (SVARs) exploiting a break in the variances of the structural shocks. Point-identification for this class of models relies on an eigen-decomposition involving the covariance matrices of reduced-form errors and requires that all the eigenvalues are distinct. This point-identification, however, fails in the presence of multiplicity of eigenvalues. This occurs in an empirically relevant scenario where, for instance, only a subset of structural shocks had the break in their variances, or where a group of variables shows a variance shift of the same amount. Together with zero or sign restrictions on the structural parameters and impulse responses, we derive the identified sets for impulse responses and show how to compute them. We perform inference on the impulse response functions, building on the robust Bayesian approach developed for set identified SVARs. To illustrate our proposal, we present an empirical example based on the literature on the global crude oil market where the identification is expected to fail due to multiplicity of eigenvalues.</description>

      <title>Automatic Debiased Machine Learning via Riesz Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.14737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.14737v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A variety of interesting parameters may depend on high dimensional regressions. Machine learning can be used to estimate such parameters. However estimators based on machine learners can be severely biased by regularization and/or model selection. Debiased machine learning uses Neyman orthogonal estimating equations to reduce such biases. Debiased machine learning generally requires estimation of unknown Riesz representers. A primary innovation of this paper is to provide Riesz regression estimators of Riesz representers that depend on the parameter of interest, rather than explicit formulae, and that can employ any machine learner, including neural nets and random forests. End-to-end algorithms emerge where the researcher chooses the parameter of interest and the machine learner and the debiasing follows automatically. Another innovation here is debiased machine learners of parameters depending on generalized regressions, including high-dimensional generalized linear models. An empirical example of automatic debiased machine learning using neural nets is given. We find in Monte Carlo examples that automatic debiasing sometimes performs better than debiasing via inverse propensity scores and never worse. Finite sample mean square error bounds for Riesz regression estimators and asymptotic theory are also given.</description>

      <title>On the Time-Varying Structure of the Arbitrage Pricing Theory using the Japanese Sector Indices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.05998v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is the first study to examine the time instability of the APT in the Japanese stock market. In particular, we measure how changes in each risk factor affect the stock risk premiums to investigate the validity of the APT over time, applying the rolling window method to Fama and MacBeth's (1973) two-step regression and Kamstra and Shi's (2023) generalized GRS test. We summarize our empirical results as follows: (1) the changes in monetary policy by major central banks greatly affect the validity of the APT in Japan, and (2) the time-varying estimates of the risk premiums for each factor are also unstable over time, and they are affected by the business cycle and economic crises. Therefore, we conclude that the validity of the APT as an appropriate model to explain the Japanese sector index is not stable over time.</description>

      <title>High-Throughput Asset Pricing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10685v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use empirical Bayes (EB) to mine data on 140,000 long-short strategies constructed from accounting ratios, past returns, and ticker symbols. This "high-throughput asset pricing" produces out-of-sample performance comparable to strategies in top finance journals. But unlike the published strategies, the data-mined strategies are free of look-ahead bias. EB predicts that high returns are concentrated in accounting strategies, small stocks, and pre-2004 samples, consistent with limited attention theories. The intuition is seen in the cross-sectional distribution of t-stats, which is far from the null for equal-weighted accounting strategies. High-throughput methods provide a rigorous, unbiased method for documenting asset pricing facts.</description>
