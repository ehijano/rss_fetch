      <title>Origin of the Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics and its Role in Statistical Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In statistical mechanics the zeroth law of thermodynamics is taken as a postulate which, as its name indicates, logically precedes the first and second laws. Treating it as a postulate has consequences for how temperature is introduced into statistical mechanics and for the molecular interpretation of temperature. One can, however, derive the zeroth law from first principles starting from a classical Hamiltonian using basic mechanics and a geometric representation of the phase space of kinetic energy configurations - the velocity hypersphere. In this approach there is no difficulty in providing a molecular interpretation of temperature, nor in deriving equality of temperature as the condition of thermal equilibrium. The approach to the macroscopic limit as a function of the number of atoms is easily determined. One also obtains with little difficulty the Boltzmann probability distribution, the statistical mechanical definition of entropy and the configuration partition function. These relations, along with the zeroth law, emerge as straightforward consequences of atoms in random motion.</description>

      <title>Modeling Atomic Polarizability: From Charge Distortion to Non-Uniform Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16631v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the classical model of atomic polarizability, atomic charges are displaced by an applied electric field, assuming the electron cloud remains spherically symmetric but with its center shifted from the nucleus, thereby inducing an electric dipole. In this work, we propose that the applied electric field distorts the initially spherical electron cloud into a spheroidal shape, with the nucleus positioned at one of its focal points. We assume that the electron cloud's charge density remains uniform and is not altered by the applied field. We derive a modified expression for the polarizability that accounts for the distortion factor, represented by the eccentricity of the spheroid, and analyze an additional model incorporating non-uniform charge distribution. Furthermore, we present an expression for polarizability that combines the effects of both distortion and non-uniform charge density. These models aim to refine the classical approximation and offer deeper insights into the mechanisms underlying atomic polarizability.</description>

      <title>Universal relations and bounds for fluctuations in quasistatic small heat engines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.08096</link>
      <description>arXiv:1910.08096v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The efficiency of any heat engine, defined as the ratio of average work output to heat input, is bounded by Carnot's celebrated result. However, this measure is insufficient to characterize the properties of miniaturized heat engines carrying non-negligible fluctuations, and a study of higher-order statistics of their energy exchanges is required. Here, we generalize Carnot's result for reversible cycles to arbitrary order moment of the work and heat fluctuations. Our results show that, in the quasistatic limit, higher-order statistics of a small engine's energetics depend solely on the ratio between the temperatures of the thermal baths. We further prove that our result for the second moment gives universal bounds for the ratio between the variances of work and heat for quasistatic cycles. We test this theory with our previous experimental results of a Brownian Carnot engine and observe the consistency between them, even beyond the quasistatic regime. Our results can be exploited in the design of thermal nanomachines to reduce their fluctuations of work output without marginalizing its average value and efficiency.</description>
