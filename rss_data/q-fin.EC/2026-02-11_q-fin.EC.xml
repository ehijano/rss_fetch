      <title>Sign-Dependent Spillovers of Global Monetary Policy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines the sign-dependent international spillovers of Federal Reserve and European Central Bank monetary policy shocks. Using a consistent high-frequency identification of pure monetary policy shocks across 44 advanced and non-advanced economies and the methodology of Caravello and Martinez-Bruera, 2024, we document strong asymmetries in international transmission. Linear specifications mask these effects: contractionary shocks generate large and significant deteriorations in financial conditions, economic activity, and international trade abroad, while expansionary shocks yield little to no measurable improvement. Our results are robust across samples, identification strategies, and the framework proposed by Ben Zeev et al., 2023.</description>

      <title>Behavioral Economics of AI: LLM Biases and Corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Do generative AI models, particularly large language models (LLMs), exhibit systematic behavioral biases in economic and financial decisions? If so, how can these biases be mitigated? Drawing on the cognitive psychology and experimental economics literatures, we conduct the most comprehensive set of experiments to date$-$originally designed to document human biases$-$on prominent LLM families across model versions and scales. We document systematic patterns in LLM behavior. In preference-based tasks, responses become more human-like as models become more advanced or larger, while in belief-based tasks, advanced large-scale models frequently generate rational responses. Prompting LLMs to make rational decisions reduces biases.</description>

      <title>Designing a Token Economy: Incentives, Governance, and Tokenomics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, tokenomic systems, decentralized systems that use cryptographic tokens to represent value and rights, have evolved considerably. Growing complexity in incentive structures has expanded the applicability of blockchain beyond purely transactional use. Existing research predominantly examines token economies within specific use cases, proposes conceptual frameworks, or studies isolated aspects such as governance, incentive design, and tokenomics. However, the literature offers limited empirically grounded, end-to-end guidance that integrates these dimensions into a coherent, step-by-step design approach informed by concrete token-economy development efforts. To address this gap, this paper presents the Token Economy Design Method (TEDM), a design-science artifact that synthesizes stepwise design propositions for token-economy design across incentives, governance, and tokenomics. TEDM is derived through an iterative qualitative synthesis of prior contributions and refined through a co-designed case. The artifact is formatively evaluated via the Currynomics case study and additional expert interviews. Currynomics is an ecosystem that maintains the Redcurry stablecoin, using real estate as the underlying asset. TEDM is positioned as reusable design guidance that facilitates the analysis of foundational requirements of tokenized ecosystems. The specificity of the proposed approach lies in the focus on the socio-technical context of the system and early stages of its design.</description>

      <title>The Macroeconomic Effects of Corporate Tax Reforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.12799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.12799v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using aggregate, sectoral, and firm-level data, this paper examines the effects of two major U.S. corporate tax cuts. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA-17) led to large shareholder payouts but modest aggregate stimulus, while Kennedy's 1960s tax cuts stimulated output and investment with minimal payout impact. To explain this divergence, I incorporate tax depreciation policy and a pass-through business sector into a neoclassical growth model. The model suggests that accelerated depreciation and a large pass-through share dampen stimulus from corporate tax rate reductions, and that Kennedy's cuts boosted output four times more per dollar of lost revenue than the TCJA-17.</description>

      <title>Generative AI and Firm Productivity: Field Experiments in Online Retail</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12049v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We quantify the impact of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) on firm productivity through a series of large-scale randomized field experiments involving millions of users and products at a leading cross-border online retail platform. Over six months in 2023-2024, GenAI-based enhancements were integrated into seven consumer-facing business workflows. We find that GenAI adoption significantly increases sales, with treatment effects ranging from $0\%$ to $16.3\%$, depending on GenAI's marginal contribution relative to existing firm practices. Because inputs and prices were held constant across experimental arms, these gains map directly into total factor productivity improvements. Across the four GenAI applications with positive sales effects, the implied annual incremental value is approximately $\$ 5$ per consumer-an economically meaningful impact given the retailer's scale and the early stage of GenAI adoption. The primary mechanism operates through higher conversion rates, consistent with GenAI reducing frictions and improving consumer experience. Importantly, these effects are not associated with worse post-purchase outcomes, as product return rates and customer ratings do not deteriorate. Finally, we document substantial demand-side heterogeneity, with larger gains for less experienced consumers. Our findings provide novel, large-scale causal evidence on the productivity effects of GenAI in online retail, highlighting both its immediate value and broader potential.</description>

      <title>The Impact of LLMs on Online News Consumption and Production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24968v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) change how consumers acquire information online; their bots also crawl news publishers' websites for training data and to answer consumer queries; and they provide tools that can lower the cost of content creation. These changes lead to predictions of adverse impact on news publishers in the form of lowered consumer demand, reduced demand for newsroom employees, and an increase in news "slop." Consequently, some publishers strategically responded by blocking LLM access to their websites using the robots.txt file standard.
  Using high-frequency granular data, we document four effects related to the predicted shifts in news publishing following the introduction of generative AI (GenAI). First, we find a moderate decline in traffic to news publishers occurring after August 2024. Second, using a difference-in-differences approach, we find that blocking GenAI bots can be associated with a reduction of total website traffic to large publishers compared to not blocking. Third, on the hiring side, we do not find evidence that LLMs are replacing editorial or content-production jobs yet. The share of new editorial and content-production job listings increases over time. Fourth, regarding content production, we find no evidence that large publishers increased text volume; instead, they significantly increased rich content and use more advertising and targeting technologies.
  Together, these findings provide early evidence of some unforeseen impacts of the introduction of LLMs on news production and consumption.</description>

      <title>Platform Design, Earnings Transparency and Minimum Wage Policies: Evidence from A Natural Experiment on Lyft</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08955v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the effects of a significant design and policy change at a major ridesharing platform that altered both provider earnings and platform transparency, examining how it affected outcomes for drivers, riders, and the platform, and providing managerial insights on balancing competing stakeholder interests while avoiding unintended consequences. In February 2024, Lyft introduced a policy guaranteeing drivers a minimum fraction of rider payments while increasing per-ride earnings transparency. The staggered rollout, first in major markets, created a natural experiment to examine how earnings guarantees and transparency affect ride availability and driver engagement. Using trip-level data from over 47 million rides across a major market and adjacent markets over six months, we apply dynamic staggered difference-in-differences models combined with a geographic border strategy to estimate causal effects on supply, demand, ride production, and platform performance. We find that the policy led to substantial increases in driver engagement, with distinct effects from the guarantee and transparency. Drivers increased working hours and utilization, resulting in more completed trips and higher per-hour and per-trip earnings, with stronger effects among drivers with lower pre-policy earnings and greater income uncertainty. Increased supply also generated positive spillovers on demand. We also find evidence that greater transparency may induce strategic driver behavior. In ongoing work, we develop a counterfactual simulation framework linking driver supply and rider intents to ride production, illustrating how small changes in driver choices could further amplify policy effects. Our study shows how platform-led interventions present an intriguing alternative to government-led minimum pay regulation and provide new strategic insights into managing platform change.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Excess Volatility Puzzle Through the Lens of the Chiarella Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07820v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We amend and extend the Chiarella model of financial markets to deal with arbitrary long-term value drifts in a consistent way. This allows us to improve upon existing calibration schemes, opening the possibility of calibrating individual monthly time series instead of classes of time series. The technique is employed on spot prices of four asset classes from ca. 1800 onward (stock indices, bonds, commodities, currencies). The so-called fundamental value is a direct output of the calibration, which allows us to (a) quantify the amount of excess volatility in these markets, which we find to be large (e.g. a factor $\approx$ 4 for stock indices) and consistent with previous estimates; and (b) determine the distribution of mispricings (i.e. the difference between market price and value), which we find in many cases to be bimodal. Both findings are strongly at odds with the Efficient Market Hypothesis. We also study in detail the 'sloppiness' of the calibration, that is, the directions in parameter space that are weakly constrained by data. The main conclusions of our study are remarkably consistent across different asset classes, and reinforce the hypothesis that the medium-term fate of financial markets is determined by a tug-of-war between trend followers and fundamentalists.</description>

      <title>Faithful Group Shapley Value</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19013v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data Shapley is an important tool for data valuation, which quantifies the contribution of individual data points to machine learning models. In practice, group-level data valuation is desirable when data providers contribute data in batch. However, we identify that existing group-level extensions of Data Shapley are vulnerable to shell company attacks, where strategic group splitting can unfairly inflate valuations. We propose Faithful Group Shapley Value (FGSV) that uniquely defends against such attacks. Building on original mathematical insights, we develop a provably fast and accurate approximation algorithm for computing FGSV. Empirical experiments demonstrate that our algorithm significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in computational efficiency and approximation accuracy, while ensuring faithful group-level valuation.</description>

      <title>Monotonic Path-Specific Effects: Application to Estimating Educational Returns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13366v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conventional research on educational effects typically either employs a "years of schooling" measure of education, or dichotomizes attainment as a point-in-time treatment. Yet, such a conceptualization of education is misaligned with the sequential process by which individuals make educational transitions. In this paper, I propose a causal mediation framework for the study of educational effects on outcomes such as earnings. The framework considers the effect of a given educational transition as operating indirectly, via progression through subsequent transitions, as well as directly, net of these transitions. I demonstrate that the average treatment effect (ATE) of education can be additively decomposed into mutually exclusive components that capture these direct and indirect effects. The decomposition has several special properties which distinguish it from conventional mediation decompositions of the ATE, properties which facilitate less restrictive identification assumptions as well as identification of all causal paths in the decomposition. An analysis of the returns to high school completion in the NLSY97 cohort suggests that the payoff to a high school degree stems overwhelmingly from its direct labor market returns. Mediation via college attendance, completion and graduate school attendance is small because of individuals' low counterfactual progression rates through these subsequent transitions.</description>
