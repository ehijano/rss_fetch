      <title>How to Leverage Personal Textual Knowledge for Personalized Conversational Information Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Personalized conversational information retrieval (CIR) combines conversational and personalizable elements to satisfy various users' complex information needs through multi-turn interaction based on their backgrounds. The key promise is that the personal textual knowledge base (PTKB) can improve the CIR effectiveness because the retrieval results can be more related to the user's background. However, PTKB is noisy: not every piece of knowledge in PTKB is relevant to the specific query at hand. In this paper, we explore and test several ways to select knowledge from PTKB and use it for query reformulation by using a large language model (LLM). The experimental results show the PTKB might not always improve the search results when used alone, but LLM can help generate a more appropriate personalized query when high-quality guidance is provided.</description>

      <title>TWIN V2: Scaling Ultra-Long User Behavior Sequence Modeling for Enhanced CTR Prediction at Kuaishou</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The significance of modeling long-term user interests for CTR prediction tasks in large-scale recommendation systems is progressively gaining attention among researchers and practitioners. Existing work, such as SIM and TWIN, typically employs a two-stage approach to model long-term user behavior sequences for efficiency concerns. The first stage rapidly retrieves a subset of sequences related to the target item from a long sequence using a search-based mechanism namely the General Search Unit (GSU), while the second stage calculates the interest scores using the Exact Search Unit (ESU) on the retrieved results. Given the extensive length of user behavior sequences spanning the entire life cycle, potentially reaching up to 10^6 in scale, there is currently no effective solution for fully modeling such expansive user interests. To overcome this issue, we introduced TWIN-V2, an enhancement of TWIN, where a divide-and-conquer approach is applied to compress life-cycle behaviors and uncover more accurate and diverse user interests. Specifically, a hierarchical clustering method groups items with similar characteristics in life-cycle behaviors into a single cluster during the offline phase. By limiting the size of clusters, we can compress behavior sequences well beyond the magnitude of 10^5 to a length manageable for online inference in GSU retrieval. Cluster-aware target attention extracts comprehensive and multi-faceted long-term interests of users, thereby making the final recommendation results more accurate and diverse. Extensive offline experiments on a multi-billion-scale industrial dataset and online A/B tests have demonstrated the effectiveness of TWIN-V2. Under an efficient deployment framework, TWIN-V2 has been successfully deployed to the primary traffic that serves hundreds of millions of daily active users at Kuaishou.</description>

      <title>GenRec: A Flexible Data Generator for Recommendations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The scarcity of realistic datasets poses a significant challenge in benchmarking recommender systems and social network analysis methods and techniques. A common and effective solution is to generate synthetic data that simulates realistic interactions. However, although various methods have been proposed, the existing literature still lacks generators that are fully adaptable and allow easy manipulation of the underlying data distributions and structural properties. To address this issue, the present work introduces GenRec, a novel framework for generating synthetic user-item interactions that exhibit realistic and well-known properties observed in recommendation scenarios. The framework is based on a stochastic generative process based on latent factor modeling. Here, the latent factors can be exploited to yield long-tailed preference distributions, and at the same time they characterize subpopulations of users and topic-based item clusters. Notably, the proposed framework is highly flexible and offers a wide range of hyper-parameters for customizing the generation of user-item interactions. The code used to perform the experiments is publicly available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/GenRec-DED3.</description>

      <title>Graph Bottlenecked Social Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08214v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the emergence of social networks, social recommendation has become an essential technique for personalized services. Recently, graph-based social recommendations have shown promising results by capturing the high-order social influence. Most empirical studies of graph-based social recommendations directly take the observed social networks into formulation, and produce user preferences based on social homogeneity. Despite the effectiveness, we argue that social networks in the real-world are inevitably noisy~(existing redundant social relations), which may obstruct precise user preference characterization. Nevertheless, identifying and removing redundant social relations is challenging due to a lack of labels. In this paper, we focus on learning the denoised social structure to facilitate recommendation tasks from an information bottleneck perspective. Specifically, we propose a novel Graph Bottlenecked Social Recommendation (GBSR) framework to tackle the social noise issue.GBSR is a model-agnostic social denoising framework, that aims to maximize the mutual information between the denoised social graph and recommendation labels, meanwhile minimizing it between the denoised social graph and the original one. This enables GBSR to learn the minimal yet sufficient social structure, effectively reducing redundant social relations and enhancing social recommendations. Technically, GBSR consists of two elaborate components, preference-guided social graph refinement, and HSIC-based bottleneck learning. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed GBSR, including high performances and good generality combined with various backbones. Our code is available at: https://github.com/yimutianyang/KDD24-GBSR.</description>

      <title>Chemical Reaction Extraction from Long Patent Documents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15124v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The task of searching through patent documents is crucial for chemical patent recommendation and retrieval. This can be enhanced by creating a patent knowledge base (ChemPatKB) to aid in prior art searches and to provide a platform for domain experts to explore new innovations in chemical compound synthesis and use-cases. An essential foundational component of this KB is the extraction of important reaction snippets from long patents documents which facilitates multiple downstream tasks such as reaction co-reference resolution and chemical entity role identification. In this work, we explore the problem of extracting reactions spans from chemical patents in order to create a reactions resource database. We formulate this task as a paragraph-level sequence tagging problem, where the system is required to return a sequence of paragraphs that contain a description of a reaction. We propose several approaches and modifications of the baseline models and study how different methods generalize across different domains of chemical patents.</description>

      <title>SyllabusQA: A Course Logistics Question Answering Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14666v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automated teaching assistants and chatbots have significant potential to reduce the workload of human instructors, especially for logistics-related question answering, which is important to students yet repetitive for instructors. However, due to privacy concerns, there is a lack of publicly available datasets. We introduce SyllabusQA, an open-source dataset with 63 real course syllabi covering 36 majors, containing 5,078 open-ended course logistics-related question-answer pairs that are diverse in both question types and answer formats. Since many logistics-related questions contain critical information like the date of an exam, it is important to evaluate the factuality of answers. We benchmark several strong baselines on this task, from large language model prompting to retrieval-augmented generation. We introduce Fact-QA, an LLM-based (GPT-4) evaluation metric to evaluate the factuality of predicted answers. We find that despite performing close to humans on traditional metrics of textual similarity, there remains a significant gap between automated approaches and humans in terms of fact precision.</description>

      <title>UQA: Corpus for Urdu Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01458v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces UQA, a novel dataset for question answering and text comprehension in Urdu, a low-resource language with over 70 million native speakers. UQA is generated by translating the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD2.0), a large-scale English QA dataset, using a technique called EATS (Enclose to Anchor, Translate, Seek), which preserves the answer spans in the translated context paragraphs. The paper describes the process of selecting and evaluating the best translation model among two candidates: Google Translator and Seamless M4T. The paper also benchmarks several state-of-the-art multilingual QA models on UQA, including mBERT, XLM-RoBERTa, and mT5, and reports promising results. For XLM-RoBERTa-XL, we have an F1 score of 85.99 and 74.56 EM. UQA is a valuable resource for developing and testing multilingual NLP systems for Urdu and for enhancing the cross-lingual transferability of existing models. Further, the paper demonstrates the effectiveness of EATS for creating high-quality datasets for other languages and domains. The UQA dataset and the code are publicly available at www.github.com/sameearif/UQA.</description>

      <title>Context Embeddings for Efficient Answer Generation in RAG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09252v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) allows overcoming the limited knowledge of LLMs by extending the input with external information. As a consequence, the contextual inputs to the model become much longer which slows down decoding time directly translating to the time a user has to wait for an answer. We address this challenge by presenting COCOM, an effective context compression method, reducing long contexts to only a handful of Context Embeddings speeding up the generation time by a large margin. Our method allows for different compression rates trading off decoding time for answer quality. Compared to earlier methods, COCOM allows for handling multiple contexts more effectively, significantly reducing decoding time for long inputs. Our method demonstrates a speed-up of up to 5.69 $\times$ while achieving higher performance compared to existing efficient context compression methods.</description>
