      <title>Single-cell sequencing of trophoblasts in preeclampsia and chemical hypoxia in BeWo b30 cells reveals EBI3, COL17A1, miR-27a-5p, and miR-193b-5p as hypoxia-response markers</title>

Abstract: Background. Preeclampsia (PE) complicates 2-8% of pregnancies and is marked by placental hypoxia and HIF-pathway activation, especially in early-onset PE (eoPE). Integrating patient tissue analyses with experimental models may reveal common molecular markers of trophoblast hypoxia.
  Methods. We analyzed scRNA-seq data from 10 eoPE, 7 late-onset PE (loPE), and corresponding control placentas, identifying villous cytotrophoblast (VCT), syncytiotrophoblast (SCT), and extravillous trophoblast (EVT) subpopulations. BeWo b30 cells were treated for 24 h with CoCl2 (300 $\mu$M) or an oxyquinoline derivative (OD, 5 $\mu$M) to induce hypoxia. RNA and small RNA sequencing quantified mRNA and microRNA changes. PROGENy inferred pathway activities.
  Results. ScRNA-seq revealed highest hypoxia pathway activation in eoPE, with EVT showing maximum activity among trophoblast populations. Nine genes were upregulated across all trophoblast types in eoPE: EBI3, CST6, FN1, RFK, COL17A1, LDHA, PKP2, RPS4Y1, and RPS26. In vitro, OD induced more specific hypoxia responses than CoCl2, with 1,284 versus 3,032 differentially expressed genes respectively. Critically, EBI3, FN1, and COL17A1 showed concordant upregulation in both placental tissue and OD-treated cells, while CoCl2 treatment produced opposite expression patterns. MicroRNA analysis identified hsa-miR-27a-5p and hsa-miR-193b-5p as consistently elevated in both experimental conditions and previously reported in PE placental vesicles. We also identified isoforms of hsa-miR-9-5p and hsa-miR-92b-3p as hypoxia-associated in trophoblast.
  Conclusions. EBI3, COL17A1, hsa-miR-27a-5p, and hsa-miR-193b-5p emerge as trophoblast hypoxia markers in PE. Oxyquinoline derivatives offer a more physiologically relevant in vitro hypoxia model than CoCl2. This integrated approach advances understanding of PE pathophysiology and suggests candidate therapeutic targets.</description>

      <title>scSiameseClu: A Siamese Clustering Framework for Interpreting single-cell RNA Sequencing Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12626v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) reveals cell heterogeneity, with cell clustering playing a key role in identifying cell types and marker genes. Recent advances, especially graph neural networks (GNNs)-based methods, have significantly improved clustering performance. However, the analysis of scRNA-seq data remains challenging due to noise, sparsity, and high dimensionality. Compounding these challenges, GNNs often suffer from over-smoothing, limiting their ability to capture complex biological information. In response, we propose scSiameseClu, a novel Siamese Clustering framework for interpreting single-cell RNA-seq data, comprising of 3 key steps: (1) Dual Augmentation Module, which applies biologically informed perturbations to the gene expression matrix and cell graph relationships to enhance representation robustness; (2) Siamese Fusion Module, which combines cross-correlation refinement and adaptive information fusion to capture complex cellular relationships while mitigating over-smoothing; and (3) Optimal Transport Clustering, which utilizes Sinkhorn distance to efficiently align cluster assignments with predefined proportions while maintaining balance. Comprehensive evaluations on seven real-world datasets demonstrate that scSiameseClu outperforms state-of-the-art methods in single-cell clustering, cell type annotation, and cell type classification, providing a powerful tool for scRNA-seq data interpretation.</description>
