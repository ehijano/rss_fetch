      <title>The Nikodym property and filters on $\omega$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a free filter $F$ on $\omega$, let $N_F=\omega\cup\{p_F\}$, where $p_F\not\in\omega$, be equipped with the following topology: every element of $\omega$ is isolated whereas all open neighborhoods of $p_F$ are of the form $A\cup\{p_F\}$ for $A\in F$. The aim of this paper is to study spaces of the form $N_F$ in the context of the Nikodym property of Boolean algebras. By $\mathcal{AN}$ we denote the class of all those ideals $\mathcal{I}$ on $\omega$ such that for the dual filter $\mathcal{I}^*$ the space $N_{\mathcal{I}^*}$ carries a sequence $\langle\mu_n\colon n\in\omega\rangle$ of finitely supported signed measures such that $\|\mu_n\|\rightarrow\infty$ and $\mu_n(A)\rightarrow 0$ for every clopen subset $A\subseteq N_{\mathcal{I}^*}$. We prove that $\mathcal{I}\in\mathcal{AN}$ if and only if there exists a density submeasure $\varphi$ on $\omega$ such that $\varphi(\omega)=\infty$ and $\mathcal{I}$ is contained in the exhaustive ideal $\mbox{Exh}(\varphi)$. Consequently, we get that if $\mathcal{I}\subseteq\mbox{Exh}(\varphi)$ for some density submeasure $\varphi$ on $\omega$ such that $\varphi(\omega)=\infty$ and $N_{\mathcal{I}^*}$ is homeomorphic to a subspace of the Stone space $St(\mathcal{A})$ of a given Boolean algebra $\mathcal{A}$, then $\mathcal{A}$ does not have the Nikodym property.
  We observe that each $\mathcal{I}\in\mathcal{AN}$ is Kat\v{e}tov below the asymptotic density zero ideal $\mathcal{Z}$, and prove that the class $\mathcal{AN}$ has a subset of size $\mathfrak{d}$ which is dominating with respect to the Kat\v{e}tov order $\leq_K$, but $\mathcal{AN}$ has no $\leq_K$-maximal element. We show that for a density ideal $\mathcal{I}$ it holds $\mathcal{I}\not\in\mathcal{AN}$ if and only if $\mathcal{I}$ is totally bounded if and only if the Boolean algebra $\mathcal{P}(\omega)/\mathcal{I}$ contains a countable splitting family.</description>

      <title>On some Fraisse limits with free amalgamation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the first section of this work we discuss some curiosities around stable Kim-forking. In the second section we give a general way of building some known and some new examples of NSOP1 theories as the limit of some Fraisse class satisfying some strong conditions. These limits will satisfy existence, that Kim independence and algebraic independence coincide over arbitrary sets, that forcing base monotonicity on Kim-independance gives forking independence, and they come with a stationary independence relation. This study is based on the results of Baudish, Ramsey, Chernikov and Kruckman.</description>

      <title>Groups with infinite linearly ordered products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a formalism for considering infinite, linearly ordered products in groups. Using this, we define infinite compositions in certain groups of formal power series and show that such series can sometimes be represented as infinite, linearly ordered, semidirect products of ordered Abelian groups.</description>

      <title>Universal truth of operator statements via ideal membership</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.11662v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a framework for proving statements about linear operators by verification of ideal membership in a free algebra. More specifically, arbitrary first-order statements about identities of morphisms in preadditive semicategories can be treated. We present a semi-decision procedure for validity of such formulas based on computations with noncommutative polynomials. These algebraic computations automatically incorporate linearity and benefit from efficient ideal membership procedures. In the framework, domains and codomains of operators are modelled using many-sorted first-order logic. To eliminate quantifiers and function symbols from logical formulas, we apply Herbrand's theorem and Ackermann's reduction. The validity of the resulting formulas is shown to be equivalent to finitely many ideal memberships of noncommutative polynomials. We explain all relevant concepts and discuss computational aspects. Furthermore, we illustrate our framework by proving concrete operator statements assisted by our computer algebra software.</description>

      <title>Definability in affine continuous logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07714v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I study definable sets in affine continuous logic. Let $T$ be an affine theory. After giving some general results, it is proved that if $T$ has a first order model, its extremal theory is a complete first order theory and first order definable sets are affinely definable. In this case, the type spaces of $T$ are Bauer simplices and they coincide with the sets of Keisler measures of the extremal theory. In contrast, if $T$ has a compact model, definable sets are exactly the end-sets of definable predicates. As an example, it is proved in the theory of probability algebras that one dimensional definable sets are exactly the intervals $[a,b]$.</description>

      <title>Herbrand's Theorem in Refutation Schemata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13905v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An inductive proof can be represented as a proof schema, i.e. as a parameterized sequence of proofs defined in a primitive recursive way. A corresponding cut-elimination method, called schematic CERES, can be used to analyze these proofs, and to extract their (schematic) Herbrand sequents, even though Herbrand's theorem in general does not hold for proofs with induction inferences. This work focuses on the most crucial part of the schematic cut-elimination method, which is to construct a refutation of a schematic formula that represents the cut-structure of the original proof schema. We develop a new framework for schematic substitutions and define a unification algorithm for resolution schemata. Moreover, we show that this new formalism allows the extraction of a structure from the refutation schema, called a Herbrand schema, which represents its Herbrand sequent.</description>

      <title>Two-sided cartesian fibrations of synthetic $(\infty,1)$-categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.00938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.00938v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Within the framework of Riehl-Shulman's synthetic $(\infty,1)$-category theory, we present a theory of two-sided cartesian fibrations. Central results are several characterizations of the two-sidedness condition \`{a} la Chevalley, Gray, Street, and Riehl-Verity, a two-sided Yoneda Lemma, as well as the proof of several closure properties.
  Along the way, we also define and investigate a notion of fibered or sliced fibration which is used later to develop the two-sided case in a modular fashion. We also briefly discuss discrete two-sided cartesian fibrations in this setting, corresponding to $(\infty,1)$-distributors.
  The systematics of our definitions and results closely follows Riehl-Verity's $\infty$-cosmos theory, but formulated internally to Riehl-Shulman's simplicial extension of homotopy type theory. All the constructions and proofs in this framework are by design invariant under homotopy equivalence. Semantically, the synthetic $(\infty,1)$-categories correspond to internal $(\infty,1)$-categories implemented as Rezk objects in an arbitrary given $(\infty,1)$-topos.</description>

      <title>On the Descriptive Complexity of Groups without Abelian Normal Subgroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.13725v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the descriptive complexity theory of finite groups by examining the power of the second Ehrenfeucht-Fra\"iss\'e bijective pebble game in Hella's (Ann. Pure Appl. Log., 1989) heirarchy. This is a Spoiler-Duplicator game in which Spoiler can place up to two pebbles each round. While it trivially solves graph isomorphism, it may be nontrivial for finite groups, and other ternary relational structures. We first provide a novel generalization of Weisfeiler-Leman (WL) coloring, which we call 2-ary WL. We then show that the 2-ary WL is equivalent to the second Ehrenfeucht-Fra\"iss\'e bijective pebble game in Hella's heirarchy.
  Our main result is that, in the pebble game characterization, only $O(1)$ pebbles and $O(1)$ rounds are sufficient to identify all groups without Abelian normal subgroups (a class of groups for which isomorphism testing is known to be in $\mathsf{P}$; Babai, Codenotti, &amp; Qiao, ICALP 2012). In particular, we show that within the first few rounds, Spoiler can force Duplicator to select an isomorphism between two such groups at each subsequent round. By Hella's results (\emph{ibid.}), this is equivalent to saying that these groups are identified by formulas in first-order logic with generalized 2-ary quantifiers, using only $O(1)$ variables and $O(1)$ quantifier depth.</description>

      <title>Invariant rational functions under rational transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.11108v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be an algebraic variety equipped with a dominant rational self-map $\phi:X\to X$. A new quantity measuring the interaction of $(X,\phi)$ with trivial dynamical systems is introduced; the stabilised algebraic dimension of $(X,\phi)$ captures the maximum number of new algebraically independent invariant rational functions on the cartesian product of $(X, \phi)$ and $(Y, \psi)$, as $(Y,\psi)$ ranges over all algebraic dynamical systems. It is shown that this birational invariant agrees with the maximum dimension of a dominant equivariant rational image $(X',\phi')$ where $\phi'$ is part of an algebraic group action on $X'$. As a consequence, it is deduced that if some cartesian power of $(X,\phi)$ admits a nonconstant invariant rational function, then already the second cartesian power does.</description>
