      <title>Image-Guided Microstructure Optimization using Diffusion Models: Validated with Li-Mn-rich Cathode Precursors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microstructure often dictates materials performance, yet it is rarely treated as an explicit design variable because microstructure is hard to quantify, predict, and optimize. Here, we introduce an image centric, closed-loop framework that makes microstructural morphology into a controllable objective and demonstrate its use case with Li- and Mn-rich layered oxide cathode precursors. This work presents an integrated, AI driven framework for the predictive design and optimization of lithium-ion battery cathode precursor synthesis. This framework integrates a diffusion-based image generation model, a quantitative image analysis pipeline, and a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. By extracting key morphological descriptors such as texture, sphericity, and median particle size (D50) from SEM images, the platform accurately predicts SEM like morphologies resulting from specific coprecipitation conditions, including reaction time-, solution concentration-, and pH-dependent structural changes. Optimization then pinpoints synthesis parameters that yield user defined target morphologies, as experimentally validated by the close agreement between predicted and synthesized structures. This framework offers a practical strategy for data driven materials design, enabling both forward prediction and inverse design of synthesis conditions and paving the way toward autonomous, image guided microstructure engineering.</description>

      <title>Electronic structure of monolayer-CrTe$_2$: an antiferromagnetic 2D van der Waals material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic van der Waals materials are an important building block to realize spintronic functionalities in heterostructures of two-dimensional (2D) materials. Yet, establishing their magnetic and electronic properties and the interrelationship between the magnetic ground state and electronic structure is often challenging because only a limited number of techniques can probe magnetism and electronic structure on length scales of tens to hundreds of nanometers. Chromium chalcogenides are a class of 2D magnetic materials for which a rich interplay between structure and magnetism has been predicted. Here, we combine angle-resolved photoemission and quasi-particle interference imaging to establish the electronic structure of a monolayer of CrTe$_2$ on graphite. From a comparison of model calculations with spectroscopic mapping using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and scanning tunnelling microscopy we establish the magnetic ground state and the low energy electronic structure. We demonstrate that the band structure of monolayer CrTe$_2$ is captured well by density functional theory (DFT) in a DFT+U framework when a Coulomb repulsion of $U=2.5\mathrm{eV}$ is accounted for.</description>

      <title>Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Generation Using WO$_3$ Nanoparticle-Decorated Sodium Niobate Microcubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The current work studies the electrocatalytic performance of NaNbO$_3$ microcubes decorated with WO$_3$ nanoparticles on Printex L6 at varying concentrations (1%, 3%, 5%, and 10% by weight) for H$_2$O$_2$ electrogeneration aiming for future use in electrochemical advanced oxidation processes for organic pollutant degradation H$_2$O$_2$  electrogeneration was studied using oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) with the rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) technique. Electrochemical results revealed an improvement in H$_2$O$_2$  electrogeneration for the NaNbO$_3$@WO$_3$/C materials compared to that achieved with Printex L6 carbon. Notably, the 5% NaNbO$_3$@WO$_3$/C electrocatalyst exhibited a higher ring current for oxygen reduction reaction and promoted a 2.1-electron transfer, facilitating a higher rate of H$_2$O$_2$  electrogeneration through the 2-electron mechanism. Also, enhancing oxygen-containing functional groups has shown the capability to thoroughly adjust characteristics and enhance active sites, increasing H$_2$O$_2$  electrogeneration. These findings suggest that 5% NaNbO$_3$@WO$_3$/C electrocatalysts hold promise for in situ hydrogen peroxide electrogeneration.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Study on MR-TADF Materials Based on CzBN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR-TADF) materials have garnered significant research interest owing to their remarkably narrow emission spectra with full width at half maximum (FWHM) below $40~\text{nm}$, demonstrating substantial advantages over conventional donor-acceptor (D--A) type TADF materials in spectral purity. However, conventional N--B--N resonant framework materials are fundamentally constrained by their intrinsically low reverse intersystem crossing rates ($k_{\text{RISC}} &lt; 10^{3}~\text{s}^{-1}$), presenting a persistent challenge for achieving high-efficiency TADF. This study proposes a triple collaborative design strategy based on CzBN to break through this limitation: (1) Enhance the separation of HOMO and LUMO by $\pi$-conjugation expansion and reduce $\Delta E_{\text{ST}}$; (2) Introduce O/S heteroatoms to control the excited state charge transfer (CT) characteristics and further reduce $\Delta E_{\text{ST}}$; (3) Enhance the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) effect through the synergy of extended $\pi$-system and heteroatoms. Based on this, five new MR-TADF molecules were designed and studied. Among them, the $k_{\text{RISC}}$ of CzBN\_S reached $3.48 \times 10^{6}~\text{s}^{-1}$, two orders of magnitude higher than CzBN, while maintaining $\Delta E_{\text{ST}} &lt; 0.1~\text{eV}$ and FWHM at $40~\text{nm}$.</description>

      <title>Lanthanide L-Edge Spectroscopy of High-Entropy Oxides: Insights into Valence and Phase Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-entropy oxides (HEOs) are a promising class of multicomponent ceramics with tunable structural and electronic properties. In this study, we investigate the local electronic structure of rare-earth HEOs in the (Ce, Sm, Pr, La, Y)O2 system using X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). By systematically increasing the Ce concentration, we observe a phase transition from bixbyite to fluorite, tracked by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and corroborated by L-edge XANES analysis of La, Sm, Ce, and Pr. The oxidation states of La and Sm remain trivalent, while Ce exhibits a minor Ce 3+ fraction and Pr shows a consistent mixed-valence state. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations with Bader charge analysis support these findings and reveal that the phase transition is driven by compositional effects rather than cation redox. Our combined experimental and computational approach provides new insights into structure-valence correlations in RE-HEOs and their implications for ionic transport and phase stability.</description>

      <title>Colossal anomalous Stark shift in defect emission of undulated 2D materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a strikingly new physical phenomenon that mirror symmetry breaking in undulated two-dimensional (2D) materials induces a colossal Stark shift in defect emissions, occurring without external electric field F, termed anomalous Stark effect. First-principles calculations of multiple defects in bent 2D hBN uncover the fundamental physical reasonings for this anomalous effect and reveal this arises due to strong coupling between flexoelectric polarization and defect dipole moment. This flexo-dipole interaction, similar to that in traditional Stark effect due to F, results in zero-phonon line (ZPL) shifts &gt;500 meV for defects like NBVN and CBVN at $\kappa$ = 1/nm, exceeding typical Stark shifts by 2-3 orders of magnitude. The large ZPL shifts variations with curvature and bending direction offers a method to identify nanotube chirality and explain the large variability in single photon emitters' wavelength in 2D materials, with additional implications for designing nano-electro-mechanical and photonic devices.</description>

      <title>Equivariant graph neural network surrogates for predicting the properties of relaxed atomic configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Density functional theory (DFT) calculations determine the relaxed atomic positions and lattice parameters that minimize the formation energy of a structure. We present an equivariant graph neural network (EGNN) model to predict the outcome of DFT calculations for structures of interest. Cluster expansions are a well established approach for representing the formation energies. However, traditional cluster expansions are limited in their ability to handle variations from a fixed lattice, including interstitial atoms, amorphous materials, and materials with multiple structures. EGNNs offer a more flexible framework that inherently respects the symmetry of the system without being reliant on a particular lattice. In this work, we present the mathematical framework and the results of training for lithium cobalt oxide (LCO) at various compositions of lithium and arrangements of the lithium atoms. Our results demonstrate that the EGNN can accurately predict quantities outside the training set including the largest atomic displacements, the strain tensor and energy, and the formation energy providing greater insight into the system being studied without the need for more DFT calculations.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the Efficiency of Complex Systems Crystal Structure Prediction by Active Learning Guided Machine Learning Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding multicomponent complex material systems is essential for design of advanced materials for a wide range of technological applications. While state-of-the-art crystal structure prediction (CSP) methods effectively identify new structures and assess phase stability, they face fundamental limitations when applied to complex systems. This challenge stems from the combinatorial explosion of atomic configurations and the vast stoichiometric space, both of which contribute to computational demands that rapidly exceed practical feasibility. In this work, we propose a flexible and automated workflow to build a highly generalizable and data-efficient machine learning potential (MLP), effectively unlocking the full potential of CSP algorithms. The workflow is validated on both Mg-Ca-H ternary and Be-P-N-O quaternary systems, demonstrating substantial machine learning acceleration in high-throughput structural optimization and enabling the efficient identification of promising compounds. These results underscore the effectiveness of our approach in exploring complex material systems and accelerating the discovery of new multicomponent materials.</description>

      <title>Sliding and superlubric moir\'e twisting ferroelectric transition in HfO2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite progress in HfO2 thin-film ferroelectrics, issues such as fatigue and high coercive fields persist, and the dynamics of emerging twisted ferroelectricity remain largely unexplored. Here, we explore how interlayer sliding and twisting in bilayer HfO2 enables low barrier switching pathways. Among 144 sliding configurations, two exhibit strong in-plane polarization (2360 pC/m) with a low switching barrier of 3.19 meV/atom. Twisting generates polar textures associated with moir\'e patterns and quasi-flat bands, which drive ferroelectricity via a soft zone-center optical mode, as revealed by machine-learning-assisted first-principles calculations. At twist angles of 21.79{\deg} and 27.80{\deg}, switching barriers drop to 0.58 and 0.06 meV/atom, indicating superlubric-like ferroelectric transitions. Notably, the 46.83{\deg} twisted bilayer shows an almost barrier-free polar evolution (0.009 meV/atom), attributed to sharply enhanced zone-center phonon linewidths. Our findings establish a moir\'e-engineered, ultra-low-energy switching route for 2D ferroelectric applications.</description>

      <title>Neural Network-Driven Molecular Insights into Alkaline Wet Etching of GaN: Toward Atomistic Precision in Nanostructure Fabrication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present large-scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations based on a machine-learning interatomic potential to investigate the wet etching behavior of various GaN facets in alkaline solution-a process critical to the fabrication of nitride-based semiconductor devices. A Behler-Parrinello-type neural network potential (NNP) was developed by training on extensive DFT datasets and iteratively refined to capture chemical reactions between GaN and KOH. To simulate the wet etching of GaN, we perform NNP-MD simulations using the temperature-accelerated dynamics approach, which accurately reproduces the experimentally observed structural modification of a GaN nanorod during alkaline etching. The etching simulations reveal surface-specific morphological evolutions: pyramidal etch pits emerge on the $-c$ plane, while truncated pyramidal pits form on the $+c$ surface. The non-polar m and a surfaces exhibit lateral etch progression, maintaining planar morphologies. Analysis of MD trajectories identifies key surface reactions governing the etching mechanisms. To gain deeper insights into the etching kinetics, we conduct enhanced-sampling MD simulations and construct free-energy profiles for Ga dissolution, a process that critically influences the overall etching rate. The $-c$, $a$, and $m$ planes exhibit moderate activation barriers, indicating the feasibility of alkaline wet etching. In contrast, the $+c$ surface displays a significantly higher barrier, illustrating its strong resistance to alkaline etching. Additionally, we show that Ga-O-Ga bridges can form on etched surfaces, potentially serving as carrier traps. By providing a detailed atomistic understanding of GaN wet etching, this work offers valuable guidance for surface engineering in GaN-based device fabrication.</description>

Abstract: The quaternary alloy AlCrTiV has been proposed as both a lightweight high entropy alloy and also a functional spin filter material based on the Heusler structure. Experimental investigations to-date, based on X-ray diffraction, offer conflicting interpretations of the structure. Here we simulate diffraction patterns of the various proposed structures to show that neutron diffraction, in particular, can reveal the nature of long-range chemical order and discriminate among distributions of the refractory transition metals. Magnetic contributions to the neutron diffraction are also discussed.</description>

      <title>First-principles electron-phonon interactions with self-consistent Hubbard interaction: an application to transparent conductive oxides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ab initio computational method known as Hubbard-corrected density functional theory (DFT+$U$) captures well ground electronic structures of a set of solids that are poorly described by standard DFT alone. Since lattice dynamical properties are closely linked to electronic structures, the Hubbard-corrected density functional perturbation theory (DFPT+$U$) can calculate them at the same level of accuracy. To investigate the effects of $U$ on electron-phonon (el-ph) interactions, we implemented DFPT+$U$ with a Hartree-Fock-based pseudohybrid functional formalism to determine $U$ self-consistently and applied our method to compute optical and transport properties of transparent conductive oxides of CdO and ZnO. For CdO, we find that opening a band gap due to $U$ restores the long-range Fr\"ohlich interaction and that its calculated mobility and absorption spectrum are in excellent agreement with experiments. For ZnO where a band gap already appears at the DFT level, DFPT+$U$ brings the results into much closer alignment with experiment, thus demonstrating improved accuracy of our method in dealing with el-ph interactions in these technologically important materials.</description>

      <title>Estimating Diffuseness for the Non-Relaxor Type Ferroelectric to Paraelectric Phase Transition in BaTiO3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Barium titanate has been extensively studied for a long time as a model ferroelectric material. However, the Ferro-Paraelectric phase transition of this material is a complex problem to analyse when it becomes diffuse. This has attracted significant research attention over the past few decades, primarily because of their intriguing and not yet fully understood physical properties. Bearing in mind the essential practical applications of ferroelectric materials and the great interest in having a simple functional form, describing the temperature dependence of the dielectric permittivity near the diffuse phase transition, scientists have been trying to figure out a proper model for a long time. In this work, such an investigation has been done to understand the diffusion dynamics, following a distribution of transition temperatures and the temperature-dependent dipole density. The transition is then revisited in the light of a temperature-dependent differential plot. Through which, distinct dielectric regimes are demarcated with improved insight into the progression from ferroelectric to paraelectric phase. Following the establishment, a simple yet effective new measure is being proposed, offering a more accurate and physically meaningful estimation of the diffuse phase transition dynamics.</description>

      <title>Elastic properties of silicene: Spinodal instabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silicene, a two-dimensional (2D) allotrope of silicon, has attracted significant interest for its electronic and mechanical properties, alongside its compatibility with various substrates. In this study, we investigate the structural and elastic characteristics of silicene using molecular dynamics simulations based on a tight-binding Hamiltonian, calibrated to align with density-functional theory calculations. We focus particularly on the material's elastic properties and mechanical stability, analyzing its behavior under extensive compressive and tensile in-plane stresses and across temperatures up to 1000 K. Key properties examined include in-plane area, Si--Si bond length, atomic mean-square displacements, elastic constants, and 2D compression modulus. Our findings reveal a notable reduction in stiffness elastic constants, Poisson's ratio, and compression modulus with increasing temperature. Additionally, we identify mechanical instabilities in the silicene structure at specific compressive and tensile biaxial stresses, signaling the material's stability limits or spinodal points. At the corresponding spinodal pressures, structural and elastic properties exhibit anomalies or divergences.</description>

      <title>DFT Investigation of Magnetocrystalline Anisotropy in Fe, Co, Pd0.97Co0.03 and Pd0.97Fe0.03 systems: From Bulk to Thin-Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nature of low-impurity ferromagnetism remains a challenging problem in the solid-state community due to the strong dependence of magnetic properties on composition, concentration, and structural geometry of diluted alloys. To address this, we performed a density functional theory study of magnetocrystalline anisotropy in Fe, Co, Pd0.97Co0.03, and Pd0.97Fe0.03 systems across bulk, monolayer, and thin-film geometries. Non-collinear spin-orbit calculations were employed to evaluate the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energies, supported by analysis of atomic-, spin-, and orbital-resolved densities of states. The results revealed that Fe and Co exhibit opposite easy-axis orientation depending on geometry. At the same time, even 3% Co-doping in Pd is sufficient to induce anisotropy trends resembling those of pure Co. In contrast, Fe-Pd system at the same concentration do not reproduce the anisotropy of pure Fe, showing isotropic behavior in bulk.</description>

      <title>Spin wave resonance in yttrium iron garnet stripe domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a thin film yttrium iron garnet sample that exhibits magnetic stripe domains due to a small perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. Using wide-field magneto-optic Kerr effect measurements we reveal the domain pattern evolution as a function of applied field and discuss the role of the cubic anisotropy for the domain formation. Rich magnetic resonant spectra for the stripe domain background are observed for different excitation conditions and micromagnetic simulations provide spatial profiles of each resonance mode. We further simulate domain patterns and resonance spectra as a function of the cubic anisotropy to correlate between them. This study highlights magnetic domain structures to host complex resonant behavior in a low-damping magnetic material, for a potential use of future applications in magnonics.</description>

      <title>Strain dependence of the Bloch domain component in 180$^\circ$ domains in bulk PbTiO$_{3}$ from first-principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of Bloch-type polarization components in 180$^\circ$ ferroelectric domain walls in bulk PbTiO$_{3}$ under varying mechanical boundary conditions, using first-principles simulations based on density functional theory. A spontaneous Bloch component$-$primarily associated with Pb displacements confined within the PbO domain wall plane$-$condense under realistic strain conditions on top of the Ising-type domain walls. The amplitude and energetic stabilization of this component are highly sensitive to the in-plane lattice parameters. In particular, tensile strains akin to those imposed by DyScO$_{3}$ substrates enhance the Bloch component and lead to energy reductions as large as 10.7 mJ/m$^{2}$ (10.6 meV/$\square$) with respect to the most stable structure including only Ising and N\'eel components. We identify a relatively flat energy landscape for the Bloch polarization, highlighting the tunability of chiral textures through strain engineering. Our results offer a predictive framework for estimating the strain-dependent onset temperature of Bloch-type domain wall components and provide insight into the design of topologically nontrivial and chiral polar structures in ferroelectrics.</description>

      <title>Dynamic interfacial effects in ultrathin ferromagnetic bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the magnetization dynamics of an ultrathin Co (1.5 nm) /Py (1.5 nm) bilayer system from femtosecond (fs) to nanosecond (ns) timescales. Magnetization dynamics in the fs timescales is characterized as a highly non-equilibrium regime due to an ultrafast reduction of magnetization by laser excitation. On the other hand, the dynamics in the ns timescales is characterized as a close-to-equilibrium regime involving the excitation of coherent magnons. We demonstrate that the interfacial interaction between the Co and Py layers in these two non-equilibrium regimes across the timescales is dynamic and simultaneously influences the magnetization loss in the fs timescales and the magnon dynamics in the ns timescales. On ultrafast (fs) timescales, comparison between time-resolved magneto-optical Kerr effect (TR-MOKE) measurements and temperature-based {\mu}T model simulations reveals that the bilayer exhibits demagnetization dynamics intermediate between those of its individual layers. When driven far from equilibrium by ultrashort laser pulse excitation, the magnetization dynamics of the individual Co and Py layers appear to remain decoupled and evolve independently in the initial stages of the ultrafast response. On the other hand, in the ns regime, the two individual layers of the bilayer precess together at the same frequency in a coupled manner as one effective single layer. Furthermore, by correlating the ultrafast demagnetization to precessional damping we attempt to bridge the two non-equilibrium regimes across fs to ns timescales. These results improve our understanding of magnetization dynamics across timescales in ultrathin exchanged-coupled ferromagnetic bilayers and provide valuable insights for the design of high-frequency and energy efficient spintronic device concepts.</description>

      <title>Influence of Silicon Interlayers on Transition Layer Formation in Ti/Ni Multilayer Structures of Different Thicknesses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive investigation of chemical, structural, and magnetic properties of Ti/Ni multilayer systems with period thicknesses of 4 nm and 10 nm. Particular attention was paid to the characterization of the transition layers at Ni-Ti interfaces and the influence of thin silicon barrier layers on their formation. A combination of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray reflectometry (XRR), and SQUID magnetometry was employed for analysis. Extended transition layers up to 1.2 nm in thickness were identified at the Ni-Ti interfaces, primarily composed of the intermetallic Ni3Ti phase. The insertion of ultra-thin silicon buffer layers at the interfaces significantly suppressed the formation of intermetallic compounds, most likely due to the formation of titanium silicides. Additionally, it was observed that the use of Si layer on the sample surface leads to the formation of silicon oxide after exposure to the ambient environment, which acts as a passivation layer and inhibits oxidation of Ni and Ti layers within the topmost period of the multilayer structure.</description>

      <title>Assembly of High-Performance van der Waals Devices Using Commercial Polyvinyl Chloride Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Control over the position, orientation, and stacking order of two-dimensional (2D) materials within van der Waals heterostructures is crucial for applications in electronics, spintronics, optics, and sensing. The most popular strategy for assembling 2D materials uses purpose-built stamps with working surfaces made from one of several different polymers. However, these stamps typically require tedious preparation steps and suffer from poor durability, contamination, and limited applicability to specific 2D materials or surfaces. Here, we demonstrate significant improvements upon current 2D flake transfer and assembly practices by using mechanically durable stamps made from polyvinyl chloride (PVC) thin films. These stamps are simpler to prepare compared with existing methods and can withstand multiple transfer cycles, enabling greater reusability. We use two commercially available PVC films with distinct pick-up and release temperatures. Together, these films also enable polymer-to-polymer flake transfers and stack-and-flip fabrication of inverted heterostructures in one seamless process. Systematic comparisons of cleaning processes confirm the removal of PVC-derived residue from the assembled structures to create atomically clean interfaces. We demonstrate the utility and versatility of these polymer films and transfer process by fabricating graphene/hexagonal boron nitride heterostructure devices with high-performance electrical characteristics. Further, we demonstrate the ability to pick up and to deposit bulk aluminum gallium arsenide nanostructured films, enabling the creation of heterogeneously integrated devices. This technique increases fabrication rates, improves device quality, and enables more complex structures, thereby facilitating nanomaterial assembly in a broad range of applications.</description>

      <title>Strain Induced Robust Skyrmion lattice at Room Temperature in van der Waals Ferromagnet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Manipulating topological magnetic orders of two-dimensional (2D) magnets by strain, once achieved, offers enormous potential for future low-power flexible spintronic applications. In this work, by placing Fe3GaTe2 (FGaT), a room-temperature 2D ferromagnet, on flexible substrate, we demonstrate a field-free and robust formation of skyrmion lattice induced by strain. By applying a minimal strain of ~0.80% to pre-annealed FGaT flakes, the Magnetic Force Microscopy (MFM) tip directly triggers the transition from maze-like domains to an ordered skyrmion lattice while scanning the sample surface. The skyrmion lattice is rather stable against extensive cyclic mechanical testing (stretching, bending, and twisting over 2000 cycles each). It also exhibited stability across a wide range of magnetic fields (~2.9 kOe) and temperatures (~ 323 K), as well as long-term retention stability, highlighting its robustness and field free stabilization. The strain effect reduces the lattice symmetry and enhances the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) of FGaT, thus stabilizing the skyrmion lattice. Our findings highlight the potential of FGaT for integrating magnetic skyrmions into future low-power-consumption flexible spintronics devices.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Dynamics in the Formation of Molecular Polariton Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exciton-polaritons - hybrid light-matter quasiparticles - can undergo Bose-Einstein-like condensation at elevated temperatures owing to their lower effective mass. This becomes even more pronounced in the context of molecular polariton condensates where the large exciton binding energy of Frenkel excitons facilitates condensation at room temperature. While widely studied as low-threshold coherent light sources, the dynamics of their condensation remain poorly understood, partly due to the limitations of existing kinetic models. Here, we use excitation correlation photoluminescence (ECPL), a nonlinear optical technique with 220fs resolution, to probe molecular polariton condensation in Rhodamine-B-doped small-molecule ionic isolation lattices (SMILES). This platform promotes dipole alignment and suppresses detrimental intermolecular interactions. ECPL reveals condensate formation within hundreds of femtoseconds, driven by radiative scattering from the reservoir. A sustained population beyond the polariton lifetime suggests an additional feeding mechanism from higher momentum states in the lower polariton dispersion. These results provide quantitative insight into condensation timescales and mechanisms, advancing our control over polariton dynamics.</description>

      <title>Dominant orbital magnetization in the prototypical altermagnet MnTe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnetism is an unconventional form of antiferromagnetism characterized by momentum-dependent spin polarization of electronic states and zero net magnetization, arising from specific crystalline symmetries. In the presence of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and broken time-reversal symmetry, altermagnets can exhibit finite net magnetization and anomalous Hall effect (AHE), phenomena typically associated with ferromagnets. Due to the dependence of AHE on magnetization, understanding the interplay between spin and orbital contributions to magnetization is essential for interpreting experiments and designing altermagnetic devices. In this work, we use density functional theory to investigate the intrinsic spin and orbital magnetization of the magnetic ground state of the prototypical altermagnet {\alpha}-MnTe. We find that SOC induces weak ferromagnetism through spin canting, accompanied by a slight in-plane rotation of the N\'eel vector. Notably, we identify a significant net orbital magnetization of 0.176 {\mu}B per unit cell oriented along the z-axis, while the spin magnetization in the same direction is much smaller at 0.002 {\mu}B. By varying the chemical potential, we show that the spin magnetization is tunable through hole doping, whereas the orbital magnetization remains robust against carrier density changes. These results highlight the important role of orbital magnetization and establish its relevance for orbital-based phenomena in altermagnets.</description>

      <title>First-principles dissociation pathways of BCl$_3$ on the Si(100)-2$\times$1 surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the most promising acceptor precursors for atomic-precision $\delta$-doping of silicon is BCl$_3$. The chemical pathway, and the resulting kinetics, through which BCl$_3$ adsorbs and dissociates on silicon, however, has only been partially explained. In this work, we use density functional theory to expand the dissociation reactions of BCl$_3$ to include reactions that take place across multiple silicon dimer rows, and reactions which end in a bare B atom either at the surface, substituted for a surface silicon, or in a subsurface position. We further simulate resulting scanning tunneling microscopy images for each of these BCl$_x$ dissociation fragments, demonstrating that they often display distinct features that may allow for relatively confident experimental identification. Finally, we input the full dissociation pathway for BCl$_3$ into a kinetic Monte Carlo model, which simulates realistic reaction pathways as a function of environmental conditions such as pressure and temperature of dosing. We find that BCl$_2$ is broadly dominant at low temperatures, while high temperatures and ample space on the silicon surface for dissociation encourage the formation of bridging BCl fragments and B substitutions on the surface. This work provides the chemical mechanisms for understanding atomic-precision doping of Si with B, enabling a number of relevant quantum applications such as bipolar nanoelectronics, acceptor-based qubits, and superconducting Si.</description>

      <title>Plastic deformation as a phase transition: a combinatorial model of plastic flow in copper single crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuum models of plasticity fail to capture the richness of microstructural evolution because the continuum is a homogeneous construction. The present study shows that an alternative way is available at the mesoscale in the form of truly discrete constructions and in the discrete exterior calculus. A pre-existing continuum mean-field model with two parameters is rewritten in the language of the latter to model the properties of a network of plastic slip events in a perfect copper single crystal under uniaxial tension. The behaviour of the system is simulated in a triangular 2D mesh in 3D space employing a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. Phases of distinct character emerge and both first-order and second-order phase transitions are observed. The phases can be interpreted as representing crystallographic phenomena like cross-slip, strain localisation and partial dislocations. The first-order transitions mostly occur as functions of the applied stress, while the second-order transitions occur exclusively as functions of the mean-field coupling parameter. The former are reminiscent of transitions in other statistical-mechanical models, while the latter find parallels in experimental observations.</description>

      <title>The structure and migration of twin boundaries in tetragonal $\beta$-Sn: an application of machine learning based interatomic potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although atomistic simulations have contributed significantly to our understanding of twin boundary structure and migration in metals and alloys with hexagonal close packed (HCP) crystal structures, few direct atomistic studies of twinning have been conducted for other types of low symmetry materials, in large part due to a lack of reliable interatomic potentials. In this work, we examine twin boundary structure and migration in a tetragonal material, $\beta$-Sn, comparing high resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) images of deformation twins in $\beta$-Sn to the results of direct atomistic simulations using multiple interatomic potentials. ML-based potentials developed in this work are found to give results consistent with our experimental data, revealing faceted twin boundary structures formed by the nucleation and motion of twinning disconnections. We use bicrystallographic methods in combination with atomistic simulations to analyze the structure, energy and shear coupled migration of observed twin facets in $\beta$-Sn. In analogy to Prismatic-Basal (PB/BP) interfaces in HCP metals, we discover low energy asymmetric Prismatic-A-plane (PA/AP) interfaces important to twin growth in $\beta$-Sn. A Moment Tensor Potential (MTP) and Rapid Artificial Neural Network (RANN) interatomic potential suitable for studying twinning and phase transformations in Sn are made publicly available as part of this work.</description>

We employ advanced electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) techniques, including continuous wave (CW) and pulsed X-band experiments, electron spin echo envelope modulation (ESEEM), and electron-electron double resonance (ELDOR)-detected NMR (EDNMR) to investigate the local coordination and electron environment of cerium ions in the hydroxyapatite matrix. The experimental results are complemented by g-tensor calculation, which allows us to interpret the EPR spectra and identify the types of paramagnetic centers. Our results show that during the synthesis of hydroxyapatite powder by the chemical precipitation method using nitrates, cerium ions enter the structure mainly in the trivalent state and replace calcium ions in two nonequivalent positions. In addition to cerium ions, nitrate radicals are found in the HAp structure. Heat treatment reduces the amount of nitrate radicals and increases crystallinity. This work expands the understanding of the role of cerium in calcium phosphates and provides a methodological basis for the characterization of doped bioceramics using various EPR approaches.</description>

Abstract: This work presents an innovative magnetoelastic (ME) biosensor using graphene functionalized with the SARS-CoV-2 N protein for antibody detection via magnetoelastic resonance. Graphene was chosen for its biocompatibility and high surface area, enabling efficient antigen adsorption, validated by techniques such as energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and micro-Raman spectroscopy. Changes in Raman bands (a $\sim 10~\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ shift in the 2D band and an increase in the $I_D/I_G$ ratio from 0.03 to 0.60) confirmed non-covalent interactions and enhanced surface coverage with ~100 $\mu$g of N protein. Tests using human plasma (10 RT-PCR-positive and 10 negative samples) demonstrated a clear distinction between groups using graphene sensors functionalized with ~100 $\mu$g of N protein. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) validation corroborated the results. Optimization of protein concentration and biofunctionalization time highlighted the importance of homogeneous surface coverage for reproducibility of the graphene-based ME biosensor. The platform combines graphene's advantages with the wireless, real-time detection capabilities of ME sensors, offering low cost, high sensitivity, and potential for automation, with applications in point-of-care diagnostics.</description>

      <title>Competing Pair Density Wave and Uniform $d$-wave Superconductivity in Phase Separated 214 Cuprates at the 1/8 Anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Compelling evidence exists for electronic phase separation in cuprate high-$T_c$ superconductors, emerging near 1/8 hole doping. At these dopings and low temperatures, intertwined charge and spin stripes coexist with more uniformly doped regions in the two-dimensional (2$D$) copper-oxide planes. Each region is capable of developing superconducting pairing, either as a pair density wave (PDW) within the stripes or as a uniform $d$-wave condensate ($d$-SC) in the more homogeneous regions. Using neutron scattering on single crystals of La$_{1.875-y}$Nd$_{y}$Sr$_{0.125}$CuO$_4$, we demonstrate that the onset temperatures for spin stripe order ($T_N$) and superconductivity ($T_c$) merge as the average ordered moment vanishes in LSCO ($y = 0$), whereas Nd doping stabilizes static stripe order and suppresses $T_c$. Because the spin stripes possess the same in-plane periodicity (8$a$) as the PDW and establish the framework in which the PDW resides, the stabilization of spin stripe order enhances PDW correlations. Thus, the competition between $d$-wave pairing in the uniform regions and PDW pairing in the stripe-ordered regions can be controlled by the Nd concentration in La$_{1.875-y}$Nd$_{y}$Sr$_{0.125}$CuO$_4$, allowing the superconducting $T_c$ to vary by nearly an order of magnitude at a fixed 1/8 hole doping.</description>

      <title>Modelling of time-dependent electrostatic effects and AFM-based surface conductivity characterization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) combined with electrical modes provides a powerful contactless approach to characterize material electrical properties at the nanoscale. However, conventional electrostatic models often overlook dynamic charge effects, which are particularly relevant for 2D materials deposited on insulating substrates. In this work, we introduce a theoretical framework that extends traditional electrostatic models by incorporating charge dynamics, analyzing two key cases: quasi-ideal conductors and quasi-ideal insulators. Our model establishes a characteristic timescale, $\tau$, which governs charge redistribution and measurement reliability. Experimental validation using Graphene Oxide, Reduced Graphene Oxide, and lightly reduced GO demonstrates strong dependence of frequency shift on surface conductivity, confirming our predictions. Temperature-dependent measurements further reveal conductivity variations consistent with disordered electronic materials. These findings provide critical insight into the impact of finite surface conductivity on AFM-based techniques and establish a novel method for evaluating charge dynamics in individual flakes of 2D materials and propose an alternative, contactless method for estimating surface conductivity.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear optical response in kagome lattice with inversion symmetry breaking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The kagome lattice is a fundamental model structure in condensed matter physics and materials science featuring symmetry-protected flat bands, saddle points, and Dirac points. This structure has emerged as an ideal platform for exploring various quantum physics. By combining effective model analysis and first-principles calculations, we propose that the synergy among inversion symmetry breaking, flat bands, and saddle point-related van Hove singularities within the kagome lattice holds significant potential for generating strong second-order nonlinear optical response. This property provides an inspiring insight into the practical application of the kagome-like materials, which is helpful for a comprehensive understanding of kagome lattice-related physics. Moreover, this work offers an alternative approach for designing materials with strong a second-order nonlinear optical response.</description>

      <title>Metal-Insulator Transition described by Natural Orbital Functional Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The metal-insulator transition (MIT) is a fundamental phenomenon in condensed matter physics and a hallmark of strong electronic correlations. Hydrogen-based systems offer a simple yet powerful model for investigating the MIT, as their insulating behavior arises purely from electron-electron interactions. In this work, we study finite hydrogen clusters with cubic geometries using Natural Orbital Functional Theory (NOFT), a method capable of accurately describing correlated systems beyond mean-field approaches. We focus on two key signatures of the MIT: the fundamental energy gap and the harmonic average of the atomic one-particle reduced density matrix. Our results show that NOFT captures the transition from insulating to metallic behavior as the interatomic distance decreases. By extrapolating the energy gap to the thermodynamic limit, we estimate a critical distance rc ~ 1.2 Ang, in excellent agreement with quantum Monte Carlo benchmarks. These findings demonstrate the reliability of NOFT for describing strong correlation effects in large-scale models.</description>

      <title>Building-Block Aware Generative Modeling for 3D Crystals of Metal Organic Frameworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) marry inorganic nodes, organic edges, and topological nets into programmable porous crystals, yet their astronomical design space defies brute-force synthesis. Generative modeling holds ultimate promise, but existing models either recycle known building blocks or are restricted to small unit cells. We introduce Building-Block-Aware MOF Diffusion (BBA MOF Diffusion), an SE(3)-equivariant diffusion model that learns 3D all-atom representations of individual building blocks, encoding crystallographic topological nets explicitly. Trained on the CoRE-MOF database, BBA MOF Diffusion readily samples MOFs with unit cells containing 1000 atoms with great geometric validity, novelty, and diversity mirroring experimental databases. Its native building-block representation produces unprecedented metal nodes and organic edges, expanding accessible chemical space by orders of magnitude. One high-scoring [Zn(1,4-TDC)(EtOH)2] MOF predicted by the model was synthesized, where powder X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis, and N2 sorption confirm its structural fidelity. BBA-Diff thus furnishes a practical pathway to synthesizable and high-performing MOFs.</description>

      <title>Rejoining fragmented ancient bamboo slips with physics-driven deep learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bamboo slips are a crucial medium for recording ancient civilizations in East Asia, and offers invaluable archaeological insights for reconstructing the Silk Road, studying material culture exchanges, and global history. However, many excavated bamboo slips have been fragmented into thousands of irregular pieces, making their rejoining a vital yet challenging step for understanding their content. Here we introduce WisePanda, a physics-driven deep learning framework designed to rejoin fragmented bamboo slips. Based on the physics of fracture and material deterioration, WisePanda automatically generates synthetic training data that captures the physical properties of bamboo fragmentations. This approach enables the training of a matching network without requiring manually paired samples, providing ranked suggestions to facilitate the rejoining process. Compared to the leading curve matching method, WisePanda increases Top-50 matching accuracy from 36\% to 52\%. Archaeologists using WisePanda have experienced substantial efficiency improvements (approximately 20 times faster) when rejoining fragmented bamboo slips. This research demonstrates that incorporating physical principles into deep learning models can significantly enhance their performance, transforming how archaeologists restore and study fragmented artifacts. WisePanda provides a new paradigm for addressing data scarcity in ancient artifact restoration through physics-driven machine learning.</description>

      <title>Quantum confinement theory of ultra-thin films: electronic, thermal and superconducting properties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The miniaturization of electronic devices has led to the prominence, in technological applications, of ultra-thin films with a thickness ranging from a few tens of nanometers to just about 1-2 nanometers. While these materials are still effectively 3D in many respects, traditional theories as well as ab initio methods struggle to describe their properties as measured in experiments. In particular, standard approaches to quantum confinement rely on hard-wall boundary conditions, which neglect the unavoidable, ubiquitous, atomic-scale irregularities of the interface. Recently, a unified theoretical approach to quantum confinement has been proposed which is able to effectively take the real nature of the interface into account, and can efficiently be implemented in synergy with microscopic theories. Its predictions for the electronic properties such as electrical conductivity of semiconductor thin films or critical temperature of superconducting thin films, have been successfully verified in comparison with experimental data. The same confinement principles lead to new laws for the phonon density of states and for the heat capacity of thin films, again in agreement with the available experimental data.</description>

Abstract: Altermagnetism, a new magnetic phase, has been theoretically proposed and experimentally verified to be distinct from ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism. Although altermagnets have been found to possess many exotic physical properties, the limited availability of known altermagnetic materials hinders the study of such properties. Hence, discovering more types of altermagnetic materials with different properties is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of altermagnetism and thus facilitating new applications in the next generation information technologies, e.g., storage devices and high-sensitivity sensors. Since each altermagnetic material has a unique crystal structure, we propose an automated discovery approach empowered by an AI search engine that employs a pre-trained graph neural network to learn the intrinsic features of the material crystal structure, followed by fine-tuning a classifier with limited positive samples to predict the altermagnetism probability of a given material candidate. Finally, we successfully discovered 50 new altermagnetic materials that cover metals, semiconductors, and insulators confirmed by the first-principles electronic structure calculations. The wide range of electronic structural characteristics reveals that various novel physical properties manifest in these newly discovered altermagnetic materials, e.g., anomalous Hall effect, anomalous Kerr effect, and topological property. Noteworthy, we discovered 4 $i$-wave altermagnetic materials for the first time. Overall, the AI search engine performs much better than human experts and suggests a set of new altermagnetic materials with unique properties, outlining its potential for accelerated discovery of the materials with targeted properties.</description>

      <title>Data-driven stochastic 3D modeling of the nanoporous binder-conductive additive phase in battery cathodes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11080v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A stochastic 3D modeling approach for the nanoporous binder-conductive additive phase in hierarchically structured cathodes of lithium-ion batteries is presented. The binder-conductive additive phase of these electrodes consists of carbon black, polyvinylidene difluoride binder and graphite particles. For its stochastic 3D modeling, a three-step procedure based on methods from stochastic geometry is used. First, the graphite particles are described by a Boolean model with ellipsoidal grains. Second, the mixture of carbon black and binder is modeled by an excursion set of a Gaussian random field in the complement of the graphite particles. Third, large pore regions within the mixture of carbon black and binder are described by a Boolean model with spherical grains. The model parameters are calibrated to 3D image data of cathodes in lithium-ion batteries acquired by focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy. Subsequently, model validation is performed by comparing model realizations with measured image data in terms of various morphological descriptors that are not used for model fitting. Finally, we use the stochastic 3D model for predictive simulations, where we generate virtual, yet realistic, image data of nanoporous binder-conductive additives with varying amounts of graphite particles. Based on these virtual nanostructures, we can investigate structure-property relationships. In particular, we quantitatively study the influence of graphite particles on effective transport properties in the nanoporous binder-conductive additive phase, which have a crucial impact on electrochemical processes in the cathode and thus on the performance of battery cells.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15788v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Acoustic haptic technology adds touch sensations to human-machine interfaces by integrating piezoelectric actuators onto touchscreens. Traditional piezoelectric haptic technologies use opaque lead-containing ceramics that are both toxic and visible. We have developed a highly transparent lead-free piezoelectric haptic device using potassium sodium niobate (KNN) and transparent conductive oxide thin films. The KNN film, grown on glass, exhibits a pure perovskite phase and a dense microstructure. This device achieves up to 80% transmittance, surpassing lead zirconate titanate (PZT) thin films. It generates an acoustic resonance at 16.5 kHz and produces a peak-to-peak displacement of 1.0 um at 28 V unipolar, making it suitable for surface rendering applications. This demonstrates the potential of transparent lead-free piezoelectric actuators as an effective alternative to conventional PZT haptic actuators.</description>

Abstract: As "2D" materials (i.e. materials just a few atoms thick) continue to gain prominence, understanding their symmetries is critical for unlocking their full potential. In this work, we present comprehensive tables that tabulate the rod group symmetries of all crystallographic lines in all 80 layer groups, which describe the symmetries of 2D materials. These tables are analogous to the scanning tables for space groups found in Volume E of the International Tables for Crystallography, but are specifically tailored for layer groups and their applications to 2D materials. This resource will aid in the analysis of line defects, such as domain walls, which play a crucial role in determining the properties and functionality of 2D materials.</description>

      <title>Efficient moment tensor machine-learning interatomic potential for accurate description of defects in Ni-Al Alloys</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01282v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Combining the efficiency of semi-empirical potentials with the accuracy of quantum mechanical methods, machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have significantly advanced atomistic modeling in computational materials science and chemistry. This necessitates the continual development of MLIP models with improved accuracy and efficiency, which enable long-time scale molecular dynamics simulations to unveil the intricate underlying mechanisms that would otherwise remain elusive. Among various existing MLIP models, the moment tensor potential (MTP) model employs a highly descriptive rotationally-covariant moment tensor to describe the local atomic environment, enabling the use of even linear regression for model fitting. Although the current MTP model has achieved state-of-the-art efficiency for similar accuracy, there is still room for optimizing the contraction process of moment tensors. In this work, we propose an effective genetic algorithm based optimization scheme that can significantly reduce the number of independent moment tensor components and intermediate tensor components. This leads to a speedup of nearly one order of magnitude in efficiency and also improved accuracy compared to the traditional MTP model for intricate basis sets. We have applied our improved MTP model to predicting the energetic and dynamical properties of various point and planar defects in Ni-Al alloys, showing overall good performances and in general outperforming the semi-empirical potentials. This work paves the way for fast and accurate atomistic modeling of complex systems and provides a useful tool for modeling defects in Ni-Al alloys.</description>

      <title>Fermi-Liquid $T^2$ Resistivity: Dynamical Mean-Field Theory Meets Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16363v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Direct-current resistivity is a key probe for the physical properties of materials. In metals, Fermi-liquid (FL) theory serves as the basis for understanding transport. A $T^2$ behavior of the resistivity is often taken as a signature of FL electron-electron scattering. However, the presence of impurity and phonon scattering as well as material-specific aspects such as Fermi surface geometry can complicate this interpretation. We demonstrate how density-functional theory combined with dynamical mean-field theory can be used to elucidate the FL regime. We take as examples SrVO$_{3}$ and SrMoO$_{3}$, two moderately correlated perovskite oxides, and establish a precise framework to analyze the FL behavior of the self-energy at low energy and temperature. Reviewing published low-temperature resistivity measurements, we find agreement between our calculations and experiments performed on samples with exceptionally low residual resistivity. This comparison emphasizes the need for further theoretical, synthesis, and characterization developments in these and other FL materials.</description>

Abstract: Ice Ih, the most stable phase of water at ambient pressure, is a stacking of the honeycomb network of water molecules H2O. What if one layer of ice is exfoliated and confined to a two-dimensional (2D) sheet? Martyite Zn3(V2O7)(OH)2 2H2O, a mineral with the honeycomb lattice of H2O in the porous framework, is an ideal system for studying such monolayer ice. Due to the geometrical frustration and 2D nature, H2O molecules are dynamically disordered at room temperature. In this study, we reveal disorder-order transitions of H2O in martyite using single-crystal x-ray diffraction (XRD). The XRD results visualize the formation of hydrogen-bonded toroidal H2O hexamers, leading to the ferroaxial order below 200 K. Combined with the molecular dynamics simulations, we discuss the formation process of the H2O hexamers and how they compromise the molecular arrangement towards lower temperatures. Our results unveil the ground state of monolayer ice, a fundamental knowledge to understand the polymorphism of H2O.</description>

      <title>Towards "on-demand" van der Waals epitaxy with hpc-driven online ensemble sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05539v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional approaches to achieve targeted epitaxial growth involves exploring a vast parameter space of thermodynamical and kinetic drivers (e.g., temperature, pressure, chemical potential etc). This tedious and time-consuming approach becomes particularly cumbersome to accelerate synthesis and characterization of novel materials with complex dependencies on local chemical environment, temperature and lattice-strains, specifically nanoscale heterostructures of layered 2D materials. We combine the strength of next generation supercomputers at the extreme scale, machine learning and classical molecular dynamics simulations within an adaptive real time closed-loop virtual environment steered by Bayesian optimization to enable asynchronous ensemble sampling of the synthesis space, and apply it to the recrystallization phenomena of amorphous transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) bilayer to form stack moir\'e heterostructures under various growth parameters. We show that such asynchronous ensemble sampling frameworks for materials simulations can be promising towards achieving on-demand epitaxy of van der Waals stacked moir\'e devices, paving the way towards a robust autonomous materials synthesis pipeline to enable unprecedented discovery of new functionalities.</description>

      <title>Strong Crystalline Thermal Insulation Induced by Extended Antibonding States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06926v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Crystalline solids with extreme insulation often exhibit a plateau or even an upward-sloping tail in thermal conductivity above room temperature. Herein, we synthesized a crystalline material AgTl$_2$I$_3$ with an exceptionally low thermal conductivity of 0.21 $\rm W m^{-1} K^{-1}$ at 300 K, which continues to decrease to 0.17 $\rm W m^{-1} K^{-1}$ at 523 K. We adopted an integrated experimental and theoretical approach to reveal the lattice dynamics and thermal transport properties of AgTl$_2$I$_3$. Our results suggest that the Ag-I polyhedron enables extended antibonding states to weaken the chemical bonding, fostering strong lattice anharmonicity driven by the rattling vibrations of Ag atoms and causing lattice softening. Experimental measurements further corroborate the large atomic thermal motions and low sound velocity. These features impede particle-like phonon propagation, and significantly diminish the contribution of wave-like phonon tunneling. This work highlights a strategy for designing thermal insulating materials by leveraging crystal structure and chemical bonding, providing a pathway for advancing the development of thermal insulators.</description>

      <title>Considerations in the use of ML interaction potentials for free energy calculations</title>

Abstract: Machine learning potentials (MLPs) offer the potential to accurately model the energy and free energy landscapes of molecules with the precision of quantum mechanics and an efficiency similar to classical simulations. This research focuses on using equivariant graph neural networks MLPs due to their proven effectiveness in modeling equilibrium molecular trajectories. A key issue addressed is the capability of MLPs to accurately predict free energies and transition states by considering both the energy and the diversity of molecular configurations. We examined how the distribution of collective variables (CVs) in the training data affects MLP accuracy in determining the free energy surface (FES) of systems, using Metadynamics simulations for butane and alanine dipeptide (ADP). The study involved training forty-three MLPs, half based on classical molecular dynamics data and the rest on ab initio computed energies. The MLPs were trained using different distributions that aim to replicate hypothetical scenarios of sampled CVs obtained if the underlying FES of the system was unknown. Findings for butane revealed that training data coverage of key FES regions ensures model accuracy regardless of CV distribution. However, missing significant FES regions led to correct potential energy predictions but failed free energy reconstruction. For ADP, models trained on classical dynamics data were notably less accurate, while ab initio-based MLPs predicted potential energy well but faltered on free energy predictions. These results emphasize the challenge of assembling an all-encompassing training set for accurate FES prediction and highlight the importance of understanding the FES in preparing training data. The study points out the limitations of MLPs in free energy calculations, stressing the need for comprehensive data that encompasses the system's full FES for effective model training.</description>

      <title>Abnormal planar Hall effect and disentanglement of incoherent and coherent transport in a Kondo lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09908v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The nature of localized-itinerant transition in Kondo lattice systems remains a mystery despite intensive investigations in past decades. While it is often identified from the coherent peak in magnetic resistivity, recent angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and ultrafast optical spectroscopy revealed a precursor incoherent region with band bending and hybridization fluctuations. This raises the question of how the coherent heavy-electron state is developed from an incoherent background of fluctuating localized moments and then established at sufficiently low temperatures. Here, on the example of the quasi-one-dimensional Kondo lattice compound CeCo$_2$Ga$_8$, we show that planar Hall effect and planar anisotropic magnetoresistance measurements provide an effective way to disentangle the incoherent Kondo scattering contribution and the coherent heavy-electron contribution, and a multi-stage process is directly visualized with lowering temperature by their distinct angle-dependent patterns in magneto-transport. Our idea may be extended to other measurements and thereby opens up a pathway for systematically investigating the fundamental physics of Kondo lattice coherence.</description>

Abstract: The discovery of new superconducting materials, particularly those exhibiting high critical temperature ($T_c$), has been a vibrant area of study within the field of condensed matter physics. Conventional approaches primarily rely on physical intuition to search for potential superconductors within the existing databases. However, the known materials only scratch the surface of the extensive array of possibilities within the realm of materials. Here, we develop InvDesFlow, an AI search engine that integrates deep model pre-training and fine-tuning techniques, diffusion models, and physics-based approaches (e.g., first-principles electronic structure calculation) for the discovery of high-$T_c$ superconductors. Utilizing InvDesFlow, we have obtained 74 dynamically stable materials with critical temperatures predicted by the AI model to be $T_c \geq$ 15 K based on a very small set of samples. Notably, these materials are not contained in any existing dataset. Furthermore, we analyze trends in our dataset and individual materials including B$_4$CN$_3$ (at 5 GPa) and B$_5$CN$_2$ (at ambient pressure) whose $T_c$s are 24.08 K and 15.93 K, respectively. We demonstrate that AI technique can discover a set of new high-$T_c$ superconductors, outline its potential for accelerating discovery of the materials with targeted properties.</description>

      <title>Early-Cycle Internal Impedance Enables ML-Based Battery Cycle Life Predictions Across Manufacturers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05326v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predicting the end-of-life (EOL) of lithium-ion batteries across different manufacturers presents significant challenges due to variations in electrode materials, manufacturing processes, cell formats, and a lack of generally available data. Methods that construct features solely on voltage-capacity profile data typically fail to generalize across cell chemistries. This study introduces a methodology that combines traditional voltage-capacity features with Direct Current Internal Resistance (DCIR) measurements, enabling more accurate and generalizable EOL predictions. The use of early-cycle DCIR data captures critical degradation mechanisms related to internal resistance growth, enhancing model robustness. Models are shown to successfully predict the number of cycles to EOL for unseen manufacturers of varied electrode composition with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 150 cycles. This cross-manufacturer generalizability reduces the need for extensive new data collection and retraining, enabling manufacturers to optimize new battery designs using existing datasets. Additionally, a novel DCIR-compatible dataset is released as part of ongoing efforts to enrich the growing ecosystem of cycling data and accelerate battery materials development.</description>

      <title>Lorentz Skew Scattering and Giant Nonreciprocal Magneto-Transport</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07746v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Skew scattering is the well-known dominant mechanism for anomalous Hall transport in highly conductive systems. However, despite extensive research, the primary mechanism governing nonlinear (nonreciprocal) magneto-transport in clean samples remains unknown. This theoretical gap has impeded the development of design principles for efficient nonreciprocal devices. Here, we unveil a hitherto unexplored effect in nonreciprocal magneto-transport from cooperative action of Lorentz force and skew scattering. The significance of this Lorentz skew scattering mechanism lies in that it dominates both longitudinal and transverse responses in highly conductive systems, and it exhibits a scaling behavior distinct from all known mechanisms. At low temperature, it shows a cubic scaling in linear conductivity, whereas the scaling becomes quartic at elevated temperature when phonon scattering kicks in. Applying our developed microscopic theory to surface transport in topological crystalline insulator SnTe and bulk transport in Weyl semimetals leads to significant results, suggesting a new route to achieve giant transport nonreciprocity in high-mobility materials with topological band features.</description>

      <title>Scaling Up Purcell-Enhanced Self-Assembled Nanoplasmonic Perovskite Scintillators into the Bulk Regime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18477v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scintillators convert high-energy radiation into detectable photons and play a crucial role in medical imaging and security applications. The enhancement of scintillator performance through nanophotonics and nanoplasmonics, specifically using the Purcell effect, has shown promise but has so far been limited to ultrathin scintillator films because of the localized nature of this effect. This study introduces a method to expand the application of nanoplasmonic scintillators to the bulk regime. By integrating 100-nm-sized plasmonic spheroid and cuboid nanoparticles with perovskite scintillator nanocrystals, we enable nanoplasmonic scintillators to function effectively within bulk-scale devices. We experimentally demonstrate power and decay rate enhancements of up to (3.20 $\pm$ 0.20) and (4.20 $\pm$ 0.31) folds for plasmonic spheroid and cuboid nanoparticles, respectively, in a 5-mm thick CsPbBr$_{3}$ nanocrystal-polymer scintillator at RT. Theoretical modeling also predicts similar enhancements of up to (2.26 $\pm$ 0.31) and (3.02 $\pm$ 0.69) folds for the same nanoparticle shapes and dimensions. Moreover, we demonstrate a (2.07 $\pm$ 0.39) fold increase in light yield under $^{241}$Am $\gamma$-excitation. These findings provide a viable pathway for utilizing nanoplasmonics to enhance bulk scintillator devices, advancing radiation detection technology.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Accelerated Descriptor Design for Catalyst Discovery in CO$_2$ to Methanol Conversion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13838v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transforming CO$_2$ into methanol represents a crucial step towards closing the carbon cycle, with thermoreduction technology nearing industrial application. However, obtaining high methanol yields and ensuring the stability of heterocatalysts remain significant challenges. Herein, we present a sophisticated computational framework to accelerate the discovery of thermal heterogeneous catalysts, using machine-learned force fields. We propose a new catalytic descriptor, termed adsorption energy distribution, that aggregates the binding energies for different catalyst facets, binding sites, and adsorbates. The descriptor is versatile and can be adjusted to a specific reaction through careful choice of the key-step reactants and reaction intermediates. By applying unsupervised machine learning and statistical analysis to a dataset comprising nearly 160 metallic alloys, we offer a powerful tool for catalyst discovery. We propose new promising candidates such as ZnRh and ZnPt$_3$, which to our knowledge, have not yet been tested, and discuss their possible advantage in terms of stability.</description>

      <title>Spin photonic topological metasurface based on kagome lattice and leaky-wave application</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03193v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The emerging field of topological metasurfaces offers unique advantages, particularly in robustness against backscattering in low-profile structures. The lattice configuration of these structures significantly influences the ability to achieve sharp turns in the propagation path. One of the most studied lattices in condensed matter physics is the kagome lattice, characterized by its hexagonal Brillouin zone, which displays a Dirac cone in its dispersion diagram. Previous research on kagome lattices in photonic topological insulators has primarily focused on valley types of insulators. This article introduces a spin topological metasurface based on the kagome lattice and its unit cell, enabling a broad range of sharp turns and propagation paths. The unit cell is compared to its hexagonal and 60-degree rhombic counterparts, and a parametric study of its dimensions is conducted. As a result of this research, a new X-band leaky-wave antenna designed in the kagome lattice with an armchair arrangement interface has been developed. This antenna provides two forward and two backward beams, each pair achieving an approximately 50-degree scan within the 8.8 to 11.1 GHz bandwidth.</description>
