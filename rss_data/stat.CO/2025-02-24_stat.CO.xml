      <title>Low degree conjecture implies sharp computational thresholds in stochastic block model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate implications of the (extended) low-degree conjecture (recently formalized in [MW23]) in the context of the symmetric stochastic block model. Assuming the conjecture holds, we establish that no polynomial-time algorithm can weakly recover community labels below the Kesten-Stigum (KS) threshold. In particular, we rule out polynomial-time estimators that, with constant probability, achieve correlation with the true communities that is significantly better than random. Whereas, above the KS threshold, polynomial-time algorithms are known to achieve constant correlation with the true communities with high probability[Mas14,AS15].
  To our knowledge, we provide the first rigorous evidence for the sharp transition in recovery rate for polynomial-time algorithms at the KS threshold. Notably, under a stronger version of the low-degree conjecture, our lower bound remains valid even when the number of blocks diverges. Furthermore, our results provide evidence of a computational-to-statistical gap in learning the parameters of stochastic block models.
  In contrast to prior work, which either (i) rules out polynomial-time algorithms for hypothesis testing with 1-o(1) success probability [Hopkins18, BBK+21a] under the low-degree conjecture, or (ii) rules out low-degree polynomials for learning the edge connection probability matrix [LG23], our approach provides stronger lower bounds on the recovery and learning problem.
  Our proof combines low-degree lower bounds from [Hopkins18, BBK+21a] with graph splitting and cross-validation techniques. In order to rule out general recovery algorithms, we employ the correlation preserving projection method developed in [HS17].</description>

      <title>Network topology of the Euro Area interbank market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapidly increasing availability of large amounts of granular financial data, paired with the advances of big data related technologies induces the need of suitable analytics that can represent and extract meaningful information from such data. In this paper we propose a multi-layer network approach to distill the Euro Area (EA) banking system in different distinct layers. Each layer of the network represents a specific type of financial relationship between banks, based on various sources of EA granular data collections. The resulting multi-layer network allows one to describe, analyze and compare the topology and structure of EA banks from different perspectives, eventually yielding a more complete picture of the financial market. This granular information representation has the potential to enable researchers and practitioners to better apprehend financial system dynamics as well as to support financial policies to manage and monitor financial risk from a more holistic point of view.</description>

      <title>Improvements on Scalable Stochastic Bayesian Inference Methods for Multivariate Hawkes Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.14658v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multivariate Hawkes Processes (MHPs) are a class of point processes that can account for complex temporal dynamics among event sequences. In this work, we study the accuracy and computational efficiency of three classes of algorithms which, while widely used in the context of Bayesian inference, have rarely been applied in the context of MHPs: stochastic gradient expectation-maximization, stochastic gradient variational inference and stochastic gradient Langevin Monte Carlo. An important contribution of this paper is a novel approximation to the likelihood function that allows us to retain the computational advantages associated with conjugate settings while reducing approximation errors associated with the boundary effects. The comparisons are based on various simulated scenarios as well as an application to the study the risk dynamics in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 intraday index prices among its 11 sectors.</description>

      <title>Fast and light-weight energy statistics using the \textit{R} package \textsf{Rfast}</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02849v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Energy statistics, also known as $\mathcal{\varepsilon}$-statistics, are functions of distances between statistical observations. This class of functions has enabled the development of non-linear statistical concepts, such as distance variance, distance covariance, and distance correlation. However, the computational burden associated with $\mathcal{\varepsilon}$-statistics is substantial, particularly when the data reside in multivariate space. To address this challenge, we have developed a method to significantly reduce memory requirements and accelerate computations, thereby facilitating the analysis of large data sets. The following cases are demonstrated: univariate and multivariate distance variance, distance covariance, partial distance correlation, energy distance, and hypothesis testing for the equality of univariate distributions.</description>

      <title>The inverse Kalman filter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10089v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the inverse Kalman filter (IKF), which enables exact matrix-vector multiplication between a covariance matrix from a dynamic linear model and any real-valued vector with linear computational cost. We integrate the IKF with the conjugate gradient algorithm, which substantially accelerates the computation of matrix inversion for a general form of covariance matrix, where other approximation approaches may not be directly applicable. We demonstrate the scalability and efficiency of the IKF approach through applications in nonparametric estimation of particle interaction functions, using both simulations and real cell trajectory data.</description>
