      <title>Conjugacy-invariant random walks on nilpotent groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish bounds on the mixing times of conjugacy-invariant random walks on finite nilpotent groups in terms of the mixing times of their projections onto the abelianization. This comparison framework shows that, in several natural cases of interest, the mixing behavior on a nilpotent group is governed by that of the projected walk on the abelianization, reducing the study of mixing to a simpler problem in the Abelian setting. As an application, these bounds yield cutoff for two examples of conjugacy-invariant walks on unit upper-triangular matrix groups previously studied by Arias-Castro, Diaconis, and Stanley (2004) and by Nestoridi (2019).</description>

      <title>Explosivity in 1-d Activated Random Walk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that Activated Random Walk on $\mathbb{Z}$ is explosive above criticality. That is, activating a single particle in a supercritical state of sleeping particles triggers an infinite avalanche of activity with positive probability. This extends the same result recently proven by Brown, Hoffman, and Son for i.i.d. initial distributions to the setting of ergodic ones, thus completing the proof of a conjecture of Rolla's in dimension one. As a corollary we obtain that, for supercritical ergodic initial distributions with any positive density of particles initially active, the system will stay active almost surely. Our result is another piece of evidence attesting to the universality of the phase transition of Activated Random Walk on $\mathbb{Z}$.</description>

      <title>Sharp concentration inequality for the sum of random variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a universal concentration bound for sums of random variables under arbitrary dependence, and we prove it is asymptotically optimal for every fixed common marginal law. The concentration bound is a direct - yet previously unnoticed - consequence of the subadditivity of expected shortfall, a property well known to financial statisticians. The sharpness result is a significant contribution relying on the construction of worst-case dependency profiles between identically distributed random variables.</description>

      <title>Moment inequalities for higher-order (inverse) stochastic dominance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic dominance has been studied extensively, particularly in the finance and economics literature. In this paper, we obtain two results. First, necessary conditions for higher-order inverse stochastic dominance are developed. These conditions, which involve moment inequalities of the minimum order statistics, are analogous to the ones obtained by Fishburn (1980b) for usual higher-order stochastic dominance. Second, we investigate how background risk variables influence usual higher-order stochastic dominance. The main result generalizes the ones in Pomatto et al. (2020) from the first-order and second-order stochastic dominance to the higher-order.</description>

      <title>The Feller diffusion as the limit of a coalescent point process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Feller diffusion is studied as the limit of a coalescent point process in which the density of the node height distribution is skewed towards zero. Using a unified approach, a number of recent results pertaining to scaling limits of branching processes are reinterpreted as properties of the Feller diffusion arising from this limit. The notion of Bernoulli sampling of a finite population is extended to the diffusion limit to cover finite Poisson-distributed samples drawn from infinite continuum populations. We show that the coalescent tree of a Poisson-sampled Feller diffusion corresponds to a coalescent point process with a node height distribution taking the same algebraic form as that of a Bernoulli-sampled birth-death process. By adapting methods for analysing k-sampled birth-death processes, in which the sample size is pre-specified, we develop methods for studying the coalescent properties of the k-sampled Feller diffusion.</description>

      <title>Stationary hitting times on vertex-transitive graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a refined version of the Aldous and Brown's exponential approximation of stationary hitting times. These are valid for all reversible Markov chains. We then specialise our estimates for vertex-transitive graphs, where we obtain improved bounds which depend on the growth of the graphs. The most delicate cases are when the diameter is comparable to that of low-dimensional tori. In particular, in "dimensions" less than four (up to logarithmic factors) our error terms are the square of those of Aldous and Brown. These improved bounds play a crucial role in the companion work arXiv:2202.02255 characterising the fluctuations of the cover time on vertex-transitive graphs.</description>

      <title>Harmonic polynomials and other exactly computable characteristics for $2$-dimensional random walks in cones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note we consider $2$-dimensional lattice random walks killed at leaving a wedge with opening $\alpha\in(0,\pi]$. Assuming that the walk cannot jump over the boundary of the wedge we prove that there exists a harmonic polynomial if and only if $\alpha=\pi/m$ with some integer $m$. Our proof is constructive and allows one to give exact expressions for harmonic polynomials for every integer $m$. Furthermore, we give exact expressions for all finite moments of the exit time, this result is valid for all angles $\alpha$.</description>

      <title>A Probabilistic Generalization of the Mazur-Ulam Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical Mazur-Ulam theorem establishes that every surjective isometry between normed real vector spaces is an affine transformation. In various applied mathematical settings, however, one encounters maps that preserve distances not pointwise, but almost everywhere with respect to a probability measure. This paper provides a rigorous generalization of the Mazur-Ulam theorem to probability spaces. We prove that if a measurable map on a subset of Rd preserves distances almost everywhere with respect to a measure with full-dimensional support, it coincides almost everywhere with a global Euclidean isometry, defined as an orthogonal transformation followed by a translation.</description>

      <title>Limit theorems for non-local functionals of smooth Gaussian fields via quasi-association</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many classical objects of study related to the geometry/topology of smooth Gaussian fields (e.g. the volume, surface area or Euler characteristic of excursion sets) have a `locality' property which is crucial to their analysis. More recently, progress has been made in studying `non-local' quantities of such fields (e.g. the component/nodal count or the Betti numbers of excursion sets). In this work we establish limit theorems for non-local, approximately additive functionals of stationary fields evaluated on growing domains. Specifically we show that, for weakly dependent fields, such functionals satisfy a law of large numbers, have variance which is asymptotic to the volume of the domain and satisfy both quantitative and almost-sure central limit theorems. Our approach uses a covariance formula for topological events to establish a form of quasi-association for the functionals.</description>

      <title>The Power Problem for Generalized Gamma Convolutions (GGC) and Related Questions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The class of generalized gamma convolutions (GGC) is closed with respect to (wrt) change of scales, weak limits and addition and multiplication of independent random variables. Our main result adds the new property that GGC is also closed wrt q-th powers, q&gt;1. The proof uses explicit formulas for the densities of finite sums of independent gamma variables, hyperbolically completely monotone functions (HCM) and the Laplace transform. The result is applied to sums and products of independent gamma variables and to symmetric extended GGC (symEGGC).</description>

      <title>TV homogenization inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the total variation distance under two information-erasing maps on inhomogeneous Bernoulli product measures: summation and homogenization. While summation is a Markov kernel and hence satisfies the usual data processing inequality, homogenization -- which maps each Bernoulli parameter to the cumulative mean -- is not. Nevertheless, we prove that the homogenization map also reduces the TV distance, up to a universal constant. The argument is based on an explicit two-sided control of the TV distance between Poisson binomials, obtained via a parameter interpolation and a second-moment extraction lemma.</description>

      <title>Ergodic Theorems and Equivalence of Green's Kernel for Random Walks in Random Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Ergodic Properties of Random Walks in stationary ergodic environments without uniform ellipticity under a minimal assumption. There are two main components in our work. The first step is to adopt the arguments of Lawler to first prove a uniqueness principle. We use a more general definition of environments using~\textit{Environment Functions}. As a corollary, we can deduce an invariance principle under these assumptions for balanced environments under some assumptions. We also use the uniqueness principle to show that any balanced, elliptic random walk must have the same transience behaviour as the simple symmetric random walk. The second is to transfer the results we deduce in balanced environments to general ergodic environments(under some assumptions) using a control technique to derive a measure under which the \textit{local process} is stationary and ergodic. As a consequence of our results, we deduce the Law of Large Numbers for the Random Walk and an Invariance Principle under our assumptions.</description>

      <title>Optimal Quantization of Finite Uniform Data on the Sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a systematic and geometric theory of optimal quantization on the unit sphere $\mathbb S^2$, focusing on finite uniform probability distributions supported on the spherical surface - rather than on lower-dimensional geodesic subsets such as circles or arcs. We first establish the existence of optimal sets of $n$-means and characterize them through centroidal spherical Voronoi tessellations. Three fundamental structural results are obtained. First, a cluster - purity theorem shows that when the support consists of well-separated components, each optimal Voronoi region remains confined to a single component. Second, a ring - allocation (discrete water - filling) theorem provides an explicit rule describing how optimal representatives are distributed across multiple latitudinal rings, together with closed-form distortion formulas. Third, a Lipschitz - type stability theorem quantifies the robustness of optimal configurations under small geodesic perturbations of the support. In addition, a spherical analogue of Lloyd's algorithm is presented, in which intrinsic (Karcher) means replace Euclidean centroids for iterative refinement. These results collectively provide a unified and transparent framework for understanding the geometric and algorithmic structure of optimal quantization on $\mathbb S^2$.</description>

      <title>SIGMA: Scalable Spectral Insights for LLM Collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid adoption of synthetic data for training Large Language Models (LLMs) has introduced the technical challenge of "model collapse"-a degenerative process where recursive training on model-generated content leads to a contraction of distributional variance and representational quality. While the phenomenology of collapse is increasingly evident, rigorous methods to quantify and predict its onset in high-dimensional spaces remain elusive. In this paper, we introduce SIGMA (Spectral Inequalities for Gram Matrix Analysis), a unified framework that benchmarks model collapse through the spectral lens of the embedding Gram matrix. By deriving and utilizing deterministic and stochastic bounds on the matrix's spectrum, SIGMA provides a mathematically grounded metric to track the contraction of the representation space. Crucially, our stochastic formulation enables scalable estimation of these bounds, making the framework applicable to large-scale foundation models where full eigendecomposition is intractable. We demonstrate that SIGMA effectively captures the transition towards degenerate states, offering both theoretical insights into the mechanics of collapse and a practical, scalable tool for monitoring the health of recursive training pipelines.</description>

      <title>Policy Synthesis for Interval MDPs via Polyhedral Lyapunov Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decision-making under uncertainty is central to many safety-critical applications, where decisions must be guided by probabilistic modeling formalisms. This paper introduces a novel approach to policy synthesis in multi-objective interval Markov decision processes using polyhedral Lyapunov functions. Unlike previous Lyapunov-based methods that mainly rely on quadratic functions, our method utilizes polyhedral functions to enhance accuracy in managing uncertainties within value iteration of dynamic programming. We reformulate the value iteration algorithm as a switched affine system with interval uncertainties and apply control-theoretic stability principles to synthesize policies that guide the system toward a desired target set. By constructing an invariant set of attraction, we ensure that the synthesized policies provide convergence guarantees while minimizing the impact of transition uncertainty in the underlying model. Our methodology removes the need for computationally intensive Pareto curve computations by directly determining a policy that brings objectives within a specified range of their target values. We validate our approach through numerical case studies, including a recycling robot and an electric vehicle battery, demonstrating its effectiveness in achieving policy synthesis under uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Kantorovich-Type Stochastic Neural Network Operators for the Mean-Square Approximation of Certain Second-Order Stochastic Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial neural network operators (ANNOs) have been widely used for approximating deterministic input-output functions; however, their extension to random dynamics remains comparatively unexplored. In this paper, we construct a new class of \textbf{Kantorovich-type Stochastic Neural Network Operators (K-SNNOs)} in which randomness is incorporated not at the coefficient level, but through \textbf{stochastic neurons} driven by stochastic integrators. This framework enables the operator to inherit the probabilistic structure of the underlying process, making it suitable for modeling and approximating stochastic signals. We establish mean-square convergence of K-SNNOs to the target stochastic process and derive quantitative error estimates expressing the rate of approximation in terms of the modulus of continuity. Numerical simulations further validate the theoretical results by demonstrating accurate reconstruction of sample paths and rapid decay of the mean square error (MSE). Graphical results, including sample-wise approximations and empirical MSE behaviour, illustrate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed stochastic-neuron-based operator.</description>

      <title>Matrix Riccati BSDEs with singular terminal condition and stochastic LQ control with linear terminal constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze a class of multidimensional linear-quadratic stochastic control problems with random coefficients, motivated by multi-asset optimal trade execution. The problems feature non-diffusive controlled state dynamics and a terminal constraint that restricts the terminal state to a prescribed random linear subspace. We derive the associated Riccati backward stochastic differential equation (BSDE) and identify a suitable formalization of its singular terminal condition. Via a penalization approach, we establish existence of a minimal supersolution of the Riccati BSDE and use it to characterize both the value function and the optimal control. We analyze the asymptotic behavior of the supersolution near terminal time and discuss special cases where closed-form solutions can be obtained.</description>

      <title>Fractional heat content asymptotics for Carnot groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel approach for studying small-time asymptotics of the fractional heat content of $C^2$ non-characteristic domains in Carnot groups. Denoting the sub-Laplacian operator by $\mathcal{L}$, the fractional heat content of a bounded domain $\Omega$ is defined as $Q^{(\alpha)}_\Omega(t)=\int_{\Omega} u_\alpha(t,x)dx$, where $u_\alpha$ is the solution to the heat equation corresponding to the fractional sub-Laplacian $\mathcal{L}_\alpha:=\mathcal{L}^{\alpha/2}$ with Dirichlet boundary condition on $\Omega$. We prove that for $1\le\alpha\le 2$, there exists explict rate function $\mu_\alpha: (0,\infty)\to (0,\infty)$ such that \[ \lim_{t\to 0}\frac{|\Omega|-Q^{(\alpha)}_\Omega(t)}{\mu_\alpha(t)}=|\partial\Omega|_H, \] where $|\partial\Omega|_H$ is the horizontal perimeter of $\Omega$. Moreover, the rate function $\mu_\alpha$ coincides with the same for the Euclidean case.</description>

      <title>Sharp Transitions and Systemic Risk in Sparse Financial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study contagion and systemic risk in sparse financial networks with balance-sheet interactions on a directed random graph. Each institution has homogeneous liabilities and equity, and exposures along outgoing edges are split equally across counterparties. A linear fraction of institutions have zero out-degree in sparse digraphs; we adopt an external-liability convention that makes the exposure mapping well-defined without altering propagation. We isolate a single-hit transmission mechanism and encode it by a sender-truncated subgraph G_sh. We define adversarial and random systemic events with shock size k_n = c log n and systemic fraction epsilon n. In the subcritical regime rho_out &lt; 1, we prove that maximal forward reachability in G_sh is O(log n) with high probability, yielding O((log n)^2) cascades from shocks of size k_n. For random shocks, we give an explicit fan-in accumulation bound, showing that multi-hit defaults are negligible with high probability when the explored default set is polylogarithmic. In the supercritical regime, we give an exact distributional representation of G_sh as an i.i.d.-outdegree random digraph with uniform destinations, placing it within the scope of the strong-giant/bow-tie theorem of Penrose (2014). We derive the resulting implication for random-shock systemic events. Finally, we explain why sharp-threshold machinery does not directly apply: systemic-event properties need not be monotone in the edge set because adding outgoing edges reduces per-edge exposure.</description>

      <title>Random knotting in very long off-lattice self-avoiding polygons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present experimental results on knotting in off-lattice self-avoiding polygons in the bead-chain model. Using Clisby's tree data structure and the scale-free pivot algorithm, for each $k$ between $10$ and $27$ we generated $2^{43-k}$ polygons of size $n=2^k$. Using a new knot diagram simplification and invariant-free knot classification code, we were able to determine the precise knot type of each polygon. The results show that the number of prime summands of knot type $K$ in a random $n$-gon is very well described by a Poisson distribution. We estimate the characteristic length of knotting as $656500 \pm 2500$. We use the count of summands for large $n$ to measure knotting rates and amplitude ratios of knot probabilities more accurately than previous experiments. Our calculations agree quite well with previous on-lattice computations, and support both knot localization and the knot entropy conjecture.</description>

      <title>Active subspace methods and derivative-based Shapley effects for functions with non-independent variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lower-dimensional subspaces that impact estimates of uncertainty are often described by Linear combinations of input variables, leading to active variables. This paper extends the derivative-based active subspace methods and derivative-based Shapley effects to cope with functions with non-independent variables, and it introduces sensitivity-based active subspaces. While derivative-based subspace methods focus on directions along which the function exhibits significant variation, sensitivity-based subspace methods seek a reduced set of active variables that enables a reduction in the function's variance. We propose both theoretical results using the recent development of gradients of functions with non-independent variables and practical settings by making use of optimal computations of gradients, which admit dimension-free upper-bounds of the biases and the parametric rate of convergence. Simulations show that the relative performance of derivative-based and sensitivity-based active subspaces methods varies across different functions.</description>

      <title>On the Absolute-Value Integral of a Brownian Motion with Drift: Exact and Asymptotic Formulae</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.04172v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present paper is concerned with the integral of the absolute value of a Brownian motion with drift. By establishing an asymptotic expansion of the space Laplace transform, we obtain series representations for the probability density function and cumulative distribution function of the integral, making use of Meijer's G-function. A functional recursive formula is derived for the moments, which is shown to yield only exponentials and Gauss' error function up to arbitrary orders, permitting exact computations. To obtain sharp asymptotic estimates for small- and large-deviation probabilities, we employ a marginal space-time Laplace transform and apply a newly developed generalization of Laplace's method to exponential Airy integrals. The impact of drift on the complete distribution of the integral is explored in depth. The resultant new formulae complement existing ones in the standard Brownian motion case to great extent in terms of both theoretical generality and modeling capacity and have been presented for easy implementation, which numerical experiments demonstrate.</description>

      <title>Global Dynamics of Granular Media Equations via Stochastic Order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01364v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the rich dynamics of one-dimensional granular media equations with attractive quadratic interactions. Building on the monotone dynamical systems framework developed in an earlier work, we allow for multiplicative noise, in contrast to most existing results restricted to additive noise. Within this framework, we show that, in the one-dimensional setting, invariant measures are totally ordered with respect to the stochastic order. The basins of attraction of the minimal and maximal invariant measures contain unbounded open sets in the 2-Wasserstein space, which is vacant in previous research even for additive noises. Also, our main results address the global convergence to the order interval enclosed by the minimal and maximal invariant measures, and an alternating arrangement of invariant measures in terms of stability (locally attracting) and instability (as the backward limit of a connecting orbit). Our theorems cover a wide range of classical granular media equations, such as double-well and multi-well landscapes. Specific values for the parameter ranges, explicit descriptions of attracting sets and phase diagrams are provided.</description>

      <title>Sharp estimates for large N Weingarten functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15892v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Weingarten functions provide a tool for computing Haar measure matrix integrals of polynomials in the matrix entries. An important property of Weingarten functions, is their particularly simple large $N$ limits. In 2017 Benoit Collins and Sho Matsumoto studied when this limit holds for Weingarten functions associated to integrals of products of $2n$ matrix entries, as $n \to \infty$, together with the matrix size $N$. They showed that the large $N$ limit is uniformly achieved as long as $n=o(N^{4/7})$, a result which already has applications to strong asymptotic freeness. However, their result is not optimal. They conjectured that their result should actually hold up to $n=o(N^{2/3})$ which is optimal. We prove this conjecture for the matrix groups $G \in \{\mathrm{U}(N)$, $\mathrm{O}(N)$, $\mathrm{Sp}(N)\}$. The proof proceeds by introducing a Markov process on permutations (pairings) which we call the unitary (orthogonal) $\textit{Weingarten process}$. We believe this process may have further applications to the theory of Weingarten functions. We also prove two new bounds regarding the large $N$ limit of the Weingarten function in the regimes when $n=o(N^{4/5})$, and $n=o(N)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02348v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Liouville field theory has long been a cornerstone of two-dimensional quantum field theory and quantum gravity, which has attracted much recent attention in the mathematics literature. Timelike Liouville field theory is a version of Liouville field theory where the kinetic term in the action appears with a negative sign, which makes it closer to a theory of quantum gravity than ordinary (spacelike) Liouville field theory. Making sense of this `wrong sign' requires a theory of Gaussian random variables with negative variance. Such a theory is developed in this paper, and is used to prove the timelike DOZZ formula for the $3$-point correlation function when the parameters satisfy the so-called `charge neutrality condition'. Expressions are derived also for the $k$-point correlation functions for all $k\ge 3$, and it is shown that these functions approach the correct semiclassical limits as the coupling constant is sent to zero</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13712v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically and computationally investigate long-memory processes based on the Markovian lifts of affine jump-diffusion processes. A nominal superposition process consisting of an infinite number of interacting affine processes is considered, along with its finite-dimensional version and associated generalized Riccati equations. We propose a splitting scheme suited to the Markovian lifts where jump and diffusion parts are dealt with separately based on recently developed exact discretization methods. We examine the computational performance of the scheme through comparisons with the analytical results. We also numerically investigate a more complex model arising in the environmental sciences and some extended cases in which superposed processes belong to a class of nonlinear processes that generalize affine processes.</description>

Under a mild assumption on the growth rate of $k_n$, we prove that the distribution of the $p$-Sylow subgroup of the cokernel of $A_n$ converges to that of Cohen--Lenstra for every prime $p$. Our result extends the work of A. M\'esz\'aros which established convergence to the Cohen--Lenstra distribution when $p \ge 5$ and $k_n=3$ for all positive integers $n$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02622v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we will consider the LAN property for both the Hurst parameter $H&gt;3/4$ and the variance of the fractional Brownian motion plus an independent standard Brownian motion (called mixed fractional Brownian motion) with high-frequency observation. We will first remove the $H$-score linear term and orthogonalize the remainder through two non-diagonal transformations, then we can construct the CLT for the quadratic form base on $\| \cdot \|_{\mathrm{op}}/\|\cdot\|_F\to0$. At last we obtain a diagonal Gaussian LAN expansion with an explicit information matrix. Beyond the case of $H&gt;3/4$, we also present that the $\| \cdot \|_{\mathrm{op}}/\|\cdot\|_F\to0$ method is also useful for the case of $H&lt;3/4$ and the proof will be concise compared with the Whittle translation method. We consider that this method can be applied to this type of problem, including the fractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model and mixed fractional O-U process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.13579v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel approach to numerically approximate McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equations (MV-SDE) using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) while avoiding the use of interacting particle systems (IPS) {and the associated simulation costs required to achieve the ``propagation of chaos'' limit}. The SGD technique is deployed to solve a Euclidean minimization problem, obtained by first representing the MV-SDE as a minimization problem over the set of continuous functions of time, and then approximating the domain with a finite-dimensional subspace. Convergence is established by proving certain intermediate stability and moment estimates of the relevant stochastic processes, including the tangent processes. Numerical experiments illustrate the competitive performance of our SGD based method compared to the IPS benchmarks. This work offers a theoretical foundation for using the SGD method in the context of numerical approximation of MV-SDEs, and provides analytical tools to study its stability and convergence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.19386v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article considers the variational wave equation with viscosity and transport noise as a system of three coupled nonlinear stochastic partial differential equations. We prove pathwise global existence, uniqueness, and temporal continuity of solutions to this system in $L^2_x$. Martingale solutions are extracted from a two-level Galerkin approximation via the Skorokhod--Jakubowski theorem. We use the apparatus of Dudley maps to streamline this stochastic compactness method, bypassing the usual martingale identification argument. Pathwise uniqueness for the system is established through a renormalisation procedure that involves double commutator estimates and a delicate handling of noise and nonlinear terms. New model-specific commutator estimates are proven.</description>

With a probabilistic method, we study the well-posedness of the forward-backward stochastic differential equations (FBSDEs) associated with the MFG and arising from the maximum principle, and estimate the corresponding Jacobian and Hessian flows. We further establish the classical regularity of the value functional $V$; in particular, we show that when the cost function is $C^3$ in the spatial and control variables and $C^2$ in the distribution argument, then the value functional is $C^1$ in time and $C^2$ in the spatial and distribution variables. As a consequence, the value functional $V$ is the unique classical solution of the degenerate MFG master equation.</description>

      <title>Rapid Mixing at the Uniqueness Threshold</title>

Abstract: Over the past decades, a fascinating computational phase transition has been identified in sampling from Gibbs distributions. Though, the computational complexity at the critical point remains poorly understood, as previous algorithmic and hardness results all required a constant slack from this threshold.
  In this paper, we resolve this open question at the critical phase transition threshold, thus completing the picture of the computational phase transition. We show that for the hardcore model on graphs with maximum degree $\Delta\ge 3$ at the uniqueness threshold $\lambda = \lambda_c(\Delta)$, the mixing time of Glauber dynamics is upper bounded by a polynomial in $n$, but is not nearly linear in the worst case.
  For the Ising model (either antiferromagnetic or ferromagnetic), we establish similar results. For the Ising model on graphs with maximum degree $\Delta\ge 3$ at the critical temperature $\beta$ where $|\beta| = \beta_c(\Delta)$, with the tree-uniqueness threshold $\beta_c(\Delta)$, we show that the mixing time of Glauber dynamics is upper bounded by $\tilde{O}\left(n^{3 + O(1/\Delta)}\right)$ and lower bounded by $\Omega\left(n^{3/2}\right)$ in the worst case. For the Ising model specified by a critical interaction matrix $J$ with $\left \lVert J \right \rVert_2=1$, we obtain an upper bound $\tilde{O}(n^{3/2})$ for the mixing time, matching the lower bound $\Omega\left(n^{3/2}\right)$ on the complete graph up to a logarithmic factor.
  Our mixing time upper bounds are derived from a new interpretation and analysis of the localization scheme method introduced by Chen and Eldan (2022), applied to the field dynamics for the hardcore model and the proximal sampler for the Ising model. As key steps in both our upper and lower bounds, we establish sub-linear upper and lower bounds for spectral independence at the critical point for worst-case instances.</description>

      <title>Active operator learning with predictive uncertainty quantification for partial differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03178v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the increased prevalence of neural operators being used to provide rapid solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs), understanding the accuracy of model predictions and the associated error levels is necessary for deploying reliable surrogate models in scientific applications. Existing uncertainty quantification (UQ) frameworks employ ensembles or Bayesian methods, which can incur substantial computational costs during both training and inference. We propose a lightweight predictive UQ method tailored for Deep operator networks (DeepONets) that also generalizes to other operator networks. Numerical experiments on linear and nonlinear PDEs demonstrate that the framework's uncertainty estimates are unbiased and provide accurate out-of-distribution uncertainty predictions with a sufficiently large training dataset. Our framework provides fast inference and uncertainty estimates that can efficiently drive outer-loop analyses that would be prohibitively expensive with conventional solvers. We demonstrate how predictive uncertainties can be used in the context of Bayesian optimization and active learning problems to yield improvements in accuracy and data-efficiency for outer-loop optimization procedures. In the active learning setup, we extend the framework to Fourier Neural Operators (FNO) and describe a generalized method for other operator networks. To enable real-time deployment, we introduce an inference strategy based on precomputed trunk outputs and a sparse placement matrix, reducing evaluation time by more than a factor of five. Our method provides a practical route to uncertainty-aware operator learning in time-sensitive settings.</description>

      <title>Improved Mixing of Critical Hardcore Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07515v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The hardcore model is one of the most classic and widely studied examples of undirected graphical models. Given a graph $G$, the hardcore model describes a Gibbs distribution of $\lambda$-weighted independent sets of $G$. In the last two decades, a beautiful computational phase transition has been established at a precise threshold $\lambda_c(\Delta)$ where $\Delta$ denotes the maximum degree, where the task of sampling independent sets transitions from polynomial-time solvable to computationally intractable. We study the critical hardcore model where $\lambda = \lambda_c(\Delta)$ and show that the Glauber dynamics, a simple yet popular Markov chain algorithm, mixes in $\tilde{O}(n^{4+O(1/\Delta)})$ time on any $n$-vertex graph of maximum degree $\Delta\geq3$, significantly improving the previous upper bound $\tilde{O}(n^{12.88+O(1/\Delta)})$ by the recent work arXiv:2411.03413. Our improvement comes from an optimal bound on the $\ell_\infty$-spectral independence for the hardcore model at all subcritical fugacity $\lambda &lt; \lambda_c(\Delta)$.</description>

      <title>The maximum-average subtensor problem: equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15400v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce and study the Maximum-Average Subtensor ($p$-MAS) problem, in which one wants to find a subtensor of size $k$ of a given random tensor of size $N$, both of order $p$, with maximum sum of entries. We are motivated by recent work on the matrix case of the problem in which several equilibrium and non-equilibrium properties have been characterized analytically in the asymptotic regime $1 \ll k \ll N$, and a puzzling phenomenon was observed involving the coexistence of a clustered equilibrium phase and an efficient algorithm which produces submatrices in this phase. Here we extend previous results on equilibrium and algorithmic properties for the matrix case to the tensor case. We show that the tensor case has a similar equilibrium phase diagram as the matrix case, and an overall similar phenomenology for the considered algorithms. Additionally, we consider out-of-equilibrium landscape properties using Overlap Gap Properties and Franz-Parisi analysis, and discuss the implications or lack-thereof for average-case algorithmic hardness.</description>

      <title>The Mean-Field Dynamics of Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01868v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a mathematical framework that interprets Transformer attention as an interacting particle system and studies its continuum (mean-field) limits. By idealizing attention on the sphere, we connect Transformer dynamics to Wasserstein gradient flows, synchronization models (Kuramoto), and mean-shift clustering. Central to our results is a global clustering phenomenon whereby tokens cluster asymptotically after long metastable states where they are arranged into multiple clusters. We further analyze a tractable equiangular reduction to obtain exact clustering rates, show how commonly used normalization schemes alter contraction speeds, and identify a phase transition for long-context attention. The results highlight both the mechanisms that drive representation collapse and the regimes that preserve expressive, multi-cluster structure in deep attention architectures.</description>

      <title>Determining subgroups via stationary measures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12966v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider random walks on the isometry groups of general metric spaces. Under some mild conditions, we show that if two non-elementary random walks on a discrete subgroup of the isometry group have non-singular stationary measures, then subgroups generated by the random walks are commensurable. This result in particular applies to separable Gromov hyperbolic spaces and Teichm\"uller spaces. As a specific application, we prove singularity between stationary measures associated to random walks on different fiber subgroups of the fundamental group of a hyperbolic 3-manifold fibering over the circle.</description>

      <title>Lambda Expected Shortfall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23139v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Lambda Value-at-Risk (Lambda-VaR) is a generalization of the Value-at-Risk (VaR), which has been actively studied in quantitative finance. Over the past two decades, the Expected Shortfall (ES) has become one of the most important risk measures alongside VaR because of its various desirable properties in the practice of optimization, risk management, and financial regulation. Analogously to the intimate relation between ES and VaR, we introduce the Lambda Expected Shortfall (Lambda-ES), as a generalization of ES and a counterpart to Lambda-VaR. Our definition of Lambda-ES has an explicit formula and many convenient properties, and we show that it is the smallest quasi-convex and law-invariant risk measure dominating Lambda-VaR under mild assumptions. We examine further properties of Lambda-ES, its dual representation, and related optimization problems.</description>
