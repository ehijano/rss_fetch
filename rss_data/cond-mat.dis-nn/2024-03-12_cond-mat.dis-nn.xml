      <title>A Parisi Formula for Quantum Spin Glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish three equivalent versions of a Parisi formula for the free energy of mean-field spin glasses in a transversal magnetic field. These results are derived from available results for classical vector spin glasses by an approximation method using the functional integral representation of the partition function. In this approach, the order parameter is a non-decreasing function with values in the non-negative, real hermitian Hilbert-Schmidt operators. For the quantum Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model, we also show that under the assumption of self-averaging of the self-overlap, the optimising Parisi order parameter is found within a two-dimensional subspace spanned by the self-overlap and the fully stationary overlap.</description>

      <title>Universal Origin of Glassy Relaxation as Recognized by Configuration Pattern-matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relaxation processes are crucial in understanding the structural rearrangements of liquids and amorphous materials. However, the overarching principle that governs these processes across vastly different materials remains an open question. Substantial analysis has been carried out based on the motions of individual particles. Here, alternatively, we propose viewing the global configuration as a single entity. We introduce a global order parameter, namely the inherent structure minimal displacement (IS Dmin), to quantify the variability of configurations by a pattern-matching technique. Through atomic simulations of seven model glass-forming liquids, we unify the influences of temperature, pressure, and perturbation time on the relaxation dissipation, via a scaling law between the mechanical damping factor and IS Dmin. Fundamentally, this scaling reflects the curvature of the local potential energy landscape. Our findings uncover a universal origin of glassy relaxation and offer an alternative approach to studying disordered systems.</description>

      <title>A Gaussian integral that counts regular graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a recent article J. Phys. Compl. 4 (2023) 035005, Kawamoto evoked statistical physics methods for the problem of counting graphs with a prescribed degree sequence. This treatment involved truncating a particular Taylor expansion at the first two terms, which resulted in the Bender-Canfield estimate for the graph counts. This is surprisingly successful since the Bender-Canfield formula is asymptotically accurate for large graphs, while the series truncation does not a priori suggest a similar level of accuracy.
  We upgrade the above treatment in three directions. First, we derive an exact formula for counting d-regular graphs in terms of a d-dimensional Gaussian integral. Second, we show how to convert this formula into an integral representation for the generating function of d-regular graph counts. Third, we perform explicit saddle point analysis for large graph sizes and identify the saddle point configurations responsible for graph count estimates. In these saddle point configurations, only two of the integration variables condense to significant values, while the remaining ones approach zero for large graphs. This provides an underlying picture that justifies Kawamoto's earlier findings.</description>

      <title>Cell reprogramming design by transfer learning of functional transcriptional networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent developments in synthetic biology, next-generation sequencing, and machine learning provide an unprecedented opportunity to rationally design new disease treatments based on measured responses to gene perturbations and drugs to reprogram cells. The main challenges to seizing this opportunity are the incomplete knowledge of the cellular network and the combinatorial explosion of possible interventions, both of which are insurmountable by experiments. To address these challenges, we develop a transfer learning approach to control cell behavior that is pre-trained on transcriptomic data associated with human cell fates, thereby generating a model of the network dynamics that can be transferred to specific reprogramming goals. The approach combines transcriptional responses to gene perturbations to minimize the difference between a given pair of initial and target transcriptional states. We demonstrate our approach's versatility by applying it to a microarray dataset comprising &gt;9,000 microarrays across 54 cell types and 227 unique perturbations, and an RNASeq dataset consisting of &gt;10,000 sequencing runs across 36 cell types and 138 perturbations. Our approach reproduces known reprogramming protocols with an AUROC of 0.91 while innovating over existing methods by pre-training an adaptable model that can be tailored to specific reprogramming transitions. We show that the number of gene perturbations required to steer from one fate to another increases with decreasing developmental relatedness and that fewer genes are needed to progress along developmental paths than to regress. These findings establish a proof-of-concept for our approach to computationally design control strategies and provide insights into how gene regulatory networks govern phenotype.</description>

      <title>Detecting quantum chaos via pseudo-entropy and negativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum informatic quantities such as entanglement entropy are useful in detecting quantum phase transitions. Recently, a new entanglement measure called pseudo-entropy was proposed which is a generalization of the more well-known entanglement entropy. It has many nice properties and is useful in the study of post-selection measurements. In this paper, one of our goals is to explore the properties of pseudo-entropy and study the effectiveness of it as a quantum chaos diagnostic, i.e. as a tool to distinguish between chaotic and integrable systems. Using various variants of the SYK model, we study the signal of quantum chaos captured in the pseudo-entropy and relate it to the spectral form factor (SFF) and local operator entanglement (LOE). We also explore another quantity called the negativity of entanglement which is a useful entanglement measure for a mixed state. We generalized it to accommodate the transition matrix and called it pseudo-negativity in analogy to pseudo-entropy. We found that it also nicely captures the spectral properties of a chaotic system and hence also plays a role as a tool of quantum chaos diagnostic.</description>

      <title>Random walk models for the propagation of signalling molecules in one-dimensional spatial networks and their continuum limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03221v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The propagation of signalling molecules within cellular networks is affected by network topology, but also by the spatial arrangement of cells in the networks. Understanding the collective reaction--diffusion behaviour in space of signals propagating through cellular networks is an important consideration for example for regenerative signals that convey positional information. In this work, we consider stochastic and deterministic versions of random walk models of signalling molecules propagating and reacting within one-dimensional spatial networks with arbitrary node placement and connectivity. By taking a continuum limit of the random walk models, we derive an inhomogeneous reaction--diffusion--advection equation, where diffusivity and advective velocity depend on local node density and connectivity within the network. Our results show that large spatial variations of molecule concentrations can be induced by heterogeneous node distributions. Furthermore, we find that noise within the stochastic random walk model is directly influenced by node density. We apply our models to consider signal propagation within the osteocyte network of bone, where signals propagating to the bone surface regulate bone formation and resorption processes. We investigate signal-to-noise ratios for different damage detection scenarios and show that the location of perturbations to the network can be detected by signals received at the network boundaries.</description>

      <title>Machine learning reveals features of spinon Fermi surface</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.03143v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With rapid progress in simulation of strongly interacting quantum Hamiltonians, the challenge in characterizing unknown phases becomes a bottleneck for scientific progress. We demonstrate that a Quantum-Classical hybrid approach (QuCl) of mining sampled projective snapshots with interpretable classical machine learning can unveil signatures of seemingly featureless quantum states. The Kitaev-Heisenberg model on a honeycomb lattice under external magnetic field presents an ideal system to test QuCl, where simulations have found an intermediate gapless phase (IGP) sandwiched between known phases, launching a debate over its elusive nature. We use the correlator convolutional neural network, trained on labeled projective snapshots, in conjunction with regularization path analysis to identify signatures of phases. We show that QuCl reproduces known features of established phases. Significantly, we also identify a signature of the IGP in the spin channel perpendicular to the field direction, which we interpret as a signature of Friedel oscillations of gapless spinons forming a Fermi surface. Our predictions can guide future experimental searches for spin liquids.</description>

      <title>Phonon thermal Hall effect in charge-compensated topological insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03064v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: From a systematic study of thermal and charge transport in various single crystals of compensated topological insulators we identify the evolution of a large low-temperature thermal Hall effect as a characteristic common feature. In order to separate phononic and electronic contributions in the measured longitudinal and transverse thermal conductivity, the electronic contributions are estimated from corresponding electrical resisivity and Hall effect measurements on the same samples by using the Wiedemann-Franz law. As may be expected for charge-compensated topological insulators the longitudinal thermal conductivity is phonon-dominated in all samples. However, we also find a pronounced field-linear thermal Hall effect that becomes most pronounced in the low-temperature range, where all samples are good electrical insulators. This indicates an underlying phononic mechanism of the thermal Hall effect and in this respect the topological insulators resemble other, mainly ionic, insulators, which have been reported to show a phonon-induced thermal Hall effect, but its underlying phononic mechanism remains to be identified. Our observation of a comparable thermal Hall ratio in topological insulators supports a theoretical scenario that explains a thermal Hall effect through skew scattering on charged impurities.</description>

      <title>Quasiperiodic and periodic extended Hatano-Nelson model: Anomalous complex-real transition and non-Hermitian skin effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05382v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the effect of quasiperiodic and periodic onsite potentials in a Hatano-Nelson model with next-nearest-neighbour hopping. By considering a non-reciprocal next-nearest-neighbour hopping and a quasiperiodic onsite potential under periodic boundary conditions, we show a breakdown of the typical correspondence between the delocalization-localization and complex-real transitions as a function of the potential strength. Moreover, we reveal that in the delocalized regime, when the potential strength increases, the eigenstates under open boundary conditions exhibit a bidirectional non-Hermitian skin effect, i.e., they tend to localize on both the edges instead of localizing on either of the edges. However, when a periodic onsite potential is considered, the system not only exhibits a bidirectional skin effect but also shows a complete direction reversal of the skin effect as a function of the onsite periodic potential.</description>
