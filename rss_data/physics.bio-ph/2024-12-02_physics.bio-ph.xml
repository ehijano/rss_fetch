      <title>Singlet fission contributes to solar energy harvesting in photosynthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Singlet fission (SF), the spin-allowed conversion of one singlet exciton into two triplet excitons, offers a promising strategy for enhancing the efficiency of photovoltaic devices. However, realising this potential necessitates materials capable of ultrafast (sub-picosecond) SF and the generation of long-lived (&gt; microsecond) triplet excitons, a synthetic challenge. Some photosynthetic organisms have evolved sophisticated molecular architectures that demonstrate these criteria, but despite 40 years of study, the underlying SF mechanisms and its functional significance in these organisms remain unclear. Here, we use a suite of ultrafast and magneto-optical spectroscopic techniques to understand the mechanism of SF within light-harvesting 1 (LH1) complexes from wild-type and genetically modified photosynthetic bacteria. Our findings reveal a SF process, termed "heterofission", wherein singlet excitons are transformed into triplet excitons localised on adjacent carotenoid (Crt) and bacteriochlorophyll (BChl) molecules. We also uncover an unexpected functional role for SF in augmenting Crt-to-BChl photosynthetic energy transfer efficiency. By transiently storing electronic excitation within the SF-generated triplet pair, the system circumvents rapid thermalisation of Crt excitations, thereby enhancing energy transfer efficiency to the BChl Qy state, and enabling the organism to usefully harvest more sunlight.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneity of tumor biophysical properties and their potential role as prognostic markers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Progress in our knowledge of tumor mechanisms and complexity led to the understanding of the physical parameters of cancer cells and their microenvironment, including the mechanical, thermal, and electrical properties, solid stress, and liquid pressure, as critical regulators of tumor progression and potential prognostic traits associated with clinical outcomes. The biological hallmarks of cancer and physical abnormalities of tumors are mutually reinforced, promoting a vicious cycle of tumor progression. A comprehensive analysis of the biological and physical tumor parameters is critical for developing more robust prognostic and diagnostic markers and improving treatment efficiency. Like the biological tumor traits, physical tumor features are characterized by inter-and intratumoral heterogeneity. The dynamic changes of physical tumor traits during tumor progression and as a result of tumor treatment highlight the necessity of their spatial and temporal analysis in clinical settings. This review focuses on the biological basis of the tumor-specific physical traits, the state-of-the-art methods of their analyses, and the perspective of clinical translation. The importance of tumor physical parameters for disease progression and therapy resistance, as well as current treatment strategies to monitor and target tumor physical traits in clinics, is highlighted.</description>

      <title>The role of inhibitory neuronal variability in modulating phase diversity between coupled networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neuronal heterogeneity, characterized by the presence of a multitude of spiking neuronal patterns, is a widespread phenomenon throughout the nervous system. In particular, the brain exhibits strong variability among inhibitory neurons. Despite the huge neuronal heterogeneity across brain regions, which in principle could decrease synchronization, cortical areas coherently oscillate during various cognitive tasks. Therefore, the functional significance of neuronal heterogeneity remains a subject of active investigation. Previous studies typically focus on the role of heterogeneity in the dynamic properties of only one population. Here, we explore how different types of inhibitory neurons can contribute to the diversity of the phase relations between two cortical areas. This research sheds light on the potential impact of local properties, such as neuronal variability, on communication between distant brain regions. We show that both homogeneous and heterogeneous inhibitory networks can exhibit phase diversity and nonintuitive regimes such as anticipated synchronization (AS) and phase bistability. It has been proposed that the bi-stable phase could be related to bi-stable perception, such as in the Necker cube. Moreover, we show that heterogeneity enlarges the region of zero-lag synchronization and bistability. We also show that the parameter controlling inhibitory heterogeneity modulates the transition from the usual delayed synchronization regime (DS) to AS. Finally, we show that the inhibitory heterogeneity drives the internal dynamics of the free-running population. Therefore, we suggest a possible mechanism to explain when the DS-AS transition occurs via zero-lag synchronization or bi-stability.</description>

      <title>The 2024 Motile Active Matter Roadmap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Activity and autonomous motion are fundamental aspects of many living and engineering systems. Here, the scale of biological agents covers a wide range, from nanomotors, cytoskeleton, and cells, to insects, fish, birds, and people. Inspired by biological active systems, various types of autonomous synthetic nano- and micromachines have been designed, which provide the basis for multifunctional, highly responsive, intelligent active materials. A major challenge for understanding and designing active matter is their inherent non-equilibrium nature due to persistent energy consumption, which invalidates equilibrium concepts such as free energy, detailed balance, and time-reversal symmetry. Furthermore, interactions in ensembles of active agents are often non-additive and non-reciprocal. An important aspect of biological agents is their ability to sense the environment, process this information, and adjust their motion accordingly. It is an important goal for the engineering of micro-robotic systems to achieve similar functionality. With many fundamental properties of motile active matter now reasonably well understood and under control, the ground is prepared for the study of physical aspects and mechanisms of motion in complex environments, of the behavior of systems with new physical features like chirality, of the development of novel micromachines and microbots, of the emergent collective behavior and swarming of intelligent self-propelled particles, and of particular features of microbial systems. The vast complexity of phenomena and mechanisms involved in the self-organization and dynamics of motile active matter poses major challenges, which can only be addressed by a truly interdisciplinary effort involving scientists from biology, chemistry, ecology, engineering, mathematics, and physics.</description>

      <title>Inverse Measurements in Active Nematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15553v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a framework to take new measurements in nematic systems that contain active elements such as molecular motors. Spatio-temporal fields of stress, traction, velocity, pressure, and forces are estimated jointly from microscopy images alone. Our inverse-problem approach ensures that these fields comply with physical laws and are accurate at system boundaries. Our novel measurements in active biological materials provide new insight for the design of boundary-aware nematic systems. The shear stress at the wall unveils a correlation with the nucleation of topological defects. The pressure gradients and the velocity characterize how boundary effects drive system-wide dynamics. And the forces link the underlying fluid with the nematic tensor to reveal the time scales of the system. More broadly, our work establishes a generalizable approach to quantitatively study experimental systems that are inaccessible to measuring probes.</description>
