      <title>A non-perturbative framework for N-point functions of locally non-Gaussian fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a non-perturbative approach to correlation functions and polyspectra of locally non-Gaussian fields and develop a simple semi-perturbative framework that does not rely on the local expansion. As an example, we apply it to locally non-Gaussian fields possessing exponential tails and derive some exact analytic results in the strongly non-Gaussian limit.</description>

      <title>Whodunnit? The case of midge swarms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As collective states of animal groups go, swarms of midge insects pose a number of puzzling questions. Their ordering polarization parameter is quite small and the insects are weakly coupled among themselves but strongly coupled to the swarm. In laboratory studies (free of external perturbations), the correlation length is small, whereas midge swarms exhibit strong correlations, scale free behavior and power laws for correlation length, susceptibility and correlation time in field studies. Data for the dynamic correlation function versus time collapse to a single curve only for small values of time scaled with the correlation time. Is there a theory that explains these disparate observations? Among the existing theories, whodunnit? Here we review and discuss several models proposed in the literature and extend our own one, the harmonically confined Vicsek model, to anisotropic confinement. Numerical simulations of the latter produce elongated swarm shapes and values of the static critical exponents between those of the two dimensional and isotropic three dimensional models. The new values agree better with those measured in natural swarms.</description>

      <title>Cyclic active refrigerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermodynamic cycles are idealized processes that can convert heat into work or produce heat flow against a temperature gradient with the input of work. They remain an active area of research in modern stochastic thermodynamics. In particular, cyclic active heat engines have been shown to display a rich phenomenology, such as ``violations'' of the Carnot bound on efficiency and an improved performance in comparison to their passive counterparts. We introduce the concept of cyclic active refrigerators using a previously derived second law for cyclic active systems. We show that for cyclic active refrigerators, a naive definition of the coefficient of performance can exceed the bound set by the standard second law for passive refrigerators. We also show that cyclic active systems can behave like a Maxwell's demon, with heat flowing from the cold to the hot reservoir without any work input. Beyond this phase, cyclic active systems can enter a hybrid phase, functioning as both a heat engine and a refrigerator simultaneously. Our results are obtained with two models that involve active Brownian particles, a simpler one that allows for analytical results and a more realistic one that is analyzed through numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Optimization of Sensory Adaptation via Game-Theoretic Path Integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biological sensory systems, from \textit{E.~coli} chemotaxis to sensory neurons in \textit{C.~elegans}, achieve reliable adaptation over wide dynamic ranges despite operating in strongly noisy and overdamped regimes. Here, we present a field-theoretic framework in which sensory adaptation emerges from a variational free-energy principle, formulated as a stochastic differential game between an organism and its environment. Using an Onsager--Machlup path-integral formalism, we show that the resulting adaptive dynamics are mathematically equivalent to a class of model reference adaptive control schemes and can be interpreted as a dynamic renormalization of the system's Green's function. Within this framework, the phasic overshoot commonly observed in sensory responses arises naturally from an effective inertia ($m^* \approx \tau \gamma$) generated by memory-dissipation coupling, rather than from biochemical fine-tuning. Quantitative fits to experimental data across species yield $R^2 &gt; 0.88$, and indicate that adaptive sensory processing operates within a narrow thermodynamically optimal regime bounded by signal-to-noise and stability constraints.</description>

      <title>Interplay of ion availability and mobility in the loss of cation selectivity for CaCl\textsubscript{2} in negatively charged nanopores: molecular dynamics using scaled-charge models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ion transport through charged nanopores is commonly interpreted in terms of electrical double layer structure, leading to the expectation of cation-selective conduction in negatively charged pores. This picture can break down for multivalent electrolytes, where strong ion-urface correlations and charge inversion modify transport behavior. Here, we study NaCl and CaCl$_2$ conduction through negatively charged silica nanopores using atomistic molecular dynamics simulations with scaled-charge ion models. By separating concentration and velocity contributions to the radial particle current density, we connect static adsorption to dynamic perm-selectivity. While NaCl exhibits conventional cation selectivity, CaCl$_2$ shows nearly bulk-like or even anion-favored transport due to Ca$^{2+}$ immobilization near the surface and dominant Cl$^-$ conduction in the pore interior following charge inversion. Although this qualitative mechanism is robust, its detailed manifestation depends sensitively on the balance of ion-surface and ion-water interactions encoded in the force field.</description>

      <title>Analytic Nonlinear Theory of Shear Banding in Amorphous Solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to offer an analytic theory of the shear banding instability in amorphous solids that are subjected to athermal quasi-static shear. To this aim we derive nonlinear equations for the displacement field, including the consequences of plastic deformation on the mechanical response of amorphous solids. The plastic events collectively induce distributed dipoles that are responsible for screening effects and the creation of typical length-scales that are absent in classical elasticity theory. The nonlinear theory exposes an instability that results in the creation of shear bands. By solving the weakly nonlinear amplitude equation we present analytic expressions for the displacement fields that is associated with shear bands, explaining the role of the elastic moduli that determine the width of a shear band from ductile to brittle characteristics. We derive an energy functional whose Hessian possesses an eigenvalue that goes to zero at the shear-banding instability, providing a prediction for the critical value of the accumulated stress that results in an instability.</description>

      <title>A statistical theory of structure in many-particle systems with local interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A theory of structure is formulated for systems of many structureless classical particles with stable local interactions in Euclidean space. Such systems are shown to have their structure in thermodynamic equilibrium determined exactly by a random field of fine local descriptions and approximately by coarsenings thereof. The degree of order in the local cluster consisting of a particle and its neighbors is identified as a universal source of coarse local descriptions and characterized by expressing the behavior of configurational entropy in local microscopic terms. A local measure of the angular redundancy in neighboring particle positions is found to satisfy this characterization and thereby established as a valid local order quantifier. A precise relationship between order and symmetry is obtained by bounding this quantifier sharply from below by a simple function of the local point group and the largest stabilizer under its action on the set of bond pairs. The marginal distribution of the quantifier is given in closed form for highly coordinated particles with broadly distributed bond angles. Applications are made to the ideal gas, perfect crystal, and simple liquid.</description>

      <title>Scaling and Universality at Noise-Affected Non-Equilibrium Spin Correlation Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate scaling and universality in nonequilibrium spin correlation functions in the presence of uncorrelated noise. In the absence of noise, spin correlation functions exhibit a crossover from monotonic decay at fast sweep velocities to oscillatory behavior at slow sweeps. We show that, under a stochastically driven field, the critical sweep velocity at which the spin correlation functions undergo an abrupt change decreases with increasing noise strength and scales linearly with the square of the noise intensity. Remarkably, when the noise intensity and sweep velocity are comparable, the excitation probability becomes locked to pk = 1/2 over a finite momentum window, signaling the emergence of noise-induced maximally mixed modes. This gives rise to a highly oscillatory region in the dynamical phase diagram, whose threshold sweep velocity increases with noise and likewise exhibits quadratic scaling with the noise strength. Finally, we identify a universal scaling function under which all boundary sweep-velocity curves collapse onto a single universal curve.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation-Response Design Rules for Nonequilibrium Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biological machines like molecular motors and enzymes operate in dynamic cycles representable as stochastic flows on networks. Current stochastic dynamics describes such flows on fixed networks. Here, we develop a scalable approach to network design in which local transition rates can be systematically varied to achieve global dynamical objectives. It is based on the fluctuation-response duality in the recent Caliber Force Theory -- a path-entropy variational formalism for nonequilibria. This approach scales efficiently with network complexity and gives new insights, for example revealing the transition from timing- to branching-dominated fluctuations in a kinesin motor model.</description>

      <title>Stochastic synthesis-degradation processes: first-passage properties and connections with resetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Processes controlled by stochastic synthesis and degradation (SSD) are widespread in biology but their reaction kinetics are not well understood. Using methods borrowed from the theory of resetting processes, we determine the first-passage properties of a collection of independent particles that are synthesized and degraded at constant rates, and follow an arbitrary diffusive process in space. At equal synthesis and degradation rates, the mean reaction time with a target site can be minimized as in stochastic resetting, and a $CV$-criterion is derived. When the degradation rate is held fixed and the synthesis costs are taken into account, an optimal synthesis rate is obtained. In bounded domains, despite particle degradation, SSD improves the mean search time compared to a single non-degrading particle if the synthesis rate exceeds a critical value. The latter obeys a universal relation. We illustrate these findings with Brownian diffusion on the infinite line and in an interval.</description>

      <title>Data-Efficient Multidimensional Free Energy Estimation via Physics-Informed Score Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many biological processes involve numerous coupled degrees of freedom, yet free-energy estimation is often restricted to one-dimensional profiles to mitigate the high computational cost of multidimensional sampling. In this work, we extend Fokker--Planck Score Learning (FPSL) to efficiently reconstruct two-dimensional free-energy landscapes from non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations using different types of collective variables. We show that explicitly modeling orthogonal degrees of freedom reveals insights hidden in one-dimensional projections at negligible computational overhead. Additionally, exploiting symmetries in the underlying landscape enhances reconstruction accuracy, while regularization techniques ensure numerical robustness in sparsely sampled regions. We validate our approach on three distinct systems: the conformational dynamics of alanine dipeptide, as well as coarse-grained and all-atom models of solute permeation through lipid bilayers. We demonstrate that, because FPSL learns a smooth score function rather than histogram-based densities, it overcomes the exponential scaling of grid-based methods, establishing it as a data-efficient and scalable tool for multidimensional free-energy estimation.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal many-body physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reciprocity is a fundamental symmetry present in many natural phenomena and engineered systems. Distinct situations where this symmetry is broken are typically grouped under the umbrella term "nonreciprocity", colloquially defined by: the action of A on B $\neq$ the action of B on A. In this review, we elucidate what nonreciprocity is by providing an introduction to its most salient classes: nonvariational dynamics, violations of Newton's third law, broken detailed balance, nonreciprocal responses and nonreciprocity of arbitrary linear operators. Next, we point out where to find these manifestations of non-reciprocity, from ensembles of particles with field mediated interactions to synthetic neural networks and open quantum systems. Given this breadth of contexts and the lack of an all-encompassing definition, it makes it all the more intriguing that some general conclusions can be gathered, when distinct definitions of nonreciprocity overlap. We explore what these universal consequences are with a special emphasis on collective phenomena that arise in nonreciprocal many-body systems. The topics covered include nonreciprocal phase transitions and non-normal amplification of noise and perturbations. We conclude with some open questions.</description>

      <title>Chaos, the Critical Phenomenon in Phase Space: Feigenbaum Constants and Critical Exponents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chaos in both dissipative systems and conservative systems is investigated on the approach of renormalization group. It is found that the chaos is regarded as the critical phenomenon of equilibrium statistics in phase space. The two Feigenbaum constants in the period-doubling bifurcation systems correspond to two independent critical exponents, which are universal and can be adopted to distinguish the classes of chaos. For the conservative systems, due to the critical nature of the chaos, the isolated systems with different parameters are correlated in the phase space, and therefore the isolated system is no longer isolated in the phase space. The information of conservative systems is irreversibly lost over time, which leads to the increase entropy in an isolated system, and the contradiction between the second law of thermodynamics and the reversibility of isolated systems can be resolved.</description>

      <title>Disturbing news about the $d=2+\epsilon$ expansion II. Assessing the recombination scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In [De Cesare, Rychkov (2025)], we revisited the $d=2+\epsilon$ expansion in the $O(N)$ Non-Linear Sigma Model (NLSM), emphasizing the existence of a protected operator which is a closed form with $N-1$ indices. The scaling dimension of this operator stays exactly equal to $N-1$, independently of $\epsilon$. Its existence is problematic for the identification of the NLSM fixed point in $d=2+\epsilon$ with the Wilson-Fisher fixed point family obtained by analytically continuing from near $d=4$, which does not possess such a protected operator. Multiplet recombination is one scenario discussed in [De Cesare, Rychkov (2025)], which could allow to connect the two families continuously (although not analytically). In this scenario, the protected dimension is lifted at some critical value of $\epsilon$, thanks to the short conformal multiplet of scaling dimension $N-1$ eating a long conformal multiplet of higher scaling dimension. In this followup work, we assess this scenario for the cases $N=3$ and $N=4$. We identify the lowest candidates for the long multiplet which could be eaten, and compute their one-loop anomalous dimensions. We find that at one loop, scaling dimensions of these candidates grow with $\epsilon$, while it should decrease down to $N$ for the recombination to occur. We conclude that multiplet recombination is unlikely.</description>

      <title>Field-driven Ion Pairing Dynamics in Concentrated Electrolytes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate ion pairing dynamics in electrolytes driven far from equilibrium using molecular simulations and nonequilibrium rate theory. Focusing on 0.5 M $\mathrm{LiPF_6}$ in water and acetonitrile under uniform electric fields, we compute transition path theory observables including reactive fluxes and mean first-passage times of ion pairing. Moreover, we introduce a dynamical proxy of free-ion population, where its field-induced change is strongly correlated with the nonlinear enhancement of conductivity, yielding an increase of $40 \ \%$ at 50 mV/{\AA} in acetonitrile, compared to less than $10 \ \%$ in aqueous electrolytes. Further kinetic analysis elucidates that Onsager's classical theory substantially overestimates field-induced enhancement of ion pair dissociation in molecular electrolytes. This discrepancy arises from solvent-mediated dynamical pathways and field-induced dielectric decrement that suppress ion pair dissociation within explicit solvents, highlighting that a faithful description of molecular details is essential. Our results provide a molecular interpretation of nonlinear electrolyte transport beyond continuum theories and establish a general framework for quantifying nonequilibrium reaction kinetics in condensed phase systems.</description>

Abstract: Building upon the work of Hu, Paz, and Zhang [1,2] on open quantum systems we consider the quantum Brownian motion (QBM) model with one oscillator (position variable $x$) as the system, {\it nonlinearly} coupled to an environment of $N$ harmonic oscillators (with mass $m_n$, natural frequency $\omega_n$, position $q_n$ and momentum $p_n$ variables) in the form $\sum_{n}\left(v_{n1}(x)q_{n}^{k}+v_{n2}(x)p_{n}^{l}\right)$ where $k, l$ are integers (the present work only considers the $k=l=2$ cases). The vertex functions $v_{n1}, v_{n2} $ are of the form $v_{n1}=\lambda C_{n1} f(x), v_{n2}(x)=-\lambda\,C_{n2}m_{n}^{-2}\omega_{n}^{-2}f(x)$ where $C_{n1,2}$ are the coupling constants with the $n$th oscillator, $f(x)$ is any arbitrary function of $x$, and $\lambda$ is a dimensionless constant. Employing the closed-time-path formalism the influence action $S_{IF}$ is calculated using a perturbative expansion in $\lambda$. It is possible to identify the terms in $S_{IF}$ quadratic or higher in $\Delta(s)\equiv f(x_{+}(s))-f(x_{-}(s))$ to constitute the noise kernel, while terms linear in $\Delta$ to that of the dissipation kernel. The non-Gaussian noise kernel gives rise to non-zero three-point correlation function of the corresponding stochastic force. The pathway presented here should be useful for the exploration of \textit{non-Gaussian properties of systems nonlinearly coupled with their environments}; examples in early universe cosmology and in quantum optomechanics (QOM) are mentioned. A modified fluctuation-dissipation relation (FDR) is also established, which ensures the consistency of the model and the accuracy of results even at higher perturbative orders. Another result of significance is the derivation of a nonlinear Langevin equation which is expected to be useful for many open quantum system applications.</description>

      <title>Coarse-Grained Boltzmann Generators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.10637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sampling equilibrium molecular configurations from the Boltzmann distribution is a longstanding challenge. Boltzmann Generators (BGs) address this by combining exact-likelihood generative models with importance sampling, but their practical scalability is limited. Meanwhile, coarse-grained surrogates enable the modeling of larger systems by reducing effective dimensionality, yet often lack the reweighting process required to ensure asymptotically correct statistics. In this work, we propose Coarse-Grained Boltzmann Generators (CG-BGs), a principled framework that unifies scalable reduced-order modeling with the exactness of importance sampling. CG-BGs act in a coarse-grained coordinate space, using a learned potential of mean force (PMF) to reweight samples generated by a flow-based model. Crucially, we show that this PMF can be efficiently learned from rapidly converged data via force matching. Our results demonstrate that CG-BGs faithfully capture complex interactions mediated by explicit solvent within highly reduced representations, establishing a scalable pathway for the unbiased sampling of larger molecular systems.</description>

      <title>Between equilibrium and fluctuation: Einstein's heuristic argument and Boltzmann's principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We critically revisit Einstein's 1905 heuristic argument for lightquanta, considering its internal coherence and the scope of its applicability. We argue that Einstein's reasoning, often celebrated for its originality, is ambiguous because it can be understood as a fluctuation or as a comparison between equilibrium states. A historical and conceptual analysis of Einstein's use of Boltzmann's principle in those years reveals his evolving stance on its meaning and the role of probability, as well as his persistent doubts about the nature of radiation. We use our analysis to examine the limitations of extending the notion of Einstein's lightquanta across the electromagnetic spectrum: the relevant parameter is not the frequency, but the occupancy number.</description>

      <title>Noise-balanced multilevel on-the-fly sparse grid surrogates for coupling Monte Carlo models into continuum models with application to heterogeneous catalysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiscale simulations utilizing high-fidelity, microscopic Monte Carlo models to provide the nonlinear response for continuum models can easily become computationally intractable. Surrogate models for the high-fidelity Monte Carlo models can overcome this but come with some challenges. One such challenges arise by the sampling noise in the underlying Monte Carlo data, which leads to uncontrolled errors possibly corrupting the surrogate even though it would be highly accurate in the case of noise-free data. Another challenge arises by the 'curse of dimensionality' when the response depends on many macro-variables. These points are addressed by a novel noise-balanced sparse grids interpolation approach which, in a quasi-optimal fashion, controls the amount of Monte Carlo sampling for each data point. The approach is complemented by a multilevel on-the-fly construction during the multiscale simulation. Besides its efficiency, a particularly appealing feature is the ease of use of the approach with only a single hyperparameter controlling the whole surrogate construction - from the surrogate's accuracy with guaranteed convergence to which data needs to be created with which accuracy. The approach is demonstrated on challenging examples from heterogeneous catalysis, coupling microscopic kinetic Monte Carlo models into macroscopic reactor simulations.</description>

      <title>Ergotropic Mpemba crossings in finite-dimensional quantum batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum Mpemba effect is a counterintuitive phenomenon in which a state initially farther from equilibrium relaxes more rapidly than one that starts nearer to equilibrium. In the context of finite-dimensional quantum batteries interacting with an environment, we introduce the notion of an ergotropic Mpemba crossing (EMC), defined by the intersection of ergotropy trajectories during the dynamics. For qubit batteries subjected to amplitude damping noise, we derive a condition for the occurrence of EMC in terms of the relative coherence of the initial states and fully characterize the region of state space that exhibits EMC with respect to a fixed reference state. Interestingly, our analysis reveals that under anisotropic Pauli noise, the emergence of EMC is jointly governed by the coherence and the energy of the initial states. To elucidate the physical origin of EMC, we decompose ergotropy into coherent and incoherent contributions and show that, in qubit systems, the coherent component plays a crucial role for EMC, an observation that strikingly does not extend to three-level batteries. Further, by extending our analysis to non-Markovian environments, we demonstrate that, unlike the Markovian case, non-Markovian dynamics can give rise to multiple Mpemba crossings, with the total number of crossings always being odd. Moreover, analyzing the connection between the EMC and the conventional state Mpemba effect reveals that, for qubits, an EMC necessarily entails a state Mpemba crossing while this correspondence breaks down for qutrits, where EMCs may arise without any state Mpemba crossing.</description>

      <title>Reentrance in a Hamiltonian flocking model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.11104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The clustering of self-motile and repulsive particles, so-called motility-induced phase separation (MIPS), is one of the clearest signatures of active physics. Typically, increasing the amplitude of self-motility increases the degree of clustering, however for high enough self-motility the homogeneous phase is reentered. Here, we report that such reentrance naturally emerges in a Hamiltonian (conservative) model known to recapitulate properties of (active) bird flocks, and exhibits clustering behaviour reminiscent of MIPS. We numerically demonstrate the reentrance of the homogeneous phase and identify the underlying mechanism as a competition between the amplitude of a spin-velocity coupled drive and mobility-limited kinetic frustration. Specifically, we reveal that strong spin-velocity coupling suppresses transverse diffusion, thereby leading the system into an arrest that closes the window for phase separation. Overall, our work offers a Hamiltonian, conservative, bridge between reentrant physics across equilibrium and non-equilibrium materials.</description>

      <title>Anomalous diffusion in convergence to effective ergodicity</title>

      <description>arXiv:1606.08693v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The nature of diffusion is usually studied for particles or time-evolving systems. Similar in principle, such studies can be conducted by tracking how a given function of observable properties evolves over time-akin to the evolution of observable functions-referred to as functional-diffusion. This is not the same as the system's individual trajectories, but can be regarded as a meta-trajectory. Following this idea, we measure how the approach to ergodicity evolves over time for the observed magnetization of a full Ising model with an external field. We compute the diffusive behavior of the functional across a range of temperatures via Metropolis and Glauber single-spin-flip dynamics. The system's ensemble-averaged dynamics are computed using expressions from the exact solution. Power-law behavior in the approach to ergodicity provides a classification of anomalies in functional-diffusion, demonstrating nonlinear anomalous behavior over different temperature and field ranges. Studying the ergodicity convergence of these meta-trajectories can help validate and enhance the pedagogical understanding of nonequilibrium thermodynamic systems.</description>

Abstract: We study the $S=\frac{1}{2}$ quantum spin system on the $d$-dimensional hypercubic lattice with $d\ge2$ with uniform nearest-neighbor interaction of the XY or XYZ type and arbitrary uniform magnetic field. By extending the method recently developed for quantum spin chains, we prove that the model possesses no local conserved quantities except for the trivial ones, such as the Hamiltonian. This result strongly suggests that the model is non-integrable. We note that our result applies to the XX model without a magnetic field, which is one of the easiest solvable models in one dimension.</description>

Abstract: We discuss a quantum typicality approach to examine systems composed of two subsystems at different temperatures. While dynamical quantum typicality is usually used to simulate high-temperature dynamics, we also investigate low-temperature dynamics using the method. To test our method, we investigate the energy current between subsystems at different temperatures in various paradigmatic spin-1/2 chains, specifically the XX chain, the critical transverse-field Ising chain, and the XXZ chain. We compare our numerics to existing analytical results and find a convincing agreement for the energy current in the steady state for all considered models and temperatures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15322v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider overdamped physical systems evolving under a feedback-controlled fluctuating potential and in contact with a thermal bath at temperature $T$. A Markovian description of the dynamics, which keeps only the last value of the control action, is advantageous -- both from the theoretical and the practical side -- for the entropy balance. Novel second-law equalities and bounds for the extractable work are obtained, the latter being both tighter and easier to evaluate than those in the literature based on the whole chain of controller actions. The Markovian framework also allows us to prove that the bound for the extractable work that incorporates the unavailable information is saturated in a wide class of physical systems, for error-free measurements. These results are illustrated in model systems. For imperfect measurements, there appears an interval of measurement uncertainty, including the point at which work ceases to be extracted, where the new Markovian bound is tighter than the unavailable information bound.</description>

Abstract: Quantum-Induced Stochastic Dynamics arises from the coupling between a classical system and a quantum environment. Unlike standard thermal reservoirs, this environment acts as a dynamic bath, capable of simultaneously exchanging heat and performing work. We formulate a thermodynamic framework for this semi-classical regime, defining heat, work, and entropy production. We derive a modified Second Law that accounts for non-equilibrium quantum features, such as squeezing. The framework is exemplified by an optomechanical setup, where we characterize the thermodynamics of the non-stationary noise induced by the cavity field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16082v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive novel low-temperature asymptotics for the spectrum of the infinitesimal generator of the overdamped Langevin dynamics. The novelty is that this operator is endowed with homogeneous Dirichlet conditions at the boundary of a domain which depends on the temperature. From the point of view of stochastic processes, this gives information on the long-time behavior of the diffusion conditioned on non-absorption at the boundary, in the so-called quasistationary regime. Our results provide precise estimates of the spectral gap and principal eigenvalue, extending the Eyring-Kramers formula. The phenomenology is richer than in the case of a fixed boundary and gives new insight into the sensitivity of the spectrum with respect to the shape of the domain near critical points of the energy function. Our work is motivated by--and is relevant to--the problem of finding optimal hyperparameters for accelerated molecular dynamics algorithms.</description>

      <title>Lindblad many-body scars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06665v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum many-body scars have received much recent attention for being both intriguing non-ergodic states in otherwise quantum chaotic systems and promising candidates to encode quantum information efficiently. So far, these studies have mostly been restricted to Hermitian systems. Here, we study many-body scars in many-body quantum chaotic systems coupled to a Markovian bath, which we term Lindblad many-body scars. They are defined as simultaneous eigenvectors of the Hamiltonian and dissipative parts of the vectorized Liouvillian. Importantly, because their eigenvalues are purely real, they are not related to revivals. The number and nature of the scars depend on both the symmetry of the Hamiltonian and the choice of jump operators. For a dissipative four-body Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model with $N$ fermions, either Majorana or complex, we construct analytically some of these Lindblad scars while others could only be obtained numerically. As an example of the former, we identify $N/2+1$ scars for complex fermions due to the $U(1)$ symmetry of the model and two scars for Majorana fermions as a consequence of the parity symmetry. Similar results are obtained for a dissipative XXZ spin chain. We also characterize the physical properties of Lindblad scars. First, the operator size is independent of the disorder realization and has a vanishing variance. By contrast, the operator size for non-scarred states, believed to be quantum chaotic, is well described by a distribution centered around a specific size and a finite variance, which could be relevant for a precise definition of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis in dissipative quantum chaos. Moreover, the entanglement entropy of these scars has distinct features such as a strong dependence on the partition choice and, in certain cases, a large entanglement.</description>

Abstract: We present efficient and practical protocols to measure the second R\'enyi entropy (RE), whose exponential is known as the purity. We achieve this by establishing a direct connection to a Loschmidt echo (LE) type measurement sequence, applicable to quantum many-body systems. Notably, our approach does not rely on random-noise averaging, a feature that can be extended to protocols to measure out-of-time-order correlation functions (OTOCs), as we demonstrate. By way of example, we show that our protocols can be practically implemented in superconducting qubit-based platforms, as well as in cavity-QED trapped ultra-cold gases.</description>

      <title>Linear Analysis of Stochastic Verlet-Type Integrators for Langevin Equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04100v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide an analytical framework for analyzing the quality of stochastic Verlet-type integrators for simulating the Langevin equation. Focusing only on basic objective measures, we consider the ability of an integrator to correctly simulate two characteristic configurational quantities of transport, a) diffusion on a flat surface and b) drift on a tilted planar surface, as well as c) statistical sampling of a harmonic potential. For any stochastic Verlet-type integrator expressed in its configurational form, we develop closed form expressions to directly assess these three most basic quantities as a function of the applied time step. The applicability of the analysis is exemplified through twelve representative integrators developed over the past five decades, and algorithm performance is conveniently visualized through the three characteristic measures for each integrator. The GJ set of integrators stands out as the only option for correctly simulating diffusion, drift, and Boltzmann distribution in linear systems, and we therefore suggest that this general method is the one best suited for high quality thermodynamic simulations of nonlinear and complex systems, including for relatively high time steps compared to simulations with other integrators.</description>

      <title>Emergent Quantum Walk Dynamics from Classical Interacting Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06896v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of a discrete-time quantum walk (DTQW) can be realized within a purely classical interacting particle system composed of some boxes and a large but finite number of balls, and can, in principle, be implemented in a tabletop experimental setting. The distribution of the balls evolves under stochastic, occupation-dependent update rules at each lattice site, producing quantum-walk dynamics without invoking a wavefunction. The update parameters are fixed by the parameters of coin and shift operations of the DTQW. This framework naturally yields a generalized active spin model and provides a minimal lattice-based microscopic understanding of the emergence of quantum-like dynamics in active matter systems. This interdisciplinary approach connects the Classical models to the broad range of applications where DTQWs are successfully employed.</description>

      <title>A fast algorithm for 2D Rigidity Percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00741v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rigidity Percolation is a crucial framework for describing rigidity transitions in amorphous systems. We present a new, efficient algorithm to study central-force Rigidity Percolation in two dimensions. This algorithm combines the Pebble Game algorithm, the Newman-Ziff approach to Connectivity Percolation, as well as novel rigorous results in rigidity theory, to exactly identify rigid clusters over the full bond concentration range, in a time that scales as $N^{1.02}$ for a system of $N$ nodes. We perform extensive numerical simulations with systems larger than $500$ million nodes, far beyond the previous limitations. We obtain new, precise estimates for the critical exponents, $\nu=1.1694(8)$ and $D_f=1.8423(7)$, and locate the critical threshold at $p_c = 0.6602741(4)$. Besides opening the way to further accurate numerical studies of Rigidity Percolation, our work provides new rigorous theoretical insights on specific cluster merging mechanisms that distinguish it from the standard Connectivity Percolation problem.</description>

      <title>SO(n) Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki states as conformal boundary states of integrable SU(n) spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13114v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a class of conformal boundary states in the $\mathrm{SU}(n)_1$ Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) conformal field theory (CFT) using the symmetry embedding $\mathrm{Spin}(n)_2 \subset \mathrm{SU}(n)_1$. These boundary states are beyond the standard Cardy construction and possess $\mathrm{SO}(n)$ symmetry. The $\mathrm{SU}(n)$ Uimin-Lai-Sutherland (ULS) spin chains, which realize the $\mathrm{SU}(n)_1$ WZW model on the lattice, allow us to identify these boundary states as the ground states of the $\mathrm{SO}(n)$ Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki spin chains. Using the integrability of the $\mathrm{SU}(n)$ ULS model, we analytically compute the corresponding Affleck-Ludwig boundary entropy using exact overlap formulas. Our results unveil intriguing connections between exotic boundary states in CFT and integrable lattice models, thus providing deep insights into the interplay of symmetry, integrability, and boundary critical phenomena.</description>

      <title>Quantum Chaos Diagnostics for non-Hermitian Systems from Bi-Lanczos Krylov Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13956v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In Hermitian systems, Krylov complexity has emerged as a powerful diagnostic of quantum dynamics, capable of distinguishing chaotic from integrable phases, in agreement with established probes such as spectral statistics and out-of-time-order correlators. By contrast, its role in non-Hermitian settings, relevant for modeling open quantum systems, remains less understood due to the challenges posed by complex eigenvalues and the limitations of standard approaches based on orthogonality, such as singular value decomposition. Here we demonstrate that Krylov complexity, computed via the bi-Lanczos algorithm, provides a reliable probe of quantum chaos in non-Hermitian systems, clearly discriminating chaotic and integrable regimes. Our results agree with complex spectral statistics and complex spacing ratios, underscoring the robustness of the method. Universality is supported by extensive tests in both the non-Hermitian Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model and non-Hermitian random-matrix ensembles across multiple non-Hermitian symmetry classes.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Diffusion in Driven Electrolytes due to Hydrodynamic Fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08478v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The stochastic dynamics of tracers arising from hydrodynamic fluctuations in a driven electrolyte is studied using a self-consistent field-theory framework in all dimensions. A plethora of scaling behaviour that includes two distinct regimes of anomalous diffusion is found, and the crossovers between them are characterized in terms of the different tuning parameters. A short-time ballistic regime is found to be accessible beyond two dimensions, whereas a long-time diffusive regime is found to be present only at four dimensions and above. The results showcase how long-ranged hydrodynamic interactions can dominate the dynamics of non-equilibrium steady states in ionic suspensions and produce strong fluctuations despite the presence of Debye screening.</description>

      <title>Two variants of the friendship paradox: The condition for inequality between them</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06176v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The friendship paradox -- the observation that, on average, one's friends have more friends than oneself -- admits two common formulations depending on whether averaging is performed over edges or over nodes. These two definitions, the "alter-based" and "ego-based" means, are often treated as distinct but related quantities. This paper establishes their exact analytical relationship, showing that the difference between them is governed by the degree-degree covariance normalized by the mean degree. Explicit examples demonstrate the three possible cases of positive, zero, and negative covariance, corresponding respectively to assortative, neutral, and disassortative mixing patterns. The derivation further connects the covariance form to the moment-based expression introduced by Kumar, Krackhardt, and Feld [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 121, e2306412121 (2024)], which involves the (-1)st, 1st, 2nd, and 3rd moments of the degree distribution. The two formulations are shown to be equivalent, as they should be: the moment-based representation expands the same structural dependence that the covariance form expresses in its most compact and interpretable form. The analysis thus unifies node-level and moment-level perspectives on the friendship paradox, offering both a pedagogically transparent derivation and a direct bridge to recent theoretical developments.</description>

      <title>Universal TT- and TQ-relations via centrally extended q-Onsager algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15876v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $A_q$ be the alternating central extension of the q-Onsager algebra, a comodule algebra over the quantum loop algebra of $sl_2$. We classify one-dimensional representations of $A_q$, and show that spin-j K-operators constructed in arXiv:2301.00781 act as K-matrices previously obtained in the literature. Using these K-operators and K-matrices, we construct universal spin-j transfer matrices generating commutative subalgebras in $A_q$. Within a technical conjecture, we derive their fusion hierarchy, the so-called universal TT-relations. On spin-chain representations of $A_q$, we show how the universal transfer matrices evaluate to spin-chain transfer matrices, and as a result we get explicit TT-relations for all values of spins for auxiliary and quantum spaces, any inhomogeneities, and general integrable boundary conditions. In particular, we derive previously conjectured TT-relations. Using the TT-relations, we show that n-th local conserved quantities of the spin-j chains of length N are polynomials of total degree 4Njn in two non-local operators of the q-Onsager algebra. As a result, we give an algorithm of explicit calculation of all local conserved quantities in terms of spin operators. Furthermore, using the universal TT-relations we derive exchange relations between spin-j Hamiltonians and the two non-local operators showing non-trivial symmetries for special boundary conditions, that they commute with all Hamiltonian densities. As another application of our universal TT-relations we propose universal T-system, Y-system and universal TQ-relations for $A_q$, and as a result, universal TQ for the q-Onsager algebra. For diagonal boundary conditions, we also obtain universal TT- and TQ-relations for a degenerate version of $A_q$ known as centrally extended augmented q-Onsager algebra. We finally discuss implications of our results for generalized Gibbs ensemble construction.</description>

      <title>Large earthquakes follow highly unequal ones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08356v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It was conjectured for a long time that the tectonic plates are in a self-organized state of criticality and that the Gutenberg-Richter law is a manifestation of that. It was recently shown that for a system near criticality, the inequality of their responses due to external driving would sharply rise and show universal behavior that could indicate proximity of the system to a critical point. As a result, measures such as the Gini and Kolkata indices that quantify inequality, can also serve as indicators of imminent criticallity and that of diverging (system spanning) responses. In the context of earthquakes, such a large response would correspond to events of high magnitudes. In this work, we show with numerical simulations and seismic data analysis that large earthquake events have a tendency to follow events that are highly unequal, similar to the case of a system near a critical point. Therefore, a continuous monitoring of the inequality indices of the earthquake time series could be useful for hazard estimates. We have applied this framework to models of earthquakes as well as to the earthquake time series from various tectonically active regions, such as North America, Southern Japan, parts of South-East Asia and Indonesia. The findings also indicate a quantitative estimate of the distance from criticality, when the tectonic plates are viewed as a self-organized critical system.</description>

      <title>Structural Theory of Information Backflow in Non-Markovian Relaxation: TC/TCL Formalism and Minimal Phase Diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09054v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a structural theory of information backflow in minimal non-Markovian relaxation processes within the framework of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics. The approach is based on the time-convolution (TC) and time-convolutionless (TCL) projection-operator formalisms for reduced dynamics and on the doubling construction of non-equilibrium thermo field dynamics, which provides an embedding representation of dissipative evolution.
  We introduce a general backflow functional associated with a time-dependent information measure and derive generator-based sufficient conditions for the absence of backflow in terms of divisibility properties and effective relaxation rates. This allows a direct connection between memory kernels in generalized master equations and observable transient phenomena such as entropy overshoot and revival.
  Furthermore, we propose a decomposition of backflow into classical mixing and intrinsic contributions in the doubled representation, leading to a unified classification of transient regimes. Minimal classical and quantum two-state models are analyzed as analytically tractable examples, yielding explicit phase diagrams and recovering Mittag-Leffler-type fractional relaxation as a universal envelope of non-Markovian damping.
  The framework provides a constructive TC-to-TCL procedure for extracting effective rates and organizing memory-induced phenomena in a model-independent manner.</description>

      <title>Quantum Correlation Dynamics Subjected to Quantum Reset-Driven Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09348v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study two central qubits interacting with a transverse-field Ising chain that serves as their environment. The environment is driven linearly in time across its quantum critical points (QCPs) and, during the evolution, is subjected to quantum reset (QR), where it is returned at random times to its initial state. We investigate how such QR of the environmental spin chain modifies the dynamics of entanglement and quantum discord between the qubits. Our results show that in the strong-coupling regime, entanglement and discord exhibit pronounced revivals within the interval bounded by the Ising QCPs, but these revivals diminish as the QR rate increases. In contrast, weak coupling leads to a monotonic reduction of quantum correlations. Numerically, we find that the revival peaks of concurrence decay and scale exponentially with the QR rate, while quantum discord shows no clear scaling behavior. In the weak-coupling regime without QR, the correlations decay monotonically as the driven field crosses the second QCP. When QR is applied, however, both entanglement and discord undergo oscillatory suppression, with the oscillation period increasing as either the QR rate or the ramp time scale is reduced.</description>
