      <title>Grounded Predictions of Teamwork as a One-Shot Game: A Multiagent Multi-Armed Bandits Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Humans possess innate collaborative capacities. However, effective teamwork often remains challenging. This study delves into the feasibility of collaboration within teams of rational, self-interested agents who engage in teamwork without the obligation to contribute. Drawing from psychological and game theoretical frameworks, we formalise teamwork as a one-shot aggregative game, integrating insights from Steiner's theory of group productivity. We characterise this novel game's Nash equilibria and propose a multiagent multi-armed bandit system that learns to converge to approximations of such equilibria. Our research contributes value to the areas of game theory and multiagent systems, paving the way for a better understanding of voluntary collaborative dynamics. We examine how team heterogeneity, task typology, and assessment difficulty influence agents' strategies and resulting teamwork outcomes. Finally, we empirically study the behaviour of work teams under incentive systems that defy analytical treatment. Our agents demonstrate human-like behaviour patterns, corroborating findings from social psychology research.</description>

      <title>Language Grounded Multi-agent Communication for Ad-hoc Teamwork</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) methods have shown promise in enabling agents to learn a shared communication protocol from scratch and accomplish challenging team tasks. However, the learned language is usually not interpretable to humans or other agents not co-trained together, limiting its applicability in ad-hoc teamwork scenarios. In this work, we propose a novel computational pipeline that aligns the communication space between MARL agents with an embedding space of human natural language by grounding agent communications on synthetic data generated by embodied Large Language Models (LLMs) in interactive teamwork scenarios. Our results demonstrate that introducing language grounding not only maintains task performance but also accelerates the emergence of communication. Furthermore, the learned communication protocols exhibit zero-shot generalization capabilities in ad-hoc teamwork scenarios with unseen teammates and novel task states. This work presents a significant step toward enabling effective communication and collaboration between artificial agents and humans in real-world teamwork settings.</description>

      <title>Multi-UAV Enabled MEC Networks: Optimizing Delay through Intelligent 3D Trajectory Planning and Resource Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) reduces the computational burden on terminal devices by shortening the distance between these devices and computing nodes. Integrating Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) with enhanced MEC networks can leverage the high mobility of UAVs to flexibly adjust network topology, further expanding the applicability of MEC. However, in highly dynamic and complex real-world environments, it is crucial to balance task offloading effectiveness with algorithm performance. This paper investigates a multi-UAV communication network equipped with edge computing nodes to assist terminal users in task computation. Our goal is to reduce the task processing delay for users through the joint optimization of discrete computation modes, continuous 3D trajectories, and resource assignment. To address the challenges posed by the mixed action space, we propose a Multi-UAV Edge Computing Resource Scheduling (MUECRS) algorithm, which comprises two key components: 1) trajectory optimization, and 2) computation mode and resource management. Experimental results demonstrate our method effectively designs the 3D flight trajectories of UAVs, enabling rapid terminal coverage. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm achieves efficient resource deployment and scheduling, outperforming comparative algorithms by at least 16.7%, demonstrating superior adaptability and robustness.</description>

      <title>Modular Autonomous Vehicle in Heterogeneous Traffic Flow: Modeling, Simulation, and Implication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modular autonomous vehicles (MAVs) represent a groundbreaking concept that integrates modularity into the ongoing development of autonomous vehicles. This innovative design introduces unique features to traffic flow, allowing multiple modules to seamlessly join together and operate collectively. To understand the traffic flow characteristics involving these vehicles and their collective operations, this study established a modeling framework specifically designed to simulate their behavior within traffic flow. The mixed traffic flow, incorporating arbitrarily formed trains of various modular sizes, is modeled and studied. Simulations are conducted under varying levels of traffic demand and penetration rates to examine the traffic flow dynamics in the presence of these vehicles and their operations. The microscopic trajectories, MAV train compositions, and macroscopic fundamental diagrams of the mixed traffic flow are analyzed. The simulation findings indicate that integrating MAVs and their collective operations can substantially enhance capacity, with the extent of improvement depending on the penetration rate in mixed traffic flow. Notably, the capacity nearly doubles when the penetration rate exceeds 75%. Furthermore, their presence significantly influences and regulates the free-flow speed of the mixed traffic. Particularly, when variations in operational speed limits exist between the MAVs and the background traffic, the mixed traffic adjusts to the operating velocity of these vehicles. This study provides insights into potential future traffic flow systems incorporating emerging MAV technologies.</description>

      <title>Plurals: A System for Guiding LLMs Via Simulated Social Ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent debates raised concerns that language models may favor certain viewpoints. But what if the solution is not to aim for a 'view from nowhere' but rather to leverage different viewpoints? We introduce Plurals, a system and Python library for pluralistic AI deliberation. Plurals consists of Agents (LLMs, optionally with personas) which deliberate within customizable Structures, with Moderators overseeing deliberation. Plurals is a generator of simulated social ensembles. Plurals integrates with government datasets to create nationally representative personas, includes deliberation templates inspired by democratic deliberation theory, and allows users to customize both information-sharing structures and deliberation behavior within Structures. Six case studies demonstrate fidelity to theoretical constructs and efficacy. Three randomized experiments show simulated focus groups produced output resonant with an online sample of the relevant audiences (chosen over zero-shot generation in 75% of trials). Plurals is both a paradigm and a concrete system for pluralistic AI. The Plurals library is available at https://github.com/josh-ashkinaze/plurals and will be continually updated.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Nonlinear Model Predictive Control for Safe Collision Avoidance in Quadrotor Teams with Limited Detection Range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-quadrotor systems face significant challenges in decentralized control, particularly with safety and coordination under sensing and communication limitations. State-of-the-art methods leverage Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) to provide safety guarantees but often neglect actuation constraints and limited detection range. To address these gaps, we propose a novel decentralized Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) that integrates Exponential CBFs (ECBFs) to enhance safety and optimality in multi-quadrotor systems. We provide both conservative and practical minimum bounds of the range that preserve the safety guarantees of the ECBFs. We validate our approach through extensive simulations with up to 10 quadrotors and 20 obstacles, as well as real-world experiments with 3 quadrotors. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in realistic settings, highlighting its potential for reliable quadrotor teams operations.</description>

      <title>AssistantX: An LLM-Powered Proactive Assistant in Collaborative Human-Populated Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing demand for intelligent assistants in human-populated environments has motivated significant research in autonomous robotic systems. Traditional service robots and virtual assistants, however, struggle with real-world task execution due to their limited capacity for dynamic reasoning and interaction, particularly when human collaboration is required. Recent developments in Large Language Models have opened new avenues for improving these systems, enabling more sophisticated reasoning and natural interaction capabilities. In this paper, we introduce AssistantX, an LLM-powered proactive assistant designed to operate autonomously in a physical office environment. Unlike conventional service robots, AssistantX leverages a novel multi-agent architecture, PPDR4X, which provides advanced inference capabilities and comprehensive collaboration awareness. By effectively bridging the gap between virtual operations and physical interactions, AssistantX demonstrates robust performance in managing complex real-world scenarios. Our evaluation highlights the architecture's effectiveness, showing that AssistantX can respond to clear instructions, actively retrieve supplementary information from memory, and proactively seek collaboration from team members to ensure successful task completion.

      <title>Control Industrial Automation System with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional industrial automation systems require specialized expertise to operate and complex reprogramming to adapt to new processes. Large language models offer the intelligence to make them more flexible and easier to use. However, LLMs' application in industrial settings is underexplored. This paper introduces a framework for integrating LLMs to achieve end-to-end control of industrial automation systems. At the core of the framework are an agent system designed for industrial tasks, a structured prompting method, and an event-driven information modeling mechanism that provides real-time data for LLM inference. The framework supplies LLMs with real-time events on different context semantic levels, allowing them to interpret the information, generate production plans, and control operations on the automation system. It also supports structured dataset creation for fine-tuning on this downstream application of LLMs. Our contribution includes a formal system design, proof-of-concept implementation, and a method for generating task-specific datasets for LLM fine-tuning and testing. This approach enables a more adaptive automation system that can respond to spontaneous events, while allowing easier operation and configuration through natural language for more intuitive human-machine interaction.

      <description>arXiv:2409.18037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present HARMONIC, a framework for implementing cognitive robots that transforms general-purpose robots into trusted teammates capable of complex decision-making, natural communication and human-level explanation. The framework supports interoperability between a strategic (cognitive) layer for high-level decision-making and a tactical (robot) layer for low-level control and execution. We describe the core features of the framework and our initial implementation, in which HARMONIC was deployed on a simulated UGV and drone involved in a multi-robot search and retrieval task.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to multi-robot planning and collaboration. We demonstrate a cognitive strategy for robots in human-robot teams that incorporates metacognition, natural language communication, and explainability. The system is embodied using the HARMONIC architecture that flexibly integrates cognitive and control capabilities across the team. We evaluate our approach through simulation experiments involving a joint search task by a team of heterogeneous robots (a UGV and a drone) and a human. We detail the system's handling of complex, real-world scenarios, effective action coordination between robots with different capabilities, and natural human-robot communication. This work demonstrates that the robots' ability to reason about plans, goals, and attitudes, and to provide explanations for actions and decisions are essential prerequisites for realistic human-robot teaming.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Explanation is key to people having confidence in high-stakes AI systems. However, machine-learning-based systems - which account for almost all current AI - can't explain because they are usually black boxes. The explainable AI (XAI) movement hedges this problem by redefining "explanation". The human-centered explainable AI (HCXAI) movement identifies the explanation-oriented needs of users but can't fulfill them because of its commitment to machine learning. In order to achieve the kinds of explanations needed by real people operating in critical domains, we must rethink how to approach AI. We describe a hybrid approach to developing cognitive agents that uses a knowledge-based infrastructure supplemented by data obtained through machine learning when applicable. These agents will serve as assistants to humans who will bear ultimate responsibility for the decisions and actions of the human-robot team. We illustrate the explanatory potential of such agents using the under-the-hood panels of a demonstration system in which a team of simulated robots collaborates on a search task assigned by a human.</description>

      <title>ZSC-Eval: An Evaluation Toolkit and Benchmark for Multi-agent Zero-shot Coordination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.05208v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Zero-shot coordination (ZSC) is a new cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) challenge that aims to train an ego agent to work with diverse, unseen partners during deployment. The significant difference between the deployment-time partners' distribution and the training partners' distribution determined by the training algorithm makes ZSC a unique out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization challenge. The potential distribution gap between evaluation and deployment-time partners leads to inadequate evaluation, which is exacerbated by the lack of appropriate evaluation metrics. In this paper, we present ZSC-Eval, the first evaluation toolkit and benchmark for ZSC algorithms. ZSC-Eval consists of: 1) Generation of evaluation partner candidates through behavior-preferring rewards to approximate deployment-time partners' distribution; 2) Selection of evaluation partners by Best-Response Diversity (BR-Div); 3) Measurement of generalization performance with various evaluation partners via the Best-Response Proximity (BR-Prox) metric. We use ZSC-Eval to benchmark ZSC algorithms in Overcooked and Google Research Football environments and get novel empirical findings. We also conduct a human experiment of current ZSC algorithms to verify the ZSC-Eval's consistency with human evaluation. ZSC-Eval is now available at https://github.com/sjtu-marl/ZSC-Eval.</description>

      <title>CollaMamba: Efficient Collaborative Perception with Cross-Agent Spatial-Temporal State Space Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07714v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By sharing complementary perceptual information, multi-agent collaborative perception fosters a deeper understanding of the environment. Recent studies on collaborative perception mostly utilize CNNs or Transformers to learn feature representation and fusion in the spatial dimension, which struggle to handle long-range spatial-temporal features under limited computing and communication resources. Holistically modeling the dependencies over extensive spatial areas and extended temporal frames is crucial to enhancing feature quality. To this end, we propose a resource efficient cross-agent spatial-temporal collaborative state space model (SSM), named CollaMamba. Initially, we construct a foundational backbone network based on spatial SSM. This backbone adeptly captures positional causal dependencies from both single-agent and cross-agent views, yielding compact and comprehensive intermediate features while maintaining linear complexity. Furthermore, we devise a history-aware feature boosting module based on temporal SSM, extracting contextual cues from extended historical frames to refine vague features while preserving low overhead. Extensive experiments across several datasets demonstrate that CollaMamba outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving higher model accuracy while reducing computational and communication overhead by up to 71.9% and 1/64, respectively. This work pioneers the exploration of the Mamba's potential in collaborative perception. The source code will be made available.</description>

      <title>Opponent Shaping for Antibody Development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10588v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Anti-viral therapies are typically designed to target the current strains of a virus. Game theoretically, this corresponds to a short-sighted, or myopic, response. However, therapy-induced selective pressures act on viral antigens to drive the emergence of mutated strains, against which initial therapies have reduced efficacy. Building on a computational model of binding between antibodies and viral antigens (the Absolut! framework), we design and implement a genetic simulation of such viral evolutionary escape. Crucially, this allows our antibody optimisation algorithm to consider and influence the entire escape curve of the virus, i.e. to guide (or ''shape'') the viral evolution. This is inspired by opponent shaping which, in general-sum learning, accounts for the adaptation of the co-player rather than playing a myopic best response. Hence we call the optimised antibodies shapers. Within our simulations, we demonstrate that our shapers target both current and simulated future viral variants, outperforming the antibodies chosen in a myopic way. Furthermore, we show that shapers exert specific evolutionary pressure on the virus compared to myopic antibodies. Altogether, shapers modify the evolutionary trajectories of viral strains and minimise the viral escape compared to their myopic counterparts. While this is a simplified model, we hope that our proposed paradigm will enable the discovery of better long-lived vaccines and antibody therapies in the future, enabled by rapid advancements in the capabilities of simulation tools. Our code is available at https://github.com/olakalisz/antibody-shapers.</description>
