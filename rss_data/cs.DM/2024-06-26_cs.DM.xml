      <title>Spectral conditions of pancyclicity for t-tough graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: More than 40 years ago Chv\'atal introduced a new graph invariant, which he called graph toughness. From then on a lot of research has been conducted, mainly related to the relationship between toughness conditions and the existence of cyclic structures, in particular, determining whether the graph is Hamiltonian and pancyclic. A pancyclic graph is certainly Hamiltonian, but not conversely. Bondy in 1976, however, suggested the "metaconjecture" that almost any nontrivial condition on a graph which implies that the graph is Hamiltonian also implies that the graph is pancyclic. We confirm the Bondy conjecture for t-tough graphs in the case when $t\in \{ 1;2;3\}$ in terms of the edge number, the spectral radius and the signless Laplacian spectral radius of the graph.</description>

      <title>The Complexity of Intersection Graphs of Lines in Space and Circle Orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the complexity of the recognition problem for two families of combinatorial structures. A graph $G=(V,E)$ is said to be an intersection graph of lines in space if every $v\in V$ can be mapped to a straight line $\ell (v)$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$ so that $vw$ is an edge in $E$ if and only if $\ell(v)$ and $\ell(w)$ intersect. A partially ordered set $(X,\prec)$ is said to be a circle order, or a 2-space-time order, if every $x\in X$ can be mapped to a closed circular disk $C(x)$ so that $y\prec x$ if and only if $C(y)$ is contained in $C(x)$. We prove that the recognition problems for intersection graphs of lines and circle orders are both $\exists\mathbb{R}$-complete, hence polynomial-time equivalent to deciding whether a system of polynomial equalities and inequalities has a solution over the reals. The second result addresses an open problem posed by Brightwell and Luczak.</description>

      <title>The Spectrum of the Singular Values of Z-Shaped Graph Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.14144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2006.14144v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph matrices are a type of matrix which has played a crucial role in analyzing the sum of squares hierarchy on average case problems. However, except for rough norm bounds, little is known about graph matrices. In this paper, we take a step towards better understanding graph matrices by determining the limiting distribution of the spectrum of the singular values of Z-shaped graph matrices. We then give a partial generalization of our results for $m$-layer Z-shaped graph matrices.</description>
