      <title>Graph-Based Nearest-Neighbor Search without the Spread</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $\renewcommand{\Re}{\mathbb{R}}$Recent work showed how to construct nearest-neighbor graphs of linear size, on a given set $P$ of $n$ points in $\Re^d$, such that one can answer approximate nearest-neighbor queries in logarithmic time in the spread. Unfortunately, the spread might be unbounded in $n$, and an interesting theoretical question is how to remove the dependency on the spread. Here, we show how to construct an external linear-size data structure that, combined with the linear-size graph, allows us to answer ANN queries in logarithmic time in $n$.</description>

      <title>Gromov-Wasserstein at Scale, Beyond Squared Norms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fundamental challenge in data science is to match disparate point sets with each other. While optimal transport efficiently minimizes point displacements under a bijectivity constraint, it is inherently sensitive to rotations. Conversely, minimizing distortions via the Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) framework addresses this limitation but introduces a non-convex, computationally demanding optimization problem. In this work, we identify a broad class of distortion penalties that reduce to a simple alignment problem within a lifted feature space. Leveraging this insight, we introduce an iterative GW solver with a linear memory footprint and quadratic (rather than cubic) time complexity. Our method is differentiable, comes with strong theoretical guarantees, and scales to hundreds of thousands of points in minutes. This efficiency unlocks a wide range of geometric applications and enables the exploration of the GW energy landscape, whose local minima encode the symmetries of the matching problem.</description>

      <title>Computing Diffusion Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Calculus and geometry are ubiquitous in the theoretical modelling of scientific phenomena, but have historically been very challenging to apply directly to real data as statistics. Diffusion geometry is a new theory that reformulates classical calculus and geometry in terms of a diffusion process, allowing these theories to generalise beyond manifolds and be computed from data. This work introduces a new computational framework for diffusion geometry that substantially broadens its practical scope and improves its precision, robustness to noise, and computational complexity. We present a range of new computational methods, including all the standard objects from vector calculus and Riemannian geometry, and apply them to solve spatial PDEs and vector field flows, find geodesic (intrinsic) distances, curvature, and several new topological tools like de Rham cohomology, circular coordinates, and Morse theory. These methods are data-driven, scalable, and can exploit highly optimised numerical tools for linear algebra.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Sliced Wasserstein Kernel for persistence diagrams: a Figalli-Gigli approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Sliced Wasserstein Kernel (SWK) for persistence diagrams was introduced in (Carri{\`e}re et al. 2017) as a powerful tool to implicitly embed persistence diagrams in a Hilbert space with reasonable distortion. This kernel is built on the intuition that the Figalli-Gigli distance-that is the partial matching distance routinely used to compare persistence diagrams-resembles the Wasserstein distance used in the optimal transport literature, and that the later could be sliced to define a positive definite kernel on the space of persistence diagrams. This efficient construction nonetheless relies on ad-hoc tweaks on the Wasserstein distance to account for the peculiar geometry of the space of persistence diagrams. In this work, we propose to revisit this idea by directly using the Figalli-Gigli distance instead of the Wasserstein one as the building block of our kernel. On the theoretical side, our sliced Figalli-Gigli kernel (SFGK) shares most of the important properties of the SWK of Carri{\`e}re et al., including distortion results on the induced embedding and its ease of computation, while being more faithful to the natural geometry of persistence diagrams. In particular, it can be directly used to handle infinite persistence diagrams and persistence measures. On the numerical side, we show that the SFGK performs as well as the SWK on benchmark applications.</description>

      <title>Extracting Manifold Information from Point Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00427v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A kernel based method is proposed for the construction of signature (defining) functions of subsets of $\mathbb{R}^d$. The subsets can range from full dimensional manifolds (open subsets) to point clouds (a finite number of points) and include bounded (closed) smooth manifolds of any codimension. The interpolation and analysis of point clouds are the main application. Two extreme cases in terms of regularity are considered, where the data set is interpolated by an analytic surface, at the one extreme, and by a H\"older continuous surface, at the other. The signature function can be computed as a combination of translated kernels, the coefficients of which are the solution of a Fredholm integral equation (matrix equation in the finite dimensional case). Once it is obtained, it can be used to estimate the dimension as well as the normal and the curvatures of the interpolated manifold. The method is global and does not require the data set to be organized or structured in any particular way. It admits a variational formulation with a natural regularized counterpart, that proves useful in dealing with data sets corrupted by numerical error or noise. The underlying analytical structure of the approach is presented in general before it is applied to the case of point clouds.</description>

      <title>T-REGS: Minimum Spanning Tree Regularization for Self-Supervised Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23484v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for learning representations without labeled data, often by enforcing invariance to input transformations such as rotations or blurring. Recent studies have highlighted two pivotal properties for effective representations: (i) avoiding dimensional collapse-where the learned features occupy only a low-dimensional subspace, and (ii) enhancing uniformity of the induced distribution. In this work, we introduce T-REGS, a simple regularization framework for SSL based on the length of the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) over the learned representation. We provide theoretical analysis demonstrating that T-REGS simultaneously mitigates dimensional collapse and promotes distribution uniformity on arbitrary compact Riemannian manifolds. Several experiments on synthetic data and on classical SSL benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our approach at enhancing representation quality.</description>
