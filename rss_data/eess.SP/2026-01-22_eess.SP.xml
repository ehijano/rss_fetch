      <title>Experimental Performance of Bidirectional Phase Coherent Transmission and Sensing for mmWave Cell-free Massive MIMO Systems with Reciprocity Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase synchronization among distributed transmission reception points (TRPs) is a prerequisite for enabling coherent joint transmission and high-precision sensing in millimeter wave (mmWave) cell-free massive multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) systems. This paper proposes a bidirectional calibration scheme and a calibration coefficient estimation method for phase synchronization, and presents a calibration coefficient phase tracking method using unilateral uplink/downlink channel state information (CSI). Furthermore, this paper introduces the use of reciprocity calibration to eliminate non-ideal factors in sensing and leverages sensing results to achieve calibration coefficient phase tracking in dynamic scenarios, thus enabling bidirectional empowerment of both communication and sensing. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively implement reciprocal calibration with lower overhead, enabling coherent collaborative transmission, and resolving non-ideal factors to acquire lower sensing error in sensing applications. Experimental results show that, in the mmWave band, over-the-air (OTA) bidirectional calibration enables coherent collaborative transmission for both collaborative TRPs and collaborative user equipments (UEs), achieving beamforming gain and long-time coherent sensing capabilities.</description>

      <title>Improved GPR-Based CSI Acquisition via Spatial-Correlation Kernel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate channel estimation with low pilot overhead and computational complexity is key to efficiently utilizing multi-antenna wireless systems. Motivated by the evolution from purely statistical descriptions toward physics- and geometry-aware propagation models, this work focuses on incorporating channel information into a Gaussian process regression (GPR) framework for improving the channel estimation accuracy. In this work, we propose a GPR-based channel estimation framework along with a novel Spatial-correlation (SC) kernel that explicitly captures the channel's second-order statistics. We derive a closed-form expression of the proposed SC-based GPR estimator and prove that its posterior mean is optimal in terms of minimum mean-square error (MMSE) under the same second-order statistics, without requiring the underlying channel distribution to be Gaussian. Our analysis reveals that, with up to 50% pilot overhead reduction, the proposed method achieves the lowest normalized mean-square error, the highest empirical 95% credible-interval coverage, and superior preservation of spectral efficiency compared to benchmark estimators, while maintaining lower computational complexity than the conventional MMSE estimator.</description>

      <title>Integrated Sensing, Communication and Control enabled Agile UAV Swarm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms are pivotal in the applications such as disaster relief, aerial base station (BS) and logistics transportation. These scenarios require the capabilities in accurate sensing, efficient communication and flexible control for real-time and reliable task execution. However, sensing, communication and control are studied independently in traditional research, which limits the overall performance of UAV swarms. To overcome this disadvantage, we propose a deeply coupled scheme of integrated sensing, communication and control (ISCC) for UAV swarms, which is a systemic paradigm that transcends traditional isolated designs of sensing, communication and control by establishing a tightly-coupled closed-loop through the co-optimization of sensing, communication and control. In this article, we firstly analyze the requirements of scenarios and key performance metrics. Subsequently, the enabling technologies are proposed, including communication-and-control-enhanced sensing, sensing-and-control-enhanced communication, and sensing-and-communication-enhanced control. Simulation results validate the performance of the proposed ISCC framework, demonstrating its application potential in the future.</description>

      <title>Absorption mode broadband 2D MS for proteomics and metabolomics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional mass spectrometry (2D MS) is a method for tandem mass spectrometry that enables the correlation between precursor and fragment ions without the need for ion isolation. On a Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer, the phase correction functions for absorption mode data processing were found to be linear in the precursor ion dimension and quadratic in the fragment ion dimension. Absorption mode data processing on limited data sets has previously shown improvements in signal-to-noise ratio and resolving power by a factor of 2. Here, we have expanded absorption mode data processing to 2D mass spectra regardless of size and frequency range. We have applied absorption mode 2D MS to top-down analysis of variously oxidized ubiquitin proteoforms generated by fast photochemical oxidation of proteins (FPOP) and to an extract of ergot alkaloids. We show that absorption mode data processing significantly improves both the signal-to-noise ratio and the resolving power of the 2D mass spectrum compared to standard magnitude mode in terms of sequence coverage in top-down proteomics, as well as the accuracy of precursor-fragment correlation in metabolomics.</description>

      <title>Movable Antenna Empowered Covert Dual-Functional Radar-Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Movable antenna (MA) has emerged as a promising technology to flexibly reconfigure wireless channels by adjusting antenna placement. In this paper, we study a secured dual-functional radar-communication (DFRC) system aided by movable antennas. To enhance the communication security, we aim to maximize the achievable sum rate by jointly optimizing the transmitter beamforming vectors, receiving filter, and antenna placement, subject to radar signal-to-noise ratio (SINR) and transmission covertness constraints. We consider multiple Willies operating in both non-colluding and colluding modes. For noncolluding Willies, we first employ a Lagrangian dual transformation procedure to reformulate the challenging optimization problem into a more tractable form. Subsequently, we develop an efficient block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm that integrates semidefinite relaxation (SDR), projected gradient descent (PGD), Dinkelbach transformation, and successive convex approximation (SCA) techniques to tackle the resulting problem. For colluding Willies, we first derive the minimum detection error probability (DEP) by characterizing the optimal detection statistic, which is proven to follow the generalized Erlang distribution. Then, we develop a minimum mean square error (MMSE)-based algorithm to address the colluding detection problem. We further provide a comprehensive complexity analysis on the unified design framework. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method can significantly improve the covert sum rate, and achieve a superior balance between communication and radar performance compared with existing benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Sensing in OFDM-based ISAC under the Influence of Sampling Jitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To enable integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) in cellular networks, a wide range of additional requirements and challenges are either imposed or become more critical. One such impairment is sampling jitter (SJ), which arises due to imperfections in the sampling instants of the clocks of digital-to-analog converters (DACs) and analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). While SJ is already well studied for communication systems based on orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM), which is expected to be the waveform of choice for most sixth-generation (6G) scenarios where ISAC could be possible, the implications of SJ on the OFDM-based radar sensing must still be thoroughly analyzed. Considering that phase-locked loop (PLL)-based oscillators are used to derive sampling clocks, which leads to colored SJ, i.e., SJ with non-flat power spectral density, this article analyzes the resulting distortion of the adopted digital constellation modulation and sensing performance in OFDM-based ISAC for both baseband (BB) and bandpass (BP) sampling strategies and different oversampling factors. For BB sampling, it is seen that SJ induces intercarrier interference (ICI), while for BP sampling, it causes carrier phase error and more severe ICI due to a phase noise-like effect at the digital intermediate frequency. Obtained results for a single-input single-output OFDM-based ISAC system with various OFDM signal parameterizations demonstrate that SJ-induced degradation becomes non-negligible for both BB and BP sampling only for root mean square (RMS) SJ values above 10^-11 s at both DAC and ADC, which corresponds to 0.5*10^-2 times the considered critical sampling period without oversampling. Based on the achieved results, it can be concluded that state-of-the-art hardware enables sufficient communication and sensing robustness against SJ, as RMS SJ values in the femtosecond range can be achieved.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning assisted Port-Cycling based Channel Sounding for Precoder Estimation in Massive MIMO Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future wireless systems are expected to employ a substantially larger number of transmit ports for channel state information (CSI) estimation compared to current specifications. Although scaling ports improves spectral efficiency, it also increases the resource overhead to transmit reference signals across the time-frequency grid, ultimately reducing achievable data throughput. In this work, we propose an deep learning (DL)-based CSI reconstruction framework that serves as an enabler for reliable CSI acquisition in future 6G systems. The proposed solution involves designing a port-cycling mechanism that sequentially sounds different portions of CSI ports across time, thereby lowering the overhead while preserving channel observability. The proposed CSI Adaptive Network (CsiAdaNet) model exploits the resulting sparse measurements and captures both spatial and temporal correlations to accurately reconstruct the full-port CSI. The simulation results show that our method achieves overhead reduction while maintaining high CSI reconstruction accuracy.</description>

      <title>Alternative Shapes of Modulation Schemes Detailed Exposition and Simulation Methodology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.15004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modulation constellation design is a core challenge in digital communications, especially under stringent demands on spectral efficiency, robustness, and energy consumption. Classical schemes like PSK and QAM, while analytically tractable, often lose optimality under realistic channels and nonlinear hardware constraints. This paper provides a unified study of constellation design from geometric, probabilistic, optimization, and machine learning perspectives, focusing on symbol error rate (SER), fading robustness, peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), and energy efficiency. We evaluate classical, lattice-based, asymmetric, probabilistically shaped, Golden Angle, heuristic-optimized, and machine learning assisted constellations under AWGN and Rayleigh fading via large-scale Monte Carlo simulations. Incorporating PAPR-aware and power amplifier models reveals that SER-optimal designs are not always energy-optimal; small SER trade-offs can yield substantial energy savings. Machine learning approaches offer flexible joint optimization of reliability, robustness, and energy efficiency by embedding channel and hardware constraints into the learning objective.</description>

      <title>Physical Layer Security in Massive MIMO: Challenges and Open Research Directions Against Passive Eavesdroppers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) has become a crucial enabling technology for 5G and beyond, providing previously unheard-of increases in energy and spectrum efficiency. It is still difficult to guarantee secure communication in these systems, particularly when it comes to passive eavesdroppers whose base station is unaware of their channel state information. By taking advantage of the inherent randomness of wireless channels, Physical Layer Security (PLS) offers a promising paradigm; however, its efficacy in massive MIMO is heavily reliant on resource allocation and transmission strategies. In this work, the performance of secure transmission schemes, such as Maximum Ratio Transmission (MRT), Zero-Forcing (ZF), and Artificial Noise (AN)-aided beamforming, is examined when passive eavesdroppers are present. This work will use extensive Monte Carlo simulations to assess important performance metrics such as energy efficiency, secrecy outage probability, and secrecy sum rate under different system parameters (e.g., number of antennas, Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), power allocation). The results aim to provide comparative insight into the strengths and limitations of different PLS strategies and to highlight open research directions to design scalable, energy-efficient, and robust secure transmission techniques in future 6G networks.</description>

      <title>Neural Tracking of Sustained Attention, Attention Switching, and Natural Conversation in Audiovisual Environments using Mobile EEG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Everyday communication is dynamic and multisensory, often involving shifting attention, overlapping speech and visual cues. Yet, most neural attention tracking studies are still limited to highly controlled lab settings, using clean, often audio-only stimuli and requiring sustained attention to a single talker. This work addresses that gap by introducing a novel dataset from 24 normal-hearing participants. We used a mobile electroencephalography (EEG) system (44 scalp electrodes and 20 cEEGrid electrodes) in an audiovisual (AV) paradigm with three conditions: sustained attention to a single talker in a two-talker environment, attention switching between two talkers, and unscripted two-talker conversations with a competing single talker. Analysis included temporal response functions (TRFs) modeling, optimal lag analysis, selective attention classification with decision windows ranging from 1.1s to 35s, and comparisons of TRFs for attention to AV conversations versus side audio-only talkers. Key findings show significant differences in the attention-related P2-peak between attended and ignored speech across conditions for scalp EEG. No significant change in performance between switching and sustained attention suggests robustness for attention switches. Optimal lag analysis revealed narrower peak for conversation compared to single-talker AV stimuli, reflecting the additional complexity of multi-talker processing. Classification of selective attention was consistently above chance (55-70% accuracy) for scalp EEG, while cEEGrid data yielded lower correlations, highlighting the need for further methodological improvements. These results demonstrate that mobile EEG can reliably track selective attention in dynamic, multisensory listening scenarios and provide guidance for designing future AV paradigms and real-world attention tracking applications.</description>

      <title>Sparse Sensor Arrays for Active Sensing: Models, Configurations and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This chapter focuses on active sensing using sparse arrays. In active sensing applications, such as radar, sonar, wireless communications, and medical ultrasound, a collection of sensors probes the environment by emitting self-generated energy. A key benefit of such active multi-sensor arrays is their ability to focus and steer energy in desired directions by beamforming on transmit. Sparse sensor arrays offer several advantages over conventional uniform arrays, including improved resolution using fewer physical sensors and the capability to identify more scatterers than sensors. This is facilitated by the effective transmit-receive virtual array known as the sum co-array, which can have many more virtual sensors than the number of physical transmit or receive sensors. Herein, we focus on the design of low-redundancy sparse array configurations and on employing transmit-receive (Tx-Rx) beamforming using sparse arrays. We discuss the optimal, but computationally intractable Minimum-redundancy array, and a scalable symmetric array framework, which extends many well-known passive sparse array geometries to the active case. We also examine mitigating side lobes arising from spatial undersampling by a synthetic beamforming method known as image addition. We briefly present approaches for finding the physical beamforming weights synthesizing a desired Tx-Rx beampattern, and consider related spatio-temporal trade-offs. We conclude by discussing selected applications of sparse arrays in active sensing.</description>

      <title>Weather Estimation for Integrated Sensing and Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the key features of sixth generation (6G) mobile communications will be integrated sensing and communication (ISAC). While the main goal of ISAC in standardization efforts is to detect objects, the byproducts of radar operations can be used to enable new services in 6G, such as weather sensing. Even though weather radars are the most prominent technology for weather detection and monitoring, they are expensive and usually neglect areas in close vicinity. To this end, we propose reusing the dense deployment of 6G base stations for weather sensing purposes by detecting and estimating weather conditions. We implement both a classifier and a regressor as a convolutional neural network trained across measurements with varying precipitation rates and wind speeds. We implement our approach in an ISAC proof-of-concept, and conduct a multi-week experiment campaign. Experimental results show that we are able to jointly and accurately classify weather conditions with accuracies of 99.38% and 98.99% for precipitation rate and wind speed, respectively. For estimation, we obtain errors of 1.2 mm/h and 1.5 km/h, for precipitation rate and wind speed, respectively. These findings indicate that weather sensing services can be reliably deployed in 6G ISAC networks, broadening their service portfolio and boosting their market value.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.07861v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 5G cellular systems depend on the timely exchange of feedback control information between the user equipment and the base station. Proper decoding of this control information is necessary to set up and sustain high throughput radio links. This paper makes the first attempt at using Machine Learning techniques to improve the decoding performance of the Physical Uplink Control Channel Format 0. We use fully connected neural networks to classify the received samples based on the uplink control information content embedded within them. The trained neural network, tested on real-time wireless captures, shows significant improvement in accuracy over conventional DFT-based decoders, even at low SNR. The obtained accuracy results also demonstrate conformance with 3GPP requirements.</description>

      <title>Communication-Efficient Multi-Modal Edge Inference via Uncertainty-Aware Distributed Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semantic communication is emerging as a key enabler for distributed edge intelligence due to its capability to convey task-relevant meaning. However, achieving communication-efficient training and robust inference over wireless links remains challenging. This challenge is further exacerbated for multi-modal edge inference (MMEI) by two factors: 1) prohibitive communication overhead for distributed learning over bandwidth-limited wireless links, due to the \emph{multi-modal} nature of the system; and 2) limited robustness under varying channels and noisy multi-modal inputs. In this paper, we propose a three-stage communication-aware distributed learning framework to improve training and inference efficiency while maintaining robustness over wireless channels. In Stage~I, devices perform local multi-modal self-supervised learning to obtain shared and modality-specific encoders without device--server exchange, thereby reducing the communication cost. In Stage~II, distributed fine-tuning with centralized evidential fusion calibrates per-modality uncertainty and reliably aggregates features distorted by noise or channel fading. In Stage~III, an uncertainty-guided feedback mechanism selectively requests additional features for uncertain samples, optimizing the communication--accuracy tradeoff in the distributed setting. Experiments on RGB--depth indoor scene classification show that the proposed framework attains higher accuracy with far fewer training communication rounds and remains robust to modality degradation or channel variation, outperforming existing self-supervised and fully supervised baselines.</description>

      <title>Instantaneous Frequency in Power Systems using the Teager-Kaiser Energy Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops an instantaneous-frequency (IF) local estimator calculated with the complex Teager-Kaiser energy operator (CTKEO) and the dynamic-signal identity. The contribution is a novel IF expression that makes the envelope-curvature terms explicit, thus correcting the bias that affects conventional estimators used in power systems. The estimator aligns with complex-frequency (CF) kinematics and admits a geometric interpretation (curvature/torsion) without phase unwrapping. Simulations and data-driven examples demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Single-Satellite-Based Geolocation of Broadcast GNSS Spoofers from Low Earth Orbit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17791v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents an analysis and experimental demonstration of single-satellite single-pass geolocation of a terrestrial broadcast Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) spoofer from Low Earth Orbit (LEO). The proliferation of LEO-based GNSS receivers offers the prospect of unprecedented spectrum awareness, enabling persistent GNSS interference detection and geolocation. Accurate LEO-based single-receiver emitter geolocation is possible when a range-rate time history can be extracted for the emitter. This paper presents a technique crafted specifically for indiscriminate broadcast-type GNSS spoofing signals. Furthermore, it explores how unmodeled oscillator instability and worst-case spoofer-introduced signal variations degrade the geolocation estimate. The proposed geolocation technique is validated by a controlled experiment, in partnership with Spire Global, in which a LEO-based receiver captures broadcast GNSS spoofing signals transmitted from a known ground station on a non-GNSS frequency band.</description>

      <title>Performance Comparison of Joint Delay-Doppler Estimation Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16200v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communications (ISAC), radar, and beamforming require real-time, high-resolution estimation algorithms to determine delay-Doppler values of specular paths within the wireless propagation channel. Our contribution is the measurement-based performance comparison of the delay-Doppler estimation between three different algorithms, comprising maximum likelihood (ML), convolutional neural network (CNN), and constant false alarm rate (CFAR) approaches. We apply these algorithms to publicly available channel data which includes two spherical targets with analytically describable delay-Doppler parameters. The comparison of the three algorithms features the target detection rate, root mean squared errors (RMSEs) of the delay-Doppler estimates, and a runtime analysis. Notably, all three algorithms demonstrate similar parameter estimation capabilities in bi-static scenarios, achieving target detection probabilities of up to 80%. Conversely, forward and backward scattering conditions pose a problem to the estimation due to strong line-of-sight (LoS) contribution, reducing the corresponding detection probability down to 0%.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.04186v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inverse wave scattering aims at determining the properties of an object using data on how the object scatters incoming waves. In order to collect information, sensors are put in different locations to send and receive waves from each other. The choice of sensor positions and incident wave frequencies determines the reconstruction quality of scatterer properties. This paper introduces reinforcement learning to develop precision imaging that decides sensor positions and wave frequencies adaptive to different scatterers in an intelligent way, thus obtaining a significant improvement in reconstruction quality with limited imaging resources. Extensive numerical results will be provided to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over existing methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18579v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an unsupervised variational acoustic clustering model for clustering audio data in the time-frequency domain. The model leverages variational inference, extended to an autoencoder framework, with a Gaussian mixture model as a prior for the latent space. Specifically designed for audio applications, we introduce a convolutional-recurrent variational autoencoder optimized for efficient time-frequency processing. Our experimental results considering a spoken digits dataset demonstrate a significant improvement in accuracy and clustering performance compared to traditional methods, showcasing the model's enhanced ability to capture complex audio patterns.</description>

      <title>Acoustic Non-Stationarity Objective Assessment with Hard Label Criteria for Supervised Learning Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06405v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Objective non-stationarity measures are resource intensive and impose critical limitations for real-time processing solutions. In this paper, a novel Hard Label Criteria (HLC) algorithm is proposed to generate a global non-stationarity label for acoustic signals, enabling supervised learning strategies to be trained as stationarity estimators. The HLC is first evaluated on state-of-the-art general-purpose acoustic models, demonstrating that these models capture stationarity information. Furthermore, the first-of-its-kind HLC-based Network for Acoustic Non-Stationarity Assessment (NANSA) is proposed. NANSA models outperform competing approaches, achieving up to 99% classification accuracy, while solving the computational infeasibility of traditional objective measures.</description>

      <title>Rec-RIR: Monaural Blind Room Impulse Response Identification via DNN-based Reverberant Speech Reconstruction in STFT Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15628v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents Rec-RIR for monaural blind room impulse response (RIR) identification. Rec-RIR is developed based on the convolutive transfer function (CTF) approximation, which models reverberation effect within narrow-band filter banks in the short-time Fourier transform domain. Specifically, we propose a deep neural network (DNN) with cross-band and narrow-band blocks to estimate the CTF filter. The DNN is trained through reconstructing the noise-free reverberant speech spectra. This objective enables stable and straightforward supervised training. Subsequently, a pseudo intrusive measurement process is employed to convert the CTF filter estimate into RIR by simulating a common intrusive RIR measurement procedure. Experimental results demonstrate that Rec-RIR achieves state-of-the-art performance in both RIR identification and acoustic parameter estimation. Open-source codes are available online at https://github.com/Audio-WestlakeU/Rec-RIR.</description>

      <title>Targeted Fine-Tuning of DNN-Based Receivers via Influence Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15950v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first use of influence functions for deep learning-based wireless receivers. Applied to DeepRx, a fully convolutional receiver, influence analysis reveals which training samples drive bit predictions, enabling targeted fine-tuning of poorly performing cases. We show that loss-relative influence with capacity-like binary cross-entropy loss and first-order updates on beneficial samples most consistently improves bit error rate toward genie-aided performance, outperforming random fine-tuning in single-target scenarios. Multi-target adaptation proved less effective, underscoring open challenges. Beyond experiments, we connect influence to self-influence corrections and propose a second-order, influence-aligned update strategy. Our results establish influence functions as both an interpretability tool and a basis for efficient receiver adaptation.</description>

      <title>PPGFlowECG: Latent Rectified Flow with Cross-Modal Encoding for PPG-Guided ECG Generation and Cardiovascular Disease Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19774v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electrocardiography (ECG) is the clinical gold standard for cardiovascular disease (CVD) assessment, yet continuous monitoring is constrained by the need for dedicated hardware and trained personnel. Photoplethysmography (PPG) is ubiquitous in wearable devices and readily scalable, but it lacks electrophysiological specificity, limiting diagnostic reliability. While generative methods aim to translate PPG into clinically useful ECG signals, existing approaches are limited by the misalignment of physiological semantics in generative models and the complexity of modeling in high-dimensional signals. To address these limitations, we propose PPGFlowECG, a two-stage framework that aligns PPG and ECG in a shared latent space using the CardioAlign Encoder and then synthesizes ECGs with latent rectified flow. We further provide a formal analysis of this coupling, showing that the CardioAlign Encoder is necessary to guarantee stable and semantically consistent ECG synthesis under our formulation. Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate improved synthesis fidelity and downstream diagnostic utility. These results indicate that PPGFlowECG supports scalable, wearable-first CVD screening when standard ECG acquisition is unavailable.</description>
