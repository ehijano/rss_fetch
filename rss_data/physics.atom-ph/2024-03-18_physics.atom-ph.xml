      <title>A clock with $8\times10^{-19}$ systematic uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report an optical lattice clock with a total systematic uncertainty of $8.1 \times 10^{-19}$ in fractional frequency units, representing the lowest uncertainty of any clock to date. The clock relies on interrogating the ultra-narrow ${}^1S_0 \rightarrow {}^3P_0$ transition in a dilute ensemble of fermionic strontium atoms trapped in a vertically-oriented, shallow, one-dimensional optical lattice. With $10^5$ atoms in Wannier-Stark eigenstates of this lattice, we measure record atomic coherence time and measurement precision reaching below $1 \times 10^{-19}$ [arXiv:2109.12238]. Such clock precision, together with imaging spectroscopy, enables precise control of collisional shifts as well as the lattice light shift [arXiv:2201.05909, arXiv:2210.16374]. To address two remaining large systematic effects, we measure the second order Zeeman coefficient on the least magnetically sensitive clock transition, and we precisely determine the $5s4d$ $^3D_1$ lifetime to reduce the dynamic black body radiation shift uncertainty. All other systematic effects have uncertainties below $1 \times 10^{-19}$.</description>

      <title>Atomic polarization and Stark-shift in relativistic strong field ionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A relativistic analytical theory of strong field ionization applicable across the regimes of the deep-tunneling up to the over-barrier ionization (OTBI) is developed, incorporating the effects of the polarization of the atomic bound state and the Stark-shift in an ultrastrong laser field. The theory, in particular, addresses the order of magnitude discrepancy of the ionization yield in the relativistic regime calculated via the numerical solution of the Klein-Gordon equation [B. Hafizi \textit{et al}., Phys. Rev. Lett. 118, 133201 (2017)] with respect to the state-of-the-art quasiclassical theory of Perelomov-Popov-Terent'ev (PPT) for strong field ionization. The developed theory employs a Keldysh-like approach describing the ionization as an adiabatic quantum jump from the bound state to the continuum at a specific transition time, where the improved performance is achieved by accounting for the bound state distortion in the laser field. In the nonrelativistic limit, our theory reproduces the well-known fit to the numerical calculations for the OTBI rate via the Tong-Lin factor. Realistic conditions for an experimental confirmation of the prediction of the present relativistic model versus PPT-theory are also presented.</description>

      <title>Pulsed loading of a magneto-optical trap on atom chip for fast pressure recovery in ultrahigh vacuum environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents investigations on pulsed loading of a magneto-optical trap (MOT) on an atom chip in an UHV environment. Using three parallel resistively heated Rb-metal dispensers activated by pulsed current supply, approximately 3.0 $\times$ $10^{7}$ cold $^{87}Rb$ atoms were loaded into the MOT. A current pulse of $\sim$ 24 A with duration of $\sim$ 10 s raised the pressure in the chamber from 2.0 $\times$ $10^{-10}$ Torr to 3.3 $\times$ $10^{-10}$ Torr. Remarkably, the pressure recovery time after switching off the dispensers current was found to be $\sim$ 600 ms, making a significant advancement in achieving fast recovery of UHV environment surrounding the MOT region. This study is very useful for laser cooling and magnetic trapping / evaporative cooling of atoms on atom chip in the same UHV chamber.</description>

      <title>mqdtfit: A collection of Python functions for empirical multichannel quantum defect calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Python functions distributed with this article can be used for calculating the parameters of multichannel quantum defect theory models describing excited bound states of complex atoms. These parameters are obtained by fitting a model to experimental data provided by the user. The two main formulations of the theory are supported, namely the one in which the parameters of the model are a set of eigen channel quantum defects and a transformation matrix, and the one where these parameters are the elements of a reactance matrix. The distribution includes programs for calculating theoretical energy levels, calculating mixing coefficients and channel fractions and producing Lu-Fano plots.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopy of laser cooling transitions in MgF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We measure the complete set of transition frequencies necessary to laser cool and trap MgF molecules. Specifically, we report the frequency of multiple low $J$ transitions of the $X^2\Sigma^+(v^{\prime\prime}=0,1) \rightarrow A^2\Pi_{1/2}(v^\prime=0)$, $X^2\Sigma^+(v^{\prime\prime}=1,2) \rightarrow A^2\Pi_{1/2}(v^\prime=1)$, and $X^2\Sigma^+(v^{\prime\prime}=1) \rightarrow B^2\Sigma^+(v^{\prime}=0)$ bands of MgF. The measured $X^2\Sigma^+(v^{\prime\prime}=1)\rightarrow B^2\Sigma^+(v^\prime=0)$ spectrum allowed the spin-rotation and hyperfine parameters of the $B^2\Sigma^+(v=0)$ state of MgF to be determined. Furthermore, we demonstrate optical cycling in MgF by pumping molecules into the $X^2\Sigma^+(v=1,2)$ states. Optical pumping enhances the spectroscopic signals of transitions originating in the $N^{\prime\prime}=1$ level of the $X^2\Sigma^+(v^{\prime\prime}=1,2)$ states.</description>

      <title>Ion solvation in atomic baths: from snowballs to polarons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solvation, the result of the complicated interplay between solvent-solute and solvent-internal interactions, is one of the most important chemical processes. Consequently, a complete theoretical understanding of solvation seems a heroic task. However, it is possible to elucidate fundamental solvation mechanisms by looking into simpler systems, such as ion solvation in atomic baths. In this work, we study ion solvation by calculating the ground state properties of a single ion in a neutral bath from the high-density regime to the low-density regime, finding common ground for these two, in principle, disparate regimes. Our results indicate that a single $^{174}$Yb$^+$ ion in a bath of $^{7}$Li atoms forms a coordination complex at high densities with a coordination number of 8, with strong electrostriction, characteristic of the snowball effect. On the contrary, treating the atomic bath as a dilute quantum gas at low densities, we find that the ion-atom interaction's short-range plays a significant role in the physics of many-body bound states and polarons. Furthermore, in this regime, we explore the role of a putative ion trap, which drastically affects the binding mechanism of the ion and atoms from a quantum gas. Therefore, our results give a novel insight into the universality of ion-neutral systems in the ultracold regime and the possibilities of observing exotic many-body effects.</description>

      <title>Below the Surface: Unraveling the Intricacies of the Nonlinear Optical Properties of Aluminum through Bound Electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By uncovering novel aspects of second harmonic generation in aluminum we show that there are unusual and remarkable consequences of resonant absorption, namely an unexpectedly critical role that bound electrons play for light-matter interactions across the optical spectrum, suggesting that a different basic approach is required to fully explain the physics of surfaces. We tackle an issue that is never under consideration given the generic hostile conditions to the propagation of light under resonant absorption. Unlike most noble metals, aluminum displays Lorentz-like behavior and interband transitions centered near 810 nm, thus splitting the plasmonic range in an atypical manner and setting its linear and nonlinear optical properties apart. Studies of aluminum nanostructures having complex topologies abound, as do reported inconsistencies in the linear spectral response of surface plasmons and harmonic generation. Our experimental observations of second harmonic generation from aluminum nanolayers show that bound electrons are responsible for a unique signature neither predicted nor observed previously: a hole in the second harmonic spectrum. A hydrodynamic-Maxwell theory explains these findings exceptionally well and becomes the basis for renewed studies of surface physics.</description>

      <title>Universal fluctuations and noise learning from Hilbert-space ergodicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Systems reaching thermal equilibrium are ubiquitous. For classical systems, this phenomenon is typically understood statistically through ergodicity in phase space, but translating this to quantum systems is a long-standing problem of interest. Recently a quantum notion of ergodicity has been proposed, namely that isolated, global quantum states uniformly explore their available state space, dubbed Hilbert-space ergodicity. Here we observe signatures of this process with an experimental Rydberg quantum simulator and various numerical models, before generalizing to the case of a local quantum system interacting with its environment. For a closed system, where the environment is a complementary subsystem, we predict and observe a smooth quantum-to-classical transition in that observables progress from large, quantum fluctuations to small, Gaussian fluctuations as the bath size grows. This transition is universal on a quantitative level amongst a wide range of systems, including those at finite temperature, those with itinerant particles, and random circuits. Then, we consider the case of an open system interacting noisily with an external environment. We predict the statistics of observables under largely arbitrary noise channels including those with correlated errors, allowing us to discriminate candidate error models both for continuous Hamiltonian time evolution and for digital random circuits. Ultimately our results clarify the role of ergodicity in quantum dynamics, with fundamental and practical consequences.</description>

      <title>A tweezer array with 6100 highly coherent atomic qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical tweezer arrays have had a transformative impact on atomic and molecular physics over the past years, and they now form the backbone for a wide range of leading experiments in quantum computing, simulation, and metrology. Underlying this development is the simplicity of single particle control and detection inherent to the technique. Typical experiments trap tens to hundreds of atomic qubits, and very recently systems with around one thousand atoms were realized without defining qubits or demonstrating coherent control. However, scaling to thousands of atomic qubits with long coherence times and low-loss, high-fidelity imaging is an outstanding challenge and critical for progress in quantum computing, simulation, and metrology, in particular, towards applications with quantum error correction. Here we experimentally realize an array of optical tweezers trapping over 6,100 neutral atoms in around 12,000 sites while simultaneously surpassing state-of-the-art performance for several key metrics associated with fundamental limitations of the platform. Specifically, while scaling to such a large number of atoms, we also demonstrate a coherence time of 12.6(1) seconds, a record for hyperfine qubits in an optical tweezer array. Further, we show trapping lifetimes close to 23 minutes in a room-temperature apparatus, enabling record-high imaging survival of 99.98952(1)% in combination with an imaging fidelity of over 99.99%. Our results, together with other recent developments, indicate that universal quantum computing with ten thousand atomic qubits could be a near-term prospect. Furthermore, our work could pave the way for quantum simulation and metrology experiments with inherent single particle readout and positioning capabilities at a similar scale.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast artificial intelligence: Machine learning with atomic-scale quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.12231v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We train a model atom to recognize hand-written digits between 0 and 9, employing intense light--matter interaction as a computational resource. For training, individual images of hand-written digits in the range 0-9 are converted into shaped laser pulses (data input pulses). Simultaneously with an input pulse, another shaped pulse (program pulse), polarized in the orthogonal direction, is applied to the atom and the system evolves quantum mechanically according to the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation. The purpose of the optimal program pulse is to direct the system into specific atomic final states that correspond to the input digits. A success rate of about 40\% is demonstrated here for a basic optimization scheme, so far limited by the computational power to find the optimal program pulse in a high-dimensional search space. This atomic-intelligence image-recognition scheme is scalable towards larger (e.g. molecular) systems, is readily reprogrammable towards other learning/classification tasks and operates on time scales down to tens of femtoseconds. It has the potential to outpace other currently implemented machine-learning approaches, including the fastest optical on-chip neuromorphic systems and optical accelerators, by orders of magnitude.</description>

Abstract: We present a novel cold strontium atom source designed for quantum sensors. We optimized the deceleration process to capture a large velocity class of atoms emitted from an oven and achieved a compact and low-power setup capable of generating a high atomic flux. Our approach involves velocity-dependent transverse capture of atoms using a two-dimensional magneto-optical trap. To enhance the atomic flux, we employ tailored magnetic fields that minimize radial beam expansion and incorporate a cascaded Zeeman-slowing configuration utilizing two optical frequencies. The performance is comparable to that of conventional Zeeman slower sources, and the scheme is applicable to other atomic species. Our results represent a significant advancement towards the deployment of portable and, possibly, space-based cold atom sensors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05958v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The long-range electrostatic interactions between molecules depend strongly on their relative orientation, which manifests as a rotational state dependence. Interactions between molecules in the same rotational quantum state are well-known attractive rotational van der Waals interactions. Interactions in rotational states that differ by one quantum show resonant dipole-dipole interactions. We show that where molecules are in rotational states that differ by more than one quantum, they exhibit repulsive van der Waals interactions. At temperatures below a millikelvin, this effect can reduce collisional loss by multiple orders of magnitude. These repulsive interactions lead to applications in quantum simulation and impurity physics with ultracold polar molecules.</description>

      <title>A scheme for deterministic loading of laser-cooled molecules into optical tweezers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06028v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose to repeatedly load laser-cooled molecules into optical tweezers, and transfer them to storage states that are rotationally excited by two additional quanta. Collisional loss of molecules in these storage states is suppressed, and a dipolar blockade prevents the accumulation of more than one molecule. Applying three cycles loads tweezers with single molecules at an 80~\% success rate, limited by residual collisional loss. This improved loading efficiency reduces the time needed for rearrangement of tweezer arrays, which would otherwise limit the scalability of neutral molecule quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Cooling trapped ions with phonon rapid adiabatic passage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02315v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent demonstrations of the quantum charge-coupled device (QCCD) computer architecture, circuit times are dominated by cooling. Some motional modes of multi-ion crystals take orders-of-magnitude longer to cool than others because of low coolant ion participation. Here we demonstrate a new technique, which we call phonon rapid adiabatic passage (phrap), that avoids this issue by coherently exchanging the thermal populations of selected modes on timescales short compared to direct cooling. Analogous to adiabatic rapid passage, we quasi-statically couple these slow-cooling modes with fast-cooling ones using DC electric fields. When the crystal is then adiabatically ramped through the resultant avoided crossing, nearly-complete phonon population exchange results. We demonstrate this on two-ion crystals, and show the indirect ground-state cooling of all radial modes--achieving an order of magnitude speedup compared to direct cooling. We also show the technique's insensitivity to trap potential and control field fluctuations, and find that it still achieves sub-quanta temperatures starting as high as n~200.</description>
