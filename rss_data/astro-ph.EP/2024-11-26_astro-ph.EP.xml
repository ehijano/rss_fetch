      <title>Impacts of UV Radiation from an AGN on Planetary Atmospheres and Consequences for Galactic Habitability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a study of the effects of ultraviolet (UV) emission from active galactic nuclei (AGN) on the atmospheric composition of planets and potential impact on life. It is expected that all supermassive black holes, which reside at galactic centers, have gone through periods of high AGN activity in order to reach their current masses. We examine potential damaging effects on lifeforms on planets with different atmosphere types and receiving different levels of AGN flux, using data on the sensitivity of various species' cells to UV radiation to determine when radiation becomes ``dangerous''. We also consider potential chemical changes to planetary atmospheres as a result of UV radiation from AGN, using the PALEO photochemical model. We find the presence of sufficient initial oxygen (surface mixing ratio $\geq 10^{-3} \rm\, mol/mol$) in the planet's atmosphere allows a thicker ozone layer to form in response to AGN radiation, which reduces the level of dangerous UV radiation incident on the planetary surface from what it was in absence of an AGN. We estimate the fraction of solar systems in galaxies that would be affected by AGN UV radiation, and find that the impact is most pronounced in compact galaxies such as ``red nugget relics'', as compared to typical present-day ellipticals and spirals (using M87 and the Milky Way as examples). Our work generally supports the Gaia hypothesis, where the development of life on a planet (and resulting oxygenation of the atmosphere) causes the environment to become more stable against potential extinction events in the future.</description>

      <title>Improved Initial Guesses for Numerical Solutions of Kepler's Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical solutions of Kepler's Equation are critical components of celestial mechanics software, and are often computation hot spots. This work uses symbolic regression and a genetic learning algorithm to find new initial guesses for iterative Kepler solvers for both elliptical and hyperbolic orbits. The new initial guesses are simple to implement, and result in modest speed improvements for elliptical orbits, and major speed improvements for hyperbolic orbits.</description>

      <title>Suppression of hydrodynamic escape of an H2-rich early Earth atmosphere by radiative cooling of carbon oxides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radiative cooling by molecules is a crucial process for hydrodynamic escape, as it can efficiently remove the thermal energy driving the outflow, acquired through X-ray and extreme UV absorption. Carbon oxides, such as CO and CO2, and their photochemical products are anticipated to serve as vital radiative cooling sources not only in atmospheres dominated by carbon oxides but also in H2-rich atmospheres. However, their specific effects on the hydrodynamic escape, especially in H2-rich atmospheres, have been inadequately investigated. In this study, we conduct 1-D hydrodynamic escape simulations for H2-rich atmospheres incorporating CO, CO2, and their chemical products on an Earth-mass planet. We consider detailed radiative cooling processes and chemical networks related to carbon oxides to elucidate their impacts on the hydrodynamic escape. In the escape outflow, CO2 undergoes rapid photolysis, producing CO and atomic oxygen, while CO exhibits photochemical stability compared to CO2. The H2 oxidation by atomic oxygen results in the production of OH and H2O. Consequently, the hydrodynamic escape is significantly suppressed by the radiative cooling effects of CO, H2O, OH, and H3+ even when the basal mixing fraction of CO and CO2 is lower than ~0.01. These mechanisms extend the lifetime of H2-rich atmospheres by about one order of magnitude compared to the case of pure hydrogen atmospheres on early Earth, which also results in negligible escape of heavier carbon- and nitrogen-bearing molecules and noble gases.</description>

      <title>SURF Report: High Accuracy Methods for Computing Gravitational Potential and Gravitational Force Fields Near the Surface of Irregularly Shaped 3-Dimensional Bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate gravity field calculations are necessary for landing on planets, moons, asteroids, minimoons, or other irregularly shaped bodies, but current methods become increasingly inaccurate and slow near the surface. We present high accuracy, fast methods for computing gravitational potential and gravitational force fields, which are needed for future space missions. Notably, gravitational force and potential computations are simplified, with high accuracy enhanced by bringing the derivative inside the gravitational potential integral. In addition, we present a new gravitational field calculus, which lets us combine simpler potentials and force fields to create more complex ones without accuracy loss. Several examples are provided, for instance, where we subtract different shapes from a spherical body making a variety of craters. The calculus will also work well with volumetric octree methods. Additionally, we use new bounds in the gravitational potential integral, to avoid trying to fit smooth basis functions to non-smooth curves, and harness new computational tools where tasks can be migrated to GPUs. We also have found that cylindrical coordinates can have special advantages in tailoring shape models. We have created a series of algorithms and preliminary MATLAB and Mathematica toolboxes utilizing these methods and the gravitational calculus. These methods are newly customizable for necessary high-accuracy gravity computations in future missions planned by JPL and other space agencies to navigate near irregularly shaped bodies in the solar system.</description>

      <title>The Spatiotemporal Structure of Induced Magnetic Fields in Callisto's Plasma Environment due to their Propagation with MHD Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how the spatiotemporal structure of induced magnetic fields outside of Callisto is affected by their propagation with the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) modes. At moons that are surrounded by dense magnetized plasmas like the Galilean moons, low-frequency induced magnetic fields cannot propagate with the ordinary electromagnetic mode as is implicitly used by standard analytical expressions. Instead, the induced magnetic fields propagate with the MHD modes, which exhibit anisotropic propagation properties and have finite velocities. Using an MHD framework, we model the spatiotemporal effects of the transport on the induced signals and analyze their contribution to Galileo's C03 and C09 flyby observations. We find that the induced magnetic field in Callisto's plasma environment is asymmetric with a pronounced upstream/downstream asymmetry. By neglecting the transport effects, the amplitude of the induced magnetic field is under- or overestimated by up to tens of percent, respectively. Additionally, we find that MHD wave and convection velocities are strongly reduced in Callisto's local plasma environment, resulting in an additional temporal delay between the emergence of the induced field at the surface of Callisto or the top of its ionosphere and the measurements at spacecraft location. The associated phase shift depends on the location of the observer and can reach values of several to tens of degrees of the phase of the primary inducing frequency. Transport effects impact the observed induction signals and are consistent with the C03 and C09 magnetic field measurements.</description>

      <title>The bulk metallicity of giant planets around M stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The bulk-metallicity determination of giant exoplanets is essential to constrain their formation and evolution pathways and to compare them to the solar system. Previous studies inferred an inverse relation between the mass and bulk metallicity. However, the data almost exclusively contained planets that orbit FGK stars. The recent discoveries of giant exoplanets around M-dwarf stars present an opportunity to probe whether they follow a mass-metallicity trend different from that of their FGK counterparts. Using evolution models we characterised the interiors of giant exoplanets with reliable mass-radius measurements that orbit FGK and M-dwarf stars. We then inferred the mass-metallicity trends for both populations. We found that the bulk metallicity of giant planets around M stars is overall lower compared to those around FGK stars. This yielded mass-metallicity relations for the two populations with similar slopes but significantly different offsets. The lack of metal-rich giant planets around M dwarfs could explain the difference in the inferred offset and be a result of different formation conditions. However, there were only 20 successful bulk-metallicity retrievals for the giant planets around M dwarfs, which resulted in rather large uncertainties. Therefore, it is of great importance to continue detecting these planets with both transit and radial velocities. Additionally, the characterisation of the atmospheres of giant planets around M-stars can further help to constrain their interiors and to investigate the atmosp</description>

      <title>Centaur 29P/Schwassmann-Wachmann 1 and its near-nucleus environment from a stellar occultation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Comets offer valuable insights into the early Solar System's conditions and processes. Stellar occultations enables detailed study of cometary nuclei typically hidden by their coma. Observing the star's light passing through the coma helps infer dust's optical depth near the nucleus and determine dust opacity detection limits. 29P/Schwassmann-Wachmann 1, a Centaur with a diameter of approximately 60 km, lies in a region transitioning from Centaurs to Jupiter-Family comets. Our study presents the first-ever observed occultation by 29P, allowing in the future a more refined orbit and thus better predictions for other occultations. The light curve reveals a solid-body detection lasting $3.65\pm0.05$ seconds, corresponding to a chord length of approximately 54 km. This provides a lower limit for the object's radius, measured at $27.0\pm0.7$ km. We identified features on both sides of the main-body occultation around 1,700 km from the nucleus in the sky plane for which upper limits on apparent opacity and equivalent width were determined. Gradual dimming within 23 km of the nucleus during ingress only is interpreted as a localised dust cloud/jet above the surface, with an optical depth of approximately $\tau \sim 0.18$.</description>

      <title>The JWST Weather Report from the Isolated Exoplanet Analog SIMP 0136+0933: Pressure-Dependent Variability Driven by Multiple Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Isolated planetary-mass objects share their mass range with planets but do not orbit a star. They lack the necessary mass to support fusion in their cores and thermally radiate their heat from formation as they cool, primarily at infrared wavelengths. Many isolated planetary-mass objects show variations in their infrared brightness consistent with non-uniform atmospheric features modulated by their rotation. SIMP J013656.5+093347.3 is a rapidly rotating isolated planetary-mass object, and previous infrared monitoring suggests complex atmospheric features rotating in and out of view. The physical nature of these features is not well understood, with clouds, temperature variations, thermochemical instabilities, and infrared-emitting aurora all proposed as contributing mechanisms. Here we report JWST time-resolved low-resolution spectroscopy from 0.8 - 11 micron of SIMP J013656.5+093347.3 which supports the presence of three specific features in the atmosphere: clouds, hot spots, and changing carbon chemistry. We show that no single mechanism can explain the variations in the time-resolved spectra. When combined with previous studies of this object indicating patchy clouds and aurorae, these measurements reveal the rich complexity of the atmosphere of SIMP J013656.5+093347.3. Gas giant planets in the solar system, specifically Jupiter and Saturn, also have multiple cloud layers and high-altitude hot spots, suggesting these phenomena are also present in worlds both within and beyond our solar-system.</description>

      <title>Interactions between tidal flows and magnetic fields in stellar/planetary convective envelopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stars and gaseous planets are magnetised objects but the influence of magnetic fields on their tidal responses and dissipation rates has not been well explored. We present the first exploratory nonlinear magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of tidally-excited waves in incompressible convective envelopes harbouring an initial dipolar magnetic field. Simulations with weak magnetic fields exhibit tidally-generated differential rotation in the form of zonal flows (like in the purely hydrodynamic case) that can modify tidal dissipation rates from prior linear predictions. Moreover, tidal waves and zonal flows affect the amplitude and structure of the magnetic field, notably through creation of toroidal fields via the $\Omega$-effect. In contrast, simulations with strong magnetic fields feature severely inhibited zonal flows, due to large-scale magnetic stresses, excitation of torsional waves, or magnetic instabilities. We predict that the different regimes observed for weak and strong magnetic fields may be both relevant for low-mass stars when using turbulent values of the magnetic Prandtl number.</description>

Abstract: Impacts by rocky and icy bodies are thought to have played a key role in shaping the composition of solar system objects, including the Earth's habitability. Hence, it is likely that they play a similar role in exoplanetary systems. We investigate how an icy cometary impact affects the atmospheric chemistry, climate, and composition of an Earth-like, tidally-locked, terrestrial exoplanet, a prime target in the search for a habitable exoplanet beyond our solar system. We couple a cometary impact model which includes thermal ablation and pressure driven breakup with the 3D Earth System Model WACCM6/CESM2, and use this model to investigate the effects of the water and thermal energy delivery associated with an $R=2.5$ km pure water ice cometary impact on an Earth-like atmosphere. We find that water is the primary driver of longer timescale changes to the atmospheric chemistry and composition by acting as a source of opacity, cloud ice, and atmospheric hydrogen/oxygen. The water opacity drives heating at $\sim5\times10^{-4}$ bar, and cooling below, due to a decreased flux reaching the surface. The increase in atmospheric hydrogen and oxygen also drives an increase in the abundance of hydrogen/oxygen rich molecules, with the exception of ozone, whose column density decreases by $\sim10\%$. These atmospheric changes are potentially observable for $\sim$ 1-2 years post-impact, particularly those associated with cloud ice scattering. They also persist, albeit at a much reduced level, to our quasi-steady-state, suggesting that sustained bombardment or multiple large impacts have the potential to shape the composition and habitability of terrestrial exoplanets.</description>

      <title>Irradiated Atmospheres I: Heating by Vertical-Mixing Induced Energy Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12605v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Observations have revealed unique temperature profiles in hot Jupiter atmospheres. We propose that the energy transport by vertical mixing could lead to such thermal features. In our new scenario, strong absorbers, TiO and VO are not necessary. Vertical mixing could be naturally excited by atmospheric circulation or internal gravity wave breaking. We perform radiative transfer calculations by taking into account the vertical mixing driven energy transport. The radiative equilibrium (RE) is replaced by radiative-mixing equilibrium (RME). We investigate how the mixing strength, $K_{\rm zz}$, affects the atmospheric temperature-pressure profile. Strong mixing can heat the lower atmosphere and cool the upper atmosphere. This effect has important effects on the atmosphere thermal features that would form without mixing. In certain circumstances, it can induce temperature inversions in scenarios where the temperature monotonically increases with increasing pressure under conditions of lower thermal band opacity. Temperature inversions show up as $K_{\rm zz}$ increases with altitude due to shear interaction with the convection layer. The atmospheric thermal structure of HD~209458b can be well fitted with $K_{\rm zz} \propto (P/1\ {\rm bar})^{-1/2}\ {\rm cm}^{2} \ {\rm s}^{-1}$. Our findings suggest vertical mixing promotes temperature inversions and lowers $K_{\rm zz}$ estimates compared to prior studies. Incorporating chemical species into vertical mixing will significantly affect the thermal profile due to their temperature sensitivity.</description>

      <title>The radiative torque spin-up efficiency of ballistic dust grain aggregates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09968v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Aims. Understanding the rotational dynamics of interstellar dust grains is quintessential for the analysis of the observed dust polarization signal. We aim to constrain the set of parameters for an accurate description of the rotational spin-up process of ballistic dust grain aggregates driven by radiative torques (RATs).
  Methods. We model the dust grains as complex fractal aggregates grown by the ballistic aggregation of uniform spherical particles (monomers) of different sizes. A broad variation of dust materials, shapes, and sizes are studied in the presence of different radiation sources.
  Results. We find that the canonical parametrization for the torque efficiency overestimates the maximal angular velocity $\omega_{\mathrm{RAT}}$ caused by RATs of grain aggregates, and to resolve this problem we propose a new parametrization which predicts $\omega_{\mathrm{RAT}}$ more accurately. We find that RATs are strongest for larger grains with smaller monomer-density, this manifests as size and monomer-density dependence in the constant part of the parametrization. Following the constant part, the parametrization has two power-laws with different slopes, which retain the universality for all grain sizes. The maximum grain rotation does not scale linearly with radiation strength, due to different drag mechanisms dominating depending on grain material and environment. The angular velocity $\omega_{\mathrm{RAT}}$ of individual single dust grains has a wide distribution and may even differ from the mean by up to two orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Deconstructing the Properties of Solar Super Active Region 13664 in the Context of the Historic Geomagnetic Storm of 2024 May 10-11</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14752</link>

Abstract: The impact of solar-stellar activity on planetary environments is a topic of great interest within the Sun-Earth system as well as exoplanetary systems. In particular, extreme events such as flares and coronal mass ejections have a profound effect on planetary atmospheres. In May this year, a magnetic active region on the Sun (AR 13664) -- with a size exceeding hundred times that of Earth -- unleashed a large number of high energy X-class flares and associated mass ejections. The resulting Earth impact (geomagnetic storm) on May 10-11 was the strongest in the last two decades. We perform the first comprehensive analysis of the magnetic properties of the active region that spawned these flares and identify this to be a super active region with very rare physical characteristics. We also demonstrate how the rate of energization of the system is related to the flaring process. Our work illuminates how flare productive super active regions on the Sun and stars can be identified and what are their salient physical properties. Specifically, we put AR 13664 in historical context over the cumulative period of 1874 May-2024 June. We find that AR 13664 stands at 99.95 percentile in the distribution of area over 1874 May-2024 June, and at 99.10 percentile in terms of flux content among all ARs over the period 1996 April-2024 June. Our analysis indicates that five of its magnetic properties rank highest among all ARs recorded in SHARP data series during 2010 May-2024 June by the Solar Dynamic Observatory. Furthermore, we demonstrate that AR 13664 reached its most dynamic flare productive state following a rapid rate of rise of its flare-relevant parameters and that the X-class flares it spawned were more frequent near their peak values. Our analyses establish AR 13644 to be solar super active region and provide a paradigm for investigating their flare-relevant physical characteristics.</description>

Abstract: The coldest Y spectral type brown dwarfs are similar in mass and temperature to cool and warm ($\sim$200 -- 400 K) giant exoplanets. We can therefore use their atmospheres as proxies for planetary atmospheres, testing our understanding of physics and chemistry for these complex, cool worlds. At these cold temperatures, their atmospheres are cold enough for water clouds to form, and chemical timescales increase, increasing the likelihood of disequilibrium chemistry compared to warmer classes of planets. JWST observations are revolutionizing the characterization of these worlds with high signal-to-noise, moderate resolution near- and mid-infrared spectra. The spectra have been used to measure the abundances of prominent species like water, methane, and ammonia; species that trace chemical reactions like carbon monoxide; and even isotopologues of carbon monoxide and ammonia. Here, we present atmospheric retrieval results using both published fixed-slit (GTO program 1230) and new averaged time series observations (GO program 2327) of the coldest known Y dwarf, WISE 0855-0714 (using NIRSpec G395M spectra), which has an effective temperature of $\sim$ 264 K. We present a detection of deuterium in an atmosphere outside of the solar system via a relative measurement of deuterated methane (CH$_{3}$D) and standard methane. From this, we infer the D/H ratio of a substellar object outside the solar system for the first time. We also present a well-constrained part-per-billion abundance of phosphine (PH$_{3}$). We discuss our interpretation of these results and the implications for brown dwarf and giant exoplanet formation and evolution.</description>
