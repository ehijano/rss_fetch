      <title>Generalizable neural-network parameterization of mesoscale eddies in idealized and global ocean models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data-driven methods have become popular to parameterize the effects of mesoscale eddies in ocean models. However, they perform poorly in generalization tasks and may require retuning if the grid resolution or ocean configuration changes. We address the generalization problem by enforcing physical constraints on a neural network parameterization of mesoscale eddy fluxes. We found that the local scaling of input and output features helps to generalize to unseen grid resolutions and depths offline in the global ocean. The scaling is based on dimensional analysis and incorporates grid spacing as a length scale. We formulate our findings as a general algorithm that can be used to enforce data-driven parameterizations with dimensional scaling. The new parameterization improves the representation of kinetic and potential energy in online simulations with idealized and global ocean models. Comparison to baseline parameterizations and impact on global ocean biases are discussed.</description>

      <title>The VIIRS-DNB radiance product is insufficient to assess the effect of "cool pavement" materials on nighttime radiances of treated areas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In warmer climates, cities face the prospect of higher air temperatures in summer compared to historical averages due to the urban heat island effect. An approach intended to address this problem is the application of "cool pavement" treatments (CPT) to city streets to make them more reflective to sunlight. Raising the albedo of roadways for this purpose may also have the effect of increasing the amount of street light that is reflected into the night sky. The simplest hypothesis explaining the relationship between CPT application and upward radiance is that CPT applied to road surfaces in areas where street lighting is dominant should increase the upward radiance of neighborhoods where the treatments are applied. A simple model predicted radiance increases of 2-6% immediately after CPT application. To test the hypothesis and model predictions, we looked for radiance changes coinciding with the application of CPT in residential neighborhoods of Phoenix, U.S., since 2020. We obtained time series radiance measurements from Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite Day-Night Band (VIIRS-DNB) data from Radiance Light Trends for Phoenix neighborhoods receiving CPT and nearby "control" neighborhoods not receiving CPT. At the 95% confidence level, we found that any increases in nighttime radiances from treated neighborhoods did not exceed about 14%. As a consequence, we cannot rule out either the expected radiance increases from our model or the possibility that CPT application yielded no change in radiance. We therefore cannot draw robust conclusions about the potential influence of CPT deployment on skyglow given the limitations of the DNB as a data source.</description>

      <title>Causal Feedback Discovery using Convergence Cross Mapping from Sea Ice Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Arctic region is experiencing accelerated warming, largely driven by complex and nonlinear interactions among time series atmospheric variables such as, sea ice extent, short-wave radiation, temperature, and humidity. These interactions significantly alter sea ice dynamics and atmospheric conditions, leading to increased sea ice loss. This loss further intensifies Arctic amplification and disrupts weather patterns through various feedback mechanisms. Although stochastic methods such as Granger causality, PCMCI, and VarLiNGAM estimate causal interactions among atmospheric variables, they are limited to unidirectional causal relationships and often miss weak causal interactions and feedback loops in nonlinear settings. In this study, we show that Convergent Cross Mapping (CCM) can effectively estimate nonlinear causal coupling, identify weak interactions and causal feedback loops among atmospheric variables. CCM employs state space reconstruction (SSR) which makes it suitable for complex nonlinear dynamic systems. While CCM has been successfully applied to a diverse range of systems, including fisheries and online social networks, its application in climate science is under-explored. Our results show that CCM effectively uncovers strong nonlinear causal feedback loops and weak causal interactions often overlooked by stochastic methods in complex nonlinear dynamic atmospheric systems.</description>

      <title>Modeling Indoor PM$_{2.5}$ Exposure During Retrofits: Plastic Film Barriers and a Quadratic Baseline Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Temporary plastic film barriers are widely used to separate occupied rooms from exterior renovation zones, yet their effect on indoor particulate exposure is poorly quantified. We monitored PM$_{2.5}$ in a Tampa, Florida, apartment for 48 days with a low-cost optical sensor (Temtop LKC-1000S+), spanning pre-barrier, barrier-on, and post-barrier periods. A quadratic baseline was fitted to "background" minutes devoid of identifiable indoor sources, allowing excess concentrations ($\Delta$PM) to be partitioned into facade work, cooking, and passive accumulation without outdoor co-monitoring. The barrier prevented large construction spikes indoors but curtailed natural ventilation, doubling the mean baseline from 1.9 to 3.9 $\mu$g m$^{-3}$. During this stage, passive build-up accounted for $45\,\%$ of the daily excess dose, with facade work and cooking contributing $31\,\%$ and $24\,\%$, respectively. Once the new window was installed and evening airing resumed, the baseline fell to 0.8 $\mu$g m$^{-3}$, the lowest of the campaign. Our findings highlight the trade-off between dust shielding and background elevation and demonstrate that simple polynomial fitting bolsters low-cost IAQ diagnostics in mechanically unventilated dwellings. The framework is readily transferable to other retrofits; future studies should pair indoor sensing with outdoor references and multi-room deployments to refine infiltration estimates.</description>

      <title>Data-driven multiscale modeling for correcting dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.17496v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a multiscale approach for predicting quantities in dynamical systems which is explicitly structured to extract information in both fine-to-coarse and coarse-to-fine directions. We envision this method being generally applicable to problems with significant self-similarity or in which the prediction task is challenging and where stability of a learned model's impact on the target dynamical system is important. We evaluate our approach on a climate subgrid parameterization task in which our multiscale networks correct chaotic underlying models to reflect the contributions of unresolved, fine-scale dynamics.</description>

      <title>The Changes of the Northern Hadley Cell Strength in Reanalyses and Radiosonde Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05331v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study examines mean meridional winds and their trends in the Northern Hadley Cell (NHC) from 1980 to 2022 using reanalysis datasets and radiosonde observations. Compared to radiosonde data, reanalyses underestimate the mean upper-tropospheric poleward flow of the NHC but accurately capture the mean equatorward flow in the lower troposphere. While climate models generally project a weakening of the NHC, our study finds no significant trend in radiosonde observations, adding to the uncertainty in future climate projections. In contrast, reanalyses indicate a strengthening, primarily due to an intensification of the upper-tropospheric poleward flow. Our examination of ERA5 analysis increments confirms that the NHC strengthening trend in ERA5 is not an artefact of data assimilation. Instead, the increments correct the first-guess, which underestimates the strength of the NHC, nudging it toward a stronger circulation.</description>
