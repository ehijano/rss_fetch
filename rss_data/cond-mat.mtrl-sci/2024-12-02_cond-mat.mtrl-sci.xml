      <title>Effects of isotherm patterns on cellular interface morphologies of melt pool origin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatiotemporal variation of the thermal gradient in the melt pool inherited from different heat input patterns or other non-equilibrium transient effects during additive manufacturing can significantly affect the resulting subgrain microstructure evolution. To examine the impact of this variation, we approximate the thermal gradient by various isotherm patterns that move with constant velocity following directional solidification. We report the first three-dimensional phase-field simulations to investigate the effects of isotherm patterns on the cellular structures typically observed in solidified melt pools. Results indicate that small variations in the isotherm can considerably impact the microstructural features. We use appropriate statistical characterizations of the solid fraction, solid percolation, and solute partitioning behavior to demonstrate the influence of isotherm patterns on the dendritic structures and semisolid mushy zones. Consistent with experimental observations, we find that non-planar isotherms produce finer cells and reduced microsegregation compared to planar isotherms. Also, we note that a tilt of the isotherm leads to a tilted state of the resulting cellular arrays. Our findings will help in understanding the qualitative aspects of the influence of temperature gradient patterns on the evolution of solidification morphologies, mushy zones, and secondary phases, which are crucial for the macroscopic description of the solidified material.</description>

      <title>Ductile fracture in functionally graded materials: Insight into crack behavior within the gradient interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite advances in manufacturing making metal functionally graded materials (FGMs) more common, numerical methods for predicting fracture in ductile functionally graded materials remain limited. In this work we study the crack propagation in ductile FGMs, specifically focusing on crack propagation within the gradient region of an FGM. We investigate the direct effects of plasticity, and the exact correlations between accumulated plastic strain and crack growth patterns in an FGM. Through this, we determine key differences in crack growth patterns between well-studied brittle FGMs, and more recently developed ductile FGMs. We provide substantial insight on the influence of both the angle of incidence and the width of the gradient, and expose potential pathways for engineering crack-arresting behavior in ductile FGMs</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy of organic semiconductor nanostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This chapter discusses recent experimental work exploring the optical properties and quantum dynamics of organic semiconductor nanostructures based on squaraine dyes. Squaraines are prototypical quadrupolar charge-transfer chromophores of interest for solu-tion-processed photovoltaics and as aggregates with large circular dichroism. Here, we demonstrate and exploit their unique properties as quantum emitters for implementing hy-brid nanostructures featuring strong exciton-plasmon couplings. We show that the unusual electronic properties of squaraines result in a substantial reduction of vibronic coupling to the ubiquitous high-frequency C-C-bond-stretching modes of organic materials and in the formation of spectrally narrow J-aggregated exciton resonances in squaraine thin films. This is exploited to create metallic nanostructures covered with squaraine thin films and to per-form the first time-domain study of coherent exciton-plasmon couplings using two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy with 10-fs time resolution. The experiments present unexpected evidence for long-range coherent exciton transport driven by plasmonic fields. This opens up new opportunities for manipulating the coherent transport of matter excita-tions by coupling to vacuum fields.</description>

      <title>Decoding Non-Linearity and Complexity: Deep Tabular Learning Approaches for Materials Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Materials data, especially those related to high-temperature properties, pose significant challenges for machine learning models due to extreme skewness, wide feature ranges, modality, and complex relationships. While traditional models like tree-based ensembles (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM) are commonly used for tabular data, they often struggle to fully capture the subtle interactions inherent in materials science data. In this study, we leverage deep learning techniques based on encoder-decoder architectures and attention-based models to handle these complexities. Our results demonstrate that XGBoost achieves the best loss value and the fastest trial duration, but deep encoder-decoder learning like Disjunctive Normal Form architecture (DNF-nets) offer competitive performance in capturing non-linear relationships, especially for highly skewed data distributions. However, convergence rates and trial durations for deep model such as CNN is slower, indicating areas for further optimization. The models introduced in this study offer robust and hybrid solutions for enhancing predictive accuracy in complex materials datasets.</description>

      <title>A Machine Learning Approach Capturing Hidden Parameters in Autonomous Thin-Film Deposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of machine learning and robotics into thin film deposition is transforming material discovery and optimization. However, challenges remain in achieving a fully autonomous cycle of deposition, characterization, and decision-making. Additionally, the inherent sensitivity of thin film growth to hidden parameters such as substrate conditions and chamber conditions can compromise the performance of machine learning models. In this work, we demonstrate a fully autonomous physical vapor deposition system that combines in-situ optical spectroscopy, a high-throughput robotic sample handling system, and Gaussian Process Regression models. By employing a calibration layer to account for hidden parameter variations and an active learning algorithm to optimize the exploration of the parameter space, the system fabricates silver thin films with optical reflected power ratios within 2.5% of the target in an average of 2.3 attempts. This approach significantly reduces the time and labor required for thin film deposition, showcasing the potential of machine learning-driven automation in accelerating material development.</description>

      <title>Diamine Surface Passivation and Post-Annealing Enhance Performance of Silicon-Perovskite Tandem Solar Cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the use of 1,3-diaminopropane (DAP) as a chemical modifier at the perovskite/electron-transport layer (ETL) interface enhances the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 1.7 eV bandgap FACs mixed-halide perovskite single-junction cells, primarily by boosting the open-circuit voltage (VOC) from 1.06 V to 1.15 V. Adding a post-processing annealing step after C60 evaporation, further improves the fill factor (FF) by 20% from the control to the DAP + post-annealing devices. Using hyperspectral photoluminescence microscopy, we demonstrate that annealing helps improve compositional homogeneity at the top and bottom interfaces of the solar cell, which prevents detrimental bandgap pinning in the devices and improves C60 adhesion. Using time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry, we show that DAP reacts with formamidinium present near the surface of the perovskite lattice to form a larger molecular cation, 1,4,5,6-tetrahydropyrimidinium (THP) that remains at the interface. Combining the use of DAP and the annealing of C60 interface, we fabricate Si-perovskite tandems with PCE of 25.29%, compared to 23.26% for control devices. Our study underscores the critical role of chemical reactivity and thermal post-processing of the C60/Lewis-base passivator interface in minimizing device losses and advancing solar-cell performance of wide-bandgap mixed-cation mixed-halide perovskite for tandem application.</description>

      <title>Non-relativistic spin splitting above and below the Fermi level in a $g$-wave altermagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnets are distinguished by their unique spin group symmetries, where spin and spatial symmetries are fully decoupled, resulting in nonrelativistic spin splitting (NRSS) of electronic bands. This phenomenon, unlike conventional spin splitting driven by relativistic spin-orbit coupling, has transformative potential in fields such as spintronics, superconductivity and energy-efficient electronics. However, direct observation of NRSS is challenging due to presence of competing phases, low N\'eel temperatures, and the limitations of existing experimental probes to unambiguously capture the associated properties. Here, we integrate theoretical and experimental approaches to uncover NRSS in the intercalated transition metal dichalcogenide CoNb$_4$Se$_8$. Symmetry analysis, density functional theory (DFT), a novel Symmetry-Constrained Adaptive Basis (SCAB), and tight-binding modeling predict the presence of symmetry-enforced spin splitting, which we directly confirm using spin-ARPES for the occupied band structure and a newly developed technique, spin- and angle-resolved electron reflection spectroscopy (spin-ARRES), for the unoccupied states. Together, these complementary tools reveal alternating spin textures consistent with our predicted g-wave altermagnetic order and demonstrate the persistence of NRSS across a broad energy range. Crucially, temperature-dependent measurements show the suppression of NRSS at the N\'eel temperature ($T_N$), providing the first direct evidence of an altermagnetic phase transition. Residual spin splitting above $T_N$ suggests the coexistence of altermagnetic fluctuations and spin-orbit coupling effects, underscoring a complex interplay of mechanisms. By establishing CoNb$_4$Se$_8$ as a prototypical g-wave altermagnet, this work offers a robust framework for understanding NRSS, and lays the foundation for designing energy-efficient spin-based technologies.</description>

      <title>Continuous Collapse of the Spin Cycloid in BiFeO3 Thin Films under and Applied Magnetic Field probed by Neutron Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bismuth ferrite (BiFeO3) is one of the rare materials that exhibits multiferroic properties already at room-temperature. Therefore, it offers tremendous potential for future technological applications, such as memory and logic. However, a weak magnetoelectric coupling together with the presence of a noncollinear cycloidal spin order restricts various practical applications of BiFeO3. Therefore, there is a large interest in the search for suitable methods for the modulation of the spin cycloid in BiFeO3. By performing neutron diffraction experiments using a triple-axis instrument we have determined that the spin cycloid can be systematically suppressed by applying a high magnetic field of 10 T in a BiFeO3 thin film of about 100 nm grown on a (110)-oriented SrTiO3 substrate. As predicted by previous theoretical calculations, we observed that the required critical magnetic field to suppress the spin cycloid in a BiFeO3 thin film was lower as compared to the previously reported critical magnetic field for bulk BiFeO3 single crystals. Our experiment reveals that the spin cycloid continuously expands with increasing magnetic field before the complete transformation into a G-type antiferromagnetic spin order. Such tuning of the length of the spin cycloid up to a complete suppression offers new functionalities for future technological applications as in spintronics or magnonics.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Dynamics of Coherent Phonon Modes in Excitonic Insulator Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spontaneous condensation of excitons in the excitonic insulating phase has been reported in Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$ below 325 K. In this context, we present the temperature-dependent optical pump optical probe spectroscopy of Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$, with a focus on coherent phonon dynamics. In addition to the fast relaxation process involving excitonic recombination, we observe a systematic behavior for the slow relaxation process associated with the relaxation of hot phonons. The asymmetry parameter and cubic anharmonicity of the 3 THz mode demonstrate the structural transition across T$_C$=325 K, whereas the order parameter nature and asymmetry of 2 THz modes reveal its coupling with the excitonic phase of Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$. Coherent phonon modes display less anharmonicity compared to the corresponding Raman modes. Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) reveals that the peak time t$_{peak}$ of phonons is similar for all modes except the 3 THz mode. The temperature dependence of t$_{peak}$ for the M3 mode exhibits a possible role of excitonic condensate below T$_c$ in the formation of quasiparticle (phonon). CWT analysis supports the time-dependent asymmetry of the M3 mode caused by photoexcited carriers. This study illustrates the role of photoexcited carriers in depicting a structural transition and dressing of coherent phonons and, hence, demonstrating many-body effects.</description>

      <title>Laser-Controlled Nonlinear Hall Effect in Tellurium Solids via Nonlinear Phononics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Terahertz (THz) laser with strong strength could excite more than one phonons and induce a transient lattice distortion termed as nonlinear phononics. This process allows dynamic control of various physical properties, including topological properties. Here, using first-principles calculations and dynamical simulations, we demonstrate that THz laser excitation can modulate the electronic structure and the signal of nonlinear Hall effect in elemental solid tellurium (Te). By strongly exciting the chiral phonon mode, we observe a non-equilibrium steady state characterized by lattice distortion along the breathing vibrational mode. This leads to a transition of Te from a direct to an indirect semiconductor. In addition, the energy dispersion around the Weyl point is deformed, leading to variations in the local Berry curvature dipole. As a result, the nonlinear Hall-like current in Te can be modulated with electron doping where the sign of current could be reversed under a strong THz laser field. Our results may stimulate further research on coupled quasiparticles in solids and the manipulation of their topological transport properties using THz lasers.</description>

      <title>Laser writing and spin control of near infrared emitters in silicon carbide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Near infrared emission in silicon carbide is relevant for quantum technology specifically single photon emission and spin qubits for integrated quantum photonics, quantum communication and quantum sensing. In this paper we study the fluorescence emission of direct femtosecond laser written array of color centres in silicon carbide followed by thermal annealing. We show that in high energy laser writing pulses regions a near telecom O-band ensemble fluorescence emission is observed after thermal annealing and it is tentatively attributed to the nitrogen vacancy centre in silicon carbide. Further in the low energy laser irradiation spots after annealing, we fabricated few divacancy, PL5 and PL6 types and demonstrate their optical spin read-out, and coherent spin manipulation (Rabi and Ramsey oscillations and spin echo). We show that direct laser writing and thermal annealing can yield bright near telecom emission and preserve the spin coherence time of divacancy at room temperature.</description>

      <title>Short-Range Order Based Ultra Fast Large-Scale Modeling of High-Entropy Alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-Entropy Alloys (HEAs) exhibit complex atomic interactions, with short-range order (SRO) playing a critical role in determining their properties. Traditional methods, such as Monte Carlo (MC) and hybrid MC-Molecular Dynamics (MC-MD), are often constrained by system size and computational inefficiency, limiting their applicability for large-scale modeling. We introduce PyHEA, a high-performance Python package with a C++ core, designed to efficiently model HEAs through a combination of global and local search algorithms, incremental SRO calculations, and GPU acceleration. PyHEA delivers an impressive speedup of more than 110,000x over state-of-the-art tools like SCRAPs and ATAT, ensuring accurate SRO calculations with unprecedented efficiency. In practical applications, PyHEA successfully modeled a 256,000-atom Fe-Mn-Cr-Co alloy, replicating literature results and reducing computational time by over tenfold compared to hybrid MC-MD approaches. By eliminating the need for MC-MD hybridization, PyHEA reduces SRO simulation times from hours to minutes, offering a scalable and efficient tool for HEA research. This advancement enables unprecedented scale and efficiency in modeling atomic structures and SRO, accelerating HEA research and development.</description>

      <title>Autonomous materials search using machine learning and ab initio calculations for L10-FePt-based quaternary alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The efficient exploration of expansive material spaces remains a significant challenge in materials science. To address this issue, autonomous material search methods that combine machine learning with ab initio calculations have emerged as a promising solution. These approaches offer a systematic and rapid means of discovering new materials, particularly when the material space is too large. This requirement is particularly important in the development of L10-structured alloys as magnetic recording media. These materials require a high magnetic moment (M) and magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy (EMCA) to satisfy the demands of next-generation data storage technologies. Although autonomous search methods have been successfully applied to various material systems, quaternary L10 alloys with optimized magnetic properties remain an open and underexplored frontier. In this study, we present a simulation-based autonomous search method aimed at identifying quaternary L10 alloys with enhanced M and EMCA values. Over a continuous 100-day search, our system suggested the FeMnPtEr alloy system as a promising candidate, exhibiting superior values for both M and EMCA. Although further experimental validation is required, this study underscores the potential of autonomous search methods to accelerate the discovery of advanced materials.

      <title>Magnetic field induced arrested state and observation of spontaneous anomalous Hall effect in TbMn$_6$Sn$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quasi two-dimensional kagome ferrimagnet TbMn$_6$Sn$_6$ is investigated for thermo-remanent magnetization and Hall effects. On cooling under a moderate magnetic field, the sample attains a magnetization value close to the saturation magnetization. Upon heating in a very small magnetic field, the sample continues to maintain the large value of magnetization, which eventually diminishes distinctly at around 200 K manifesting an ultrasharp jump. A similar feature is also observed in the Hall resistivity, which holds its saturation value when heated back in zero field after being field-cooled. The ultrasharp jump in magnetization is also get reflected in our Hall data. The observed data is exotic and can be rooted to the large anisotropy and the strong exchange interaction.</description>

      <title>Growth and inelastic light scattering studies on Sr2Nb2O7 single crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A crack free and high structural quality Sr2Nb2O7 single crystals were grown by the optical float zone method using optimized growth parameters. Laue pattern confirms single crystalline nature of the grown crystal. Temperature dependent Raman and Brillouin light scattering studies reveal a significant shift in phonon modes across normal to incommensurate phase transition (Tn-in) which occurs ~ 488 K. In the temperature range from 900 down to 500 K, two optical phonon modes about 63 (B1 mode) and 54 cm-1 (A1 mode) were observed. The frequency of A1 mode strongly decreases with an increase in temperature above the Tn-in while the frequency of this mode almost remains constant below the Tn-in. In contrast the frequency of B1 phonon mode is found to increase with temperature in the range of 500 - 900 K but it does not display a significant shift below the phase transition temperature. In addition in the incommensurate phase a new optical phonon mode at 35 cm-1 also begins to appear and exhibits strong stiffening behavior with increase in temperature in the range of 300 - 488 K. Moreover, the anomalous behavior of the acoustic phonon across Tn-in were further probed using Brilliouin scattering. Longitudinal acoustic phonon mode at 41 GHz exhibits strong change in slope near Tn-in. In addition, the transverse acoustic modes at 28.6 and 22.4 GHz also exhibit strong anomalies with minimum in frequency near Tn-in. The inelastic light scattering studies provide valuable information on the phase transition.</description>

      <title>Structural, optical and mechanical properties of Cr doped \b{eta}-Ga2O3 single crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Undoped and Cr doped \b{eta}-Ga2O3 (100) single crystals are grown by optical floating zone method. The full width at half maximum of rocking curve is found to be 106 arcsec for undoped Ga2O3 crystals whereas the 100 and 200 ppm of Cr doped Ga2O3 crystals display multiple rocking curves with large peak widths indicating the presence of structural defects. Raman measurements reveal broadening in the vibrational mode of ~ 350 cm-1 with a shoulder peak indicating the Cr3+ dopants preferentially substitute for Ga3+ at the octahedral sites. Further, the Cr doped Ga2O3 crystals display strong optical absorption bands about 420 and 597 nm in the UV-Vis spectroscopy. Moreover, the observation of sharp characteristic photoluminescence emission lines at 690 and 697 nm also confirms the Cr substitution in the doped crystals. The indentation hardness increases nearly linear from 13.0 to 17.9 GPa whilst the indentation modulus decreases from 224.9 to 202.4 GPa upon Cr doping of 200 ppm in \b{eta}-Ga2O3. The structural defects caused by the Cr doping interrupt the movement of indentation induced dislocations that results in the increase of hardness of the Cr doped \b{eta}-Ga2O3 (100) single crystals.</description>

      <title>Theory meets experiment: insights into structure and magnetic properties of Fe$_{1-x}$Ni$_{x}$B alloy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We studied the structural and magnetic properties of the solid solution Fe$_{1-x}$Ni$_{x}$B through theoretical and experimental approaches. Powder X-ray diffraction, X-ray Pair Distribution Function analysis, and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy reveal that the Fe$_{1-x}$Ni$_{x}$B solid solution crystallizes in the FeB structure type up to x = 0.6-0.7 and exhibits anisotropic unit cell volume contraction with increasing Ni concentration. Magnetic measurements showed a transition from ferromagnetism to paramagnetism around x = 0.7. For x = 0.5, the low (&lt; 0.3 $\mu_{B}$) magnetic moments suggest itinerant magnetism despite the relatively high Curie temperature (up to 225 K). Theoretical calculations indicated different types of magnetic orderings depending on the Fe/Ni atomic order, with the antiferromagnetic state being stable for ordered FeNiB$_{2}$, whereas the ground state is ferromagnetic for the disordered alloy. Calculations also predicted the coexistence of low- and high-spin states in Fe atoms around the composition with x=0.5, in line with the experimental evidence from $^{57}$Fe M\"ossbauer spectroscopy. The two magnetically distinct Fe sites for x = 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5 observed by $^{57}$Fe M\"ossbauer spectroscopy can also be interpreted as two magnetically different regions or clusters that could affect the critical behavior near a quantum magnetic transition based on a potential ferromagnetic quantum critical point identified computationally and experimentally near x=0.64. This work highlights the complex interplay between structure and magnetism in Fe$_{1-x}$Ni$_{x}$B alloys, suggesting areas for future research on quantum critical behavior.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the anisotropy of linear and nonlinear charge-spin conversion in Weyl semimetal TaIrTe4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Weyl semimetals, the nonlinear planar Hall effect (NPHE) and spin-orbit torque (SOT) are prominent manifestations of nonlinear and linear charge-spin conversion, respectively. However, simultaneous investigations of these phenomena within a single material system are scarce, limiting our understanding of their intrinsic connection and underlying mechanisms. Here, we report the first simultaneous observation of NPHE and SOT in a TaIrTe4/Py heterostructure. By employing harmonic Hall measurements and developing a magnetic field-dependent method, we successfully separated the contributions from NPHE, field-like SOT, and damping-like SOT, enabling accurate characterization of both linear and nonlinear charge-spin conversion properties. Our experiments revealed significant anisotropy along the [100] and [010] crystallographic directions of TaIrTe4, with stronger nonlinear responses and field-like SOT along the [100] direction, and larger damping-like SOT along the [010] direction. The distinct directional dependence of these phenomena provides new insights into the interplay between surface and bulk contributions to charge-spin conversion in Weyl semimetals. These findings enhance our understanding of anisotropic charge-spin conversion mechanisms in Weyl semimetals, which may inform future research and development of spintronic devices based on topological materials.</description>

      <title>Charge transfer induced cubic gauche nitrogen from azides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cubic gauche nitrogen (cg-N) with a three-dimensional network of N-N single bonds attracted lots of attentions in last decades, since it theoretically has five times larger energy than TNT. While, extreme environments of high pressure or plasma treatment were required in traditional routes. Quite recently, in vacuum or protective gas environments, a one-step synthesis route relying solely on heating is reported giving the highest cg-N content. However, corresponding mechanism is missing, which hinders the improvement of yield and the development of simpler methods. Here, by treating KN3 in different gas environments, we find that moisture can prevent the transition from KN3 to cg-N. In a dry air environment at 260 ~ 300{\deg}C, KN3 decomposes into K and N2, and charge transfer from K to KN3 can induce cg-N. Furthermore, by grinding or loading pressure on the mixture of KN3 with Li, Na, K, Cs, Ca, Mg and Al, we find that elements with higher electronegativity, higher pressure and temperature conditions are needed to induce cg-N, while grinding alone is sufficient for alkali metals even without heating, thus confirming the charge-transfer mechanism. These findings provide guidance for the synthesis of cg-N under ambient conditions through metal-catalyzed polymerization of various azides.</description>

      <title>Challenges and Insights in Growing Epitaxial FeSn Thin Films on GaAs(111) substrate Using Molecular Beam Epitaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: FeSn is a room-temperature antiferromagnet composed of alternating Fe3Sn kagome layers and honeycomb Sn layers. Its distinctive lattice allows the formation of linearly dispersing Dirac bands and topological flat bands in its electronic band structure, positioning FeSn as an ideal candidate for investigating the interplay between magnetism and topology. In this study, we investigate the epitaxial growth of FeSn thin films on GaAs(111) substrates by molecular beam epitaxy. A significant challenge in this growth process is the diffusion of Ga and As from the substrate into the deposited films and the diffusion of Fe into the substrate. This diffusion complicates the formation of a pure FeSn phase. Through a comprehensive analysis-including reflection high energy electron diffraction, high-resolution X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and vibrating sample magnetometry-we demonstrate that the Sn evaporation temperature plays a critical role in influencing the crystallinity, surface morphology, and magnetic behaviour of the films. Our results show that while it is difficult to grow a single-phase FeSn film on GaAs due to diffusion, optimizing the Sn evaporation temperature can enhance the dominance of the FeSn phase, partially overcoming these challenges.</description>

      <title>Strain-induced valley polarization, topological states, and piezomagnetism in two-dimensional altermagnetic V$_2$Te$_2$O, V$_2$STeO, V$_2$SSeO, and V$_2$S$_2$O</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnets (AM) are a recently discovered third class of collinear magnets, and have been attracting significant interest in the field of condensed matter physics. Here, based on first-principles calculations and theoretical analysis, we propose four two-dimensional (2D) magnetic materials--monolayer V$_2$Te$_2$O, V$_2$STeO, V$_2$SSeO, and V$_2$S$_2$O--as candidates for altermagnetic materials. We show that these materials are semiconductors with spin-splitting in their nonrelativistic band structures. Furthermore, in the band structure, there are a pair of Dirac-type valleys located at the time-reversal invariant momenta (TRIM) X and Y points. These two valleys are connected by crystal symmetry instead of time-reversal symmetry. We investigate the strain effect on the band structure and find that uniaxial strain can induce valley polarization, topological states in these monolayer materials. Moreover, piezomagnetism can be realized upon finite doping. Our result reveals interesting valley physics in monolayer V$_2$Te$_2$O, V$_2$STeO, V$_2$SSeO, and V$_2$S$_2$O, suggesting their great potential for valleytronics, spintronics, and multifunctional nanoelectronics applications.</description>

      <title>Band-gap reduction and band alignments of dilute bismide III--V alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adding a few atomic percent of Bi to III--V semiconductors leads to significant changes in their electronic structure and optical properties. Bismuth substitution on the pnictogen site leads to a large increase in spin-orbit splitting $\Delta_{\rm SO}$ at the top of the valence band ($\Gamma_{8v}-\Gamma_{7v}$) and a large reduction in the band gap, creating unique opportunities in semiconductor device applications. Quantifying these changes is key to the design and simulation of electronic and optoelectronic devices. Using hybrid functional calculations, we predict the band gap of III--Vs (III=Al, Ga, In and V=As, Sb) with low concentrations of Bi (3.125\% and 6.25\%), the effects of adding Bi on the valence- and conduction-band edges, and the band offset between these dilute alloys and their III--V parent compounds. As expected, adding Bi raises the valence-band maximum (VBM). However, contrary to previous assumptions, the conduction-band minimum (CBM) is also significantly lowered, and both effects contribute to the sizable band-gap reduction. Changes in band gap and $\Delta_{\rm SO}$ are notably larger in the arsenides than in the antimonides. We also predict cases of band-gap inversion ($\Gamma_{6c}$ below $\Gamma_{8v}$) and $\Delta_{\rm SO}$ larger than the band gap, which are key parameters for designing topological materials and for minimizing losses due to Auger recombination in infrared lasers.</description>

      <title>Kirchhoff's analogy for a planar ferromagnetic rod</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kirchhoff's kinetic analogy relates the equilibrium solutions of an elastic rod or strip to the motion of a spinning top. In this analogy, time is replaced by the arc length parameter in the phase portrait to determine the equilibrium configurations of the rod. Predicted equilibrium solutions from the phase portrait for specific boundary value problems, as well as certain localized solutions, have been experimentally observed. In this study, we employ the kinetic analogy to investigate the equilibrium solutions of planar soft ferromagnetic rods subjected to transverse and longitudinal external magnetic fields. Our analysis reveals a subcritical pitchfork bifurcation in the phase portrait of a ferromagnetic rod subjected to transverse external magnetic field as the axial load is decreased continuously from a large compressive load. Similarly, a supercritical pitchfork bifurcation is observed in the case of longitudinal external magnetic field. We predict equilibrium configurations for a free-standing soft ferromagnetic elastic rod and the same subjected to canonical boundary conditions. Furthermore, we observe novel localized equilibrium solutions arising from homoclinic and heteroclinic orbits, which are absent in the phase portraits of purely elastic rods.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Growth and Properties of Sputter-Deposited Phase-Change Superlattice Films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Highly textured chalcogenide films have recently gained significant interest for phase-change memory applications. Several reports have highlighted that programming efficiency improves in devices featuring superlattice stacks, such as Ge2Sb2Te5/Sb2Te3. However, to be technologically relevant, these films must be deposited on foundry-scale wafers using processes compatible with back end of the line (BEOL) integration and complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology, such as, for example, sputter deposition. In this work, we present our observations on the influence of temperature, pressure, and seeding layer parameters on the sputter growth processes of superlattice films. By measuring various material properties, we construct a pseudo-phase diagram to illustrate the growth of both individual and superlattice films with different periodicities on technologically relevant substrates, namely SiO2 and carbon. These results provide important insights into the structure, intermixing and electro-optical properties of superlattice films,</description>

      <title>Lattice Vibration, Raman Modes and Room-Temperature Spin-Phonon Coupling in Intrinsic 2D van der Waals Ferromagnetic Fe3GaTe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) magnets with spin-phonon coupling are crucial for next-generation spintronics. Among them, Fe3GaTe2 has attracted widespread attention due to above-room-temperature intrinsic ferromagnetism and large perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. However, the lattice vibrations and the interplay between ferromagnetism and lattice vibrations in Fe3GaTe2 are still unexplored. Here, we report the lattice vibration, Raman modes, and room-temperature spin-phonon coupling in 2D Fe3GaTe2 with above-room-temperature Curie temperature (TC). Two typical Raman modes with out-of-plane lattice vibrations are identified: "A" _"1g" ^"1" and "A" _"1g" ^"2" , whose frequencies increase as the thickness decreases from bulk to 2D Fe3GaTe2 due to the weakening of interlayer vdW interactions and spin exchange coupling. Moreover, the difference between phonon band dispersions under ferromagnetic and nonmagnetic interlayer spin ordering indicates the existence of spin-phonon coupling. The phonon frequency diverges from the anharmonic model below TC and thus the strength of spin-phonon coupling is ~0.28 cm-1 at 300 K, which is the first experimental identification of room-temperature spin-phonon coupling in 2D vdW magnets. This work deepens the understanding of novel 2D vdW magnets and provides a basis for spintronic applications at and above room temperature.</description>

      <title>Hot-carrier trapping preserves high quantum yields but limits optical gain in InP-based quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Indium phosphide is the leading material for commercial applications of colloidal quantum dots. To date, however, the community has failed to achieve successful operation under strong excitation conditions, contrasting sharply with other materials. Here, we report how the unusual photophysics of state-of-the-art InP-based quantum dots make them unattractive as a gain material. A combination of ensemble-based time-resolved spectroscopy over timescales from femtoseconds to microseconds and single-quantum-dot spectroscopy reveals ultrafast trapping of hot charge carriers. This process leads to charge-carrier losses, thereby reducing the achievable population inversion which limits amplification of light in a gain material. Interestingly, fluorescence is only delayed, not quenched, by hot charge-carrier trapping, explaining why InP-based quantum dots are successful as bright luminescent colour convertors for low-intensity applications. Comparison with other popular quantum-dot materials, such as CdSe, Pb-halide perovskites, and CuInS2, indicate that the hot-carrier dynamics observed are unique to InP.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flat elastic sheets tend to display wrinkles and folds. From pieces of clothing down to two-dimensional crystals, these corrugations appear in response to strain generated by sheet compression or stretching, thermal or mechanical mismatch with other elastic layers, or surface tension. Extensively studied in metals, polymers and, more recently, in van der Waals exfoliated layers, with the advent of thin single crystal freestanding films of complex oxides, researchers are now paying attention to novel microstructural effects induced by bending ferroelectric-ferroelastics, where polarization is strongly coupled to lattice deformation. Here we show that wrinkle undulations in BaTiO3 sheets bonded to a viscoelastic substrate transform into a buckle delamination geometry when transferred onto a rigid substrate. Using spatially resolved techniques at different scales (Raman, scanning probe and electron microscopy), we show how these delaminations in the free BaTiO3 sheets display a self-organization of ferroelastic domains along the buckle profile that strongly differs from the more studied sinusoidal wrinkle geometry. Moreover, we disclose the hierarchical distribution of a secondary set of domains induced by the misalignment of these folding structures from the preferred in-plane crystallographic orientations. Our results disclose the relevance of the morphology and orientation of buckling instabilities in ferroelectric free sheets, for the stabilization of different domain structures, pointing to new routes for domain engineering of ferroelectrics in flexible oxide sheets.</description>

      <title>Materials Learning Algorithms (MALA): Scalable Machine Learning for Electronic Structure Calculations in Large-Scale Atomistic Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the Materials Learning Algorithms (MALA) package, a scalable machine learning framework designed to accelerate density functional theory (DFT) calculations suitable for large-scale atomistic simulations. Using local descriptors of the atomic environment, MALA models efficiently predict key electronic observables, including local density of states, electronic density, density of states, and total energy. The package integrates data sampling, model training and scalable inference into a unified library, while ensuring compatibility with standard DFT and molecular dynamics codes. We demonstrate MALA's capabilities with examples including boron clusters, aluminum across its solid-liquid phase boundary, and predicting the electronic structure of a stacking fault in a large beryllium slab. Scaling analyses reveal MALA's computational efficiency and identify bottlenecks for future optimization. With its ability to model electronic structures at scales far beyond standard DFT, MALA is well suited for modeling complex material systems, making it a versatile tool for advanced materials research.</description>

      <title>Understanding the anisotropic growth of VS grown PbSnTe nanowires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: PbSnTe is a topological crystalline insulator (TCI), which holds promise for scattering-free transport channels and fault-tolerant quantum computing. As the topologically non-trivial states live on the surface, the nanowire geometry, with a high surface-to-volume ratio, is ideal for probing these states. The controlled growth of PbSnTe nanowires using molecular beam epitaxy has been shown before, but an understanding of the anisotropic growth and the resulting morphology is lacking. Here, based on experimental observations, we develop a model that describes the evolution of NW morphology as a function of growth time. It is found that the anisotropic morphology can be described by a combination of direct impingement, mask diffusion and facet diffusion which results in a transition from a Te-limited growth regime to a group IV-limited growth regime. This growth model allows us to design more targeted experiments which could lead to a higher flexibility in device design.</description>

      <title>Large Nernst effect in Te-based van der Waals materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Layered van der Waals tellurides reveal topologically non-trivial properties that give rise to unconventional magneto-transport phenomena. Additionally, their semimetallic character with high mobility makes them promising candidates for large magneto-thermoelectric effects. Remarkable studies on the very large and unconventional Nernst effect in WTe$_2$ have been reported, raising questions about whether this property is shared across the entire family of van der Waals tellurides.
  In this study, systematic measurements of the Nernst effect in telluride van der Waals Weyl semimetals are presented. Large linear Nernst coefficients in WTe$_2$ and MoTe$_2$ are identified, and moderate Nernst coefficients with non-linear behavior in magnetic fields are observed in W$_{0.65}$Mo$_{0.35}$Te$_2$, TaIrTe$_4$, and TaRhTe$_4$. Within this sample set, a correlation between the dominant linear-in-magnetic-field component of the Nernst coefficient and mobility is established, aligning with the established Nernst scaling framework, though with a different scaling factor compared to existing literature. This enhancement might be caused by the shared favorable electronic band structure of this family of materials. Conversely, the non-linear component of the Nernst effect in a magnetic field could not be correlated with mobility. This non-linear term is almost absent in the binary compounds, suggesting a multiband origin and strong compensation between electron-like and hole-like carriers. This comprehensive study highlights the potential of van der Waals tellurides for thermoelectric conversion.</description>

      <title>Precision benchmarks for solids: G0W0 calculations with different basis sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The GW approximation within many-body perturbation theory is the state of the art for computing quasiparticle energies in solids. Typically, Kohn-Sham (KS) eigenvalues and eigenfunctions, obtained from a Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculation are used as a starting point to build the Green's function G and the screened Coulomb interaction W, yielding the one-shot G0W0 selfenergy if no further update of these quantities are made. Multiple implementations exist for both the DFT and the subsequent G0W0 calculation, leading to possible differences in quasiparticle energies. In the present work, the G0W0 quasiparticle energies for states close to the band gap are calculated for six crystalline solids, using four different codes: Abinit, exciting, FHI-aims, and GPAW. This comparison helps to assess the impact of basis-set types (planewaves versus localized orbitals) and the treatment of core and valence electrons (all-electron full potentials versus pseudopotentials). The impact of unoccupied states as well as the algorithms for solving the quasiparticle equation are also briefly discussed. For the KS-DFT band gaps, we observe good agreement between all codes, with differences not exceeding 0.1 eV, while the G0W0 results deviate on the order of 0.1-0.3 eV. Between all-electron codes (FHI-aims and exciting), the agreement is better than 15 meV for KS-DFT and, with one exception, about 0.1 eV for G0W0 band gaps.</description>

      <title>Integrated Artificial Neurons from Metal Halide Perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hardware neural networks could perform certain computational tasks orders of magnitude more energy-efficiently than conventional computers. Artificial neurons are a key component of these networks and are currently implemented with electronic circuits based on capacitors and transistors. However, artificial neurons based on memristive devices are a promising alternative, owing to their potentially smaller size and inherent stochasticity. But despite their promise, demonstrations of memristive artificial neurons have so far been limited. Here we demonstrate a fully on-chip artificial neuron based on microscale electrodes and halide perovskite semiconductors as the active layer. By connecting a halide perovskite memristive device in series with a capacitor, the device demonstrates stochastic leaky integrate-and-fire behavior, with an energy consumption of 20 to 60 pJ per spike, lower than that of a biological neuron. We simulate populations of our neuron and show that the stochastic firing allows the detection of sub-threshold inputs. The neuron can easily be integrated with previously-demonstrated halide perovskite artificial synapses in energy-efficient neural networks.</description>

      <title>Altermagnetic multiferroics and altermagnetoelectric effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetoelectric multiferroics are highly sought after for applications in low-power electronics and for advancing fundamental research, including axion insulators and dark matter detection. However, achieving a combination of ferroic spin and electric orders, along with their controllable switching, remains a significant challenge in conventional ferromagnets and antiferromagnets. Here, we present first-principles evidence that time-reversal symmetry-breaking altermagnetic spin polarization with relatively high critical temperatures can emerge in ferroelectrics BaCuF$_4$ (T$_N$ $\sim$ 275K) and Ca$_3$Mn$_2$O$_7$ (T$_N$ $\sim$ 110K). Furthermore, we classify all possible altermagnetic polar spin groups, revealing altermagnetism in a collinear phase of BiFeO$_3$. We also propose an altermagnetoelectric effect, a nonrelativistic cross-coupling between altermagnetic spin polarization and ferroelectric polarization, mediated by a rotation of nonmagnetic polyhedra in the lattice structure. Our findings suggest an alternative pathway towards high-temperature magnetoelectric multiferroicity and the electric field control of altermagnetic order parameters.</description>

      <title>MaterialBENCH: Evaluating College-Level Materials Science Problem-Solving Abilities of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03161v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A college-level benchmark dataset for large language models (LLMs) in the materials science field, MaterialBENCH, is constructed. This dataset consists of problem-answer pairs, based on university textbooks. There are two types of problems: one is the free-response answer type, and the other is the multiple-choice type. Multiple-choice problems are constructed by adding three incorrect answers as choices to a correct answer, so that LLMs can choose one of the four as a response. Most of the problems for free-response answer and multiple-choice types overlap except for the format of the answers. We also conduct experiments using the MaterialBENCH on LLMs, including ChatGPT-3.5, ChatGPT-4, Bard (at the time of the experiments), and GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 with the OpenAI API. The differences and similarities in the performance of LLMs measured by the MaterialBENCH are analyzed and discussed. Performance differences between the free-response type and multiple-choice type in the same models and the influence of using system massages on multiple-choice problems are also studied. We anticipate that MaterialBENCH will encourage further developments of LLMs in reasoning abilities to solve more complicated problems and eventually contribute to materials research and discovery.</description>

      <title>A New Moir\'e Platform Based on M-Point Twisting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new class of moir\'e systems and materials based on monolayers with triangular lattices and low-energy states at the M points of the Brillouin zone. These M-point moir\'e materials are fundamentally distinct from those derived from $\Gamma$- or K-point monolayers, featuring three time-reversal-preserving valleys related by three-fold rotational symmetry. We propose twisted bilayers of experimentally exfoliable 1T-SnSe$_2$ and 1T-ZrS$_2$ as realizations of this new class. Using extensive ab initio simulations, we develop quantitative continuum models and analytically show that the corresponding M-point moir\'e Hamiltonians exhibit emergent momentum-space non-symmorphic symmetries and a kagome plane-wave lattice in momentum space. This represents the first experimentally viable realization of a projective representation of crystalline space groups in a non-magnetic system. With interactions, these materials represent six-flavor Hubbard simulators with Mott physics, as can be seen by their flat Wilson loops. Furthermore, the presence of a non-symmorphic momentum-space in-plane mirror symmetry makes some of the M-point moir\'e Hamiltonians quasi-one-dimensional in each valley, suggesting the possibility of realizing Luttinger liquid physics. We predict the twist angles at which a series of (conduction) flat bands appear, provide a faithful continuum Hamiltonian, analyze its topology and charge density and briefly discuss several aspects of the physics of this new platform.</description>

      <title>All-passive upconversion imaging of incoherent near-infrared light at intensities down to 50 nW/cm$^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Frequency upconversion, which converts low-energy photons into higher-energy ones, typically requires intense coherent illumination to drive nonlinear processes or the use of externally driven optoelectronic devices. Here, we demonstrate a high-resolution upconversion imaging system that converts low-intensity (down to 50 nW/cm$^2$) incoherent near-infrared (NIR) light into the visible, reaching intensities perceptible by the human eye, without the use of any external power input. Our upconverting element is enabled by the following ingredients: (1) photon upconversion via triplet-triplet annihilation in a bulk heterojunction of the organic semiconductors Y6 and rubrene; (2) plasmonic enhancement of absorption and field intensity in the heterojunction layer; (3) collection enhancement using a dichroic thin-film assembly. The upconverting element is inserted at an intermediate image plane of a dual-wavelength telescope system, which preserves the relative directionality of rays between the incident NIR light and output visible light. Our all-passive upconversion imaging system will enable NIR imaging and sensing in low-light environments under energy constraints.</description>

      <title>Pressure induced transition from chiral charge order to time-reversal symmetry-breaking superconducting state in Nb-doped CsV$_3$Sb$_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The experimental realisation of unconventional superconductivity and charge order in kagome systems \textit{A}V$_3$Sb$_5$ is of critical importance. We conducted a highly systematic study of Cs(V$_{1-x}$Nb$_x$)$_3$Sb$_5$ with $x$=0.07 (Nb$_{0.07}$-CVS) by employing a unique combination of tuning parameters such as doping, hydrostatic pressure, magnetic fields, and depth, using muon spin rotation, AC susceptibility, and STM. We uncovered tunable magnetism in the normal state of Nb$_{0.07}$-CVS, which transitions to a time-reversal symmetry (TRS) breaking superconducting state under pressure. Specifically, our findings reveal that the bulk of Nb$_{0.07}$-CVS (at depths greater than 20 nm from the surface) experiences TRS breaking below $T^*=40~$K, lower than the charge order onset temperature, $T_\mathrm{CO}$ = 58 K. However, near the surface (within 20 nm from the surface), the TRS breaking signal doubles and onsets at $T_\mathrm{CO}$, indicating that Nb-doping decouples TRS breaking from charge order in the bulk but synchronises them near the surface. Additionally, Nb-doping raises the superconducting critical temperature $T_\mathrm{C}$ from 2.5 K to 4.4 K. Applying hydrostatic pressure enhances both $T_\mathrm{C}$ and the superfluid density by a factor of two, with a critical pressure $p_\mathrm{cr}$ ${\simeq}$ 0.85 GPa, suggesting competition with charge order. Notably, above $p_\mathrm{cr}$, we observe nodeless electron pairing and weak internal fields below $T_\mathrm{C}$, indicating broken TRS in the superconducting state. Overall, these results demonstrate a highly unconventional normal state with a depth-tunable onset of TRS breaking at ambient pressure, a transition to TRS-breaking superconductivity under low hydrostatic pressure, and an unconventional scaling between $T_\mathrm{C}$ and the superfluid density.</description>

      <title>Light-induced Orbital and Spin Magnetism in $3d$, $4d$, and $5d$ Transition Metals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the coherent interplay of light with the magnetization in metals has been a long-standing problem in ultrafast magnetism. While it is known that when laser light acts on a metal it can induce magnetization via the process known as the inverse Faraday effect (IFE), the most basic ingredients of this phenomenon are still largely unexplored. In particular, given a strong recent interest in orbital non-equilibrium dynamics and its role in mediating THz emission in transition metals, the exploration of distinct features in spin and orbital IFE is pertinent. Here, we present a first complete study of the spin and orbital IFE in $3d$, $4d$ and $5d$ transition metals of groups IV$-$XI from first-principles. By examining the dependence on the light polarization and frequency, we show that the laser-induced spin and orbital moments may vary significantly both in magnitude and sign. We underpin the interplay between the crystal field splitting and spin-orbit interaction as the key factor which determines the magnitude and key differences between the spin and orbital response. Additionally, we highlight the anisotropy of the effect with respect to the ferromagnetic magnetization and to the crystal structure. The provided complete map of IFE in transition metals is a key reference point in the field of optical magnetism.</description>

      <title>Measuring direct flexoelectricity at the nanoscale</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flexoelectricity is a property of all dielectric materials, where inhomogeneous strain induces electrical polarization. This effect becomes particularly prominent at the nanoscale where larger strain gradients can be obtained. While flexoelectric charges have been measured in mm-scale systems, direct measurements in nanoscale-thickness materials have not yet been achieved. Given that one of the most prominent applications of flexoelectricity is in nano-electro-mechanical systems (NEMS), confirming the presence and magnitude of the effect at these scales is essential. This study presents the first-ever measurements of flexoelectric-generated charges (direct effect) in nanoscale-thickness materials, using cantilevers with a 50 nm hafnium oxide layer. We confirm that the estimated flexoelectric coefficient from said measurements aligns with the values obtained from complementary experiments using the flexoelectric inverse effect. Additionally, by changing the cantilever geometry (modifying the width of the cantilevers), we demonstrate a 40% increase in the effective flexoelectric coefficient, explained by the interplay of different flexoelectric tensor components. These findings not only validate the presence of flexoelectric effects at the nanoscale but also open the possibility for full flexoelectric transduction of the motion in NEMS/MEMS devices.</description>

Abstract: Developing environmentally sustainable refrigerants is critical for mitigating the impact of anthropogenic greenhouse gases on global warming. This study presents a predictive modeling framework to estimate the 100-year global warming potential (GWP 100) of single-component refrigerants using a fully connected neural network implemented on the Multi-Sigma platform. Molecular descriptors from RDKit, Mordred, and alvaDesc were utilized to capture various chemical features. The RDKit-based model achieved the best performance, with a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 481.9 and an R2 score of 0.918, demonstrating superior predictive accuracy and generalizability. Dimensionality reduction through Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and quantile transformation were applied to address the high-dimensional and skewed nature of the dataset,enhancing model stability and performance. Factor analysis identified vital molecular features, including molecular weight, lipophilicity, and functional groups, such as nitriles and allylic oxides, as significant contributors to GWP values. These insights provide actionable guidance for designing environmentally sustainable refrigerants. Integrating RDKit descriptors with Multi-Sigma's framework, which includes PCA, quantile transformation, and neural networks, provides a scalable solution for the rapid virtual screening of low-GWP refrigerants. This approach can potentially accelerate the identification of eco-friendly alternatives, directly contributing to climate mitigation by enabling the design of next-generation refrigerants aligned with global sustainability objectives.</description>

Abstract: This review explores the progress of spin-wave technology, emphasizing magnonics as a potential solution to modern challenges in radio frequency (RF) communication systems. To ensure clarity, the first two sections of the review reiterate premises of the magnonics, outline key milestones in spin-wave research, briefly review the state-of-the-art for technology and materials, as well as highlight potential directions for future developments. The third section is dedicated to spin-wave RF applications developed over the past 50 years, focusing on selected passive fundamental devices (filters, power limiters, delay lines, phase shifters, directional couplers, resonators, etc) and their operating principles. In the last section, the review further discusses the main advantages of spin-waves for RF applications while highlighting potential concerns, such as insertion losses, linearity and power capacity. Finally, potential solutions to address these challenges are proposed.</description>

      <title>Observation of a non-reciprocal skyrmion Hall effect of hybrid chiral skyrmion tubes in synthetic antiferromagnetic multilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological spin textures in magnetic materials beyond two-dimensional skyrmions have attracted attention for electronics beyond CMOS technologies. In particular, three-dimensional (3D) topological spin textures are promising due to the expected complex non-linear dynamics as well as high static and dynamic thermal stability. In multilayer heterostructures, a hybrid chiral skyrmion tube is a well-known example of a 3D topological spin texture, exhibiting an intriguing chirality transition along the thickness direction. This transition progresses from left-handed to right-handed N\'eel-type chirality, passing through a Bloch-type intermediate state. Such an exotic spin configuration potentially exhibits distinctly different dynamics from that of the common skyrmion tube that exhibits a homogeneous chirality; yet these dynamics have not been ascertained so far. Here we reveal the distinct features of current-induced dynamics that result from the hybrid chiral skyrmion tube structure in synthetic antiferromagnetic (SyAFM) multilayers. Strikingly, the SyAFM hybrid chiral skyrmion tubes exhibit a non-reciprocal skyrmion Hall effect in the flow regime. The non-reciprocity can even be tuned by the degree of magnetic compensation in the SyAFM systems. Our theoretical modeling qualitatively corroborates that the non-reciprocity stems from the dynamic oscillation of skyrmion helicity during its current-induced motion. The findings highlight the critical role of the internal degrees of freedom of these complex skyrmion tubes for their current-induced dynamics.</description>

      <title>Predictive orientational phase behavior in convex polyhedral entropic crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hard convex polyhedra, idealized models for anisotropic colloids and nanoparticles, are known to form variety of orientational phases despite the regular arrangement of particles in the crystalline assemblies. Based on the orientational behavior of the constituents particles, such phases could be categorized into freely rotating plastic crystals (PC), discrete plastic crystals (DPC) and orientationally ordered crystals (OC). In this article, we report an extensive Monte Carlo computer simulation study of sixty hard convex polyhedral shape indicating a direct predictive relationship between the nature of orientational phases in the crystalline assemblies and single-particle shape attributes. The influence of three attributes namely; (i) Isoperimetric Quotient (IQ) i.e., the extent of asphericity; (ii) isotropy of the moment of inertia tensor in the principal frame and (iii) number of symmetry operations in the point group of the particle and self-assembled crystal structure, were observed to control the orientational phase behavior of the entire solid region in many-body system. The translational order in the crystal appeared to play significant role only in the DPC phase, where as, other two phases were completely governed by the combination of two attributes. In this study, the role of shape attributes were characterized by sequential appearance of one or two of the aforementioned rotational phases across the phase diagram in a pressure dependent manner which could be regarded as an important stepping stone towards fully predictive self-assembly behavior of hard particle systems.</description>

      <title>Chirality-Dependent Kinetics of Single-Walled Carbon Nanotubes from Machine-Learning Force Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The origin of the chirality of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) has been a long-standing dispute. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations driven by machine-learning force fields (MLFF), which can study the interface dynamics under near ab-initio accuracy, provides a powerful technique to reveal the formation mechanism of SWCNTs. Here, we develop a cobalt-carbon MLFF and perform growth simulations on a cobalt catalyst to investigate the chirality preference of the growth of SWCNTs under the vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) regime. Through microkinetic modeling, we reproduce the observed growth and defect kinetics, demonstrating their dependence on the chirality. It is observed that while the initial chirality assignment is likely related to the configurational degeneracy of the nanotube caps, pentagon defects immediately form and resolve after nucleation. Such processes, which we name as diameter control mechanisms, not only control the diameter toward an optimum but also shift the chirality distribution drastically. Our work therefore offers a microkinetic modeling workflow for the chirality-dependent kinetics of the SWCNTs, highlighting the important contribution of the defect kinetics to the chirality origination.</description>

      <title>Efficient short-wave infrared upconversion by self-sensitized holmium-doped nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photon upconversion, combining several low-energy photons to generate one high-energy photon is of wide interest for biomedical, catalytic and photonic applications. Lanthanide-doped nanoparticles (LnNP) are a unique type of upconversion nanoconverter, which can realize ultralarge anti-Stokes shift (&gt;1000 nm) and high photostability, without photo-bleaching and photo-blinking. The excitation wavelength of LnNPs has been limited to the second near-infrared window (1000-1700 nm), mainly sensitized by erbium ions with absorption centered around 1.5 $\mu$m. Here, we demonstrate novel self-sensitized holmium (Ho)-doped nanoconverters to further expand the sensitization range to the short-wave infrared at 2 $\mu$m and achieve efficient upconversion to 640 nm. We show that this upconversion is a 4-photon conversion process with an underlying energy transfer upconversion mechanism. Via careful control of dopant concentration and shelling we achieve a relative upconversion-to-downconversion efficiency up to 15.2%, more than half the theoretical maximum. The placement of the Ho doped LnNPs into a plasmonic nanocavity device enables large gains in emission intensity (up to 32-fold), due to the dramatic shortening of the emission lifetime of Ho from 29 $\mu$s to &lt;1 ns, indicating a high Purcell-enhancement factor of 3x10$^4$. These results open new possibilities at the frontier of short-wave infrared upconversion and the nanoplasmonic enhancement of LnNP emission, with potential applications in detection, theranostics, photonics and optoelectronics.</description>

      <title>Nearly perfect spin polarization of noncollinear antiferromagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.03026v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ferromagnets with high spin polarization are known to be valuable for spintronics--a research field that exploits the spin degree of freedom in information technologies. Recently, antiferromagnets have emerged as promising alternative materials for spintronics due to their stability against magnetic perturbations, absence of stray fields, and ultrafast dynamics. For antiferromagnets,however, the concept of spin polarization and its relevance to the measured electrical response are elusive due to nominally zero net magnetization.Here, we define an effective momentum-dependent spin polarization and reveal an unexpected property of many noncollinear antiferromagnets to exhibit nearly 100% spin polarization in a broad area of the Fermi surface. This property leads to the emergence of an extraordinary tunneling magnetoresistance (ETMR) effect in antiferromagnetic tunnel junctions (AFMTJs). As a representative example, we predict that a noncollinear antiferromagnet Mn$_{3}$GaN exhibits nearly 100% spin-polarized states that can efficiently tunnel through low-decay-rate evanescent states of perovskite oxide SrTiO$_{3}$ resulting in ETMR as large as $10^{4}$%. Our results uncover hidden functionality of material systems with noncollinear spin textures and open new perspectives for spintronics.</description>

      <title>Integrated ab initio modelling of atomic order and magnetic anisotropy for rare-earth-free magnet design: effects of alloying additions in $\mathrm{L}1_0$ FeNi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.02809v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe an integrated modelling approach to accelerate the search for novel, single-phase, multicomponent materials with high magnetocrystalline anisotropy (MCA). For a given system we predict the nature of atomic ordering, its dependence on the magnetic state, and then proceed to describe the consequent MCA, magnetisation, and magnetic critical temperature (Curie temperature). Crucially, within our modelling framework, the same ab initio description of the material's electronic structure determines all aspects. We demonstrate this holistic method by studying the effects of alloying additions in FeNi, examining systems with the general stoichiometries Fe$_4$Ni$_3X$ and Fe$_3$Ni$_4X$, for additives including X= Pt, Pd, Al, and Co. The atomic ordering behaviour predicted on adding these elements, fundamental for determining a material's MCA, is rich and varied. Equiatomic FeNi has been reported to require ferromagnetic order to establish the tetragonal L10 order suited for significant MCA. Our results show that when alloying additions are included in this material, annealing in an applied magnetic field and/or below a material's Curie temperature may also promote tetragonal order, along with an appreciable effect on the predicted hard magnetic properties.</description>

      <title>Structure, short-range order, and phase stability of the Al$_x$CrFeCoNi high-entropy alloy: Insights from a perturbative, DFT-based analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13173v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the phase behaviour of the Al$_x$CrFeCoNi high-entropy alloy. Our approach is based on a perturbative analysis of the internal energy of the paramagnetic solid solution as evaluated within the Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker formulation of density functional theory, using the coherent potential approximation to average over disorder. Via application of a Landau-type linear response theory, we infer preferential chemical orderings directly. In addition, we recover a pairwise form of the alloy internal energy suitable for study via atomistic simulations, which in this work are performed using the nested sampling algorithm, which is well-suited for studying complex potential energy surfaces. When the underlying lattice is fcc, at low concentrations of Al, depending on the value of $x$, we predict either an $\mathrm{L}1_2$ or $\mathrm{D}0_{22}$ ordering emerging below approximately 1000 K. On the other hand, when the underlying lattice is bcc, consistent with experimental observations, we predict $\mathrm{B}2$ ordering temperatures higher than the melting temperature of the alloy, confirming that this ordered phase forms directly from the melt. For both fcc and bcc systems, chemical orderings are dominated by Al moving to one sublattice, Ni and Co the other, while Cr and Fe remain comparatively disordered. On the bcc lattice, our atomistic modelling suggests eventual decomposition into $\mathrm{B}2$ NiAl and Cr-rich phases. These results shed light on the fundamental physical origins of atomic ordering tendencies in these intriguing materials.</description>

      <title>Unidirectional spin waves measured using propagating spin wave spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09107v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dispersion relation of spin waves can vary monotonically about the center of the Brillouin zone, allowing zero-momentum wavepackets to flow unidirectionally, which is of interest for applications. Techniques such as propagating spin wave spectroscopy are inoperative in such cases because of the difficulty to identify the spin wave wavevector at a particular frequency within a spectrum. Here we present a method to analyse this case and apply it to acoustic spin waves in a synthetic antiferromagnet in the scissors state, in which we confirm that propagation parallel to the applied fields is unidirectional. Interestingly, we find that in this unidirectional situation, the phase accumulated by the spin waves propagating between two antenna is not proportional to the antenna spacing. It is also a function of the two other lengths of the problem: the antenna width and the spin wave decay length. Accounting for them is required to avoid wavevector errors in the dispersion relations.</description>

      <title>Room Temperature Hydrogen Atom Scattering Experiments Are Not a Sufficient Benchmark to Validate Electronic Friction Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12949v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the dynamics of atoms and molecules at metal surfaces, electron-hole pair excitations can play a crucial role. In the case of hyperthermal hydrogen atom scattering, they lead to nonadiabatic energy loss and highly inelastic scattering. Molecular dynamics with electronic friction simulations where friction is computed under an isotropic homogeneous electron gas approximation have previously shown good agreement with measured kinetic energy loss distributions, suggesting that this level of theoretical description is sufficient to describe nonadiabatic effects of atomic scattering. In this work, we show that similar agreement with room temperature experiments can also be achieved with friction derived from density functional theory linear response calculations. The apparent agreement of the homogeneous electron gas approximation with experiment arises from a fortuitous cancellation of errors where friction is overestimated close to the surface and the spin transition is neglected. Only for scattering at low temperatures can both approximations be distinguished and differences rationalised in terms of the number of bounces of the atom on the surface. We identify the signatures of nonadiabatic energy loss of different levels of theory, which future low-temperature scattering experiments will be able to measure.</description>

Abstract: The determination of mechanical properties such as the Young's modulus provides an important means to compare classical molecular dynamics simulations with materials. In this respect, ultra-thin materials hold several challenges: their volume is ambiguous, and different methods to determine a stress-strain relation deliver different result in particular for disordered systems. Using the example of carbon nanomembranes we discuss three common approaches to the problem and show that stress-strain simulations following experimental setups deliver correct results if adjusted carefully. We provide step-by-step instructions how to perform trustworthy simulations.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we review the models and their parameters to describe the relative permittivity, bandgap, impact ionization, mobility, charge carrier recombination/effective masses and incomplete dopand ionization of 4H silicon carbide in computer simulations. We aim to lower the entrance barrier for newcomers and provide a critical evaluation of the status quo to identify shortcomings and guide future research. The review reveals a rich set of often diverging values in literature based on a variety of calculation and measurement methods. Although research for all the selected parameters is still active, we show that sometimes old values or those determined for other kinds of silicon carbide are commonly used.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09429v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The discovery of advanced materials is the cornerstone of human technological development and progress. The structures of materials and their corresponding properties are essentially the result of a complex interplay of multiple degrees of freedom such as lattice, charge, spin, symmetry, and topology. This poses significant challenges for the inverse design methods of materials. Humans have long explored new materials through a large number of experiments and proposed corresponding theoretical systems to predict new material properties and structures. With the improvement of computational power, researchers have gradually developed various electronic structure calculation methods, such as the density functional theory and high-throughput computational methods. Recently, the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology in the field of computer science has enabled the effective characterization of the implicit association between material properties and structures, thus opening up an efficient paradigm for the inverse design of functional materials. A significant progress has been made in inverse design of materials based on generative and discriminative models, attracting widespread attention from researchers. Considering this rapid technological progress, in this survey, we look back on the latest advancements in AI-driven inverse design of materials by introducing the background, key findings, and mainstream technological development routes. In addition, we summarize the remaining issues for future directions. This survey provides the latest overview of AI-driven inverse design of materials, which can serve as a useful resource for researchers.</description>

      <title>A facile route to synthesize cubic gauche polymeric nitrogen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10331v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, the long-sought cg-N with N-N single bond has been synthesized for the first time by a thermal-driven-only chemical route at ambient conditions. The successful synthesis of cg-N was achieved by first creating a solution of azides, which was then pretreated under vacuum conditions. Following the pretreatment, the resultant concentrated azide was heated at temperatures ranging from 260{\deg}C to 330{\deg}C for a reaction time of 3 hours, ultimately leading to the formation of cg-N. The emergent intense Raman peak characterized of cg-N provides solid evidence that the double bonded nitrogen-nitrogen transforms into a single bond form, which agrees well with cg-N structure. To date, this is the only work achieving the quantity of cg-N synthesized at ambient conditions by a facile route that can be further developed for the scalable synthesis and applications of polymerized nitrogen-based materials as high energy density materials.</description>

      <title>A data driven approach to classify descriptors based on their efficiency in translating noisy trajectories into physically-relevant information</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12570v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reconstructing the physical complexity of many-body dynamical systems can be challenging. Starting from the trajectories of their constitutive units (raw data), typical approaches require selecting appropriate descriptors to convert them into time-series, which are then analyzed to extract interpretable information. However, identifying the most effective descriptor is often non-trivial. Here, we report a data-driven approach to compare the efficiency of various descriptors in extracting information from noisy trajectories and translating it into physically relevant insights. As a prototypical system with non-trivial internal complexity, we analyze molecular dynamics trajectories of an atomistic system where ice and water coexist in equilibrium near the solid/liquid transition temperature. We compare general and specific descriptors often used in aqueous systems: number of neighbors, molecular velocities, Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions (SOAP), Local Environments and Neighbors Shuffling (LENS), Orientational Tetrahedral Order, and distance from the fifth neighbor ($d_5$). Using Onion Clustering -- an efficient unsupervised method for single-point time-series analysis -- we assess the maximum extractable information for each descriptor and rank them via a high-dimensional metric. Our results show that advanced descriptors like SOAP and LENS outperform classical ones due to higher signal-to-noise ratios. Nonetheless, even simple descriptors can rival or exceed advanced ones after local signal denoising. For example, $d_5$, initially among the weakest, becomes the most effective at resolving the system's non-local dynamical complexity after denoising. This work highlights the critical role of noise in information extraction from molecular trajectories and offers a data-driven approach to identify optimal descriptors for systems with characteristic internal complexity.</description>

      <title>Diffusionless relaxation of half-skyrmion liquid, hexatic, and crystalline states in a chiral molecular crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.04021v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Particles in a crowded environment exhibit slow anomalous diffusion, and their efficient manipulation is important in controlling transport phenomena in complex materials. Skyrmions and half-skyrmions, spatially localized quasiparticles observed in magnetic systems and liquid crystals, also exhibit diffusive motion. They exhibit normal diffusion in dilute conditions. However, the cooperative dynamics and diffusion of skyrmions and half-skyrmions in their condensed liquid, hexatic, and crystalline phases are elusive. Here we show in the half-skyrmion condensed phases that the fusion and fission of half-skyrmions, not their diffusion, are responsible for the primary structural relaxation. The fusion and fission occur due to the non-conserved nature of the quasiparticle number density. The diffusion, which contributes to the secondary structural relaxation, is suppressed by cages formed by surrounding half-skyrmions, whereas enhanced by Mermin-Wagner fluctuation characteristic to two-dimensional systems, leading to subdiffusive motion. Large displacement of half-skyrmions is locally excited by fusion-fission and bond-breaking between adjacent half-skyrmions via heterogeneous elastic fields. Furthermore, the motion of half-skyrmions couples with transverse and longitudinal sound wave excitation differently, where the transverse sound wave is more attenuated than the longitudinal one due to the coupling between transverse sound wave and half-skyrmion deformation. We also discuss the {relationship} between half-skyrmion diffusion in our system and skyrmion diffusion in magnetic systems. Our result provides a qualitative difference in dynamical properties between half-skyrmion gaseous and condensed phases, suggesting the efficient manipulation of high-density half-skyrmions and skyrmions.</description>

      <title>Understanding orientational disorder in crystalline assemblies of hard convex polyhedra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.06799v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spontaneous self-assembly of hard convex polyhedra are known to form orientationally disordered crystalline phases, where particle orientations do not follow the same pattern as the positional arrangement of the crystal. A distinct type of orientational phase with discrete rotational mobility has been reported in hard particle systems. In this paper, we present a new analysis method for characterizing orientational phase of a crystal, which is based on algorithmic detection of unique orientations. Using this method we collected complete statistics of discrete orientations along the Monte Carlo simulation trajectories and observed that particles were equally partitioned among them, with specific values of pairwise orientational differences. These features remained constant across the pressure range and did not depend on rotational mobility. The discrete mobility was characteristic of a distinct equilibrium thermodynamic phase, qualitatively different from the freely rotating plastic phase with continuous orientations. The high pressure behavior with frozen particle orientations was part of that the same description and not a non-equilibrium arrested state. We introduced a precise notion of orientational order and demonstrated that the system was maximally disordered at the level of unit cell, even though individual particles could only take few discrete orientations. We report the existence of this phase in five polyhedral shapes and in systematically curated shape families constructed around two of them. The symmetry mismatch between the particle and the crystallographic point groups was found to be a predictive indicator for the occurrence of this phase.</description>

Abstract: Topological superconductors have garnered significant attention due to their potential for realizing topological quantum computation. However, a universal computational tool based on first-principles calculations for predicting topological superconductivity has not yet been fully developed, posing substantial challenges in identifying topological superconducting materials. In this paper, we present a numerical method to characterize the superconducting spectrum and topological invariants of two-dimensional (2D) slab systems using first-principles calculations, implemented in the open-source software WannierTools. To more accurately model the superconducting proximity effect, we integrate an SC pairing decay module into the program. Our approach can be applied to classical superconductor-topological insulator (SC-TI) heterostructures, SC-semiconductor heterostructures, and intrinsic topological superconductors. The program's validity is demonstrated using the topological crystal insulator SnTe, the Rashba semiconductor InSb, and the superconductor NbSe2 as examples. We anticipate that this tool will accelerate the discovery of topological superconductor candidates.</description>

      <title>GW effects on the topology of type-II Dirac cones in NiTe$_2$, PtSe$_2$ and PtTe$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03012v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many-body correlations are known to be responsible for a broad range of fascinating physical phenomena, introducing corrections that appear elusive at the mean-field level. An example of this is the Lifshitz transition that occurs as the Fermi surface topology changes when {\it e.g.} Coulomb interaction effects break into the picture. In particular, the Fermi velocity renormalization can lead a type-II Weyl semimetal at mean-field level to become a trivial or a type-I Dirac material when correlations are accounted for, which is far from being obvious. In this work we scrutinize the band structure of NiTe$_2$, a material that features a type-II Dirac point near the Fermi level within the mean-field approach. Including GW-level correlations, our findings showcase anisotropic corrections on the Dirac carrier velocity exceeding $100 \, \%$ enhancements, underscoring the nuanced influence of electronic interactions in the band structure. We also consider type-II Dirac crossings in PtSe$_2$ and PtTe$_2$ and observe that including many-body effects via GW the band topology changes, featuring trivial topology and type-I Dirac crossings, respectively. Our findings highlights the necessity to evaluate the many-body effects on non-trivial bands, contributing essential insights to the broader exploration of many-body correlation effects in type-II Dirac points of condensed-matter systems.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the nature of cathodoluminescence from photon statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12824v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cathodoluminescence (CL), the emission of light induced by accelerated free electrons, has been extensively utilized in various applications, such as displays, streak cameras, and high-spatial-resolution analysis of optical material, surpassing the diffraction limit of light. Despite its long history, the photon statistics of CL have only recently been examined, revealing unexpectedly large bunching of photons. Here we find that this peculiar photon bunching contains information of intervening excitation processes before the photon emission, which can be extracted from the photon statistics within each excitation event by a single free electron. Using this approach, we experimentally unveiled the statistical differences of coherent CL involving a single electromagnetic interaction process and incoherent CL involving multiple excitation processes. The developed formulation is universally applicable for particle generation processes in general to investigate the nature of cascade reactions.</description>

      <title>Broadband measurement of Feibelman's quantum surface response functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16616v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Feibelman $d$-parameter, a mesoscopic complement to the local bulk permittivity, describes quantum optical surface responses for interfaces, including nonlocality, spill-in and-out, and surface-enabled Landau damping. It has been incorporated into the macroscopic Maxwellian framework for convenient modeling and understanding of nanoscale electromagnetic phenomena, calling for the compilation of a $d$-parameter database for interfaces of interest in nano-optics. However, accurate first-principles calculations of $d$-parameters face computational challenges, whereas existing measurements of $d$-parameters are scarce and restricted to narrow spectral windows. We demonstrate a general broadband ellipsometric approach to measure $d$-parameters at a gold--air interface across the visible--ultraviolet regimes. Gold is found to spill in and spill out at different frequencies. We also observe gold's Bennett mode, a surface-dipole resonance associated with a pole of the $d$-parameter, around 2.5 eV. Our measurements give rise to and are further validated by the passivity and Kramers--Kronig causality analysis of $d$-parameters. Our work advances the understanding of quantum surface response and may enable applications like enhanced electron field emission.</description>
