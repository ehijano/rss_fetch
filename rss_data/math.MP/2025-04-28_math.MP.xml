      <title>A Canonical Construction of the Extended Hilbert Space for Causal Fermion Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is shown that second variations of the causal action can be decomposed into a sum of three terms, two of which being positive and one being small. This gives rise to an approximate decoupling of the linearized field equations into the dynamical wave equation and bosonic field equations. A concrete construction of homogeneous and inhomogeneous solutions of the dynamical wave equation in time strips is presented. In addition, it is show that the solution space admits a positive definite inner product which is preserved under the time evolution. Based on these findings, a canonical construction of the extended Hilbert space containing these solutions is given.</description>

      <title>Large time cumulants of the KPZ equation on an interval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation on the interval $[0,L]$ with Neumann type boundary conditions and boundary parameters $u,v$. We show that the $k$-th order cumulant of the height behaves as $c_k(L,u,v)\, t$ in the large time limit $t \to +\infty$, and we compute the coefficients $c_k(L,u,v)$. We obtain an expression for the upper tail large deviation function of the height. We also consider the limit of large $L$, with $u=\tilde u/\sqrt{L}$, $u=\tilde v/\sqrt{L}$, which should give the same quantities for the two parameter family $(\tilde u, \tilde v)$ KPZ fixed point on the interval. We employ two complementary methods. On the one hand we adapt to the interval the replica Bethe ansatz method pioneered by Brunet and Derrida for the periodic case. On the other hand, we perform a scaling limit using previous results available for the open ASEP. The latter method allows to express the cumulants of the KPZ equation in terms a functional equation involving an integral operator.</description>

      <title>On the Excess Charge Problem of Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper establishes new bounds on the maximum number of electrons $ N_c(Z) $ that an atom with nuclear charge $Z$ can bind. Specifically, we show that \begin{equation*}
  N_c(Z) &lt; 1.1185Z + O(Z^{1/3}) \end{equation*} with an explicit bound on the lower order term $O(Z^{1/3})$. This result improves long--standing bounds by Lieb and Nam obtained in 1984, respectively 2012. Our bounds show the fundamental difference between fermionic and bosonic atoms for finite $Z$ since for bosonic atoms it is known that $\lim N_c(Z)/Z = t_c \approx 1.21$ in the limit of large nuclear charges $Z$.</description>

      <title>Equations of motion for dynamical systems with angular momentum on Finsler geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article aims to derive equations of motion for dynamical systems with angular momentum on Finsler geometries. To this end, we apply Souriau's Principle of General Covariance, which is a geometrical framework to derive diffeomorphism invariant equations of motion. The equations we obtain are the generalization of that of Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon (MPD) on Finsler geometries, and we give their conserved quantities which turn out to be formally identical to the Riemannian case.
  These equations share the same properties as the MPD equations, and we mention different choices possible for supplementary conditions to close this system of equations. These equations have an additional requirement, which is the choice of what defines the tangent direction of the Finsler manifold, since the velocity and momentum are not parallel in general. After choosing the momentum as the Finsler direction and to define the center of mass, we give the complete equations of motion in 3 spatial dimensions, which we find coincide to previously known equations for Finsler spinoptics, and novel equations in 4 dimensions for massive and massless dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Global Gauge Symmetry Breaking in the Abelian Higgs Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper aims to resolve the incompatibility between two extant gauge-invariant accounts of the Abelian Higgs mechanism: the first account uses global gauge symmetry breaking, and the second eliminates spontaneous symmetry breaking entirely. We resolve this incompatibility by using the constrained Hamiltonian formalism in symplectic geometry. First we argue that, unlike their local counterparts, global gauge symmetries are physical. The symmetries that are spontaneously broken by the Higgs mechanism are then the global ones. Second, we explain how the dressing field method singles out the Coulomb gauge as a preferred gauge for a gauge-invariant account of the Abelian Higgs mechanism. Based on the existence of this group of global gauge symmetries that are physical, we resolve the incompatibility between the two accounts by arguing that the correct way to carry out the second method is to eliminate only the redundant gauge symmetries, i.e. those local gauge symmetries which are not global. We extend our analysis to quantum field theory, where we show that the Abelian Higgs mechanism can be understood as spontaneous global $U(1)$ symmetry breaking in the $C^*$-algebraic sense.</description>

      <title>The Weyl anomaly in interacting quantum field theory on curved spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define the notion of Weyl anomalies, measuring the violation of local scale invariance, in interacting quantum field theory on curved spacetimes in the framework of locally covariant field theory. We discuss some general properties of Weyl anomalies, such as their relation to the trace anomaly. We study the trace anomaly in detail for the $\phi^4$ theory, in particular determining it up to second order in the interaction. We also show that at third order in the interaction a potential $\Box \phi^2$ term can be removed by finite renormalization.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the problem of $\mathcal{F}$-harmonic forms and the long-time behavior of the Type IIA flow on certain nilpotent and solvable symplectic Lie algebras (and corresponding nilmanifolds and solvmanifolds). In particular, we demonstrate that the Type IIA flow in these cases are very useful to detect desired geometric structures including Lagrangian torus fibrations and harmonic almost complex structures.</description>

      <title>Heat kernels, intrinsic contractivity and ergodicity of discrete-time Markov chains killed by potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study discrete-time Markov chains on countably infinite state spaces, which are perturbed by rather general confining (i.e.\ growing at infinity) potentials. Using a discrete-time analogue of the classical Feynman--Kac formula, we obtain two-sided estimates for the $n$-step heat kernels $u_n(x,y)$ of the perturbed chain. These estimates are of the form $u_n(x,y)\asymp \lambda_0^n\phi_0(x)\widehat\phi_0(y)+F_n(x,y)$, where $\phi_0$ (and $\widehat\phi_0$) are the (dual) eigenfunctions for the lowest eigenvalue $\lambda_0$; the perturbation $F_n(x,y)$ is explicitly given, and it vanishes if either $x$ or $y$ is in a bounded set. The key assumptions are that the chain is uniformly lazy and that the \enquote{direct step property} (DSP) is satisfied. This means that the chain is more likely to move from state $x$ to state $y$ in a single step rather than in two or more steps. Starting from the form of the heat kernel estimate, we define the intrinsic (or ground-state transformed) chains and we introduce time-dependent ultracontractivity notions -- asymptotic and progressive intrinsic ultracontractivity -- which we can link to the growth behaviour of the confining potential; this allows us to consider arbitrarily slow growing potentials. These new notions of ultracontractivity also lead to a characterization of uniform (quasi-)ergodicity of the perturbed and the ground-state transformed Markov chains. At the end of the paper, we give various examples that illustrate how our findings relate to existing models, e.g.\ nearest-neighbour walks on infinite graphs, subordinate processes or non-reversible Markov chains.</description>

      <title>A Noise-Robust Model-Based Approach to T-Wave Amplitude Measurement and Alternans Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: T-wave alternans (TWA) is a potential marker for sudden cardiac death, but its reliable analysis is often constrained to noise-free environments, limiting its utility in real-world settings. We explore model-based T-wave estimation to mitigate the impact of noise on TWA level. Detection was performed using a previous surrogate-based method as a benchmark and a new method based on a Markov model state transition matrix (STM). These were combined with a Modified Moving Average (MMA) method and polynomial T-wave modeling to enhance noise robustness. Methods were tested across a wide range of signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), from -5 to 30 dB, and different noise types: baseline wander (BW), muscle artifacts (MA), electrode movement (EM), and respiratory modulation. Synthetic ECGs with known TWA levels were used: 0 uV for TWA-free and 30-72 uV for TWA-present signals. T-wave modeling improved estimation accuracy under noisy conditions. With EM noise at SNRs of -5 and 5 dB, mean absolute error (MAE) dropped from 62 to 49 uV and 27 to 25 uV, respectively (Mann-Whitney-U test, p &lt; 0.05) with modeling applied. Similar improvements were seen with MA noise: MAE dropped from 100 to 70 uV and 26 to 23 uV. In detection, the STM method achieved an F1-score of 0.92, outperforming the surrogate-based method (F1 = 0.81), though both struggled under EM noise at -5 dB. Importantly, beyond SNR, detection performance depended on the number of beats analyzed. These findings show that combining model-based estimation with STM detection significantly improves TWA analysis under noise, supporting its application in ambulatory and wearable ECG monitoring.</description>

      <title>A generalized fundamental solution technique for the regularized 13-moment system in rarefied gas flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the method of fundamental solutions (MFS) for solving the regularized 13-moment (R13) equations for rarefied monatomic gases. While previous applications of the MFS in rarefied gas flows relied on problem-specific fundamental solutions, we propose a generic approach that systematically computes the fundamental solutions for any linear moment system without predefined source terms. The generalized framework is first introduced using a simple example involving the Stokes equations, and is then extended to the R13 equations. The results obtained from the generic MFS are validated against an analytical solution for the R13 equations. Following validation, the framework is applied to the case of thermally-induced flow between two non-coaxial cylinders. Since no analytical solution exists for this case, we compare the results obtained from the MFS with those obtained from the finite element method (FEM). To further assess computational efficiency, we analyze the runtimes of the FEM and MFS. The results indicate that the MFS converges faster than the FEM and serves as a promising alternative to conventional meshing-based techniques.</description>

      <title>Monoidal Quantaloids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate how to add a symmetric monoidal structure to quantaloids in a compatible way. In particular, dagger compact quantaloids turn out to have properties that are similar to the category Rel of sets and binary relations. Examples of such quantaloids are the category qRel of quantum sets and binary relations, and the category V-Rel of sets and binary relations with values in a commutative unital quantale V. For both examples, the process of internalization structures is of interest. Discrete quantization, a process of generalization mathematical structures to the noncommutative setting can be regarded as the process of internalizing these structures in qRel, whereas fuzzification, the process of introducing degrees of truth or membership to concepts that are traditionally considered either true or false, can be regarded as the process of internalizing structures in V-Rel. Hence, we investigate how to internalize power sets and preordered structures in dagger compact quantaloids.</description>

      <title>Emergent random matrix universality in quantum operator dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The memory function description of quantum operator dynamics involves a carefully chosen split into 'fast' and 'slow' modes. An approximate model for the fast modes can then be used to solve for Green's functions $G(z)$ of the slow modes. One common approach is to form a Krylov operator basis $\{O_m \}_{m\ge 0}$, and then approximate the dynamics restricted to the 'fast space' $\{O_m \}_{m\ge n}$ for $n\gg 1$. Denoting the fast space Green's function by $G_n (z)$, in this work we prove that $G_n (z)$ exhibits universality in the $n \to \infty$ limit, approaching different universal scaling forms in different regions of the complex $z$-plane. This universality of $G_n (z)$ is precisely analogous to the universality of eigenvalue correlations in random matrix theory (RMT). At finite $z$, we show that $G_n (z)$ approaches the Wigner semicircle law, the same as the average bulk resolvent for the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble. When $G(z)$ is the Green's function of certain hydrodynamical variables, we show that at low frequencies $G_n (z)$ is instead governed by the Bessel universality class from RMT. As an application we give a new numerical method, the spectral bootstrap, for approximating spectral functions from Lanczos coefficients. Our proof is complex analytic in nature, involving a Riemann-Hilbert problem which we solve using a steepest-descent-type method, controlled in the $n\to\infty$ limit. This proof technique assumes some regularity conditions on the spectral function, and we comment on their possible connections to the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. We are led via steepest-descent to a related Coulomb gas ensemble, and we discuss how a recent conjecture -- the 'Operator Growth Hypothesis' -- is linked to a confinement transition in this Coulomb gas. We then explain the implications of this criticality for the computational resources required to estimate transport coefficients.</description>

      <title>Cohomology for Linearized Boundary-Value Problems on General Riemannian Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a framework for casting the solvability and uniqueness conditions of linearized geometric boundary-value problems in cohomological terms. The theory is designed to be applicable without assumptions on the underlying Riemannian structure and provides tools to study the emergent cohomology explicitly. To achieve this generality, we extend Hodge theory to sequences of Douglas--Nirenberg systems that interact via Green's formulae, overdetermined ellipticity, and a condition we call the order-reduction property, replacing the classical requirement that the sequence form a cochain complex. This property typically arises from linearized constraints and gauge equivariance, as demonstrated by several examples, including the linearized Einstein equations with sources, where the cohomology encodes geometric and topological data.</description>

      <title>Extended Cartan homotopy formula for higher Chern-Simons-Antoniadis-Savvidy theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14935v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider extended Cartan homotopy formula (ECHF) for higher gauge theory. Firstly, we construct an oriented simplex based on 2-connections and present differential and integral forms of the higher ECHF. Then, we study the higher Chern-Simons-Antoniadis-Savvidy (ChSAS) theory and prove that the higher ECHF can reproduce the higher Chern-Weil theorem and give higher triangle equation. We finally conclude from the higher ECHF that a higher transgression form can be written as the difference of two higher ChSAS forms minus an exact form.</description>

      <title>The Geometry of Fixed-Magnetization Spin Systems at Low Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03643v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spin systems are fundamental models of statistical physics that provide insight into collective behavior across scientific domains. Their interest to computer science stems in part from the deep connection between the phase transitions they exhibit and the computational complexity of sampling from the probability distributions they describe. Our focus is on the geometry of spin configurations, motivated by applications to programmable matter and computational biology. Rigorous results in this vein are scarce because the natural setting of these applications is the low-temperature, fixed-magnetization regime. Recent progress in this regime is largely limited to spin systems under which magnetization concentrates, which enables the analysis to be reduced to that of the simpler, variable-magnetization case. More complicated models, like those that arise in applications, do not share this property.
  We study the geometry of spin configurations on the triangular lattice under the Generalized Potts Model (GPM), which generalizes many fundamental models of statistical physics, including the Ising, Potts, clock, and Blume--Capel models. Moreover, it specializes to models used to program active matter to solve tasks like compression and separation, and it is closely related to the Cellular Potts Model, widely used in computational models of biological processes. Our main result shows that, under the fixed-magnetization GPM at low temperature, spins of different types are typically partitioned into regions of mostly one type, separated by boundaries that have nearly minimal perimeter. The proof uses techniques from Pirogov--Sinai theory to extend a classic Peierls argument for the fixed-magnetization Ising model, and introduces a new approach for comparing the partition functions of fixed- and variable-magnetization models.</description>

      <title>On the four-body lima\c{c}on choreography: maximal superintegrability and choreographic fragmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16403v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, as a continuation of [Fernandez-Guasti, \textit{Celest Mech Dyn Astron} 137, 4 (2025)], we demonstrate the maximal superintegrability of the reduced Hamiltonian, which governs the four-body choreographic planar motion along the lima\c{c}on trisectrix (resembling a folded figure eight), in the six-dimensional space of relative motion. The corresponding eleven integrals of motion in the Liouville-Arnold sense are presented explicitly. Specifically, it is shown that the reduced Hamiltonian admits complete separation of variables in Jacobi-like variables. The emergence of this choreography is not a direct consequence of maximal superintegrability. Rather, it originates from the existence of \textit{particular integrals} and the phenomenon of \textit{particular involution}. We also provide a detailed analysis of the fragmentation of a general four-body choreographic motion into two isomorphic two-body choreographies, as well as the reverse process, namely, the fusion of two-body choreographies into a four-body configuration. This model combines choreographic motion with maximal superintegrability, a seldom-studied interplay in classical mechanics.</description>

      <title>Complex tridiagonal quantum Hamiltonians and matrix continued fractions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16424v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum resonances described by non-Hermitian tridiagonal-matrix Hamiltonians $H$ with complex energy eigenvalues are considered. The method of evaluation of quantities $\sigma_n$ known as the singular values of $H$ is proposed. Its basic idea is that the quantities $\sigma_n$ can be treated as eigenvalues of an auxiliary self-adjoint operator $\mathbb{H}$. As long as such an operator can be given a block-tridiagonal matrix form, we finally expand its resolvent in terms of a matrix continued fraction (MCF). In an illustrative application, a discrete version of conventional Hamiltonian $H=-d^2/dx^2+V(x)$ with complex local $V(x) \neq V^*(x)$ is considered. The numerical MCF convergence is found quick, supported also by a fixed-point-based formal proof.</description>

      <title>On the Cartan-Helgason theorem for supersymmetric pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19145v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $(\mathfrak{g},\mathfrak{k})$ be a supersymmetric pair arising from a finite-dimensional, symmetrizable Kac-Moody superalgebra $\mathfrak{g}$. An important branching problem is to determine the finite-dimensional highest-weight $\mathfrak{g}$-modules which admit a $\mathfrak{k}$-coinvariant, and thus appear as functions in a corresponding supersymmetric space $\mathcal{G}/\mathcal{K}$. This is the super-analogue of the Cartan-Helgason theorem. We solve this problem via a rank one reduction and an understanding of reflections in singular roots, which generalize odd reflections in the theory of Kac-Moody superalgebras. An explicit presentation of spherical weights is provided for every pair when $\mathfrak{g}$ is indecomposable.</description>

      <title>On gamma functions with respect to the alternating Hurwitz zeta functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02854v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 2021, Hu and Kim defined a new type of gamma function $\widetilde{\Gamma}(x)$ from the alternating Hurwitz zeta function $\zeta_{E}(z,x)$, and obtained some of its properties. In this paper, we shall further investigate the function $\widetilde{\Gamma}(x)$, that is, we obtain several properties in analogy to the classical Gamma function $\Gamma(x)$, including the integral representation, the limit representation, the recursive formula, the special values, the log-convexity, the duplication and distribution formulas, and the reflection equation. Furthermore, we also prove a Lerch-type formula, which shows that the derivative of $\zeta_{E}(z,x)$ can be representative by $\widetilde\Gamma(x)$.</description>

      <title>Fusion rule in conformal field theories and topological orders: A unified view of correspondence and (fractional) supersymmetry and their relation to topological holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05178v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The algebraic or ring structure of anyons called the fusion rule, is one of the most fundamental research interests in contemporary studies on topological orders (TOs) and the corresponding conformal field theories (CFTs). Recently, the algebraic structure realized as generalized symmetry, including non-invertible and categorical symmetry, captured attention in the fields. Such non-abelian anyonic objects appear in a bulk CFT or chiral CFT (CCFT), but it has been known that the construction of a CCFT contains theoretical difficulties in general. In this work, we study the structure of the fusion rule in $Z_{N}$ symmetric chiral and bulk conformal field theories and the corresponding TOs. We propose a nontrivial expression of subalgebra structure in the fusion rule of a bulk CFT. We name this subalgebra ``bulk semion". This corresponds to the fusion rule of the CCFTs and categorical symmetry of the TOs or symmetry topological field theory (SymTFT). This gives a bulk-edge correspondence based on the symmetry analysis and corresponds to an anyon algebraic expression of topological holography in the recent literature. The recent topological holography is expected to apply to systems in general space-time dimensions. Moreover, we give a concise way of unifying duality (or fractional supersymmetry), generalized or categorical symmetry, and Lagrangian subalgebra. Our method is potentially useful to formulate and study general TOs, fundamentally only from the data of bulk CFTs or vice versa, and gives a clue in understanding CCFT (or ancillary CFT more generally).</description>

      <title>Zassenhaus decomposition of half-sided translations and generalizations in 2d conformal field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00164v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the half-sided translations associated to Rindler wedge algebras for conformal field theories in 1+1 Minkowski spacetime, generated by an unbounded operator $\mathcal{G}$, in terms of bilinear forms $G, G'$ made from entanglement Hamiltonians of the underlying algebras such that $\mathcal{G} = G+G'$. We show that despite entanglement Hamiltonians being ill-defined operators on Hilbert space, $G, G'$ can be regularized using smooth bump functions to operators $\hat{G}, \hat{G}'$ with well-defined commutators, and use them to do a centered Zassenhaus expansion of $\exp(i \mathcal{G} s)$ in terms of $\hat{G}$ and $\hat{G}'$ which is tractable and respects causality. We show that in fact half-sided translations is a special case in a large class of operators $\mathcal{O}$ for which a similar decomposition can be done by defining $\mathcal{O} = O_L+O_R$ with $O_{L}, O_{R}$ chosen approriately.</description>

      <title>New Formula for Entropy Solutions for Scalar Hyperbolic Conservation Laws with Flux Functions of Convexity Degeneracy and Global Dynamic Patterns of Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21114v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We are concerned with a new solution formula and its applications to the analysis of properties of entropy solutions of the Cauchy problem for one-dimensional scalar hyperbolic conservation laws, wherein the flux functions exhibit convexity degeneracy and the initial data are in $L^\infty$. We first introduce/validate the novel formula for entropy solutions for the Cauchy problem, which generalizes the Lax-Oleinik formula. Then, by employing this formula, we obtain a series of fine properties of entropy solutions and discover several new structures and phenomena, which include: (i) Series of results on the fine structures of entropy solutions, especially including the new criteria for all six types of initial waves for the Cauchy problem, the new structures of entropy solutions inside the backward characteristic triangle, and the new features of the formation and development of shocks such as all five types of continuous shock generation points, along with their criteria and the optimal regularities of the corresponding resulting shocks; (ii) Series of results on the global structures of entropy solutions, including the four new invariants of entropy solutions, the new criteria for the locations and speeds of divides, and the exact determination of the global structures of entropy solutions; (iii) Series of new results on the asymptotic behaviors of entropy solutions, including the asymptotic profiles and decay rates of entropy solutions for initial data in $L^\infty$, respectively in the $L^\infty$--norm and the $L^p_{{\rm loc}}$--norm. Through these results above, we obtain the global dynamic patterns of entropy solutions for scalar hyperbolic conservation laws with the flux functions satisfying (1.3) and general initial data in $L^\infty$. Moreover, the new solution formula is also extended to more general scalar hyperbolic conservation laws.</description>
