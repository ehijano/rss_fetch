      <title>The second fluctuation-dissipation theorem for the generalized Langevin equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Necessary and sufficient conditions are presented for the existence of (second order) stationary solutions of the generalized Langevin equation under appropriate assumptions on the associated memory kernel. When this stochastic equation is formulated as an initial value problem, then it is shown that the solution approaches a stationary process as time goes to infinity, whenever the fluctuating force term is taken to be a combination of a white noise process and a mean-square continuous centered stationary Gaussian process (which may be correlated with each other). The limiting process can be any centered stationary Gaussian process with sufficiently smooth spectral density. On the other hand, the solution itself is only stationary when the fluctuating force satisfies a certain fluctuation-dissipation relation, and this stationary solution is uniquely specified by its covariance.</description>

      <title>Sharp informational inequalities involving Kullback-Leibler and R\'enyi divergences and a family of scaling-invariant relative Fisher measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new transformation called \emph{relative differential-escort}, which extends the usual differential-escort transformation by relating the change of variable to a reference probability density. As an application of it, we define a biparametric family of \emph{relative Fisher measures} presenting significant advantages with respect to the pre-existing ones in the literature: invariance under scaling changes and, consequently, sharp inequalities between the new relative Fisher measure and the well established Kullback-Leibler and R\'enyi divergences. We also introduce a biparametric family of \emph{relative cumulative moment-like measures} and we establish sharp lower bounds of these new measures by the Kullback-Leibler and R\'enyi divergences. The optimal bound and the minimizing densities are given. We also construct a family of inequalities for an arbitrary and fixed minimizing density in which the so-called generalized trigonometric functions plays a central role, providing thus one more interesting application of the newly introduced inequalities and measures.</description>

      <title>Multifold degeneracy points of quantum systems and singularities of matrix varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parameter-dependent quantum systems often exhibit energy degeneracy points, whose comprehensive description naturally lead to the application of methods from singularity theory. A prime example is an electronic band structure where two energy levels coincide in a point of momentum space. It may happen, and this case is the focus of our work, that three or more levels coincide at a parameter point, called multifold degeneracy. Upon a generic perturbation, such a multifold degeneracy point is dissolved into a set of Weyl points, that is, generic two-fold degeneracy points. In this work, we provide an upper bound to the number of Weyl points born from the multifold degeneracy point. To compute this upper bound, we describe the geometric degeneracy variety in the space of complex matrices. We compute its multiplicity at certain singular points corresponding to a multifold degeneracy, and the multiplicity of holomorphic map germs with respect to this variety. Our work covers physics and mathematics aspects in detail, and attempts to bridge the two disciplines and communities. For self-containedness, we survey examples of multi-fold degeneracies in quantum systems and condensed-matter physics, as well as the established tools of local algebraic geometry that we use to identify the upper bound.</description>

      <title>Breaking the permutation character of diffeomorphisms on spinor structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of diffeomorphisms where more than one nonequivalent spinor structure is built upon a given base manifold endowed with nontrivial topology. We call attention to the fact that a relatively straightforward construction evinces a lack of symmetry between fermionic modes from different spinor bundle sections, leading to a dynamic preference breaking the permutation character of diffeomorphisms on spinor structures.</description>

      <title>Relational Quantum Dynamics (RQD): An Informational Ontology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05979v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum mechanics has transformed our understanding of reality, yet deep philosophical puzzles remain unresolved. Is there a consistent way to describe quantum measurement, the emergence of space and time, and the role of observers within one coherent ontology? This paper introduces Relational Quantum Dynamics (RQD), an interpretation that places relationships and information, not isolated objects, at the foundation of physics. Unlike traditional views, such as the Copenhagen interpretation, Everett's many-worlds theory, or hidden-variable approaches, RQD denies a single observer-independent reality, instead proposing that facts only become definite within specific observational contexts. It explicitly addresses foundational no-go results, including Bell's theorem, the Kochen-Specker theorem, and the Frauchiger-Renner paradox, by replacing absolute facts with relational, context-dependent truths. RQD rests on five interlocking principles: (1) quantum states are contextual and observer-relative, (2) time emerges from quantum interactions rather than existing as an external parameter, (3) space is constructed from patterns of quantum entanglement, (4) observers emerge as systems with highly integrated information, and (5) classical reality appears through quantum decoherence without special wavefunction collapse. Philosophically, RQD aligns with ontic structural realism, proposing that the fundamental ontology of the universe consists entirely of informational relations. It avoids collapsing into relativism or solipsism by ensuring intersubjective agreement through physical interactions. Ultimately, RQD may offer a unified picture in which quantum mechanics, spacetime, and observers are no longer separate domains but aspects of one interconnected informational web.</description>

      <title>The sphere free energy of the vector models to order $1/N$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate the large-$N$ expansion of the sphere free energy $F=-\log Z_{S^d}$ of the O(N) $\phi^4$ and the Gross-Neveu $(\bar{\psi} \psi)^2$ CFTs to order $1/N$. Analytical regularization of these theories requires consistently shifting the UV scaling dimension of the auxiliary field: this can only be done by modifying its kinetic term. This modification combines with the counterterms to give the result that matches the $\epsilon$-expansion, resolving a puzzle raised by Tarnopolsky in arXiv:1609.09113. These $F$s can be written compactly in terms of the anomalous dimensions, for both the short-range and the long-range versions of these CFTs. We also provide various technical results including a computation of the counterterms on the sphere and a neat derivation of the sphere free energy of a free conformal field. Finally, we observe that the long-range CFT becomes the short-range CFT at exactly the point where its $\tilde{F} =-\sin \tfrac{\pi d}{2} F$ is maximized as a function of the vector's scaling dimension.</description>

      <title>Quantum TBA for refined BPS indices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Refined BPS indices give rise to a quantum Riemann-Hilbert problem that is inherently related to a non-commutative deformation of moduli spaces arising in gauge and string theory compactifications. We reformulate this problem in terms of a non-commutative deformation of a TBA-like equation and obtain its formal solution as an expansion in refined indices. As an application of this construction, we derive a generating function of solutions of the TBA equation in the unrefined case.</description>

      <title>Higher symmetries, anomalies, and crossed squares in lattice gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine higher-form symmetries of quantum lattice gauge theories through the lens of homotopy theory and operator algebras. We show that in the operator-algebraic approach both higher-form symmetries and 't Hooft anomalies arise from considering restrictions of symmetry transformations to spatial regions. The data of these restrictions are naturally packaged into a higher group. For example, for gauge theories in two spatial dimensions, this information is encoded in a crossed square of groups, which is an algebraic model of a 3-group. In general, we propose that higher groups appear in lattice models and QFT as crossed n-cubes of groups via a nonabelian version of the Cech construction.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Quantum Soundness for Bipartite Compiled Bell Games via the Sequential NPA Hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Compiling Bell games under cryptographic assumptions replaces the need for physical separation, allowing nonlocality to be probed with a single untrusted device. While Kalai et al. (STOC'23) showed that this compilation preserves quantum advantages, its quantitative quantum soundness has remained an open problem. We address this gap with two primary contributions. First, we establish the first quantitative quantum soundness bounds for every bipartite compiled Bell game whose optimal quantum strategy is finite-dimensional: any polynomial-time prover's score in the compiled game is negligibly close to the game's ideal quantum value. More generally, for all bipartite games we show that the compiled score cannot significantly exceed the bounds given by a newly formalized sequential Navascu\'es-Pironio-Ac\'in (NPA) hierarchy. Second, we provide a full characterization of this sequential NPA hierarchy, establishing it as a robust numerical tool that is of independent interest. Finally, for games without finite-dimensional optimal strategies, we explore the necessity of NPA approximation error for quantitatively bounding their compiled scores, linking these considerations to the complexity conjecture $\mathrm{MIP}^{\mathrm{co}}=\mathrm{coRE}$ and open challenges such as quantum homomorphic encryption correctness for "weakly commuting" quantum registers.</description>

      <title>Exact solution of asymmetric gelation between three walks on the square lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We find and analyse the exact solution of a model of three different
  polymers with asymmetric contact interactions in two dimensions, modelling a
  scenario where there are different types of polymers involved. In particular, we find
  the generating function of three directed osculating walks in star
  configurations on the square lattice with two interaction Boltzmann weights,
  so that there is one type of contact interaction between the top pair of walks and a
  different interaction between the bottom pair of walks. These osculating
  stars are found to be the most amenable to exact solution using functional
  equation techniques in comparison to the symmetric case where three friendly
  walks in watermelon configurations were successfully solved with the same
  techniques. We elucidate the phase diagram, which has four phases, and find
  the order of all the phase transitions between them. We also calculate the
  entropic exponents in each phase.</description>

      <title>Quantum walks reveal topological flat bands, robust edge states and topological phase transitions in cyclic graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17250v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological phases, edge states, and flat bands in synthetic quantum systems are a key resource for topological quantum computing and noise-resilient information processing. We introduce a scheme based on step-dependent quantum walks on cyclic graphs, termed cyclic quantum walks (CQWs), to simulate exotic topological phenomena using discrete Fourier transforms and an effective Hamiltonian. Our approach enables the generation of both gapped and gapless topological phases, including Dirac cone-like energy dispersions, topologically nontrivial flat bands, and protected edge states, all without resorting to split-step or split-coin protocols. Odd and even-site cyclic graphs exhibit markedly different spectral characteristics, with rotationally symmetric flat bands emerging exclusively in $4n$-site graphs ($n\in \mathbf{N}$). We analytically establish the conditions for the emergence of topological, gapped flat bands and show that gap closings in rotation space imply the formation of Dirac cones in momentum space. Further, we engineer protected edge states at the interface between distinct topological phases in both odd and even cycle graphs. We numerically demonstrate that the edge states are robust against moderate static and dynamic gate disorder and remain stable against phase-preserving perturbations. This scheme serves as a resource-efficient and versatile platform for engineering topological phases, transitions, edge states, and flat bands in quantum systems, opening new avenues for fault-tolerant quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Beyond symmetry protection: Robust feedback-enforced edge states in non-Hermitian stacked quantum spin Hall systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conventional wisdom holds that strongly coupling two QSH layers yields a trivial $\mathbb{Z}_2$ phase and no protected topological edge states. We demonstrate that, in a regime with intermediate inter-layer coupling (neither in the strong or weak coupling regimes) and competitive non-Hermitian directed amplification, bulk modes are suppressed while arbitrary bulk excitations inevitably accumulate into robust helical edge transport modes - without relying on any symmetry protection. Our feedback-enforced mechanism persists over broad parameter ranges and remains robust even on fractal or irregular boundaries. These findings challenge the traditional view of stacked QSH insulators as inevitably trivial, and open up new avenues for designing helical topological devices that exploit feedback-enforced non-Hermitian engineering, instead of symmetry-enforced robustness.</description>

      <title>A Learning-based Domain Decomposition Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent developments in mechanical, aerospace, and structural engineering have driven a growing need for efficient ways to model and analyse structures at much larger and more complex scales than before. While established numerical methods like the Finite Element Method remain reliable, they often struggle with computational cost and scalability when dealing with large and geometrically intricate problems. In recent years, neural network-based methods have shown promise because of their ability to efficiently approximate nonlinear mappings. However, most existing neural approaches are still largely limited to simple domains, which makes it difficult to apply to real-world PDEs involving complex geometries. In this paper, we propose a learning-based domain decomposition method (L-DDM) that addresses this gap. Our approach uses a single, pre-trained neural operator-originally trained on simple domains-as a surrogate model within a domain decomposition scheme, allowing us to tackle large and complicated domains efficiently. We provide a general theoretical result on the existence of neural operator approximations in the context of domain decomposition solution of abstract PDEs. We then demonstrate our method by accurately approximating solutions to elliptic PDEs with discontinuous microstructures in complex geometries, using a physics-pretrained neural operator (PPNO). Our results show that this approach not only outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on these challenging problems, but also offers resolution-invariance and strong generalization to microstructural patterns unseen during training.</description>

      <title>Impacts of Intrinsic Noise and Quantum Entanglement on the Geometric and Dynamical Properties of the XXZ Heisenberg Interacting Spin Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how intrinsic decoherence affects the interplay between geometry, dynamics, and entanglement in quantum systems is a central challenge in quantum information science. In this work, we develop a unified framework that explores this interplay for a pair of interacting spins governed by an XXZ-type Heisenberg model under an external magnetic field and intrinsic decoherence. We quantify entanglement using the concurrence measure and examine its evolution under decoherence, revealing that intrinsic noise rapidly suppresses entanglement as it increases. We then analyze the Hilbert-Schmidt and Bures distances between quantum states and show how both the degree of entanglement and the noise rate modulate these distances and their associated quantum speeds. Importantly, we demonstrate that the Hilbert Schmidt speed is more responsive to entanglement and coherence loss than the Bures speed, making it a powerful tool for probing the geometry of quantum dynamics. Moreover, we solve the quantum brachistochrone problem in the presence of intrinsic decoherence, identifying the minimal evolution time and the corresponding optimal entangled states. Finally, we explore the geometric phase accumulated during the system's evolution. Our results show that decoherence hinders geometric phase accumulation, while entanglement counteracts this effect, enhancing phase stability.</description>

      <title>Exact results for active particle models: from long-range interactions to first-passage properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The goal of this thesis is to obtain new exact results for models of active particles in one dimension, focusing on two different aspects: their behavior in the presence of long-range interactions and their first-passage properties. In the first part we give an overview of existing exact results both for active particle models and for Brownian particles with long-range interactions (Riesz gases). The next two parts focus on how methods from these two fields can be combined and extended to derive new results for models of active particles with long-range interactions. In part two, we study the density of particles in the stationary state, in the limit where the number of particles is very large, using an extension of the Dean-Kawasaki equation to run-and-tumble particles (RTPs). In the case of the 1D Coulomb interaction (attractive or repulsive), we obtain exact expressions for the stationary density for different types of confining potentials, which sheds lights on new non-equilibrium phase-transitions. Some results are also obtained for a repulsive 2D Coulomb interaction (log-gas), although the single-file constraint makes the study more difficult in this case. In part three, we focus on the fluctuations at the tagged particle level. In the limit of weak noise, we compute exactly and analyze in different regimes a variety of correlation functions of the particle positions and interparticle distances, both for the Brownian Riesz gas and for its active counterpart, and show that the activity plays an important role both at short times and at small distances. The last part of this thesis focuses on Siegmund duality, which connects the first-passage properties of a stochastic process with absorbing boundaries to its spatial distribution with hard walls. We extend this duality to a new class of stochastic processes, which includes active particles and diffusing diffusivity models.</description>

      <title>Exterior Cyclic Polytopes and Convexity of Amplituhedra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The amplituhedron is a semialgebraic set in the Grassmannian. We study convexity and duality of amplituhedra. We introduce a notion of convexity, called \textit{extendable convexity}, for real semialgebraic sets in any embedded projective variety. We show that the $k=m=2$ amplituhedron is extendably convex in the Grassmannian of lines in projective three-space. In the process we introduce a new polytope called the \emph{exterior cyclic polytope}, generalizing the cyclic polytope. It is equal to the convex hull of the amplituhedron in the Pl\"ucker embedding. We undertake a combinatorial analysis of the exterior cyclic polytope, its facets, and its dual. Finally, we introduce the \textit{(extendable) dual amplituhedron}, which is closely related to the dual of the exterior cyclic polytope. We show that the dual amplituhedron for $k=m=2$ is again an amplituhedron, where the external matrix data is changed by the twist map.</description>

      <title>Bivariate multiple orthogonal polynomials of mixed type on the step-line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article studies bivariate multiple orthogonal polynomials of the mixed type on the step-line. The analysis is based on the LU factorization of a moment matrix specifically adapted to this framework. The orthogonality and biorthogonality relations satisfied by these polynomials are identified, and their precise multi-degrees are determined. The corresponding recurrence relations and the growing band matrices that encode them are also derived. Christoffel-Darboux kernels and the associated Christoffel-Darboux-type formulas are obtained. An ABC-type theorem is established, relating the inverse of the truncated moment matrix to these kernels.</description>

      <title>Scaling Properties of Current Fluctuations in Periodic TASEP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate current fluctuations in the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP) on a ring of size $N$ with $p$ particles. By deforming the Markov generator with a parameter $\gamma$, we analyze the tilted operator governing current statistics using coordinate Bethe ansatz techniques. We derive implicit expressions for the scaled cumulant generating function (SCGF), i.e. the largest eigenvalue, and the spectral gap in terms of Bethe roots, exploiting the geometric structure of Cassini ovals.
  In the thermodynamic limit, at fixed particle density, a dynamical phase transition emerges between regimes distinguished by the sign of $\gamma$. For positive deformation $\gamma$, the SCGF exhibits ballistic scaling, growing linearly with system size $N$. For negative $\gamma$, the SCGF converges to a universal constant, highlighting distinct fluctuation regimes.
  Correspondingly, the spectral gap, controlling relaxation times, shows qualitatively different finite-size scaling: it closes as $O(N^{-1})$ for $\gamma&gt;0$ reflecting slow relaxation, but it decreases exponentially for $\gamma&lt;0$ indicating rapid convergence. These results provide insight into the metastability and relaxation dynamics in driven interacting particle systems.</description>

      <title>Deformation Quantization with Separation of Variables of $G_{2,4}(\mathbb{C})$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00500v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a deformation quantization with separation of variables of the Grassmannian $G_{2,4}(\mathbb{C})$. A star product on $G_{2,4}(\mathbb{C})$ can be explicitly determined as the solution of the recurrence relations for $G_{2,4}(\mathbb{C})$ given by Hara and one of the authors (A. Sako). To provide the solution to the recurrence relations, it is necessary to solve a system of linear equations in each order. However, to give a concrete expression of the general term is not simple because the variables increase with the order of the differentiation of the star product. For this reason, there has been no formula to express the general term of the recurrence relations. In this paper, we overcome this problem by transforming the recurrence relations into simpler ones. We solve the recurrence relations using creation and annihilation operators on a Fock space. From this solution, we obtain an explicit formula of a star product with separation of variables on $G_{2,4}(\mathbb{C})$.</description>

      <title>First order operators on shrinking graph-like spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19904v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we discuss the convergence of first order operators on a thickened graph (a graph-like space) towards a similar operator on the underlying metric graph. On the graph-like space, the first order operator is of the form exterior derivative (the gradient) on functions and its adjoint (the negative divergence) on closed 1-forms (irrotational vector fields). Under the assumption that each cross section of the tubular edge neighbourhood is convex, that each vertex neighbourhood is simply connected and under suitable uniformity assumptions (which hold in particular, if the spaces are compact) we establish generalised norm resolvent convergence of the first order operator on the graph-like space towards the one on the metric graph. The square of the first order operator is of Laplace type; on the metric graph, the function (0-form) component is the usual standard (Kirchhoff) Laplacian. A key ingredient in the proof is a uniform Gaffney estimate: such an estimate follows from an equality relating here the divergence operator with all (weak) partial derivatives and a curvature term, together with a (localised) Sobolev trace estimate.</description>

Abstract: We consider the theory of spinor fields written in polar form and we re-express it in terms of the so-called 1+1+2 covariant splitting: after this is done for the basic kinematic variables, we proceed to decompose the dynamical equations, both for the case of the Dirac differential field equations and for the case of the energy density tensor. As an explicit example of a real physical application we deal with the hydrogen atom. Comments are addressed in the end.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11715v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The theory of Jacobi-Haantjes manifolds is proposed as a natural geometric framework useful to state the integrability of both conservative and dissipative Hamiltonian systems in a unified way. As a reduction, new structures such as contact-Haantjes and locally conformal symplectic-Haantjes manifolds are investigated. The main properties of these novel classes of manifolds and their mutual relationship are discussed. It is shown that the notion of Haantjes chains, within the framework of Jacobi geometry, is related to the existence of complete integrable contact Hamiltonian systems, encompassing also dissipative cases, as well as to the integrability of Hamiltonian systems on appropriate invariant submanifolds. Our framework naturally generalizes the formulation of integrable conservative Hamiltonian systems through the theory of symplectic-Haantjes (or {\omega}H) manifolds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2201.09475v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a construction of the Coulomb branch of a $3d\ {\mathcal N}=4$ gauge theory corresponding to a choice of a connected reductive group $G$ and a symplectic finite-dimensional reprsentation $\mathbf M$ of $G$, satisfying certain anomaly cancellation condition. This extends the construction of arXiv:1601.03586 (where it was assumed that ${\mathbf M}={\mathbf N}\oplus{\mathbf N}^*$ for some representation $\mathbf N$ of $G$). Our construction goes through certain "universal" ring object in the twisted derived Satake category of the symplectic group $Sp(2n)$. The construction of this object uses a categorical version of the Weil representation; we also compute the image of this object under the (twisted) derived Satake equivalence and show that it can be obtained from the theta-sheaf introduced by S.Lysenko on $\operatorname{Bun}_{Sp(2n)}({\mathbb P}^1)$ via certain Radon transform. We also discuss applications of our construction to a potential mathematical construction of $S$-duality for super-symmetric boundary conditions in 4-dimensional gauge theory and to (some extension of) the conjectures of D.Ben-Zvi, Y.Sakellaridis and A.Venkatesh.</description>

      <title>Lower bounds for bulk deviations for the simple random walk on $\mathbb{Z}^d$, $d\geq 3$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17074v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article investigates the behavior of the continuous-time simple random walk on $\mathbb{Z}^d$, $d \geq 3$. We derive an asymptotic lower bound on the principal exponential rate of decay for the probability that the average value over a large box of some non-decreasing local function of the field of occupation times of the walk exceeds a given positive value. This bound matches at leading order the corresponding upper bound derived by Sznitman in arXiv:1906.05809, and is given in terms of a certain constrained minimum of the Dirichlet energy of functions on $\mathbb{R}^d$ decaying at infinity. Our proof utilizes a version of tilted random walks, a model originally constructed by Li in arXiv:1412.3959 to derive lower bounds on the probability of the event that the trace of a simple random walk disconnects a macroscopic set from an enclosing box.</description>

Abstract: Lattices with minimal normalized second moments are designed using a new numerical optimization algorithm. Starting from a random lower-triangular generator matrix and applying stochastic gradient descent, all elements are updated towards the negative gradient, which makes it the most efficient algorithm proposed so far for this purpose. A graphical illustration of the theta series, called theta image, is introduced and shown to be a powerful tool for converting numerical lattice representations into their underlying exact forms. As a proof of concept, optimized lattices are designed in dimensions up to 16. In all dimensions, the algorithm converges to either the previously best known lattice or a better one. The dual of the 15-dimensional laminated lattice is conjectured to be optimal in its dimension and its exact normalized second moment is computed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05102v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider finite-dimensional many-body quantum systems described by time-independent Hamiltonians and Markovian master equations, and present a systematic method for constructing smaller-dimensional, reduced models that exactly reproduce the time evolution of a set of initial conditions or observables of interest. Our approach exploits Krylov operator spaces and their extension to operator algebras, and may be used to obtain reduced linear models of minimal dimension, well-suited for simulation on classical computers, or reduced quantum models that preserve the structural constraints of physically admissible quantum dynamics, as required for simulation on quantum computers. Notably, we prove that the reduced quantum-dynamical generator is still in Lindblad form. By introducing a new type of observable-dependent symmetries, we show that our method provides a non-trivial generalization of techniques that leverage symmetries, unlocking new reduction opportunities. We quantitatively benchmark our method on paradigmatic open many-body systems of relevance to condensed-matter and quantum-information physics. In particular, we demonstrate how our reduced models can quantitatively describe decoherence dynamics in central-spin systems coupled to structured environments, magnetization transport in boundary-driven dissipative spin chains, and unwanted error dynamics on information encoded in a noiseless quantum code.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05077v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In many quantum field theories (such as higher-dimensional holomorphic field theories or raviolo theories), operator product expansions of local operators can have as coefficients not only ordinary functions but also 'derived' functions with nonzero ghost number, which are certain elements of sheaf cohomology. We analyse the 'derived' functions that should appear in operator product expansions for a quantum field theory with an arbitrary number of topological, holomorphic and/or ordinary spacetime dimensions and identify necessary and sufficient conditions for such 'derived' functions to appear. In particular, theories with one topological spacetime dimension and multiple ordinary spacetime dimensions provide a smooth analogue of the (holomorphic) raviolo.</description>

      <title>Distance-based measures and Epsilon-measures for measurement-based quantum resources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11331v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum resource theories provide a structured and elegant framework for quantifying quantum resources. While state-based resource theories have been extensively studied, their measurement-based resource theories remain relatively underexplored. In practical scenarios where a quantum state or a set of measurements is only partially known, conventional resource measures often fall short in capturing the resource content. In such cases, \epsilon-measures offer a robust alternative, making them particularly valuable. In this work, we investigate the quantification of measurement-based resources using distance-based measures, followed by a detailed analysis of the mathematical properties of \epsilon-measures. We also extend our analysis by exploring the connections between \epsilon-measures and some key quantities relevant to resource manipulation tasks. Importantly, the analysis of resources based on sets of measurements are tedious compared to that of single measurements as the former allows more general transformations such as controlled implementation. Yet our framework applies not only to resources associated with individual measurements but also to those arising from sets of measurements. In short, our analysis is applicable to existing resource theories of measurements and has the potential to be useful for all resource theories of measurements that are yet to be developed.</description>

      <title>Smooth Solutions of the Navier-Stokes Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13816v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Smooth solutions of the Navier-Stokes equation with smooth but otherwise unconstrained initial conditions are constructed, to solve the Millennium fluids problem in the positive. The smooth solutions are the mean values of general weak solutions and are alternately characterized as the entropy production minimizing solutions. The construction occurs in a finite periodic cube.</description>

      <title>Maximum entropy principle for quantum processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.24079v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The maximum entropy principle, as applied to quantum systems, is a fundamental prescript positing that for a quantum system for which we only have partial knowledge, the maximum entropy state consistent with the partial knowledge is a valuable choice as the system's state. An intriguing result is that in case the only prior knowledge is of a fixed mean energy, the maximum entropy state turns out to be the thermal state, a ubiquitous state in several arenas, especially in statistical mechanics. We extend the consequences of this principle from static quantum states to dynamic quantum processes. We establish that a quantum channel attains maximal entropy under a fixed mean energy constraint if and only if it is an absolutely thermalizing channel whose fixed output is the thermal state of the same mean energy. This provides an alternative approach for understanding the emergence of absolute thermalization processes within the observable part of the universe under physically natural energy constraints. Our results have potential implications for understanding the informational and thermodynamic utility of quantum channels under physical constraints. As an application, we examine the consequences for private randomness distillation from energy-constrained quantum processes.</description>

      <title>Optimal Calibration of Qubit Detuning and Crosstalk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10661v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Characterizing and calibrating physical qubits is essential for maintaining the performance of quantum processors. A key challenge in this process is the presence of crosstalk that complicates the estimation of individual qubit detunings. In this work, we derive optimal strategies for estimating detuning and crosstalk parameters by optimizing Ramsey interference experiments using Fisher information and the Cramer-Rao bound. We compare several calibration protocols, including measurements of a single quadrature at multiple times and of two quadratures at a single time, for a fixed number of total measurements. Our results predict that the latter approach yields the highest precision and robustness in both cases of isolated and coupled qubits. We validate experimentally our approach using a single NV center as well as superconducting transmons. Our approach enables accurate parameter extraction with significantly fewer measurements, resulting in up to a 50% reduction in calibration time while maintaining estimation accuracy.</description>
