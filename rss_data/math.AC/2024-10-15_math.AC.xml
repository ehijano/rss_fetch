      <title>On maximal common divisors in Puiseux monoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a commutative monoid. An element $d \in M$ is called a maximal common divisor of a nonempty subset $S$ of $M$ if $d$ is a common divisor of $S$ in $M$ and the only common divisors in $M$ of the set $\big\{ \frac{s}d : s \in S \big\}$ are the units of $M$. In this paper, we investigate the existence of maximal common divisors in rank-$1$ torsion-free commutative monoids, also known as Puiseux monoids. We also establish some connections between the existence of maximal common divisors and both atomicity and the ascending chain condition on principal ideals for the monoids we investigate here.</description>

      <title>Strong Purity and Phantom Morphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $R$ be a commutative ring and $S \subseteq R$ be a multiplicative subset. We introduce and study the concept of $S$-purity based on the notion of $S$-strongly flat modules. The class of $S$-pure injective modules will be studied. We demonstrate that this class is enveloping and explore its closedness under extension. The concept of purity is closely connected to the existence of phantom maps. So we will delve into the study of the $S$-phantom morphisms. We will establish that the $S$-phantom ideal is a precovering ideal and examine the situations where it becomes a covering ideal. Finally, in the last section, we will investigate an ideal version of the `Optimistic Conjecture', raised by Positselski and Sl\'{a}vik.</description>

      <title>Definable henselian valuations on dp-minimal real fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give an explicit algebraic characterisation of all definable henselian valuations on a dp-minimal real field. Additionally we characterise all dp-minimal real fields that admit a definable henselian valuation with real closed residue field. We do so by first proving this for the more general setting of almost real closed fields.</description>

      <title>Cartwright-Sturmfels Hilbert Schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let S be the Cox ring of a product of r projective spaces. In this paper, we study the Cartwright-Sturmfels Hilbert schemes of S, which are multigraded Hilbert schemes that only parametrize radical ideals. Our main result shows that these Hilbert schemes are always smooth and irreducible if the Picard rank r is at most 2. This result can be seen as a multigraded analogue of the famous theorems of Fogarty and Maclagan-Smith, where the Picard rank replaces the dimension of the ambient space.</description>

      <title>Hyperplane Arrangements Satisfy (un)Twisted Logarithmic Comparison Theorems, Applications to $\mathscr{D}_{X}$-modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.01462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.01462v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a reduced hyperplane arrangement we prove the analytic Twisted Logarithmic Comparison Theorem, subject to mild combinatorial arithmetic conditions on the weights defining the twist. This gives a quasi-isomorphism between the twisted logarithmic de Rham complex and the twisted meromorphic de Rham complex. The latter computes the cohomology of the arrangement's complement with coefficients from the corresponding rank one local system. We also prove the algebraic variant (when the arrangement is central), and the analytic and algebraic (untwisted) Logarithmic Comparison Theorems. The last item positively resolves an old conjecture of Terao. We also prove that: every nontrivial rank one local system on the complement can be computed via these Twisted Logarithmic Comparison Theorems; these computations are explicit finite dimensional linear algebra. Finally, we give some $\mathscr{D}_{X}$-module applications: for example, we give a sharp restriction on the codimension one components of the multivariate Bernstein--Sato ideal attached to an arbitrary factorization of an arrangement. The bound corresponds to (and, in the univariate case, gives an independent proof of) M. Saito's result that the roots of the Bernstein--Sato polynomial of a non-smooth, central, reduced arrangement live in $(-2 + 1/d, 0).$</description>

      <title>Enhanced Auslander-Reiten duality and Morita theorem for singularity categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.14090v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a Morita theorem to construct triangle equivalences between the singularity categories of (commutative and non-commutative) Gorenstein rings and the cluster categories of finite dimensional algebras over fields, and more strongly, quasi-equivalences between their canonical dg enhancements. More precisely, we prove that such an equivalence exists as soon as we find a quasi-equivalence between the graded dg singularity category of a Gorenstein ring and the derived category of a finite dimensional algebra which can be done by finding a single tilting object.
  Our result is based on two key theorems on dg enhancements of cluster categories and of singularity categories, which are of independent interest. First we give a Morita-type theorem which realizes certain $\mathbb{Z}$-graded dg categories as dg orbit categories. Secondly, we show that the canonical dg enhancements of the singularity categories of symmetric orders have the bimodule Calabi-Yau property, which lifts the classical Auslander-Reiten duality on singularity categories.
  We apply our results to such classes of rings as Gorenstein rings of dimension at most $1$, quotient singularities, and Geigle-Lenzing complete intersections, including finite or infinite Grassmannian cluster categories, to realize their singularity categories as cluster categories of finite dimensional algebras.</description>
