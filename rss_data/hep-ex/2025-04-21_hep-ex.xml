      <title>Hunting for a 17 MeV particle coupled to electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss a set of precision observables that can probe the existence of a light particle $X$ coupled to electrons in the mass range of 1--100 MeV. As a case study, we consider the recent excess of $e^+e^-$ final-state events at $\sqrt{s} = 16.9$ MeV reported by the PADME collaboration. Interestingly, this mass is tantalizingly close to the invariant mass at which anomalous $e^+e^-$ pair production has previously been observed in nuclear transitions from excited to ground states by the ATOMKI collaboration. For the scenario in which the new particle has a vector coupling to electrons, we show that the PADME excess is already in tension with constraints from the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron and the non-observation of the exotic pion and muon decays $\pi^+\to e^+ \nu X$ and $\mu^+ \to e^+ \bar\nu_\mu\nu_e X$ at the SINDRUM experiment. Further improvements in the measurement of the electron $g$-2, together with upcoming results from the Mu3e and PIONEER experiments, are expected to definitively probe this scenario in the near future. We also explore alternative possibilities where the new particle has scalar, pseudoscalar, or axial-vector couplings.</description>

      <title>Unbinned Inference with Correlated Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern machine learning has enabled parameter inference from event-level data without the need to first summarize all events with a histogram. All of these unbinned inference methods make use of the fact that the events are statistically independent so that the log likelihood is a sum over events. However, this assumption is not valid for unbinned inference on unfolded data, where the deconvolution process induces a correlation between events. We explore the impact of event correlations on downstream inference tasks in the context of the OmniFold unbinned unfolding method. We find that uncertainties may be significantly underestimated when event correlations are excluded from uncertainty quantification.</description>

      <title>Updated analysis of charmonium states in a relativized quark potential model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent experimental observations of charmonium(-like) states, we investigate their interpretation as conventional charmonium states within the framework of relativized quark potential model. We find a consistent description of the updated masses of charmonia, bottomonia and some selected charmed mesons, then systematically compute open-charm strong decay widths and electromagnetic transition widths for radially excited charmonium states up to $n=5$. The numerical results show significantly improved agreement with experimental masses and widths. Notably, the newly-observed $\chi_{c1}(4010)$ and $\chi_{c1}(4274)$ are tentatively associated with the $\chi_{c1}(2P)$ and $\chi_{c1}(3P)$ respectively, while the $\chi_{c0}(4500)$ and $\chi_{c0}(4700)$ are interpreted as the $\chi_{c0}(4P)$ and $\chi_{c0}(5P)$ states. For the controversial $\chi_{c1}(3872)$ state, we suggest its potential connection to $\chi_{c1}(4010)$, as a two-pole structure due to the $\chi_{c1}(2P)$ coupling to $D\bar{D}$ channels. Intriguingly, the predicted mass of $\chi_{c0}(2P)$ is about 3851 MeV, diverging from the original estimate of 3916 MeV in the Godfrey and Isgur's work but consistent with non-relativistic potential model predictions. This calculation might provide more insight to the future experimental investigation of charmonium(-like) states.</description>

      <title>Identifying triple-strangeness $\Omega$ hyperons in light of recent experimental results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we systematically calculate the mass spectra and decay widths of $\Omega$ baryons with $N\leq3$. In our scheme, the newly observed $\Omega(2109)$ is identified as a $N=2$ candidate, with its quantum numbers tentatively assigned as $\Omega(2S,3/2^+)$. However, the experimentally measured mass exhibits a deviation of approximately 50 MeV below the theoretical predictions. The possible reason for this deviation, along with the suggestion for experiments, are discussed in this paper. Additionally, we give possible assignments of $\Omega(2012)^-$, $\Omega(2250)^-$, $\Omega(2380)^-$, and $\Omega(2470)^-$. Furthermore, we calculate the masses and widths of other missing $\Omega$ states, which could provide valuable clues for experimental searches aimed at discovering these states.</description>

      <title>The quest for the quark-gluon plasma from the perspective of dynamical models of relativistic heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The physics of heavy-ion collisions is one of the most exciting and challenging directions of science for the last four decades. On the theoretical side one deals with a non-abelian field theory, while on the experimental side today's largest accelerators are needed to enable these studies. The discovery of a new stage of matter - called the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) - and the study of its properties is one of the major achievements of modern physics. In this contribution we briefly review the history of theoretical descriptions of heavy-ion collisions based on dynamical models, focusing on the personal experiences in this inspiring field.</description>

      <title>Haloscope Searching for Dark Photons at Q-band with a Novel Coupling Tuning Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Laboratory searching for dark matter is crucial for understanding several fundamental conundrums in physics and cosmology. Most cavity-based haloscope searches focus on the frequency range below 10 GHz, while the parameter space with higher frequency remains rarely explored, due to the challenges lying in the fabrication of microwave cavities. Here we report the first Q-band haloscope searching for dark photons with a 33.141 GHz cavity. A novel coupling tuning structure separated from the cavity was designed so as not to degrade the quality factor of the cavity. We have established the most stringent constraints $\chi&lt;2.5\times10^{-12}$ at a confidence level of 90$\%$ in the frequency range from 33.139 GHz to 33.143 GHz, corresponding to the mass of dark photons ranging from 137.05 $\mu$eV to 137.07 $\mu$eV. The results surpass the previous astronomical constraints by nearly three orders of magnitude. This work has demonstrated the feasibility of dark matter haloscopes at Q band. In the future, the constraints can be further improved by more than one order of magnitude through low-temperature experiments, and the setup can be extended to search for axions, axion-like particles, and high-frequency gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>Identify hadron anomalous couplings at colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the identification of the Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) Lagrangian at colliders such as BESIII and the Super-$\tau$-Charm Facility. Our analysis concentrates on the radiative decays of $\eta$ and $\eta'$ mesons, including $\eta^{(\prime)} \to \gamma\gamma$, $\eta^{(\prime)} \to \gamma\ell^+ \ell^-$, $\eta^{(\prime)} \to \pi^+\pi^-\gamma$, and $\eta^{(\prime)} \to \pi^+\pi^-\ell^+\ell^-$, as well as semileptonic kaon decays such as $K^+ \to \pi^+\pi^- e^+ \nu_e$. Employing the hidden local symmetry framework to incorporate vector meson contributions, we compute the decay amplitudes and form factors. For the decay $\eta \to \pi^+\pi^-\gamma$, the box anomaly dominates, and we find that the anomalous coupling can be experimentally determined to percent-level precision at BESIII. In contrast, vector meson contributions are significant in the decay $\eta' \to \pi^+\pi^-\gamma$. Using experimental data for $\eta' \to \pi^+\pi^-\gamma$, we obtain ${\cal B}_{\mathrm{box}}^{\text{exp}} = (1.70 \pm 0.05)\%$, which is approximately ten times larger than previously expected experimentally. We observe good agreement between our calculated anomalous couplings and experimental results. In kaon decays, WZW terms uniquely contribute to the form factor $H$, which can be extracted from parity-conserving decay distributions. While predictions at the chiral point closely match experimental values (e.g., $H^+ = -2.31$ versus $-2.27 \pm 0.10$), we find that intermediate vector meson states introduce substantial corrections, potentially as large as 25%. We strongly advocate for revisiting these experiments to achieve improved precision in form factor extractions.</description>

      <title>New horizon in particle physics: First observation of CP violation in baryon decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, the LHCb Collaboration achieved the observation of CP violation (CPV) in baryon decays through the process of $\Lambda_b^0\to pK^-\pi^+\pi^-$, reporting an asymmetry of $(2.45\pm0.46\pm0.10)\%$ with a significance of 5.2$\sigma$. This marks a breakthrough and a milestone in particle physics, six decades after the first observation of CPV in mesons. It will be helpful to understand the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe. In addition to the global CPV, local CPV is also observed by LHCb in the low mass region of $m_{p\pi^+\pi^-}&lt;2.7$GeV as $(5.4\pm0.9\pm0.1)\%$ with a significance of 6.0$\sigma$. Intriguingly, this measurement aligns well with a theoretical prediction of $(5.6-5.9)\%$ based on a CPV dynamics using the data of $N\pi\to p\pi^+\pi^-$ scatterings. Since baryons contain one more quark than mesons, the dynamics of baryon decays are significantly different from those of mesons. Therefore, the first observation of baryon CPV by LHCb opens a new horizon in the studies of dynamics of the strong interaction.</description>

      <title>Semileptonic and nonleptonic $\bar{B}_{s}\to D_{sJ}$ decays in covariant light-front approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the $\bar{B}_{s}\to D_{sJ}$ transitions in covariant light-front approach, where $D_{sJ}$ denotes an s-wave or p-wave $c\bar{s}$ meson state. We first obtain the transition form factors within the framework of the quark model, and then apply the obtained form factors to obtain the branching fractions of semileptonic and nonleptonic decays. We also compare our results with experimental data and other theoretical predictions. We find that some branching fractions are sizable and might be accessible at the LHC and future $e^{+}$-$e^{-}$ colliders. Our work is expected to be of great value for establishing corresponding decay channels, and also be helpful in understanding the non-perturbative QCD dynamics.</description>

      <title>Atmospheric muon flux suppression at potential new low-radiation underground physics laboratory in Israel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The residual atmospheric muon flux was measured at a candidate site for a new underground, low-radiation physics laboratory beneath the Kokhav HaYarden national park in Israel. Located inside the tunnels of a hydroelectric pumped-storage facility operating since 2024, the proposed site benefits from a vertical rock overburden of 361 meters, large potential floorspace, and easy access by road. A muon hodoscope of vertically stacked wide-area $144 \times 60 \times 1.2 $ cm$^3$ plastic scintillator plates was employed to measure the suppression in the integrated muon flux at the site as compared with above ground at sea level. Data-taking took place in mid-August of 2024 for several days and was split into South-North and West-East orientations to account for the directional acceptances due to the geometry of the detector. The suppression factor is reported at $4456 \pm 77$, expressed as $3.75 \pm 0.06 \times 10^{-6}$ cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ in absolute terms, corresponding to an effective overburden of roughly $873$ m.w.e.. A deeper location at the site may also be available, but it could not be reached at this time. Furthermore, the asymmetric topography of the mountain above and its muon shadow are clearly visible in the angular data. Finally, auxiliary environmental measurements recorded low background radon activity at $28.3 \pm 14.0$ Bq m$^{-3}$. The experimental campaign thus succeeded in demonstrating the viability of the site's working conditions for future scientific research.</description>

      <title>First-principle event reconstruction by time-charge readouts for the Taishan Antineutrino Observatory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01239v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Taishan Antineutrino Observatory (TAO) is a liquid-scintillator satellite experiment of the Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO) to measure the reference reactor neutrino spectrum with unprecented energy resolution. We use inhomogeous Poisson process and Tweedie generalized linear model (GLM) to characterize the detector response and the charge distribution of a SiPM. We develop a pure probabilistic model for time and charge of SiPMs from first principles to reconstruct point-like events in the TAO central detector. Thanks to our precise model and the high photo-coverage and quantum efficiency of the SiPM tiles at TAO, we achieve vertex position resolution better than 20mm, energy resolution of about 2% at 1MeV and &lt;0.5% non-uniformity, marking the world's best performance of liquid scintillator detectors. With such resolution, we perceive MeV events to exhibit track effects. It opens up an exciting possibility of computed tracking calorimeter for unsegmented liquid scintillator detector like TAO. Our methodology is applicable to other experiments that utilize PMTs for time and charge readouts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10674v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The large amount of data recorded with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider, corresponding to 140 fb$^{-1}$ of $pp$ collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV, has brought our knowledge of the top quark to a higher level. The measurement of the top-antitop quark pair-production cross-section has reached a precision of 1.8$\% $ and the cross-section was measured differentially up to several TeV in multiple observables including the top-quark transverse momentum and top-quark-pair invariant mass. Single-top-quark production was studied in all production modes. Rare production processes where the top quark is associated with a vector boson, and four-top-quark production, have become accessible and cross-section measurements for several of these processes have reached uncertainties of around 10$\% $ or smaller. Innovative measurements of the top-quark mass and properties have also emerged, including the observation of quantum entanglement in the top-quark sector and tests of lepton-flavour universality using top-quark decays. Searches for flavour-changing neutral currents in the top-quark sector have been significantly improved, reaching branching-ratio exclusion limits ranging from $10^{-3}$ to $10^{-5}$. Many of these analyses have been used to set limits on Wilson coefficients within the effective field theory framework.</description>

      <title>Search for rare decays of the Z and Higgs bosons to a J/$\psi$ or $\psi$(2S) meson and a photon in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15000v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A search is presented for rare decays of the Z and Higgs bosons to a photon and a J/$\psi$ or a $\psi$(2S) meson, with the charmonium state subsequentially decaying to a pair of muons. The data set corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 123 fb$^{-1}$ of proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV collected with the CMS detector at the LHC. No evidence for branching fractions of these rare decay channels larger than predicted in the standard model is observed. Upper limits at 95% confidence level are set: $\mathcal{B}$(H $\to$ J/$\psi \gamma$) $\lt$ 2.6 $\times$ 10$^{-4}$, $\mathcal{B}$(H $\to$ $\psi$(2S)$\gamma$) $\lt$ 9.9 $\times$ 10$^{-4}$, $\mathcal{B}$(Z $\to$ J/$\psi \gamma$) $\lt$ 0.6 $\times$ 10$^{-6}$, and $\mathcal{B}$(Z $\to$ $\psi$(2S)$\gamma$) $\lt$ 1.3 $\times$ 10$^{-6}$. The ratio of the Higgs boson coupling modifiers $\kappa_\mathrm{c} / \kappa_\gamma$ is constrained to be in the interval ($-$157, $+$199) at 95% confidence level. Assuming $\kappa_\gamma = 1$, this interval becomes ($-$166, $+$208).</description>

      <title>Identification of low-momentum muons in the CMS detector using multivariate techniques in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13.6 TeV</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17590v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: "Soft" muons with a transverse momentum below 10 GeV are featured in many processes studied by the CMS experiment, such as decays of heavy-flavor hadrons or rare tau lepton decays. Maximizing the selection efficiency for these muons, while simultaneously suppressing backgrounds from long-lived light-flavor hadron decays, is therefore important for the success of the CMS physics program. Multivariate techniques have been shown to deliver better muon identification performance than traditional selection techniques. To take full advantage of the large data set currently being collected during Run 3 of the CERN LHC, a new multivariate classifier based on a gradient-boosted decision tree has been developed. It offers a significantly improved separation of signal and background muons compared to a similar classifier used for the analysis of the Run 2 data. The performance of the new classifier is evaluated on a data set collected with the CMS detector in 2022 and 2023, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 62 fb$^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of the upgraded 3-inch Hamamatsu photomultiplier for the KM3NeT Neutrino Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02989v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The 3-inch Hamamatsu R14374-02 photomultiplier tube is an improved version of the R12199-02 model and its successor in the construction of the KM3NeT neutrino telescope. A total of 1000 photomultipliers were analysed to assess their dark count rate, transit time spread, and spurious pulses. A subset of 200 photomultipliers were further evaluated to determine their quantum efficiency which is an essential parameter for Monte Carlo simulations of the detector response. The measurements show that R14374-02 model has better quantum efficiency homogeneity over the photocatode and better time properties than the R12199-02.</description>

      <title>Applicability of Hydrodynamics in Hadronic Phase of Heavy-Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.14792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.14792v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The hadronic phase and its dynamics in relativistic heavy-ion collisions are topics of immense discussion. The hadronic phase contains various massive hadrons with an abundance of the lightest hadron, i.e., $\pi$-mesons (pions). In this paper, we consider that pions are in thermal equilibrium in the hadronic phase and use second-order viscous hydrodynamics for a medium of massive pions to obtain its expansion to the boundary of the kinetic freeze-out. We achieve the kinetic freeze-out boundary with the Knudsen number $Kn&gt;1$ limit. When this condition is met, hydrodynamics expansion breaks down, and the mean free path becomes sufficiently large in comparison with the system size so that the particle yields are preserved. Further, we investigate the effect of the massive fluid on the resonance particle yields, including re-scattering and regeneration, along with the natural decay widths of the resonances. The resonances can play an essential role in determining the characteristics of the hadronic phase as they have sufficiently small lifetimes, which may be comparable to the hadronic phase lifetime. In the current study, we predict the hadronic phase lifetime, which is further used to determine the $K^*(892)^0/K$, $\phi(1020)/K$, and $\rho(770)^0/\pi$ yield ratios at the kinetic freeze-out. We calculate these ratios as a function of charged particle multiplicity and transverse momentum and compare the findings with experimental data. Our calculations qualitatively agree with the experimental data, indicating a possible hydrodynamical evolution of the hadronic phase.</description>

      <title>Improving Neutrino Energy Reconstruction with Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15867v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Faithful energy reconstruction is foundational for precision neutrino experiments like DUNE, but is hindered by uncertainties in our understanding of neutrino--nucleus interactions. Here, we demonstrate that dense neural networks are very effective in overcoming these uncertainties by estimating inaccessible kinematic variables based on the observable part of the final state. We find improvements in the energy resolution by up to a factor of two compared to conventional reconstruction algorithms, which translates into an improved physics performance equivalent to a 10-30% increase in the exposure.</description>

      <title>AI-based particle track identification in scintillating fibres read out with imaging sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10519v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the development and application of an AI-based method for particle track identification using scintillating fibres read out with imaging sensors. We propose a variational autoencoder (VAE) to efficiently filter and identify frames containing signal from the substantial data generated by SPAD array sensors. Our VAE model, trained on purely background frames, demonstrated a high capability to distinguish frames containing particle tracks from background noise. The performance of the VAE-based anomaly detection was validated with experimental data, demonstrating the method's ability to efficiently identify relevant events with rapid processing time, suggesting a solid prospect for deployment as a fast inference tool on hardware for real-time anomaly detection. This work highlights the potential of combining advanced sensor technology with machine learning techniques to enhance particle detection and tracking.</description>

      <title>Is Dark Matter the origin of the $B\to K \nu\bar\nu$ excess at Belle II?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04900v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present two models of dark matter (DM) that can provide a natural explanation of the excess of $B^+\to K^+ +\,\text{invisible}$ events with respect to the Standard Model (SM) prediction for $B^+\to K^+ \nu\bar\nu$, which has been reported by the Belle II collaboration. Interactions between the dark and the visible sector are mediated by an axion-like particle (ALP) in one case, by the kinetic mixing between a dark photon and the SM photon in the second case. Both models encompass a light fermion singlet as the DM candidate and can account for the observed DM relic abundance through, respectively, the freeze-in and the freeze-out production mechanism, while simultaneously explaining the Belle II excess.</description>

      <title>Testing the limits of ITkPixV2: the ATLAS inner tracker pixel detector readout chip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05097v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ITkPixV2 chip is the final production readout chip for the ATLAS Phase 2 Inner Tracker (ITk) upgrade at the upcoming High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC). Due to the extraordinarily high peak luminosity at the HL-LHC of $5 \times 10^{34}$ cm$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$, ITkPixV2 must meet significant increases in nearly all design requirements compared to the current ATLAS Inner Detector (ID), including a 10x increase in trigger rate, a 7.5x increase in hit rate, a 3x increase in radiation tolerance, and a 12.5x decrease in pixel current draw per unit area, all while maintaining a similar power per unit area as present pixel detectors. Here we present the first measurements of the ITkPixV2 chip operated at the limits of the full chip design requirements, including in particular a measurement of the activity-induced current of the chip as a function of increasing hit rate.</description>
