      <title>Spatial Econometric Analysis of Dana Point's Housing Market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the determinants of home prices in Dana Point, California to analyze various factors influencing the real estate market. The results are based on a cross-sectional dataset that incorporates year and month-time dummies to account for temporal trends, as well as spatial variables that capture effects within and between clusters. To address endogeneity issues between square footage and price, parking is employed to instrument square footage and break the reverse causality link. The robustness of the instrument is confirmed through statistical tests, indicating a strong relationship with square footage. Additionally, this study employs the use of Probability models to test Tobit's robustness at estimating the dummy-transformed price variable. Spatial trends are analyzed through fixed effects, random effects, as well as Spatial Autoregressive models absorbing cluster factors, which highlight the differences in price dynamics across various clusters within Dana Point.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Relationship of EV Charging Station on the Uptake of Electric Vehicles -- Implication of the NEVI Formula Program</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To achieve the federal goal to make half of all new vehicles sold in the U.S. in 2030 zero-emissions vehicles, the U.S. Department of Transportation's (DOT) Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) has employed the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Program, which aims to promote an interconnected network of publicly accessible electric vehicle (EV) charging stations. By analyzing panel data on a subset of U.S. counties, this paper examines the relationship between different classes of EV charging stations and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) and battery electric vehicles (BEVs). Through an instrumental approach to identify potential endogeneity, this study suggests that public charging stations and the implications of the NEVI Formula Program might not provide the optimistic benefit expected in achieving the federal goal. This finding indicates the need to reevaluate current strategies and explore additional incentives to enhance EV adoption and the effectiveness of public charging infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Economic Geography and Structural Change</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As countries develop, the relative importance of agriculture declines and economic activity becomes spatially concentrated. We develop a model integrating structural change and regional disparities to jointly capture these phenomena. A key modeling innovation ensuring analytical tractability is the introduction of non-homothetic Cobb-Douglas preferences, which are characterized by constant unitary elasticity of substitution and non-constant income elasticity. As labor productivity increases over time, economic well-being rises, leading to a declining expenditure share on agricultural goods. Labor reallocates away from agriculture, and industry concentrates spatially, further increasing aggregate productivity: structural change and regional disparities are two mutually reinforcing outcomes and propagators of the growth process.</description>

      <title>E-Commerce in Africa: Divergent Impacts on Rural and Urban Economies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: E-commerce is rapidly transforming economies across Africa, offering immense opportunities for economic growth, market expansion, and digital inclusion. This study investigates the effects of e-commerce on select African regions. By utilizing readiness factors, including mobile money deployment, GDP per capita, internet penetration, and digital infrastructure, the preparedness of African countries for e-commerce adoption is quantified, highlighting significant disparities. Through case studies in urban and rural areas, including Lagos, Kano, Nairobi, and the Rift Valley, the study shows e-commerce's significant effects on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), employment, and market efficiency. Urban centers demonstrated significant gains in productivity and profitability, whereas rural regions experienced slower growth due to limited internet access and infrastructural barriers. Despite these challenges, localized solutions such as mobile money systems and agricultural e-commerce platforms are bridging gaps. This study highlights the significant potential of e-commerce in Africa while emphasizing the need for targeted investments and strategies to address existing regional disparities.</description>

      <title>Counter-Geoengineering: Feasibility and Policy Implications for a Geoengineered World</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the increasing urgency of climate change's impacts and limited success in reducing emissions, "geoengineering," or the artificial manipulation of the climate to reduce warming rates, has been proposed as an alternative short-term solution. Options range from taking carbon out of the atmosphere through carbon sinks and brightening clouds to increasing the planet's albedo through the release of reflective particles into the atmosphere. While still controversial, geoengineering has been proposed by some as a promising and low-cost way of combating climate change. In particular, so-called 'moderate' geoengineering is claimed to be achievable with few potential side effects or other ramifications. However, this paper argues that the effect of moderate geoengineering can easily be nullified by 'counter-geoengineering,' and any impactful geoengineering would require a global governance framework to prevent countries which benefit from warming temperatures from deploying counter-geoengineering. In this paper, we take Russia as an example due to its potential interest in counteracting geoengineering and its significant ability to release a great amount of methane, a viable counter-geoengineering pathway in the short term.</description>

      <title>Augmenting Minds or Automating Skills: The Differential Role of Human Capital in Generative AI's Impact on Creative Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative AI is rapidly reshaping creative work, raising critical questions about its beneficiaries and societal implications. This study challenges prevailing assumptions by exploring how generative AI interacts with diverse forms of human capital in creative tasks. Through two random controlled experiments in flash fiction writing and song composition, we uncover a paradox: while AI democratizes access to creative tools, it simultaneously amplifies cognitive inequalities. Our findings reveal that AI enhances general human capital (cognitive abilities and education) by facilitating adaptability and idea integration but diminishes the value of domain-specific expertise. We introduce a novel theoretical framework that merges human capital theory with the automation-augmentation perspective, offering a nuanced understanding of human-AI collaboration. This framework elucidates how AI shifts the locus of creative advantage from specialized expertise to broader cognitive adaptability. Contrary to the notion of AI as a universal equalizer, our work highlights its potential to exacerbate disparities in skill valuation, reshaping workplace hierarchies and redefining the nature of creativity in the AI era. These insights advance theories of human capital and automation while providing actionable guidance for organizations navigating AI integration amidst workforce inequalities.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Excess Bond Premium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the drivers of the Gilchrist and Zakraj\v{s}ek (2012) excess bond premium (EBP) through the lens of the news. The monthly attention the news pays to 180 topics (Bybee et al., 2024) captures up to 80% of the variation in the EBP, and this component of variation forecasts macroeconomic movements. Greater news attention to financial intermediaries and crises tends to drive up the EBP and portend macroeconomic downturns, while greater news attention to politics and science tends to drive down the EBP. Attention-based estimates of EBP largely drive out the forecast power of direct sentiment measures for macroeconomic fluctuations and predict the business cycle going back to the early 1900's. Overall, we attribute predictive variation about the EBP for macroeconomic movements to variation in news attention to financial intermediaries, crises, and politics.</description>

      <title>Multi-Scale Node Embeddings for Graph Modeling and Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lying at the interface between Network Science and Machine Learning, node embedding algorithms take a graph as input and encode its structure onto output vectors that represent nodes in an abstract geometric space, enabling various vector-based downstream tasks such as network modelling, data compression, link prediction, and community detection. Two apparently unrelated limitations affect these algorithms. On one hand, it is not clear what the basic operation defining vector spaces, i.e. the vector sum, corresponds to in terms of the original nodes in the network. On the other hand, while the same input network can be represented at multiple levels of resolution by coarse-graining the constituent nodes into arbitrary block-nodes, the relationship between node embeddings obtained at different hierarchical levels is not understood. Here, building on recent results in network renormalization theory, we address these two limitations at once and define a multiscale node embedding method that, upon arbitrary coarse-grainings, ensures statistical consistency of the embedding vector of a block-node with the sum of the embedding vectors of its constituent nodes. We illustrate the power of this approach on two economic networks that can be naturally represented at multiple resolution levels: namely, the international trade between (sets of) countries and the input-output flows among (sets of) industries in the Netherlands. We confirm the statistical consistency between networks retrieved from coarse-grained node vectors and networks retrieved from sums of fine-grained node vectors, a result that cannot be achieved by alternative methods. Several key network properties, including a large number of triangles, are successfully replicated already from embeddings of very low dimensionality, allowing for the generation of faithful replicas of the original networks at arbitrary resolution levels.</description>

      <title>Costly Attention and Retirement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.06520</link>
      <description>arXiv:1904.06520v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In UK data, I document the prevalence of misbeliefs regarding the State Pension eligibility age (SPA) and these misbeliefs predictivity of retirement. Exploiting policy variation, I estimate a lifecycle model of retirement in which rationally inattentive households learning about uncertain pension policy endogenously generate misbeliefs. Endogenous misbeliefs explain 43\%-88\% of the excessive (given financial incentives) drop in employment at SPA. To achieve this, I develop a solution method for dynamic rational inattention models with history-dependent beliefs. Costly attention makes the SPA up to 15\% less effective at increasing old-age employment. Information letters improve welfare and increase employment.</description>

      <title>The Market Consequences of Perceived Strategic Generosity: An Empirical Examination of NFT Charity Fundraisers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12064v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Crypto donations now represent a significant fraction of charitable giving worldwide. Nonfungible token (NFT) charity fundraisers, which involve the sale of NFTs of artistic works with the proceeds donated to philanthropic causes, have emerged as a novel development in this space. A unique aspect of NFT charity fundraisers is the significant potential for donors to reap financial gains from the rising value of purchased NFTs. Questions may arise about donors' motivations in these charity fundraisers, potentially resulting in a negative social image. NFT charity fundraisers thus offer a unique opportunity to understand the economic consequences of a donor's social image. We investigate these effects in the context of a large NFT charity fundraiser. We identify the causal effect of purchasing an NFT within the charity fundraiser on a donor's later market outcomes by leveraging random variation in transaction processing times on the blockchain. Further, we demonstrate a clear pattern of heterogeneity based on an individual's decision to relist (versus hold) the purchased charity NFTs (a sign of perceived strategic generosity) and based on an individual's social exposure within the NFT marketplace. We show that charity-NFT 're-listers' experience significant penalties in the market regarding the prices they can command for their other NFTs, particularly among those who are more socially exposed. Finally, we report the results of a scenario-based online experiment, which again support our findings, highlighting that the re-listing a charity NFT for sale at a profit leads others to perceive their initial donation as strategic generosity and reduces those others' willingness to purchase NFTs from the donor. Our study underscores the growing importance of digital visibility and traceability, features that characterize crypto-philanthropy, and online philanthropy more broadly.</description>

      <title>Spatial Weather, Socio-Economic and Political Risks in Probabilistic Load Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00507v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate forecasts of the impact of spatial weather and pan-European socio-economic and political risks on hourly electricity demand for the mid-term horizon are crucial for strategic decision-making amidst the inherent uncertainty. Most importantly, these forecasts are essential for the operational management of power plants, ensuring supply security and grid stability, and in guiding energy trading and investment decisions. The primary challenge for this forecasting task lies in disentangling the multifaceted drivers of load, which include national deterministic (daily, weekly, annual, and holiday patterns) and national stochastic weather and autoregressive effects. Additionally, transnational stochastic socio-economic and political effects add further complexity, in particular, due to their non-stationarity. To address this challenge, we present an interpretable probabilistic mid-term forecasting model for the hourly load that captures, besides all deterministic effects, the various uncertainties in load. This model recognizes transnational dependencies across 24 European countries, with multivariate modeled socio-economic and political states and cross-country dependent forecasting. Built from interpretable Generalized Additive Models (GAMs), the model enables an analysis of the transmission of each incorporated effect to the hour-specific load. Our findings highlight the vulnerability of countries reliant on electric heating under extreme weather scenarios. This emphasizes the need for high-resolution forecasting of weather effects on pan-European electricity consumption especially in anticipation of widespread electric heating adoption.</description>
