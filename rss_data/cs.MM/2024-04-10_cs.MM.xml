      <title>Demonstration of MaskSearch: Efficiently Querying Image Masks for Machine Learning Workflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate MaskSearch, a system designed to accelerate queries over databases of image masks generated by machine learning models. MaskSearch formalizes and accelerates a new category of queries for retrieving images and their corresponding masks based on mask properties, which support various applications, from identifying spurious correlations learned by models to exploring discrepancies between model saliency and human attention. This demonstration makes the following contributions:(1) the introduction of MaskSearch's graphical user interface (GUI), which enables interactive exploration of image databases through mask properties, (2) hands-on opportunities for users to explore MaskSearch's capabilities and constraints within machine learning workflows, and (3) an opportunity for conference attendees to understand how MaskSearch accelerates queries over image masks.</description>

      <title>Efficient and Generic Point Model for Lossless Point Cloud Attribute Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The past several years have witnessed the emergence of learned point cloud compression (PCC) techniques. However, current learning-based lossless point cloud attribute compression (PCAC) methods either suffer from high computational complexity or deteriorated compression performance. Moreover, the significant variations in point cloud scale and sparsity encountered in real-world applications make developing an all-in-one neural model a challenging task. In this paper, we propose PoLoPCAC, an efficient and generic lossless PCAC method that achieves high compression efficiency and strong generalizability simultaneously. We formulate lossless PCAC as the task of inferring explicit distributions of attributes from group-wise autoregressive priors. A progressive random grouping strategy is first devised to efficiently resolve the point cloud into groups, and then the attributes of each group are modeled sequentially from accumulated antecedents. A locality-aware attention mechanism is utilized to exploit prior knowledge from context windows in parallel. Since our method directly operates on points, it can naturally avoids distortion caused by voxelization, and can be executed on point clouds with arbitrary scale and density. Experiments show that our method can be instantly deployed once trained on a Synthetic 2k-ShapeNet dataset while enjoying continuous bit-rate reduction over the latest G-PCCv23 on various datasets (ShapeNet, ScanNet, MVUB, 8iVFB). Meanwhile, our method reports shorter coding time than G-PCCv23 on the majority of sequences with a lightweight model size (2.6MB), which is highly attractive for practical applications. Dataset, code and trained model are available at https://github.com/I2-Multimedia-Lab/PoLoPCAC.</description>

      <title>GoodDrag: Towards Good Practices for Drag Editing with Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce GoodDrag, a novel approach to improve the stability and image quality of drag editing. Unlike existing methods that struggle with accumulated perturbations and often result in distortions, GoodDrag introduces an AlDD framework that alternates between drag and denoising operations within the diffusion process, effectively improving the fidelity of the result. We also propose an information-preserving motion supervision operation that maintains the original features of the starting point for precise manipulation and artifact reduction. In addition, we contribute to the benchmarking of drag editing by introducing a new dataset, Drag100, and developing dedicated quality assessment metrics, Dragging Accuracy Index and Gemini Score, utilizing Large Multimodal Models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed GoodDrag compares favorably against the state-of-the-art approaches both qualitatively and quantitatively.

      <title>Local Neighborhood Features for 3D Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.05140v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With advances in deep learning model training strategies, the training of Point cloud classification methods is significantly improving. For example, PointNeXt, which adopts prominent training techniques and InvResNet layers into PointNet++, achieves over 7% improvement on the real-world ScanObjectNN dataset. However, most of these models use point coordinates features of neighborhood points mapped to higher dimensional space while ignoring the neighborhood point features computed before feeding to the network layers. In this paper, we revisit the PointNeXt model to study the usage and benefit of such neighborhood point features. We train and evaluate PointNeXt on ModelNet40 (synthetic), ScanObjectNN (real-world), and a recent large-scale, real-world grocery dataset, i.e., 3DGrocery100. In addition, we provide an additional inference strategy of weight averaging the top two checkpoints of PointNeXt to improve classification accuracy. Together with the abovementioned ideas, we gain 0.5%, 1%, 4.8%, 3.4%, and 1.6% overall accuracy on the PointNeXt model with real-world datasets, ScanObjectNN (hardest variant), 3DGrocery100's Apple10, Fruits, Vegetables, and Packages subsets, respectively. We also achieve a comparable 0.2% accuracy gain on ModelNet40.</description>

      <title>Large-scale Multi-Modal Pre-trained Models: A Comprehensive Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.10035v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the urgent demand for generalized deep models, many pre-trained big models are proposed, such as BERT, ViT, GPT, etc. Inspired by the success of these models in single domains (like computer vision and natural language processing), the multi-modal pre-trained big models have also drawn more and more attention in recent years. In this work, we give a comprehensive survey of these models and hope this paper could provide new insights and helps fresh researchers to track the most cutting-edge works. Specifically, we firstly introduce the background of multi-modal pre-training by reviewing the conventional deep learning, pre-training works in natural language process, computer vision, and speech. Then, we introduce the task definition, key challenges, and advantages of multi-modal pre-training models (MM-PTMs), and discuss the MM-PTMs with a focus on data, objectives, network architectures, and knowledge enhanced pre-training. After that, we introduce the downstream tasks used for the validation of large-scale MM-PTMs, including generative, classification, and regression tasks. We also give visualization and analysis of the model parameters and results on representative downstream tasks. Finally, we point out possible research directions for this topic that may benefit future works. In addition, we maintain a continuously updated paper list for large-scale pre-trained multi-modal big models: https://github.com/wangxiao5791509/MultiModal_BigModels_Survey.

      <title>A Shift In Artistic Practices through Artificial Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.10054v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The explosion of content generated by artificial intelligence (AI) models has initiated a cultural shift in arts, music, and media, whereby roles are changing, values are shifting, and conventions are challenged. The vast, readily available dataset of the Internet has created an environment for AI models to be trained on any content on the Web. With AI models shared openly and used by many globally, how does this new paradigm shift challenge the status quo in artistic practices? What kind of changes will AI technology bring to music, arts, and new media?</description>

      <title>GaussianImage: 1000 FPS Image Representation and Compression by 2D Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08551v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Implicit neural representations (INRs) recently achieved great success in image representation and compression, offering high visual quality and fast rendering speeds with 10-1000 FPS, assuming sufficient GPU resources are available. However, this requirement often hinders their use on low-end devices with limited memory. In response, we propose a groundbreaking paradigm of image representation and compression by 2D Gaussian Splatting, named GaussianImage. We first introduce 2D Gaussian to represent the image, where each Gaussian has 8 parameters including position, covariance and color. Subsequently, we unveil a novel rendering algorithm based on accumulated summation. Remarkably, our method with a minimum of 3$\times$ lower GPU memory usage and 5$\times$ faster fitting time not only rivals INRs (e.g., WIRE, I-NGP) in representation performance, but also delivers a faster rendering speed of 1500-2000 FPS regardless of parameter size. Furthermore, we integrate existing vector quantization technique to build an image codec. Experimental results demonstrate that our codec attains rate-distortion performance comparable to compression-based INRs such as COIN and COIN++, while facilitating decoding speeds of approximately 1000 FPS. Additionally, preliminary proof of concept shows that our codec surpasses COIN and COIN++ in performance when using partial bits-back coding. Code will be available at https://github.com/Xinjie-Q/GaussianImage.</description>
