      <title>Characterizing the Role of Hind Flippers in Hydrodynamics of A Harbor Seal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the hydrodynamic characteristics of harbor seal locomotion, focusing on the role of hind flippers in thrust generation and wake dynamics. Through three-dimensional numerical simulations using an immersed boundary method at Reynolds number of 3000, we analyze the impact of varying Strouhal number (St = 0.2-0.35) and propulsive wavelength ($\lambda^\ast = 1.0-1.2$) on swimming performance. Our findings reveal two distinct wake patterns: a single-row structure at lower Strouhal numbers ($St \leq 0.25$) and a double-row configuration at higher St ($St \geq 0.3$). Increasing wavelength generally enhances thrust production by reducing both pressure and friction of drag components. Additionally, we identify critical vortex interactions between the front and hind flippers, with destructive interference occurring at lower St and constructive patterns emerging at higher St. Circulation analysis confirms stronger vortex formation at higher St and $\lambda^\ast$}, particularly during the left stroke phase. These results provide novel insights into the hydrodynamic mechanisms underlying seal locomotion and contribute to our understanding of efficient aquatic propulsion systems.</description>

      <title>On the role of morphology and kinematics of biological swimmers to spread and suppress their odors in the wake</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the interplay between hydrodynamics and chemical sensing in aquatic environments is crucial for unraveling biological swimmers' navigation, foraging, and communication strategies. This study investigates the role of kinematics and morphologies of fish in dispersion and suppression of odor cues in their wake. We employ high-fidelity three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics simulations, integrating a sharp-interface immersed-boundary method with an odor transport model. Using carangiform and anguilliform kinematics for a jackfish and an eel, we analyze the transport of chemical cues in the wake of undulatory swimmers at a Reynolds number of 3000 and Strouhal numbers of 0.25 and 0.4. Our findings reveal that odor plumes closely align with vortex structures, emphasizing a strong coupling between hydrodynamics and chemical dispersion. We demonstrate that kinematics, rather than morphology, predominantly govern odor transport, with anguilliform motion generating broader, more persistent odor trails. Increasing the amplitude of undulation improves the effectiveness of the odor, driven primarily by convection, while diffusion plays a secondary role. These insights provide a deeper understanding of underwater sensing mechanisms and inform the design of bio-inspired robotic systems with improved navigation and chemical detection capabilities.</description>

      <title>Numerical Simulation of Three-dimensional High-Lift Configurations Using Data-Driven Turbulence Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations often struggle to predict separated flows accurately. Recent studies have employed data-driven methods to enhance predictions by modifying baseline equations, such as field inversion and machine learning (FIML) with symbolic regression. However, data-driven turbulence models exhibit limited adaptability and are rarely applied to complex engineering problems. This study examines the application of data-driven turbulence models to complex three-dimensional high-lift configurations, extending their usability beyond previous applications. First, the generalizability of the SST-CND model, derived from conditioned field inversion and symbolic regression, is validated. Then, the spatially varying correction factor obtained through conditioned field inversion is transferred to the three-equation k-(v^2)-w model. The 30P30N three-element airfoil, the JAXA Standard Model (JSM), and the high-lift version of the NASA Common Research Model (CRM-HL) are numerically simulated. The results indicated that the SST-CND model significantly improves the prediction of stall characteristics, demonstrating satisfactory generalizability. The corrected k-(v^2 )-w-CND model accurately predicts the stall characteristics of CRM-HL, with a relative error of less than 5% compared to experimental results. This confirms the strong transferability of the model correction derived from conditioned field inversion across different turbulence models.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of Large Eddy Simulation for the prediction of an intake flow rig using sequential Data Assimilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Data Assimilation (DA) strategy based on an ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) is used to enhance the predictive capabilities of scale resolving numerical tools for the analysis of flows exhibiting cyclic behaviour. More precisely, an ensemble of numerical runs using Large Eddy Simulation (LES) for the compressible steady-state flow rig is augmented via the integration of high-fidelity data. This observation is in the form of instantaneous velocity measurements, which are sampled at localized sensors in the physical domain. Two objectives are targeted. The first one is the calibration of an unsteady inlet condition suitable to capture the cyclic flow investigated. The second one is the analysis of the synchronization of velocity field predicted by the LES with the available observation. In order to reduce the computational costs required for this analysis, a hyper-localization procedure (HLEnKF) is proposed and it is integrated in the library CONES, tailored to perform fast online DA. The proposed strategy performs a satisfactory calibration of the inlet conditions, and its robustness is assessed using two different prior distributions for the free parameters optimized in this task. DA state estimation is efficient in obtaining accurate local synchronization of the inferred velocity fields with the observed data. The modal analysis of the kinetic energy of the flow field provides additional information on the quality of the reconstruction of the velocity field, which shows improvements. Thus, the HLEnKF shows promising features for the calibration and the synchronization of scale-resolved turbulent flows, opening perspectives of applications for complex phenomena using advanced tools such as digital twins.</description>

      <title>A new emitter for electrospray and electrohydrodynamic jet printing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose using a dielectric beveled nozzle for electrospray and electrohydrodynamic jet printing. This nozzle stabilizes the liquid ejection of low-conductivity liquids, considerably reducing the minimum flow rate below which the flow becomes unstable. This translates into a significant reduction of the minimum jet diameter. Due to its dielectric character, electrochemical reactions occurring in metallic beveled nozzles (e.g. hypodermic needles) do not occur, preserving the purity of the liquid. This property makes this nozzle appropriate for Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry (ESI-MS) or bioplotting. We illustrate the capabilities of this new technique by conducting (i) electrospray experiments with Newtonian liquids and (ii) electrohydrodynamic jet printing experiments with viscoelastic fluids. Jets with diameters around 1 $\mu$m are produced with low-conductivity liquids such as octanol and glycerine. Viscoelastic threads a few microns in diameter are gently deposited on a moving substrate to print out uniform lines tens of nanometers in height. Due to the strong stabilizing effect of the beveled nozzle, the minimum flow rate and jet diameter were much smaller than the respective values obtained with the cylindrical capillary in the electrospray and electrohydrodynamic jet printing experiments. The proposed technique opens new routes for electrospray and electrohydrodynamic jet printing.</description>

      <title>Analytic adjoint solution for incompressible potential flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain the analytic adjoint solution for two-dimensional (2D) incompressible potential flow for a cost function measuring aerodynamic force using the connection of the adjoint approach to Green's functions and also by establishing and exploiting its relation to the adjoint incompressible Euler equations. By comparison with the analytic solution, it is shown that the naive approach based on solving Laplace's equation for the adjoint variables can be ill-defined. The analysis of the boundary behavior of the analytic solution is used to discuss the proper formulation of the adjoint problem as well as the mechanism for incorporating the Kutta condition in the adjoint formulation</description>

      <title>Thermal Enskog-Vlasov Lattice Boltzmann model with phase separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An Enskog-Vlasov finite-difference Lattice Boltzmann (EV-FDLB) for liquid-vapor systems with variable temperature is introduced. The model involves both the simplified Enskog collision operator and the self-consistent force field which accounts for the long-range interaction between the fluid particles. Full-range Gauss-Hermite quadratures were used for the discretization of the momentum space. The numerical solutions of the Enskog-Vlasov equation obtained employing the EV-FDLB model and the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC)-like particle method (PM) are compared. Reasonable agreement is found between the two approaches when simulating the liquid-vapor phase separation and the liquid slab evaporation.</description>

      <title>Longitudinal vortices in unsteady Taylor-Couette flow: solution to a 60-year-old mystery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Applying a sufficiently rapid start-stop to the outer cylinder of the Couette-Taylor system, structures approximately aligned with the axis were recorded in the classic work of Coles (1965). These short-lived rolls are oriented perpendicular to the classic Taylor-vortex rolls. In this work we report numerical observation of this instability, guided by a more recent experimental observation. The instability is shown to be related to an inflection in the azimuthal velocity profile, a finding consistent with the experimental observations of its emergence during the deceleration phase. Despite the transient nature of start-stop experiments, we show that the instability can be linked to that of the oscillating boundary layer problem of Stokes. There are several reasons why the instability may have remained elusive, both for experimental observation and intrinsic to the idealized system. We look in more detail at dependence on the radius ratio for the Taylor-Couette system and find that, in the case where the size of the rolls scales with the gap width, for radius ratios any lower than that used by Coles, R_i/R_o=0.874, the instability is quickly overrun by axisymmetric rolls of Gortler type.</description>

      <title>Revealing the drivers of turbulence anisotropy over flat and complex terrain: an interpretable machine learning approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Turbulence anisotropy was recently integrated into Monin-Obukhov Similarity Theory (MOST), extending its applicability to complex terrain and diverse surface conditions. Implementing this generalized MOST in numerical models, however, requires understanding the key drivers of turbulence anisotropy across various terrain conditions. This study therefore employs random forest models trained on measurement data from both flat and complex terrain and including upstream terrain features, to predict turbulence anisotropy. Two approaches were compared: using dimensional variables directly or employing non-dimensional groups as model input. To address cross-correlation among features, we developed a new selection method, Recursive Effect Elimination. Finally, interpretability methods were used to identify the most influential variables. Contrary to expectations, variables related to terrain influence were not found to significantly impact turbulence anisotropy. Instead, non-dimensional groups of common turbulence length, time and velocity scales proved more robust than dimensional variables in isolating anisotropy drivers, enhancing model performance over complex terrain and reducing location dependence. A ratio of integral and turbulence memory length scales was found to correlate well with turbulence anisotropy in both daytime and nighttime conditions, both over flat and complex terrain. During the day, a refined stability parameter incorporating both the surface and mixed layer scaling emerged as the dominant driver of anisotropy, while at night, parameters related to rapid distortion were strong predictors.</description>

      <title>Sedimentation and shear-induced dynamics of spheroids in fluids with spatial viscosity variations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A generalized reciprocal theorem is used to relate the force and torque induced on a particle in an inertia-less fluid with small variation in viscosity to integrals involving Stokes flow fields and the spatial dependence of viscosity. These resistivity expressions are analytically evaluated using spheroidal harmonics and then used to obtain the mobility of the spheroid during sedimentation, and in linear flows, of a fluid with linear viscosity stratification. The coupling between the rotational and translational motion induced by stratification rotates the spheroid's centerline, creating a variety of rotational and translational dynamics dependent upon the particle's aspect ratio, $\kappa$, and the component of the stratification unit vector in the gravity direction, $d_g$. Spheroids with $0.55\lessapprox\kappa\lessapprox2.0$ exhibit the largest variety of settling behaviors. Interestingly, this range covers most microplastics and typical microorganisms. One of the modes include a stable orientation dependent only on $\kappa$ and $d_g$, but independent of initial orientation, thus allowing for the potential control of settling angles and sedimentation rates. In a simple shear flow, cross-streamline migration occurs due to the stratification-induced force generated on the particle. Similarly, a particle no longer stays at the stagnation point of a uniaxial extensional flow. While fully analytical results are obtained for spheroids, numerical simulations provide a source of validation. These simulations also provide additional insights into the stratification-induced force- and torque-producing mechanisms through the stratification-induced stress, which is not accessed in the reciprocal theorem-based analytical calculations.</description>

      <title>Direct numerical simulations on transport and deposition of charged inertial particles in turbulent channel flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From particle lifting in atmospheric boundary layers to dust ingestion in jet engines, the transport and deposition of inertial particles in wall-bounded turbulent flows are prevalent in both nature and industry. Due to triboelectrification during collisions, solid particles often acquire significant charges. However, the impacts of the resulting electrostatic interaction on particle dynamics remain less understood. In this study, we present four-way coupled simulations to investigate the deposition of charged particles onto a grounded metal substrate through a fully developed turbulent boundary layer. Our numerical method tracks the dynamics of individual particles under the influence of turbulence, electrostatic forces, and collisions. We first report a more pronounced near-wall accumulation and an increased wall-normal particle velocity due to particle charging. In addition, contrary to predictions from the classic Eulerian model, the wall-normal transport rate of inertial particles is significantly enhanced by electrostatic forces. A statistical approach is then applied to quantify the contributions from turbophoresis, biased sampling, and electrostatic forces. For charged particles, a sharper gradient in wall-normal particle fluctuation velocity is observed, which substantially enhances turbophoresis and serves as the primary driving force of near-wall particle accumulation. Furthermore, charged particles are found to sample upward-moving fluids less frequently than neutral particles, thereby weakening the biased sampling effect that typically pushes particles away from the wall. Finally, the wall-normal electric field is shown to depend on the competition between particle-wall and particle-particle electrostatic interactions, which helps to identify the dominant electrostatic force across a wide range of scenarios.</description>

      <title>Weakly nonlinear analysis of particle-laden Rayleigh-B\'enard convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of inertial particles on Rayleigh-B\'enard convection using weakly nonlinear stability analysis. In the presence of nonlinear effects, we study the limiting value of growth of instabilities by deriving a cubic Landau equation. An Euler-Euler/two-fluid formulation is being used to describe the flow instabilities in particle-laden Rayleigh-B\'enard convection. The nonlinear results are presented near the critical point (bifurcation point) for water droplets in the dry air system. It is found that supercritical bifurcation is the only type of bifurcation beyond the critical point. Interaction of settling particles with the flow and the Reynolds stress or distortion terms emerge due to the nonlinear self-interaction of fundamental modes, breaking down the top-bottom symmetry of the secondary flow structures. In addition to the distortion functions, the nonlinear interaction of fundamental modes generates higher harmonics, leading to the tendency of preferential concentration of uniformly distributed particles, which is completely absent in the linear stability analysis. It is shown that in the presence of thermal energy coupling between the fluid and particles, the difference between the horizontally averaged heat flux at the hot and cold surface is equal to the net sensible heat flux advected by the particles. The difference between the heat fluxes at hot and cold surfaces is increased with an increase in particle concentration.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of Hall Effect Implementations in Hall-Magnetohydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is no standard numerical implementation of the Hall effect, which is one of the non-ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) effects. Numerical instability arises when a simple implementation is used, in which the Hall electric field is added to the electric field to update magnetic fields without further modifications to the numerical scheme. In this paper, several implementations proposed in the literature are compared to identify an approach that provides stable and accurate results. We consider two types of implementations of the Hall effect. One is a modified version of the Harten-Lax-van Leer method (Hall-HLL) in which the phase speeds of whistler waves are adopted as the signal speeds; the other involves adding a fourth-order hyper-resistivity to a Hall-MHD code. Based on an extensive series of test calculations, we found that hyper-resistivity yields more accurate results than the Hall-HLL, particularly in problems where the whisler-wave timescale is shorter than the the timescale of physical processes of interest. Through both von Neumann stability analysis and numerical experiments, an appropriate coefficient for the hyper-resistivity is determined.</description>

      <title>Exploring external rarefied gas flows through the method of fundamental solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18128v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The well-known Navier--Stokes--Fourier equations of fluid dynamics are, in general, not adequate for describing rarefied gas flows. Moreover, while the Stokes equations -- a simplified version of the Navier--Stokes--Fourier equations -- are effective in modeling slow and steady liquid flow past a sphere, they fail to yield a non-trivial solution to the problem of slow and steady liquid flow past an infinitely long cylinder (a two-dimensional problem essentially); this is referred to as Stokes' paradox. The paradox also arises when studying these problems for gases. In this paper, we present a way to obtain meaningful solutions for two-dimensional flows of rarefied gases around objects by circumventing Stokes' paradox. To this end, we adopt an extended hydrodynamic model, referred to as the CCR model, consisting of the balance equations for the mass, momentum and energy and closed with the coupled constitutive relations. We determine an analytic solution of the CCR model for the problem and compare it with a numerical solution based on the method of fundamental solutions. Apart from addressing flow past a circular cylinder, we aim to showcase the capabilities of the method of fundamental solutions to predict the flow past other objects in two dimensions for which analytic solutions do not exist or are difficult to determine. For that, we investigate the problem of rarefied gas flow past an infinitely long semicircular cylinder.</description>

      <title>Experimental study on the relationship between extensional and shear rheology of low-viscosity power-law fluids</title>

Abstract: This paper investigates the relationship between extensional and shear viscosity of low-viscosity power-law fluids. We showed the first experimental evidence of the conditions satisfying the same power exponents for extensional and shear viscosity, as indicated by the Carreau model. The extensional and shear viscosity are respectively measured by capillary breakup extensional rheometry dripping-onto-substrate (CaBER-DoS) and by a shear rheometer for various Ohnesorge number Oh. The viscosity ranges measured were about O(10^0) to O(10^4) mPas for shear viscosity and O(10^1) to O(10^3) mPas for extensional viscosity. Our experimental results show that, at least for the range of Oh &gt; 1, the power-law expression for the liquid filament radius, extensional viscosity, and shear viscosity holds, even for low-viscosity fluids.</description>

      <title>Effective transport by 2D turbulence: Vortex-gas theory vs. scale-invariant inverse cascade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17431v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The scale-invariant inverse energy cascade is a hallmark of 2D turbulence, with its theoretical energy spectrum observed in both direct numerical simulations (DNS) and laboratory experiments. Under this scale-invariance assumption, the effective diffusivity of a 2D turbulent flow is dimensionally controlled by the energy flux and the friction coefficient only. Surprisingly, however, we show that such scaling predictions are invalidated by numerical solutions of the 2D Navier-Stokes equation forced at intermediate wave number and damped by weak linear or quadratic drag. We derive alternate scaling-laws for the effective diffusivity based on the emergence of intense, isolated vortices causing spatially inhomogeneous frictional dissipation localized within the small vortex cores. The predictions quantitatively match DNS data. This study points to a universal large-scale organization of 2D turbulent flows in physical space, bridging standard 2D Navier-Stokes turbulence with large-scale geophysical turbulence.</description>

      <title>Investigation of the piston effect in supercritical fluids via a reversible--irreversible vector field splitting-based explicit time integration scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07449v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the vicinity of the liquid--vapor critical point, supercritical fluids behave strongly compressibly and, in parallel, thermophysical properties have strong state dependence. These lead to various peculiar phenomena, one of which being the piston effect where a sudden heating induces a mechanical pulse. The coupling between thermal and mechanical processes, in the linear approximation, yields a non-trivially rich thermoacoustics. The numerous applications of supercritical fluids raise the need for reliable yet fast and efficient numerical solution for thermoacoustic time and space dependence in this sensitive domain. Here, we present a second-order accurate, fully explicit staggered space-time grid finite difference method for such coupled linear thermoacoustic problems. Time integration is based on the splitting of the state space vector field representing the interactions that affect the dynamics into reversible and irreversible parts, which splitting procedure leads to decoupled wave and heat equations. The former is a hyperbolic partial differential equation, while the latter is a parabolic one, therefore, different time integration algorithms must be amalgamated to obtain a reliable, dispersion error-free, and dissipation error-free numerical solution. Finally, the thermoacoustic approximation of the supercritical piston effect is investigated via the developed method.</description>
