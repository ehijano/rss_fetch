      <title>Kinetics-Optimized Enhanced Sampling Using Mean First Passage Times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular dynamics simulations have become essential in many areas of atomistic modelling from drug discovery to materials science. They provide critical atomic-level insights into key dynamical events experiments cannot easily capture. However, their impact often falls short as the timescales of the important processes are inaccessible using standard molecular dynamics. Enhanced sampling methods provided avenues to access such crucial rare events, for example key slow conformational changes of biomolecules. However, the bias in enhanced sampling simulations is rarely optimized, and even if they are, the optimization criteria is based on the thermodynamics or Hamiltonian of the system, but do not directly consider molecular kinetics. Here, we introduce a novel enhanced sampling algorithm that adaptively optimizes the bias based on the kinetics of the system for the first time. We identify the optimal bias that minimizes a key physical observable, the mean first passage time (MFPT) from a starting state to a target state. Our algorithm makes use of the relation between biased and unbiased kinetics obtained from discretized Markov state models (MSMs), as established in the dynamic histogram analysis method (DHAM). We demonstrate the applicability of the method for different 1D and 2D analytical potential-based model examples, NaCl dissociation in explicit water, and phosphate unbinding in Ras GTPase. Our algorithm has excellent performance compared with state-of-art enhanced sampling methods in terms of the timescales required to reach the final state in the benchmarking systems. Our findings provide a novel, kinetics-driven enhanced sampling strategy, signatured by a targeted approach to facilitate mapping rare events, with the potential for breakthrough applications in drug discovery and materials science.</description>

      <title>Bistability in filamentous actin through monomer-sequestration of an effector species</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Filamentous actin, a species of dynamic protein polymers, is one of the main components of the cytoskeleton of eukaryotic cells. We formulate a class of models that predict the possibility of bistable steady states in populations of dynamic actin filaments. They are built upon a basic model of actin dynamics that includes severing and capping in the presence of a finite actin monomer pool. The key additional ingredient is the presence of a single species of effector molecules that is partially sequestered to an inactive state by binding to free G-actin. In its unbound active state, this effector species can \emph{enhance} the rate of nucleation of filamentous actin or its growth speed, or \emph{inhibit} the activity of capping or severing proteins. Using an explicit analytical solution of the basic actin dynamics model, we show that bistability is predicted to occur in all of the proposed models. We verify these predictions using particle-based stochastic simulations. In addition, we show that switching between the two stable states can be achieved by transient manipulation of the free G-actin pool size.</description>

      <title>Prospects for NMR Spectral Prediction on Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy is a prominent analytical tool, with applications throughout chemistry, medicine and solid-state physics. While conventional NMR spectrometers require large magnetic fields to interrogate a sample, recent advances in atomic magnetometry have enabled this spectroscopy far below geomagnetic field strengths. This zero-to-ultralow (ZULF) field regime can be advantageous since it mitigates relaxation and reveals spin couplings that are otherwise obscured, all while using compact and lower-overhead instrumentation. The resulting spectra are nonetheless difficult to interpret without computation, which can be taxing due to the presence of vector couplings and long-range spin networks. Following recent proposals, we demonstrate how fault-tolerant quantum computation could be used to simulate these spectra. Our analysis spans from input selection to the construction of explicit circuits based on qubitized quantum dynamics. By maintaining parity with experimental requirements, we demonstrate how NMR spectral prediction might be an early application for fault-tolerant quantum computers.</description>

      <title>A minimal model of cognition based on oscillatory and reinforcement processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02520v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Building mathematical models of brains is difficult because of the sheer complexity of the problem. One potential starting point is through basal cognition, which give abstract representation of a range of organisms without central nervous systems, including fungi, slime moulds and bacteria. We propose one such model, demonstrating how a combination of oscillatory and current-based reinforcement processes can be used to couple resources in an efficient manner, mimicking the way these organisms function. A key ingredient in our model, not found in previous basal cognition models, is that we explicitly model oscillations in the number of particles (i.e. the nutrients, chemical signals or similar, which make up the biological system) and the flow of these particles within the modelled organisms. Using this approach, we find that our model builds efficient solutions, provided the environmental oscillations are sufficiently out of phase. We further demonstrate that amplitude differences can promote efficient solutions and that the system is robust to frequency differences. In the context of these findings, we discuss connections between our model and basal cognition in biological systems and slime moulds, in particular, how oscillations might contribute to self-organised problem-solving by these organisms.</description>
