      <title>Pre-emptive parametric kill switch for evaporative atomic sources in vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A robust pre-emptive kill switch for cold atom experiments is introduced to significantly reduce costly system reassembly or replacement. The design incorporates upper (alarm) and lower (evaporation) event detection mechanisms based on predefined thresholds. Meanwhile, a duty cycle timing methodology is used to avert unintentional activation of the dispenser in circumstances where pulse signals occur. The circuit employs generic components, a modular design, and formalized logic, ensuring cost-effectiveness, making the design suitable for school laboratories and other research environments. This design is highly versatile and can be applied to other sensitive devices beyond dispensers, such as heating filaments, titanium sublimation pumps, tungsten lamps, and comparable systems.</description>

      <title>Precise ab initio calculations of $^4$He($1snp \, ^3P_J$) fine structure of high Rydberg states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-precision measurements of the fine-structure splittings in helium high Rydberg states have been reported, yet corresponding ab initio benchmarks for direct comparison remain unavailable. In this work, we extend the correlated B-spline basis function (C-BSBF) method to calculate the fine-structure splittings of high Rydberg states in $^4$He. The calculations include the $m\alpha^4$- and $m\alpha^5$-order contributions, the singlet-triplet mixing effect, and estimated spin-dependent $m\alpha^6$-order corrections obtained using a $1/n^3$ scaling approximation. High-precision ab initio results are obtained for principal quantum numbers $n=24$-37 with kilohertz-level accuracy and further extended to $n=45$-51 by extrapolation and fitting. The theoretical results show excellent agreement with quantum-defect theory (QDT) predictions and allow direct comparison with experimental measurements. Additionally, the discrepancy observed at $n=34$ is expected to be clarified with improved experimental precision.</description>

      <title>Model-independent determination of nuclear charge radii from Li-like ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that recent advances in QED theory of Li-like ions [V. A. Yerokhin et al., Phys. Rev. A 112, 042801 (2025)] enable determinations of absolute nuclear charge radii for heavy elements. By incorporating constraints derived from electron-scattering data, we obtain radii that are independent of the assumed model of the nuclear charge distribution. Our approach is validated for $^{208}$Pb, a well-studied spherical nucleus, and is then applied to $^{209}$Bi, where low-lying nuclear excitations complicate the interpretation of muonic-atom data.</description>

      <title>Long-lived giant circular Rydberg atoms at room temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stability achieved by large angular momentum is ubiquitous in nature, with examples ranging from classical mechanics, over optics and chemistry, to nuclear physics. In atoms, angular momentum can protect excited electronic orbitals from decay due to selection rules. This manifests spectacularly in highly excited Rydberg states. Low angular momentum Rydberg states are at the heart of recent breakthroughs in quantum computing, simulation and sensing with neutral atoms. For these applications the lifetime of the Rydberg levels sets fundamental limits for gate fidelities, coherence times, or spectroscopic precision. The quest for longer Rydberg state lifetimes has motivated the generation, coherent control and trapping of circular Rydberg atoms, which are characterized by the maximally allowed electron orbital momentum and were key to Nobel prize-winning experiments with single atoms and photons. Here, we report the observation of individually trapped circular Rydberg atoms with lifetimes of more than 10 milliseconds, two orders of magnitude longer-lived than the established low angular momentum orbitals. This is achieved via Purcell suppression of blackbody modes at room temperature. We coherently control individual circular Rydberg levels at so far elusive principal quantum numbers of up to $n=103$, and observe tweezer trapping of the Rydberg atoms on the few hundred millisecond scale. Our results pave the way for quantum information processing and sensing utilizing the combination of extreme lifetimes and giant Rydberg blockade.</description>

      <title>Automation in quantum logic experiments with cold molecular ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern experiments with cold molecular ions have reached a high degree of complexity requiring frequent sample preparation, state initialization and protocol execution while demanding precise control over multiple devices and laser sources. To maintain a high experimental duty cycle and robust measurement conditions, automation becomes essential. We present a fully automated control system for the preparation of trapped state-selected molecular ions and subsequent quantum logic-based experiments. Adaptive feedback routines based on real-time image analysis introduce and identify single molecular ions in atomic-ion Coulomb crystals. By appropriate manipulation of the trapping potentials, excess atomic ions are released from the trap to produce dual-species two-ion strings, here Ca$^+-$N$_2^+$. After mass and state identification of the molecular ion, nanosecond-level synchronization of laser pulses employing the Sinara/ARTIQ framework and real-time data analysis enable quantum-logic-spectroscopic measurements. The present automated control system enables robust, unsupervised operation over extended periods resulting in an increase of the number of experimentation cycles by about a factor of ten compared to manual operation and a factor of about eight in loaded molecules in typical practical situations. The modular, distributed design of the system provides a scalable blueprint for similar molecular-ion experiments.</description>

      <title>Directional quantum scattering transducer in cooperative Rydberg metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a single-photon transduction scheme using 4-wave-mixing and quantum scattering in planar, cooperative Rydberg arrays that is both efficient and highly directional and may allow for terahertz-to-optical transduction. In the 4-wave-mixing scheme, two lasers drive the system, coherently trapping the system in a dark ground-state and coupling a signal transition, that may be in the terahertz, to an idler transition that may be in the optical. The photon-mediated dipole-dipole interactions between emitters generate collective super-/subradiant dipolar modes, both on the signal and the idler transition. As the array is cooperative with respect to the signal transition, an incident signal photon can efficiently couple into the array and is admixed into dipolar idler modes by the drive. Under specific criticality conditions, this admixture is into a superradiant idler mode which primarily decays into a specific, highly directional optical photon that propagates within the array plane. Outside of the array, this photon may then be coupled into existing quantum devices for further processing. Using a scattering-operator formalism we derive resonance and criticality conditions that govern this two-step process and obtain analytic transduction efficiencies. For infinite lattices, we predict transduction efficiencies into specific spatial directions of up to 50%, while the overall, undirected transduction efficiency can be higher. An analysis for finite arrays of $N^2$ emitters, shows that the output is collimated into lobes that narrow as $1/\sqrt{N}$. Our scheme combines the broadband acceptance of free-space 4-wave mixing with the efficiency, directionality and tunability of cooperative metasurfaces, offering a route towards quantum-coherent THz detection and processing for astronomical spectroscopy, quantum-networked sparse-aperture imaging and other quantum-sensing applications.</description>

      <title>Non-Heisenbergian quantum mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11350v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Relaxing the postulates of an axiomatic theory is a natural way to find more general theories, and historically, the discovery of non-Euclidean geometry is a famous example of this procedure. Here, we use this way to extend quantum mechanics by ignoring the heart of Heisenberg's quantum mechanics -- We do not assume the existence of a position operator that satisfies the Heisenberg commutation relation, $[\hat x,\hat p]=i\hbar$. The remaining axioms of quantum theory, besides Galilean symmetry, lead to a more general quantum theory with a free parameter $l_0$ of length dimension, such that as $l_0 \to 0$ the theory reduces to standard quantum theory. Perhaps surprisingly, this non-Heisenberg quantum theory, without a priori assumption of the non-commutation relation, leads to a modified Heisenberg uncertainty relation, $\Delta x \Delta p\geq \sqrt{\hbar^2/4+l_0^2(\Delta p)^2}$, which ensures the existence of a minimal position uncertainty, $l_0$, as expected from various quantum gravity studies. By comparing the results of this framework with some observed data, which includes the first longitudinal normal modes of the bar gravitational wave detector AURIGA and the $1S-2S$ transition in the hydrogen atom, we obtain upper bounds on the $l_0$.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of diffusivity and plastic deformation in ultrasound-assisted cold spray of tungsten: a molecular dynamics study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09803v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tungsten ($W$) is widely valued for its exceptional thermal stability, mechanical strength, and corrosion resistance, making it an ideal candidate for high-performance military and aerospace applications. However, its high melting point and inherent brittleness pose significant challenges for processing $W$ using additive manufacturing (AM). Cold spray (CS), a solid-state AM process that relies on high-velocity particle impact and plastic deformation, offers a promising alternative. In this study, we employ atomistic simulations to investigate the feasibility of CS for tungsten. We show that ultrasound perturbation can significantly enhance the self-diffusivity and plastic deformation of $W$ compared to the negligible diffusion and plastic deformation observed in non-ultrasound-assisted CS of $W$. For different impact velocities, particle sizes, and ultrasound parameters, we demonstrate that ultrasound-assisted viscoplasticity enhances self-diffusivity by inhibiting grain boundaries and incorporating softening in $W$. Moreover, we found that this enhanced diffusion in ultrasound-assisted $W$ can be exploited to promote interdiffusion at the particle-substrate interface, enabling in situ alloy formation. Through the formation of an equimolar $V$-$W$ alloy on a $W$ substrate using ultrasound-assisted CS simulations, we observed distinct mechanical properties and a reduced dislocation density in the deposited coating compared to a pure tungsten substrate. These results highlight the potential of ultrasound-assisted CS as a viable approach for manufacturing uniform coatings and engineered alloys, addressing key limitations in the AM of refractory metals.</description>

      <title>Can Bose-Einstein condensates enhance radioactive decay?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21692v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper lays out the principles of how Bose-Einstein condensates can modify radioactive decay. We highlight the challenges of many modes and short coherence times due to the $\approx$ MeV energies of the emitted radiation. Recent proposals for gamma ray and neutrino lasers claim that using a Bose-Einstein condensate as a source would solve these issues. We show that this is not the case, and the proposed experiments would have a gain of only $10^{-20}$ or smaller. We also analyze proposals for gamma ray lasers based on stimulated annihilation of positronium Bose-Einstein condensates.</description>
