      <title>Plasma Dynamics and Nonthermal Particle Acceleration in 3D Nonrelativistic Magnetic Reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding plasma dynamics and nonthermal particle acceleration in 3D magnetic reconnection has been a long-standing challenge. In this paper, we explore these problems by performing large-scale fully kinetic simulations of multi-xline plasmoid reconnection with various parameters in both the weak and strong guide field regimes. In each regime, we have identified its unique 3D dynamics that leads to field-line chaos and efficient acceleration, and we have achieved nonthermal acceleration of both electrons and protons into power-law spectra. The spectral indices agree well with a simple Fermi acceleration theory that includes guide field dependence. In the low-guide-field regime, the flux-rope kink instability governs the 3D dynamics for efficient acceleration. The weak dependence of the spectra on the ion-to-electron mass ratio and $\beta$ ($\ll1$) implies that the particles are sufficiently magnetized for Fermi acceleration in our simulations. While both electrons and protons are injected at reconnection exhausts, protons are primarily injected by perpendicular electric fields through Fermi reflections and electrons are injected by a combination of perpendicular and parallel electric fields. The magnetic power spectra agree with in-situ magnetotail observations, and the spectral index may reflect a reconnection-driven size distribution of plasmoids instead of Goldreich-Sridhar vortex cascade. As the guide field becomes stronger, the oblique flux ropes of large sizes capture the main 3D dynamics for efficient acceleration. Intriguingly, the oblique flux ropes can also run into flux-rope kink instability to drive extra 3D dynamics. This work has broad implications for 3D reconnection dynamics and particle acceleration in heliophysics and astrophysics.</description>

      <title>The Gaia-ESO Survey: Calibrating the lithium-age relation with open clusters and associations. II. Expanded cluster sample and final membership selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Li abundance observed in pre-main sequence and main sequence late-type stars is strongly age-dependent, but also shows a complex pattern depending on several parameters, such as rotation, chromospheric activity and metallicity. The best way to calibrate these effects, with the aim of studying Li as an age indicator for FGK stars, is to calibrate coeval groups of stars, such as open clusters (OCs) and associations. We present a considerable target sample of 42 OCs and associations, ranging from 1 Myr to 5 Gyr, observed within the Gaia-ESO survey (GES), and using the latest data provided by GES iDR6 and the most recent release of Gaia that was then available, EDR3. As part of this study, we update and improve the membership analysis for all 20 OCs presented in our previous article. We perform detailed membership analyses for all target clusters to identify likely candidates, using all available parameters provided by GES and based on numerous criteria: from radial velocity distributions, to the astrometry and photometry provided by Gaia, to gravity indicators, [Fe/H] metallicity, and Li content. We obtain updated lists of cluster members for the whole target sample, as well as a selection of Li-rich giant contaminants obtained as an additional result of the membership process. Each selection of cluster candidates was thoroughly contrasted with numerous existing membership studies using data from Gaia to ensure the most robust results. These final cluster selections will be used in the third and last paper of this series, which reports the results of a comparative study characterising the observable Li dispersion in each cluster and analysing its dependence on several parameters, allowing us to calibrate a Li-age relation and obtain a series of empirical Li envelopes for key ages in our sample.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a new IW And-type dwarf nova with both tilted disk and tidal instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: IW And-type dwarf novae are anomalous Z Cam stars featured with outbursts happening during standstill states, which are not expected in the standard disk instability model. The physical mechanisms for these variations remain unclear. In this study, we report the discovery of a new candidate IW And-type dwarf nova J0652+2436, identified with its frequent outbursts from the slowly rising standstill states. Luckily, the TESS observations during a long standstill state and the earlier K2 observations give a chance to find the orbital and negative superhump period in the light curve of J0652+2436, allowing the measurement of its mass ratio of 0.366. This mass ratio is marginally possible for the tidal instability to set in according to previous SPH simulations. Thus, we propose that the outbursts in J0652+2436 are likely to be caused by the growing accretion disk during standstills, in favor of the previous hypothesis of the mechanisms lying in all IW And stars. We conclude that J0652+2436 might be the first IW And star with both a precessing tilted disk and tidal instability, which will be an important laboratory for studying the accretion disk dynamics and help understand IW And phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Distribution and Recovery Phase of Geomagnetic Storms During Solar Cycles 23 and 24</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and Stream Interaction Regions (SIRs) are the main drivers of intense geomagnetic storms. We study the distribution of geomagnetic storms associated with different drivers during solar cycles 23 and 24 (1996-2019). Although the annual occurrence rate of geomagnetic storms in both cycles tracks the sunspot cycle, the second peak in storm activity lags the second sunspot peak. SIRs contribute significantly to the second peak in storm numbers in both cycles, particularly for moderate to stronger-than-moderate storms. We note semiannual peaks in storm numbers much closer to equinoxes for moderate storms, and slightly shifted from equinoxes for intense and stronger-than-intense storms. We note a significant fraction of multiple-peak storms in both cycles due to isolated ICMEs/SIRs, while single-peak storms from multiple interacting drivers, suggesting a complex relationship between storm steps and their drivers. Our study focuses on investigating the recovery phases of geomagnetic storms and examining their dependencies on various storm parameters. Multiple-peak storms in both cycles have recovery phase duration strongly influenced by slow and fast decay phases with no correlation with the main phase buildup rate and Dst peak. However, the recovery phase in single-peak storms for both cycles depends to some extent on the main phase buildup rate and Dst peak, in addition to slow and fast decay phases. Future research should explore recovery phases of single and multiple-peak storms incorporating in-situ solar wind observations for a deeper understanding of storm evolution and decay processes.</description>

      <title>Mixing is easy: new insights for cosmochemical evolution from pre-stellar core collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Signposts of early planet formation are ubiquitous in sub-structured young discs. Dense, hot and high-pressure regions formed during gravitational collapse process, integral to star formation, facilitate dynamical mixing of dust within the protostellar disc. This provides an incentive to constrain the role of gas-dust interaction and resolve zones of dust concentration during star-disc formation. We explore if thermal and dynamical conditions developed during disc formation can generate gas flows that efficiently mix and transport well-coupled gas and dust components. We simulate the collapse of dusty molecular cloud cores with the hydrodynamics code PLUTO augmented with radiation transport and self-gravity. We use a 2D axisymmetric geometry and follow the azimuthal component of velocity. Dust is treated as Lagrangian particles that are subject to drag from the gas, whose motion is computed on a Eulerian grid. We consider 1, 10 and 100 micron-sized neutral spherical dust. Importantly, the equation of state accurately includes molecular hydrogen dissociation. We focus on molecular cloud core masses of 1 and 3 Msun and explore effects of initial rotation rates and cloud core sizes. Our study underlines mechanisms for early transport of dust from inner hot disc regions via the occurrence of meridional flows and outflow. The vortical flow fosters dynamical mixing and retention of dust, while thermal pressure driven outflow replenishes dust in the outer disc. Young dynamical precursors to planet-forming discs exhibit regions with complex hydrodynamical gas features and high-temperature structures. These can play a crucial role in concentrating dust for subsequent growth into protoplanets. Dust transport, especially, from sub-au scales surrounding the protostar to outer relatively cooler parts, offers an efficient pathway for thermal reprocessing during pre-stellar core collapse.

      <title>Initial results of our spectro-photometric monitoring of XZ Tau</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present here initial results of our spectro-photometric monitoring of XZ Tau. During our monitoring period, XZ Tau exhibited several episodes of brightness variations in timescales of months at optical wavelengths in contrast to the mid-infrared wavelengths. The color evolution of XZ Tau during this period suggest that the brightness variations are driven by changes in accretion from the disc. The mid-infrared light curve shows an overall decline in brightness by $\sim$ 0.5 and 0.7 magnitude respectively in WISE W1 (3.4 $\mu$m) and W2 (4.6 $\mu$m) bands. The emission profile of the hydrogen recombination lines along with that of Ca II IRT lines points towards magnetospheric accretion of XZ Tau. We have detected P Cygni profile in H$\beta$ indicating of outflowing winds from regions close to accretion. Forbidden transitions of oxygen are also detected, likely indicating of jets originating around the central pre-main sequence star.</description>

      <title>Eruption of a million-Kelvin warm magnetic flux rope on the Sun</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar magnetic flux rope (MFR) plays a central role in the physics of coronal mass ejections (CMEs). It mainly includes a cold filament at typical chromospheric temperatures (10000 K) and a hot channel at high coronal temperatures (10 MK). The warm MFR at quiescent coronal temperatures of a million Kelvin is, however, rarely reported. In this study, using multiwavelength images from Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board the Solar Dynamic Observatory (SDO) and Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUVI) on board the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory-A (STEREO-A), we present an eruption of a warm channel, that represents an MFR with quiescent coronal temperatures (0.6-2.5 MK). On 2022 May 8, we observed the failed eruption of a hot channel, with the average temperature and emission measure (EM) of 10 MK and 1.1*1028 cm^-5, using AIA high-temperature images in active region (AR) 13007. This failed eruption was associated with a C8.2 flare, with no CME. Subsequently, we observed a warm channel that appeared in AIA and EUVI low-temperature images, rather than AIA high-temperature images. It then erupted, and transformed toward a semi-circular shape. An associated C2.1 flare, along with the signatures of magnetic reconnection in AIA high-temperature images, were identified. Additionally, we observed a CME associated with this event. Compared with the hot channel, the warm channel is cooler and rarer with the average temperature and EM of 1.7 (1.6) MK and 2.0*1026 (2.3*1026) cm^-5. All the results suggest an unambiguous observation of the million-Kelvin warm MFR, that erupted as a CME, and fill a gap in the temperature domain of coronal MFRs.</description>

      <title>Electron densities of Transition Region Loops derived from IRIS O IV spectral data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Loops are fundamental structures in the magnetized atmosphere of the sun. Their physical properties are crucial for understanding the nature of the solar atmosphere. Transition region loops are relatively dynamic and their physical properties have not yet been fully understood. With spectral data of the line pair of O IV 1399.8 \AA &amp; 1401.2 \AA ($T_{max}=1.4\times10^5$ K) of 23 transition region loops obtained by IRIS, we carry out the first systematic analyses to their loop lengths ($L$), electron densities ($n_e$) and effective temperatures. We found electron densities, loop lengths and effective temperatures of these loops are in the ranges of $8.9\times10^{9}$-$3.5\times10^{11}$ cm$^{-3}$, 8-30 Mm and $1.9\times10^5$-$1.3\times10^6$ K, respectively. At a significant level of 90\%, regression analyses show that the relationship between electron densities and loop lengths is $n_e[cm^{-3}]\varpropto (L[Mm])^{-0.78\pm0.42}$, while the dependences of electron densities on effective temperatures and that on the line intensities are not obvious. These observations demonstrate that transition region loops are significantly different than their coronal counterparts. Further studies on the theoretical aspect based on the physical parameters obtained here are of significance for understanding the nature of transition region loops.</description>

      <title>Stellar population astrophysics (SPA) with the TNG: Measurement of the He I 10830{\AA} line in the open cluster Stock 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The precise measurement of stellar abundances plays a pivotal role in providing constraints on the chemical evolution of the Galaxy. However, before spectral lines can be employed as reliable abundance indicators, particularly for challenging elements such as helium, they must undergo thorough scrutiny. Galactic open clusters, representing well-defined single stellar populations, offer an ideal setting for unfolding the information stored in the helium spectral line feature. In this study, we characterize the profile and strength of the helium transition at around 10830{\AA} (He 10830) in nine giant stars in the Galactic open cluster Stock 2. To remove the influence of weak blending lines near the helium feature, we calibrated their oscillator strengths ($\log gf$) by employing corresponding abundances obtained from simultaneously observed optical spectra. Our observations reveal that He 10830 in all the targets is observed in absorption, with line strengths categorized into two groups. Three stars exhibit strong absorption, including a discernible secondary component, while the remaining stars exhibit weaker absorption. The lines are in symmetry and align with or around their rest wavelengths, suggesting a stable upper chromosphere without a significant systematic mass motion. We found a correlation between He 10830 strength and Ca II $\log{R'_\mathrm{HK}}$ index, with a slope similar to that reported in previous studies on dwarf stars. This correlation underscores the necessity of accounting for stellar chromosphere structure when employing He 10830 as a probe for stellar helium abundance. The procedure of measuring the He 10830 we developed in this study is applicable not only to other Galactic open clusters but also to field stars, with the aim of mapping helium abundance across various types of stars in the future.</description>

      <title>Development of a data overflow protection system for Super-Kamiokande to maximize data from nearby supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutrinos from very nearby supernovae, such as Betelgeuse, are expected to generate more than ten million events over 10\,s in Super-Kamokande (SK). At such large event rates, the buffers of the SK analog-to-digital conversion board (QBEE) will overflow, causing random loss of data that is critical for understanding the dynamics of the supernova explosion mechanism. In order to solve this problem, two new DAQ modules were developed to aid in the observation of very nearby supernovae. The first of these, the SN module, is designed to save only the number of hit PMTs during a supernova burst and the second, the Veto module, prescales the high rate neutrino events to prevent the QBEE from overflowing based on information from the SN module. In the event of a very nearby supernova, these modules allow SK to reconstruct the time evolution of the neutrino event rate from beginning to end using both QBEE and SN module data. This paper presents the development and testing of these modules together with an analysis of supernova-like data generated with a flashing laser diode. We demonstrate that the Veto module successfully prevents DAQ overflows for Betelgeuse-like supernovae as well as the long-term stability of the new modules. During normal running the Veto module is found to issue DAQ vetos a few times per month resulting in a total dead time less than 1\,ms, and does not influence ordinary operations. Additionally, using simulation data we find that supernovae closer than 800~pc will trigger Veto module resulting in a prescaling of the observed neutrino data.</description>

      <title>Atmospheric Mass Loss from TOI-1259 A b, a Gas Giant Planet With a White Dwarf Companion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The lack of close-in Neptune-mass exoplanets evident in transit surveys has largely been attributed either to photoevaporative mass loss or high-eccentricity migration. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we investigate the origins of TOI-1259 A b, a Saturn-mass (0.4 M$_J$, 1.0 R$_J$) exoplanet lying along the upper edge of the Neptune desert. TOI-1259 A b's close-in ($P$ = 3.48 days) orbit and low bulk density make the planet particularly vulnerable to photoevaporation. Using transits observed in the 1083 nm metastable helium line, we probe the upper atmosphere of TOI-1259 A b with the Hale Telescope at Palomar Observatory and the Near-Infrared Spectrograph on Keck II. We report an excess absorption of $0.395\pm{0.072}\%$ with Palomar and a blueshifted absorption of $2.4\pm0.52\%$ with Keck, consistent with an extended escaping atmosphere. Fitting this signal with a Parker wind model, we determine a corresponding atmospheric mass loss rate of log($\dot{M}$) = $10.33\pm 0.13$ g/s for a thermosphere temperature of $8400^{+1200}_{-1000}$ K based on the Palomar absorption and log($\dot{M}$) = $10.0\pm 0.1$ g/s for a thermosphere temperature of $8200^{+1000}_{-900}$ K based on the Keck absorption. This relatively low rate suggests that this planet would not have been significantly altered by mass loss even if it formed in-situ. However, the presence of a white dwarf companion, TOI-1259 B, hints that this planet may not have formed close-in, but rather migrated inward relatively late. Given the estimated parameters of the proto-white dwarf companion, we find that high-eccentricity migration is possible for the system.</description>

      <title>Astrometric detection of a Neptune-mass candidate planet in the nearest M-dwarf binary system GJ65 with VLTI/GRAVITY</title>

Abstract: The detection of low-mass planets orbiting the nearest stars is a central stake of exoplanetary science, as they can be directly characterized much more easily than their distant counterparts. Here, we present the results of our long-term astrometric observations of the nearest binary M-dwarf Gliese 65 AB (GJ65), located at a distance of only 2.67 pc. We monitored the relative astrometry of the two components from 2016 to 2023 with the VLTI/GRAVITY interferometric instrument. We derived highly accurate orbital parameters for the stellar system, along with the dynamical masses of the two red dwarfs. The GRAVITY measurements exhibit a mean accuracy per epoch of 50-60 microarcseconds in 1.5h of observing time using the 1.8m Auxiliary Telescopes. The residuals of the two-body orbital fit enable us to search for the presence of companions orbiting one of the two stars (S-type orbit) through the reflex motion they imprint on the differential A-B astrometry. We detected a Neptune-mass candidate companion with an orbital period of p = 156 +/- 1 d and a mass of m = 36 +/- 7 Mearth. The best-fit orbit is within the dynamical stability region of the stellar pair. It has a low eccentricity, e = 0.1 - 0.3, and the planetary orbit plane has a moderate-to-high inclination of i &gt; 30{\deg} with respect to the stellar pair, with further observations required to confirm these values. These observations demonstrate the capability of interferometric astrometry to reach microarcsecond accuracy in the narrow-angle regime for planet detection by reflex motion from the ground. This capability offers new perspectives and potential synergies with Gaia in the pursuit of low-mass exoplanets in the solar neighborhood.</description>

      <title>The Population of Massive Stars in AGN Disks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational instability in the outskirts of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) disks lead to disk fragmentation and formation of super-massive (several 10^2Msun) stars with potentially long lifetimes. Alternatively, stars can be captured ex-situ and grow from gas accretion in the AGN disk. However, the number density distribution throughout the disk is limited by thermal feedback as their luminosities provide the dominant heating source. We derive equilibrium stellar surface density profiles under two limiting contexts: in the case where the stellar lifetimes are prolonged due to recycling of hydrogen rich disk gas, only the fraction of gas converted into heat is removed from the disk accretion flow. Alternatively, if stellar composition recycling is inefficient and stars can evolve off the main sequence, the disk accretion rate is quenched towards smaller radii resembling a classical star-burst disk, albeit the effective removal rate depends not only on the stellar lifetime, but also the mass of stellar remnants. For AGNs with central Supermassive Black Hole (SMBH) masses of \sim 10^6 to 10^8Msun accreting at \sim 0.1 Eddington efficiency, we estimate a total number of 10^3 to 10^5 coexisting massive stars and the rate of stellar mergers to be 10^-3 to 1 per year. We motivate the detailed study of interaction between a swarm of massive stars through hydro and N body simulations to provide better prescriptions of dynamical processes in AGN disks, and to constrain more accurate estimates of the stellar population.</description>

      <title>Machine learning-based identification of Gaia astrometric exoplanet orbits</title>

Abstract: The third Gaia data release (DR3) contains $\sim$170 000 astrometric orbit solutions of two-body systems located within $\sim$500 pc of the Sun. Determining component masses in these systems, in particular of stars hosting exoplanets, usually hinges on incorporating complementary observations in addition to the astrometry, e.g. spectroscopy and radial velocities. Several DR3 two-body systems with exoplanet, brown-dwarf, stellar, and black-hole components have been confirmed in this way. We developed an alternative machine learning approach that uses only the DR3 orbital solutions with the aim of identifying the best candidates for exoplanets and brown-dwarf companions. Based on confirmed substellar companions in the literature, we use semi-supervised anomaly detection methods in combination with extreme gradient boosting and random forest classifiers to determine likely low-mass outliers in the population of non-single sources. We employ and study feature importance to investigate the method's plausibility and produced a list of 22 best candidates of which four are exoplanet candidates and another five are either very-massive brown dwarfs or very-low mass stars. Three candidates, including one initial exoplanet candidate, correspond to false-positive solutions where longer-period binary star motion was fitted with a biased shorter-period orbit. We highlight nine candidates with brown-dwarf companions for preferential follow-up. One candidate companion around the Sun-like star G 15-6 could be confirmed as a genuine brown dwarf using external radial-velocity data. This new approach is a powerful complement to the traditional identification methods for substellar companions among Gaia astrometric orbits. It is particularly relevant in the context of Gaia DR4 and its expected exoplanet discovery yield.</description>

      <title>The effects of finite electron inertia on helicity-barrier-mediated turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the partitioning of turbulent energy between ions and electrons in weakly collisional plasmas is crucial for the accurate interpretation of observations and modelling of various astrophysical phenomena. Many such plasmas are "imbalanced", wherein the large-scale energy input is dominated by Alfv\'enic fluctuations propagating in a single direction. In this paper, we demonstrate that when strongly-magnetised plasma turbulence is imbalanced, nonlinear conservation laws imply the existence of a critical value of the electron plasma beta that separates two dramatically different types of turbulence in parameter space. For betas below the critical value, the free energy injected on the largest scales is able to undergo a familiar Kolmogorov-type cascade to small scales where it is dissipated, heating electrons. For betas above the critical value, the system forms a "helicity barrier" that prevents the cascade from proceeding past the ion Larmor radius, causing the majority of the injected free energy to be deposited into ion heating. Physically, the helicity barrier results from the inability of the system to adjust to the disparity between the perpendicular-wavenumber scalings of the free energy and generalised helicity below the ion Larmor radius; restoring finite electron inertia can annul, or even reverse, this disparity, giving rise to the aforementioned critical beta. We relate this physics to the "dynamic phase alignment" mechanism, and characterise various other important features of the helicity barrier, including the nature of the nonlinear wavenumber-space fluxes, dissipation rates, and energy spectra. The existence of such a critical beta has important implications for heating, as it suggests that the dominant recipient of the turbulent energy -- ions or electrons -- can depend sensitively on the characteristics of the plasma at large scales.</description>

      <title>Eddington envelopes: The fate of stars on parabolic orbits tidally disrupted by supermassive black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stars falling too close to massive black holes in the centres of galaxies can be torn apart by the strong tidal forces. Simulating the subsequent feeding of the black hole with disrupted material has proved challenging because of the range of timescales involved. Here we report a set of simulations that capture the relativistic disruption of the star, followed by one year of evolution of the returning debris stream. These reveal the formation of an expanding asymmetric bubble of material extending to hundreds of astronomical units -- an Eddington envelope with an optically thick inner region. Such envelopes have been hypothesised as the reprocessing layer needed to explain optical/UV emission in tidal disruption events, but never produced self-consistently in a simulation. Our model broadly matches the observed light curves with low temperatures, faint luminosities, and line widths of 10,000--20,000 km/s.</description>

      <title>Bayesian inference of neutron-skin thickness and neutron-star observables based on effective nuclear interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have obtained the constraints on the density dependence of the symmetry energy from neutron-skin thickness data by parity-violating electron scatterings and neutron-star observables using a Bayesian approach, based on the standard Skyrme-Hartree-Fock (SHF) model and its extension as well as the relativistic mean-field (RMF) model. While the neutron-skin thickness data (neutron-star observables) mostly constrain the symmetry energy at subsaturation (suprasaturation) densities, they may more or less constrain the behavior of the symmetry energy at suprasaturation (subsaturation) densities, depending on the energy-density functional form. Besides showing the final posterior density dependence of the symmetry energy, we also compare the slope parameters of the symmetry energy at 0.10 fm$^{-3}$ as well as the values of the symmetry energy at twice saturation density from three effective nuclear interactions. The present work serves as a comparison study based on relativistic and nonrelativistic energy-density functionals for constraining the nuclear symmetry energy from low to high densities using a Bayesian approach.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the barometric equation and the extent of a planetary atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The standard barometric equation predicts the molecular concentration $n(z)=n_0\exp(-z/L)$ where $L=k_BT/mg$. Because the mean free path $l=1/n\sigma$ increases exponentially, we show that at high altitudes $z$, the equation is no longer within the domain of applicability of the standard kinetic theory $l\ll L$. Here, we predict the dependence $n(z)\propto z^{-2}$ for the case $l\gg L$ in uniform gravity. It corresponds to a non-stationary planetary atmosphere with hydrogen accretion. The predicted accretion is accompanied by a release of gravitational potential energy that leads to heating of the atmosphere. In that context, we suggest gravitational energy could be the elusive source that drives the formation of stellar coronas. Other consequences of accretion are: slowly decaying tails of planetary atmospheres, the existence of gas giants, and periodical hydrogen explosions of white dwarfs.</description>

      <title>Measuring a gravitomagentic effect with the triple pulsar PSR J0337+1715</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To the first post--Newtonian order, the orbital angular momentum of the fast--revolving inner binary of the triple system PSR J0337+1715, made of a millisecond pulsar and a white dwarf, induces an annular gravitomagnetic field which displaces the line of apsides of the slower orbit of the other, distant white dwarf by $-1.2$ milliarcseconds per year. The current accuracy in determining the periastron of the outer orbit is $63.9$ milliarcseconds after 1.38 years of data collection. By hypothesizing a constant rate of measurement of the pulsar's times of arrivals over the next 10 years, assumed equal to the present one, it can be argued that the periastron will be finally known to a $\simeq 0.15$ milliarcseconds level, while its cumulative gravitomagnetic retrograde shift will be as large as $-12$ milliarcseconds. The competing post--Newtonian gravitolectric periastron advance due to the inner binary's masses, nominally amounting to $74.3$ milliarcseconds per year, can be presently modelled to an accuracy level as good as $\simeq 0.04$ milliarcseconds per year. The mismodelling in the much larger Newtonian periastron rate due to the quadrupolar term of the multipolar expansion of the gravitational potential of a massive ring, whose nominal size for PSR J0337+1715 is $0.17$ degrees per year, might be reduced down to the $\simeq 0.5$ milliarcseconds per year level over the next 10 years. Thus, a first measurement of such a novel form of gravitomagnetism, although challenging, may be somehow feasible in a not too distant future.</description>

      <title>Dust Formation in Common Envelope Binary Interaction -- I: 3D Simulations Using the Bowen Approximation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.16609v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We carried out 3D smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations of the common envelope binary interaction using the approximation of Bowen to calculate the dust opacity in order to investigate the resulting dust-driven accelerations. We have simulated two types of binary star: a 1.7 and a 3.7 $M_{\odot}$ thermally-pulsating, asymptotic giant branch stars with a 0.6 $M_{\odot}$ companion. We carried out simulations using both an ideal gas and a tabulated equations of state, with the latter considering the recombination energy of the envelope. We found that the dust-driven wind leads to a relatively small increase in the unbound gas, with the effect being smaller for the tabulated equation of state simulations and for the more massive primary. Dust acceleration does contribute to envelope expansion with only a slightly elongated morphology, if we believe the results from the tabulated equation of state as more reliable. The Bowen opacities in the outer envelopes of the two models, at late times, are large enough that the photosphere of the post-inspiral object is about ten times larger compared to the same without accounting for the dust opacities. As such, the prediction of the appearance of the transient would change substantially if dust is included.</description>

      <title>Origin and Properties of the Near Subsonic Solar Wind Observed by Parker Solar Probe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05557v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We identify and examine the solar wind intervals near the sonic critical point (i.e., $M_S \sim 1$) observed by the Parker Solar Probe (PSP). The near subsonic wind intervals show similar properties: a low density, an extremely low velocity, a low proton temperature, and essentially no magnetic field deflections compared with the surrounding solar wind. The extremely low velocity is the primary contributor to the near crossing of the sonic critical point rather than the sound speed, which is roughly constant in these intervals. Source tracing with a potential field source surface (PFSS) model suggests that the near subsonic intervals all connect to the boundaries inside coronal holes. Heliospheric current sheet (HCS) and partial HCS crossings around the near subsonic intervals indicate that the near subsonic wind is a transition layer between the slow and fast wind. The above scenario is consistent with the nature of the near subsonic wind as a low Mach-number boundary layer (LMBL), which facilitates the crossing of the sonic critical point at 15-20 $R_S$. Moreover, we find a dependence of the amplitude of switchbacks on the radial sonic Mach number. Magnetic field deflections essentially disappear near the sonic critical point, which suggests that switchbacks originate from above the sonic critical point.</description>

      <title>The solar dynamo begins near the surface</title>

Abstract: The Sun's magnetic dynamo cycle features a distinct pattern: a propagating region of sunspot emergence appears around 30 degrees latitude and vanishes near the equator every 11 years. Moreover, longitudinal flows called "torsional oscillations" closely shadow sunspot migration, undoubtedly sharing a common cause. Contrary to theories suggesting deep origins for these phenomena, helioseismology pinpoints low-latitude torsional oscillations to the Sun's outer 5-10%, the "Near-Surface Shear Layer". Within this zone, inwardly increasing differential rotation coupled with a poloidal magnetic field strongly implicates the Magneto-Rotational Instability prominent in accretion-disk theory and observed in laboratory experiments. Together, these two facts prompt the general question: Is it possible that the solar dynamo is a near-surface instability? Here, we report strong affirmative evidence in stark contrast to traditional paradigms focusing on the deeper tachocline. Simple analytic estimates show that the near-surface magneto-rotational instability better explains the spatiotemporal scales of the torsional oscillations and inferred subsurface magnetic field amplitudes. State-of-the-art numerical simulations corroborate these estimates and, strikingly, reproduce hemispherical magnetic current helicity laws. The dynamo resulting from a well-understood near-surface phenomenon improves prospects for accurate predictions of full magnetic cycles and space weather, impacting Earth's electromagnetic infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Testing an exact diffraction formula with gravitational wave source lensed by a supermassive black hole in binary systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01581v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When it comes to long-wavelength gravitational waves (GWs), diffraction effect becomes significant when these waves are lensed by celestial bodies. Typically, the traditional diffraction integral formula neglects large-angle diffraction, which is often adequate for most of cases. Nonetheless, there are specific scenarios, such as when a GW source is lensed by a supermassive black hole in a binary system, where the lens and source are in close proximity, where large-angle diffraction can play a crucial role. In our prior research, we have introduced an exact, general diffraction integral formula that accounts for large-angle diffraction as well. This paper explores the disparities between this exact diffraction formula and the traditional, approximate one under various special conditions. Our findings indicate that, under specific parameters, such as a lens-source distance of $D_{\rm LS}=0.1$\,AU and a lens mass of $M_{\rm L}=4\times10^{6}M_\odot$, the amplification factor for the exact diffraction formula is notably smaller than that of the approximate formula, differing by a factor of approximately $r_F\simeq0.806$. This difference is substantial enough to be detectable. Furthermore, our study reveals that the proportionality factor $r_F$ gradually increases from 0.5 to 1 as $D_{\rm LS}$ increases, and decreases as $M_{\rm L}$ increases. Significant differences between the exact and approximate formulas are observable when $D_{\rm LS}\lesssim0.2$ AU (assuming $M_{\rm L}=4\times10^{6}M_\odot$) or when $M_{\rm L}\gtrsim2\times10^6M_\odot$ (assuming $D_{\rm LS}=0.1$ AU). These findings suggest that there is potential to validate our general diffraction formula through future GW detections.</description>

Abstract: Light curves of ellipsoidal variables collected by the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) were analyzed, in order to search for dormant black hole candidates. After the preselection based on the amplitude of ellipsoidal modulation, each object was investigated by means of the spectral energy distribution fit, which allowed us to select objects that are in close agreement with the spectrum of a single stellar object. After this final step of the preselection process, we were left with only fourteen objects that were then investigated in detail. For each candidate, we estimated basic physical parameters such as temperature, mass, luminosity, and, in some cases, radial velocity semi-amplitude. One of the objects turned out to be a spotted star while the rest are considered black-hole binary candidates. In the end, we present an alternative explanation for the ellipsoidal modulation in the form of contact binaries, which are not only vast in number, contrary to black-hole binaries, but are also in much better agreement with the radial velocity estimates for some of the systems analyzed. Even if the presented arguments suggest a noncompact character of the companion objects, each of them should be observed spectroscopically in order to verify the compact object hypothesis.</description>

      <title>The APO-K2 Catalog. II. Accurate Stellar Ages for Red Giant Branch Stars across the Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16250v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present stellar age determinations for 4661 red giant branch stars in the APO-K2 catalog, derived using mass estimates from K2 asteroseismology from the K2 Galactic Archaeology Program and elemental abundances from the Apache Point Galactic Evolution Experiment survey. Our sample includes 17 of the 19 fields observed by K2, making it one of the most comprehensive catalogs of accurate stellar ages across the Galaxy in terms of the wide range of populations spanned by its stars, enabling rigorous tests of Galactic chemical evolution models. Taking into account the selection functions of the K2 sample, the data appear to support the age-chemistry morphology of stellar populations predicted by both inside-out and late-burst scenarios. We also investigate trends in age versus stellar chemistry and Galactic position, which are consistent with previous findings. Comparisons against APOKASC-3 asteroseismic ages show agreement to within ~3%. We also discuss offsets between our ages and spectroscopic ages. Finally, we note that ignoring the effects of $\alpha$-enhancement on stellar opacity (either directly or with the Salaris metallicity correction) results in an ~10% offset in age estimates for the most $\alpha$-enhanced stars, which is an important consideration for continued tests of Galactic models with this and other asteroseismic age samples.</description>
