      <title>Links between Entropy, Complexity, and the Technological Singularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entropy always increases monotonically in a closed system but complexity increases at first and then decreases as equilibrium is approached. Commonsense information-related definitions for entropy and complexity demonstrate that complexity behaves like the time derivative of entropy, which is proposed here as a new definition for complexity. A 20-year-old study had attempted to quantify complexity (in arbitrary units) for the entire Universe in terms of 28 milestones, breaks in historical perspective, and had concluded that complexity will soon begin decreasing. That conclusion is now corroborated by other researchers. In addition, the exponential runaway technology trend advocated by supporters of the singularity hypothesis, which was in part based on the trend of the very 28 milestones mentioned above, would have anticipated five new such milestones by now, but none have been observed. The conclusions of the 20-year-old study remain valid: we are at the maximum of complexity and we should expect the next two milestones at around 2033 and 2078.</description>

      <title>A Quantitative Model Of Social Group Sizes From The Dynamics of Trust</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an argument (for a cross disciplinary audience) to explain the Dunbar scaling hierarchy for social groups. Our analysis is based on the Promise Theory of trust, and basic dimensional analysis. We derive a universal scaling relation, and pinpoint how groups form from the seeding of individuals by relative alignment, which continues until the costs associated with group contention outweigh the benefits in a detailed balance scenario. We identify an `energy' parameter for this balance that has the semantics of trust in a social setting. Subject to partial efficiency of maintaining aligned intentions, we can calculate a series of compatible rates that balance growth with entropy.</description>

      <title>The Scope 4 Emission: Neutralized Carbon Emissions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assessing carbon negative and carbon neutrality is critical for mitigating and adapting global climate change. Here we proposed a new framework to account for carbon-negative and carbon-neutral actions by introducing the definition of Carbon Negative (C0),Carbon Neutrality Stock (C1), Carbon Supply (C2) and carbon-neutral emissions or Scope 4 emissions, which refers to the avoided emission due to use of non-fossil energy or C1 products. For the first time, we calculated the global neutralized carbon emissions or Scope 4 emission by renewable electricity generation, and the results indicating the significant contributions by China, with total neutralized carbon emissions (2.15 Mt C/day ) much higher than the U.S. (0.85 Mt C/day)and EU27 &amp; UK (1.25 Mt C/day) together. We show that China contributed to more than 36% of global neutralized CO2 emissions, and such contributions are still increasing. This new framework reflects remarkable contributions for China to the global climate mitigation through the development of carbon neutrality energy system.</description>

      <title>Multifractality of complex networks is also due to geometry. The Geometric SandBox algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past three decades, describing the reality surrounding us using the language of complex networks has become very useful and therefore popular. One of the most important features, especially of real networks, is their complexity, which often manifests itself in a fractal or even multifractal structure. As a generalisation of fractal analysis, multifractal analysis of complex networks is a useful tool for the identification and quantitative description of the spatial hierarchy of both theoretical and numerical fractal patterns. Nowadays, there are many methods of multifractal analysis. However, all these methods take into account only the fact of connection between nodes (and eventually the weight of edges) and do not take into account the real positions (coordinates) of nodes in space. However, intuition suggests that the geometry of network nodes' position should have a significant impact on its true fractal structure. Many networks identified in nature (e.g. air connection networks, energy networks, social networks, mountain ridge networks, networks of neurones in the brain, street networks) have their own often unique and characteristic geometry, which is not taken into account in the identification process of multifractality in commonly used methods. In this paper, we propose a multifractal network analysis method that takes into account both connections between nodes and the location coordinates of nodes (network geometry). We show the results for different geometrical variants of the same network and reveal that this method, contrary to the commonly used method, is sensitive to changes in network geometry. We carry out tests for synthetic as well as for real-world networks.</description>

      <title>Cooperation in Public Goods Games: Leveraging Other-Regarding Reinforcement Learning on Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cooperation as a self-organized collective behavior plays a significant role in the evolution of ecosystems and human society. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a new perspective, distinct from imitation learning in evolutionary games, for exploring the mechanisms underlying its emergence. However, most existing studies with the public good game (PGG) employ a self-regarding setup or are on pairwise interaction networks. Players in the real world, however, optimize their policies based not only on their histories but also on the histories of their co-players, and the game is played in a group manner. In the work, we investigate the evolution of cooperation in the PGG under the other-regarding reinforcement learning evolutionary game (OR-RLEG) on hypergraph by combining the Q-learning algorithm and evolutionary game framework, where other players' action history is incorporated and the game is played on hypergraphs. Our results show that as the synergy factor increases, the parameter interval is divided into three distinct regions, the absence of cooperation (AC), medium cooperation (MC), and high cooperation (HC), accompanied by two abrupt transitions in the cooperation level near two transition points, respectively. Interestingly, we identify regular and anti-coordinated chessboard structures in the spatial pattern that positively contribute to the first cooperation transition but adversely affect the second. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical treatment for the first transition with an approximated first transition point and reveal that players with a long-sighted perspective and low exploration rate are more likely to reciprocate kindness with each other, thus facilitating the emergence of cooperation. Our findings contribute to understanding the evolution of human cooperation, where other-regarding information and group interactions are commonplace.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Median Voter: How Affective Polarization Shapes Party Polarization in Multidimensional Ideological Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contrary to what is expected by the median voter theorem, party polarization has emerged as a global political phenomenon, particularly pronounced in the United States. Amid concerns that this phenomenon threatens democracies, political science has sought explanations for its causes. One explanation is that affective (or social) polarization simplifies the voters' political mindset, reducing the dimensionality of identity space and compressing the diversity of interests and information in the political system. To theoretically investigate such findings, we studied a mathematical model of bipartisan elections in which voters and parties share a multidimensional ideological space. We established equations that determine the critical value of the expected number of voters for a party, which delineates the point at which it is more strategically advantageous for parties to position themselves at the center or outside of it. This critical value fundamentally depends on the dimension of the ideological space, which we identify as being related to affective polarization and which considerably mitigates party polarization as the dimension increases, even with preexisting population bimodality, the latter being related to issue polarization. This result aligns with the thesis that affective polarization, more than issue polarization, drives party polarization, offering a framework for how this phenomenon occurs.</description>

      <title>Minimizing emissions through ride pooling incentives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In face of the climate emergency and growing challenges ranging from pollution to traffic jams, ride pooling has been floated as a potential solution for less congested, low-carbon and more space-efficient urban transport. However, it is unclear which system configurations enable an economically viable case for shared pooled mobility. To gain a better understanding of mechanisms behind this, we develop a simplified model to analyze the switching potential and CO2 emissions of ride pooling systems for a given number of transport users, street network topology and other system parameter values with different hypothetical switch rate functions. We find that CO2 emissions of local transport can be reduced by 39 to 45 % depending on the assumed switch rate function with other system parameters only having a secondary effect of a few percentage points. We call for empirically gauged analyses that translate our model into scenarios for metropolitan low-carbon and smart para-transit.</description>

      <title>Evidence of equilibrium dynamics in human social networks evolving in time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of personal relationships remain largely unexplored due to the inherent difficulties of the longitudinal data collection process. In this paper, we analyse a dataset tracking the temporal evolution of a network of personal relationships among 900 people over the course of four years. We search for evidence that the network is in equilibrium, meaning that all macroscopic properties remain constant, fluctuating around stable values, while the internal microscopic dynamics are active. We find that the probabilities governing the network dynamics are stationary over time and that the degree distributions, as well as edge and triangle abundances match the theoretical equilibrium distributions expected under these dynamics. Furthermore, we verify that the system satisfies the detailed balance condition, with only minor point deviations, confirming that it is indeed in equilibrium. Remarkably, this equilibrium persists despite a high turnover in network composition, suggesting that it is an inherent characteristic of human social interactions rather than a trait of the individuals themselves. We argue that this equilibrium may be a general feature of human social networks arising from the competition between different dynamical mechanisms and also from the cognitive and material resources management of individuals. From a practical perspective, the fact that networks are in equilibrium could simplify data collection processes, validate the use of cross-sectional data-based methods like Exponential Random Graph Models, and inform the design of interventions. Our findings advance the understanding of collective human behaviour predictability and our ability to describe it using simple mathematical models.</description>

      <title>How social reinforcement learning can lead to metastable polarisation and the voter model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07993v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Previous explanations for the persistence of polarization of opinions have typically included modelling assumptions that predispose the possibility of polarization (i.e., assumptions allowing a pair of agents to drift apart in their opinion such as repulsive interactions or bounded confidence). An exception is a recent simulation study showing that polarization is persistent when agents form their opinions using social reinforcement learning.
  Our goal is to highlight the usefulness of reinforcement learning in the context of modeling opinion dynamics, but that caution is required when selecting the tools used to study such a model. We show that the polarization observed in the model of the simulation study cannot persist indefinitely, and exhibits consensus asymptotically with probability one. By constructing a link between the reinforcement learning model and the voter model, we argue that the observed polarization is metastable. Finally, we show that a slight modification in the learning process of the agents changes the model from being non-ergodic to being ergodic.
  Our results show that reinforcement learning may be a powerful method for modelling polarization in opinion dynamics, but that the tools (objects to study such as the stationary distribution, or time to absorption for example) appropriate for analysing such models crucially depend on their properties (such as ergodicity, or transience). These properties are determined by the details of the learning process and may be difficult to identify based solely on simulations.</description>

      <title>Indirect reciprocity under opinion synchronization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05551v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Indirect reciprocity is a key explanation for the exceptional magnitude of cooperation among humans. This literature suggests that a large proportion of human cooperation is driven by social norms and individuals' incentives to maintain a good reputation. This intuition has been formalized with two types of models. In public assessment models, all community members are assumed to agree on each others' reputations; in private assessment models, people may have disagreements. Both types of models aim to understand the interplay of social norms and cooperation. Yet their results can be vastly different. Public assessment models argue that cooperation can evolve easily, and that the most effective norms tend to be stern. Private assessment models often find cooperation to be unstable, and successful norms show some leniency. Here, we propose a model that can organize these differing results within a single framework. We show that the stability of cooperation depends on a single quantity: the extent to which individual opinions turn out to be correlated. This correlation is determined by a group's norms and the structure of social interactions. In particular, we prove that no cooperative norm is evolutionarily stable when individual opinions are statistically independent. These results have important implications for our understanding of cooperation, conformity, and polarization.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Relationship Between News Source Sharing and Political Beliefs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10837v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In an era marked by an abundance of news sources, access to information significantly influences public opinion. Notably, the bias of news sources often serves as an indicator of individuals' political leanings. This study explores this hypothesis by examining the news sharing behavior of politically active social media users, whose political ideologies were identified in a previous study. Using correspondence analysis, we estimate the Media Sharing Index (MSI), a measure that captures bias in media outlets and user preferences within a hidden space. During Argentina's 2019 election on Twitter, we observed a predictable pattern: center-right individuals predominantly shared media from center-right biased outlets. However, it is noteworthy that those with center-left inclinations displayed a more diverse media consumption, which is a significant finding. Despite a noticeable polarization based on political affiliation observed in a retweet network analysis, center-left users showed more diverse media sharing preferences, particularly concerning the MSI. Although these findings are specific to Argentina, the developed methodology can be applied in other countries to assess the correlation between users' political leanings and the media they share.</description>
