      <title>Implicit representations via the polynomial method</title>

Abstract: Semialgebraic graphs are graphs whose vertices are points in $\mathbb{R}^d$, and adjacency between two vertices is determined by the truth value of a semialgebraic predicate of constant complexity. We show how to harness polynomial partitioning methods to construct compact adjacency labeling schemes for families of semialgebraic graphs.
  That is, we show that for any family of semialgebraic graphs, given a graph on $n$ vertices in this family, we can assign a label consisting of $O(n^{1-2/(d+1) + \varepsilon})$ bits to each vertex (where $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ can be made arbitrarily small and the constant of proportionality depends on $\varepsilon$ and on the complexity of the adjacency-defining predicate), such that adjacency between two vertices can be determined solely from their two labels, without any additional information. We obtain for instance that unit disk graphs and segment intersection graphs have such labelings with labels of $O(n^{1/3 + \varepsilon})$ bits. This is in contrast to their natural implicit representation consisting of the coordinates of the disk centers or segment endpoints, which sometimes require exponentially many bits. It also improves on the best known bound of $O(n^{1-1/d}\log n)$ for $d$-dimensional semialgebraic families due to Alon (Discrete Comput. Geom., 2024), a bound that holds more generally for graphs with shattering functions bounded by a degree-$d$ polynomial.
  We also give new bounds on the size of adjacency labels for other families of graphs. In particular, we consider semilinear graphs, which are semialgebraic graphs in which the predicate only involves linear polynomials. We show that semilinear graphs have adjacency labels of size $O(\log n)$. We also prove that polygon visibility graphs, which are not semialgebraic in the above sense, have adjacency labels of size $O(\log^3 n)$.</description>

      <title>Sharp Thresholds for Temporal Motifs and Doubling Time in Random Temporal Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01847v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study two natural models of \textit{random temporal} graphs. In the first, the \textit{continuous} model, each edge $e$ is assigned $l_e$ labels, each drawn uniformly at random from $(0,1]$, where the numbers $l_e$ are independent random variables following the same discrete probability distribution. In the second, the \textit{discrete} model, the $l_e$ labels of each edge $e$ are chosen uniformly at random from a set $\{1,2,\ldots,T\}$. In both models we study the existence of \textit{$\delta$-temporal motifs}. Here a $\delta$-temporal motif consists of a pair $(H,P)$, where $H$ is a fixed static graph and $P$ is a partial order over its edges. A temporal graph $\mathcal{G}=(G,\lambda)$ contains $(H,P)$ as a $\delta$-temporal motif if $\mathcal{G}$ has a simple temporal subgraph on the edges of $H$ whose time labels are ordered according to $P$, and whose life duration is at most $\delta$. We prove \textit{sharp existence thresholds} for all $\delta$-temporal motifs, and we identify a qualitatively different behavior from the analogous static thresholds in Erdos-Renyi random graphs. Applying the same techniques, we then characterize the growth of the largest $\delta$-temporal clique in the continuous variant of our random temporal graphs model. Finally, we consider the \textit{doubling time} of the reachability ball centered on a small set of vertices of the random temporal graph as a natural proxy for temporal expansion. We prove \textit{sharp upper and lower bounds} for the maximum doubling time in the continuous model.</description>

      <title>Acyclic colourings of graphs with obstructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.08417v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a graph $G$, a colouring of $G$ is \emph{acyclic} if it is a proper colouring of $G$ and every cycle contains at least three colours. Its acyclic chromatic number $\chi_a(G)$ is the minimum~$k$ such that an acyclic $k$-colouring of $G$ exists. When $G$ has maximum degree $\Delta$, it is known that $\chi_a(G) = \mathcal {O}(\Delta^{4/3})$ as $\Delta \to \infty$, and that $\chi_a(G) = \mathcal {O}(\sqrt{t} \cdot \Delta)$ if in addition $G$ does not contain $K_{2,t}$ as a subgraph. We study the extremal value of the acyclic chromatic number in the class of graphs of maximum degree $\Delta$ that do not contain some fixed subgraph $F$ on $t$ vertices. We establish that this extremal value is at most $\mathcal {O}(t^{8/3}\Delta^{2/3})$ if $F$ is a tree, $\mathcal {O}(\sqrt{t} \cdot \Delta)$ if $F$ is bipartite and can be made acyclic with the removal of one vertex, $2\Delta + \mathcal {O}(t\Delta^{2/3})$ if $F$ is an even cycle of length at least $6$, and $\mathcal {O}(t^{1/4}\Delta^{5/4})$ if $F=K_{3,t}$. Moreover, we exhibit an infinite family of obstructions $F$ that each induces a different asymptotic behaviour for this extremal value. This is obtained with the derivation of lower bounds that come from the analysis of the acyclic chromatic number of a random graph drawn from either $G(n,p)$ or $G(n,n,p)$, that we entirely determine up to a ${\rm polylog}(n)$ factor. As a byproduct, we can certify that most of our results are tight up to a $\Delta^{\mathcal{O}(1/t)}$ factor.</description>

      <title>Sparse Approximation in Lattices and Semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23990v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper deals with the following question: Suppose that there exist an integer or a non-negative integer solution $x$ to a system $Ax = b$, where the number of non-zero components of $x$ is $n$. The target is, for a given natural number $k &lt; n$, to approximate $b$ with $Ay$ where $y$ is an integer or non-negative integer solution with at most $k$ non-zero components. We establish upper bounds for this question in general. In specific cases, these bounds are tight. If we view the approximation quality as a function of the parameter $k$, then the paper explains why the quality of the approximation increases exponentially as $k$ goes to $n$. This paper is a complete version of an extended abstract that appeared at the 26th International Conference on Integer Programming and Combinatorial Optimization (IPCO).</description>

      <title>Oriented discrepancy of Hamilton cycles in oriented graphs satisfying Ore-type condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05968v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Erd{\H o}s (1963) initiated extensive graph discrepancy research on 2-edge-colored graphs. Gishboliner, Krivelevich, and Michaeli (2023) launched similar research on oriented graphs. They conjectured the following extension of Dirac's theorem: If $D$ is an oriented graph on $n \ge 3$ vertices with minimum degree $\delta (D) \ge n/ 2$, then $D$ contains a Hamilton oriented cycle with at least $\delta(D)$ arcs in the same direction. This conjecture was proved by Freschi and Lo (2024) who posed an open problem to extend their result to an Ore-type condition. We propose two conjectures for such extensions and prove results which provide support to the conjectures.</description>

      <title>A Tutte-type canonical decomposition of 3- and 4-connected graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00760v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a unique decomposition of every 4-connected graph into parts that are either quasi-5-connected, cycles of triangle-torsos and 3-connected torsos on $\leq 5$ vertices, generalised double-wheels, or thickened $K_{4,m}$'s. The decomposition can be described in terms of a tree-decomposition but with edges allowed in the adhesion-sets. Our construction is explicit, canonical, and exhibits a defining property of the Tutte-decomposition.
  As a corollary, we obtain a new Tutte-type canonical decomposition of 3-connected graphs into parts that are either quasi-4-connected, generalised wheels or thickened $K_{3,m}$'s. This decomposition is similar yet different from the tri-separation decomposition.
  As an application of the decomposition for 4-connectivity, in a follow-up paper we obtain a new theorem characterising all vertex-transitive finite connected graphs as essentially quasi-5-connected or on a short explicit list of graphs.</description>

      <title>New bounds for proper $h$-conflict-free colourings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04543v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A proper $k$-colouring of a graph $G$ is called $h$-conflict-free if every vertex $v$ has at least $\min\, \{h, {\rm deg}(v)\}$ colours appearing exactly once in its neighbourhood. Let $\chi_{\rm pcf}^h(G)$ denote the minimum $k$ such that such a colouring exists. We show that for every fixed $h\ge 1$, every graph $G$ of maximum degree $\Delta$ satisfies $\chi_{\rm pcf}^h(G) \le h\Delta + \mathcal{O}(\log \Delta)$. This expands on the work of Cho et al., and improves a recent result of Liu and Reed in the case $h=1$. We conjecture that for every $h\ge 1$ and every graph $G$ of maximum degree $\Delta$ sufficiently large, the bound $\chi_{\rm pcf}^h(G) \le h\Delta + 1$ should hold, which would be tight. When the minimum degree $\delta$ of $G$ is sufficiently large, namely $\delta \ge \max\{100h, 2000\log \Delta\}$, we show that this upper bound can be further reduced to $\chi_{\rm{pcf}}^h(G) \le \Delta + \mathcal{O}(\sqrt{h\Delta})$. This improves a recent bound from Kamyczura and Przyby{\l}o when $\delta \le \sqrt{h\Delta}$.</description>

Abstract: We prove that any class of graphs with linear neighborhood complexity has bounded improper odd chromatic number. As a result, if $\mathcal{G}$ is the class of all circle graphs, or if $\mathcal{G}$ is any class with bounded twin-width, bounded merge-width, or a forbidden vertex-minor, then $\mathcal{G}$ is $\chi_{\mathrm{o}}$-bounded.</description>

      <title>Tight Bounds for Sparsifying Random CSPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13345v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The problem of CSP sparsification asks: for a given CSP instance, what is the sparsest possible reweighting such that for every possible assignment to the instance, the number of satisfied constraints is preserved up to a factor of $1 \pm \epsilon$? We initiate the study of the sparsification of random CSPs. In particular, we consider two natural random models: the $r$-partite model and the uniform model. In the $r$-partite model, CSPs are formed by partitioning the variables into $r$ parts, with constraints selected by randomly picking one vertex out of each part. In the uniform model, $r$ distinct vertices are chosen at random from the pool of variables to form each constraint.
  In the $r$-partite model, we exhibit a sharp threshold phenomenon. For every predicate $P$, there is an integer $k$ such that a random instance on $n$ vertices and $m$ edges cannot (essentially) be sparsified if $m \le n^k$ and can be sparsified to size $\approx n^k$ if $m \ge n^k$. Here, $k$ corresponds to the largest copy of the AND which can be found within $P$. Furthermore, these sparsifiers are simple, as they can be constructed by i.i.d. sampling of the edges.
  In the uniform model, the situation is a bit more complex. For every predicate $P$, there is an integer $k$ such that a random instance on $n$ vertices and $m$ edges cannot (essentially) be sparsified if $m \le n^k$ and can sparsified to size $\approx n^k$ if $m \ge n^{k+1}$. However, for some predicates $P$, if $m \in [n^k, n^{k+1}]$, there may or may not be a nontrivial sparsifier. In fact, we show that there are predicates where the sparsifiability of random instances is non-monotone, i.e., as we add more random constraints, the instances become more sparsifiable. We give a precise (efficiently computable) procedure for determining which situation a specific predicate $P$ falls into.</description>

      <title>A Finer View of the Parameterized Landscape of Labeled Graph Contractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06102v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the \textsc{Labeled Contractibility} problem, where the input consists of two vertex-labeled graphs $G$ and $H$, and the goal is to determine whether $H$ can be obtained from $G$ via a sequence of edge contractions.
  Lafond and Marchand~[WADS 2025] initiated the parameterized complexity study of this problem, showing it to be \(\W[1]\)-hard when parameterized by the number \(k\) of allowed contractions. They also proved that the problem is fixed-parameter tractable when parameterized by the tree-width \(\tw\) of \(G\), via an application of Courcelle's theorem resulting in a non-constructive algorithm.
  In this work, we present a constructive fixed-parameter algorithm for \textsc{Labeled Contractibility} with running time \(2^{\mathcal{O}(\tw^2)} \cdot |V(G)|^{\mathcal{O}(1)}\). We also prove that unless the Exponential Time Hypothesis (\ETH) fails, it does not admit an algorithm running in time \(2^{o(\tw^2)} \cdot |V(G)|^{\mathcal{O}(1)}\). This result adds \textsc{Labeled Contractibility} to a small list of problems that admit such a lower bound and matching algorithm.
  We further strengthen existing hardness results by showing that the problem remains \NP-complete even when both input graphs have bounded maximum degree. We also investigate parameterizations by \((k + \delta(G))\) where \(\delta(G)\) denotes the degeneracy of \(G\), and rule out the existence of subexponential-time algorithms. This answers question raised in Lafond and Marchand~[WADS 2025]. We additionally provide an improved \FPT\ algorithm with better dependence on \((k + \delta(G))\) than previously known. Finally, we analyze a brute-force algorithm for \textsc{Labeled Contractibility} with running time \(|V(H)|^{\mathcal{O}(|V(G)|)}\), and show that this running time is optimal under \ETH.</description>
