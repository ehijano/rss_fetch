      <title>Exact solution and Luttinger liquid behavior of the quantum 1D hard rod model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum hard rod model, a one-dimensional extension of the Lieb-Liniger model, is exactly solved using an adapted Bethe ansatz. Our solution, benchmarked against path-integral quantum Monte Carlo calculations, reveals significant corrections to the excitation spectrum and thermodynamic properties, previously overlooked by the standard excluded-volume approach. We also show that the hard rod model exhibits Luttinger liquid behavior across a wide range of parameters, at zero and finite temperature, as unveiled by correlation functions. This work provides a comprehensive framework for understanding strongly correlated regimes in dilute 1D systems, with applications to quantum wires, spin chains, and ultracold atoms.</description>

      <title>Generalized Hall Conductivities in Local Commuting Projector Models: Generalized Symmetries and Protected Surface Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hall conductivities are important characterizations of phases of matter. It is known that nonzero Hall conductivities are difficult to realize in local commuting projector lattice models due to no-go theorems in (2+1)D. In this work we construct local commuting projector models in (2+1)D and (3+1)D with nonzero generalized Hall conductivities for ordinary and higher-form continuous symmetries on tensor product Hilbert space of finite local dimension. The model is given by a standard $\mathbb{Z}_N$ toric code, but the symmetries do not admit expression in terms of onsite charge operators. The symmetry do not have local charges or currents on the lattice in the absence of boundaries, but there is still notion of Hall conductivities that coincide with the continuum field theories. We construct protected gapless boundaries of the lattice models using modified Villain formalism. The generalized Hall conductivities are computed by surface currents as well as bulk flux insertion and many body Chern number.</description>

      <title>Leveraging recurrence in neural network wavefunctions for large-scale simulations of Heisenberg antiferromagnets: the triangular lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variational Monte Carlo simulations have been crucial for understanding quantum many-body systems, especially when the Hamiltonian is frustrated and the ground-state wavefunction has a non-trivial sign structure. In this paper, we use recurrent neural network (RNN) wavefunction ans\"{a}tze to study the triangular-lattice antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model (TLAHM) for lattice sizes up to $30\times30$. In a recent study [M. S. Moss et al. arXiv:2502.17144], the authors have demonstrated how RNN wavefunctions can be iteratively retrained in order to obtain variational results for multiple lattice sizes with a reasonable amount of compute. That study, which looked at the sign-free, square-lattice antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model, showed favorable scaling properties, allowing accurate finite-size extrapolations to the thermodynamic limit. In contrast, our present results illustrate in detail the relative difficulty in simulating the sign-problematic TLAHM. We find that the accuracy of our simulations can be significantly improved by transforming the Hamiltonian with a judicious choice of basis rotation. We also show that a similar benefit can be achieved by using variational neural annealing, an alternative optimization technique that minimizes a pseudo free energy. Ultimately, we are able to obtain estimates of the ground-state properties of the TLAHM in the thermodynamic limit that are in close agreement with values in the literature, showing that RNN wavefunctions provide a powerful toolbox for performing finite-size scaling studies for frustrated quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>In situ photoemission study of collective electronic phase transition in VO2-based heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated the origin of collective electronic phase transitions induced at the heterointerface between monoclinic insulating (MI) VO2 and rutile metallic (RM) electron-doped VO2 layers using in situ soft x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (SXPES) on nanoscale VO2/V0.99W0.01O2 (001)R bilayers. Thanks to the surface sensitivity of SXPES, we determined the changes in the electronic structure and V-V dimerization in each constituent layer separately. The selective observation of the electronic and crystal structures in the upper VO2 layer of the bilayer indicates that the MI-phase VO2 layer undergoes a transition to the RM phase by forming the heterointerface. Detailed temperature-dependent measurements reveal that the RM-phase VO2 undergoes a transition to the MI phase with a decrease in temperature, as in the case of a VO2 single-layer film. Furthermore, during the temperature-induced phase transition in the VO2 layer, the spectra are well described by an in-plane phase separation of the RM and MI phases. These results suggest that the interface-induced transition from the MI phase to the RM phase in the VO2 layer of bilayers occurs as a collective phase transition derived from the static energy balance between the interfacial energy and the bulk free energies of the constituent layers.</description>

      <title>Metallic layered materials with magnetic frustration: An ARPES view of the SmAuAl$_4$Ge$_2$ and TbAuAl$_4$Ge$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compounds of the new materials class LnTAl$_4$X$_2$ (Ln = lanthanide, X = tetrel, T = transition metal) host exotic magnetic phenomena due to geometric frustration induced by their triangular lattice. Complex spin arrangements, magnetic fluctuations and double magnetic transitions have been well observed by means of magneto-transport. Nevertheless, the experimental electronic structure of this family of materials has been poorly studied. We have investigated the experimental electronic structure of two members of this class of materials: SmAuAl$_4$Ge$_2$ and TbAuAl$_4$Ge$_2$. By means of Angle-Resolved PhotoEmission Spectroscopy (ARPES) accompanied by Density Functional Theory calculations (DFT), we reveal common trends and features, the important effect of localized spin moments on the electronic structure, the presence of surface-localized electronic states and the nature of the surface termination layer. Low-dimensionality, exchange interaction, and spin-orbit coupling are all important ingredients of the electronic structure.</description>

      <title>Observation of charge density wave excitonic order parameter in topological insulator monolayer WTe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong electron-hole interactions in a semimetal or narrow-gap semiconductor may drive a ground state of condensed excitons. Monolayer WTe2 has been proposed as a host material for such an exciton condensate, but the order parameter - the key signature of a macroscopic quantum-coherent condensate - has not been observed. Here we use Fourier-transform scanning tunnelling spectroscopy (FT-STS) to study quasi-particle interference (QPI) and periodic modulations of the local density of states (LDOS) in monolayer WTe2. In WTe2 on graphene, in which the carrier density can be varied via back-gating, FT-STS shows QPI features in the 2D bulk bands, confirming the interacting nature of the bandgap in neutral WTe2 and the semi-metallic nature of highly n- and p-doped WTe2. We observe additional non-dispersive spatial modulations in the LDOS imprinted on the topological edge mode of neutral WTe2 on metallic substrates (graphene and graphite), which we interpret as the interaction of the topological edge mode with the expected charge density wave order parameter of the excitonic condensate in WTe2 at low interaction strength due to screening by the metallic substrates.</description>

      <title>Odd-parity magnetism by quantum geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the effects of quantum geometry on parity-violating magnetism that is classified as odd-parity multipole magnetism. By comparing the spin susceptibility and odd-parity multipole susceptibility in the multisublattice model, we find that the ferroic multipole fluctuation is induced by the quantum geometry of Bloch electrons over a wide range of parameters. Due to the Hubbard interaction, the quantum-geometric multipole fluctuations condense into the multipole order. We predict complex magnetic correlations, which are a signature of quantum-geometric multipole magnetism, and propose experimental verification.</description>

      <title>Polaron formation as the vertex function problem: From Dyck's paths to self-energy Feynman diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel iterative method for generating all self-energy Feynman diagrams of any given order for the single polaron problem. This approach offers an effective tool for circumventing the sign problem that often arises in approximation-free numerical summations of Feynman diagrams. Each iterative step begins by rigorously listing all noncrossing diagrams using the graphical Dyck path representation of Stieltjes-Rogers polynomials, which exactly encode the Feynman diagram series. In the second phase, the Ward-Takahashi identity is used to uniquely identify the complete subset of vertex function contributions from the self-energy diagrams obtained in the previous iterative step. Finally, the noncrossing diagrams and vertex function contributions are combined to construct the full set of Feynman diagrams at a given order of the diagrammatic expansion, determining the number of diagrams of various types. This approach establishes a systematic procedure for generating the total sum of diagrams in a given order, enabling significant sign cancellation and making it broadly suitable for numerical summation techniques involving Feynman diagrams.</description>

      <title>Hydrostatic pressure studies on non-superconducting UTe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the temperature-pressure phase diagram of a UTe$_2$ single crystal that does not undergo a bulk superconducting transition but shows filamentary superconductivity with a critical transition temperature of 1 K at ambient pressure. Electrical-resistivity measurements reveal that the evolution of the filamentary superconducting state under pressure resembles the behavior observed in previous reports on bulk superconducting samples. AC calorimetry, however, does not show evidence for either bulk superconductivity or magnetism for pressures up to 1.6 GPa. Our results highlight the role of inhomogeneity in chemical-vapor-transport-grown UTe$_2$ samples and serve as a cautionary tale when probing electrical resistivity alone.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive the Euler and Navier-Stokes equations for electronic two-band systems in arbitrary dimension and with generic power-law dispersion relations. We focus on the hydrodynamic transport regime, where such systems offer a unique tunability between a Fermi-liquid type regime at high doping and the inherent two-band physics of the low-density system close to the Dirac-type band-touching point. For a generic dispersion, the absence of Euclidean or Lorentzian invariance leads to novel types of hydrodynamic equations. We characterize these novel hydrodynamic regimes through dimensionless numbers, such as the Prandtl and Lorenz numbers, or the ratio between shear viscosity and entropy density. In all cases, we provide a derivation of the physics of the long-wavelength plasmonic modes.</description>

      <title>Pair binding and Hund's rule breaking in high-symmetry fullerenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Highly-symmetric molecules often exhibit degenerate tight-binding states at the Fermi edge. This typically results in a magnetic ground state if small interactions are introduced in accordance with Hund's rule. In some cases, Hund's rule may be broken, which signals pair binding and goes hand-in-hand with an attractive pair-binding energy. We investigate pair binding and Hund's rule breaking for the Hubbard model on high-symmetry fullerenes C$_{20}$, C$_{28}$, C$_{40}$, and C$_{60}$ by using massive, large-scale density-matrix renormalization group calculations. We exploit the SU(2) spin symmetry, the U(1) charge symmetry, and optionally the Z(N) spatial rotation symmetry of the problem. For C$_{20}$, our results agree well with available exact-diagonalization data, but our approach is numerically much cheaper. We find a Mott transition at $U_c\sim2.2t$, which is much smaller than the previously reported value of $U_c\sim4.1t$ that was extrapolated from a few datapoints. We compute the pair-binding energy for arbitrary values of $U$ and observe that it remains overall repulsive. For larger fullerenes, we are not able to evaluate the pair binding energy with sufficient precision, but we can still investigate Hund's rule breaking. For C$_{28}$, we find that Hund's rule is fulfilled with a magnetic spin-2 ground state that transitions to a spin-1 state at $U_{c,1}\sim5.4t$ before the eventual Mott transition to a spin singlet takes place at $U_{c,2}\sim 11.6t$. For C$_{40}$, Hund's rule is broken in the singlet ground state, but is restored if the system is doped with one electron. Hund's rule is also broken for C$_{60}$, and the doping with two or three electrons results in a minimum-spin state. Our results support an electronic mechanism of superconductivity for C$_{60}$ lattices. We speculate that the high geometric frustration of small fullerenes is detrimental to pair binding.</description>

      <title>Observation of hadron scattering in a lattice gauge theory on a quantum computer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scattering experiments are at the heart of high-energy physics (HEP), breaking matter down to its fundamental constituents, probing its formation, and providing deep insight into the inner workings of nature. In the current huge drive to forge quantum computers into complementary venues that are ideally suited to capture snapshots of far-from-equilibrium HEP dynamics, a major goal is to utilize these devices for scattering experiments. A major obstacle in this endeavor has been the hardware overhead required to access the late-time post-collision dynamics while implementing the underlying gauge symmetry. Here, we report on the first quantum simulation of scattering in a lattice gauge theory (LGT), performed on \texttt{IBM}'s \texttt{ibm\_marrakesh} quantum computer. Specifically, we quantum-simulate the collision dynamics of electrons and positrons as well as mesons in a $\mathrm{U}(1)$ LGT representing $1+1$D quantum electrodynamics (QED), uncovering rich post-collision dynamics that we can precisely tune with a topological $\Theta$-term and the fermionic mass. By monitoring the time evolution of the scattering processes, we are able to distinguish between two main regimes in the wake of the collision. The first is characterized by the delocalization of particles when the topological $\Theta$-term is weak, while the second regime shows localized particles with a clear signature when the $\Theta$-term is nontrivial. Furthermore, we show that by quenching to a small mass at the collision point, inelastic scattering occurs with a large production of matter reminiscent of quantum many-body scarring. Our work provides a major step forward in the utility of quantum computers for investigating the real-time quantum dynamics of HEP collisions.</description>

      <title>Quantized Transport of Disordered Superconducting $\nu=2/3$ Fractional Quantum Hall Edges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $\nu=2/3$ fractional quantum Hall (FQH) edge states, which have counter-propagating modes, are known to flow under relevant neutral disorders into a stable Kane-Fisher-Polchinski (KFP) renormalization group (RG) fixed point, which yields a quantized two-terminal conductance $\frac{2}{3}\frac{e^2}{h}$ consistent with the experiments. Motivated by growing interests in superconducting (SC) quantum Hall systems, we study the $\nu=2/3$ FQH edge states with disordered SC proximity by generalizing the KFP analysis, which may also apply to the recently realized $\nu=2/3$ fractional Chern insulator. We show that the $\nu=2/3$ FQH edge theory has an infinite number of stable RG fixed points SC$_N$ labeled by an integer $N\in\mathbb{Z}$, each of which is driven by a relevant disordered charge-$2q_N$ SC tunneling with $q_N\in\mathbb{Z}$ depending on $N$. The $N&lt;0$ ($N\ge0$) phases are favored by an attractive (repulsive) inter-mode interaction on the edge. We further predict that the edge states in a SC$_N$ phase with $q_N\neq0$ yields a quantized downstream resistance $R_d=\frac{h}{2q_N^2e^2}$ measurable in a FQH-SC junction. For edge states staying in the KFP phase ($N=0$ and $q_N=0$) under SC proximity, we arrive at a nonlinear $R_d\propto V^{-\alpha}$ or $T^{-\alpha}$ with voltage bias $V$ or temperature $T$, where $\alpha=4$ ($\alpha=1$) if pairing (vortex tunneling) dominates.</description>

      <title>Ginsparg-Wilson Hamiltonians with Improved Chiral Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a family of Ginsparg-Wilson Hamiltonians with improved chiral properties, starting from a construction of Creutz-Horvath-Neuberger that provides a doubler-free Hamiltonian lattice regularization for Dirac fermions in even spacetime dimensions. We use a higher-order generalization of the Ginsparg-Wilson relation due to Fujikawa, which yields an order-$k$ Hamiltonian overlap operator for each integer $k \geq 0$, with an exactly conserved but nonquantized chiral charge that becomes quantized as $k \to \infty$. Our construction provides physical insight into how Fujikawa's higher-order Ginsparg-Wilson relation improves chiral symmetry while reproducing the anomaly, highlighting the trade-offs inherent in any Hamiltonian lattice realization of an anomalous chiral symmetry. This class of Hamiltonian lattice regularizations, with their tunable chiral symmetry properties, offers potential advantages for quantum and tensor-network simulations.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the symmetric mass generation paradigm for lattice chiral gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Within the symmetric mass generation (SMG) approach to the construction of lattice chiral gauge theories, one attempts to use interactions to render mirror fermions massive without symmetry breaking, thus obtaining the desired chiral massless spectrum. If successful, the gauge field can be turned on, and thus a chiral gauge theory can be constructed in the phase in which SMG takes place. In this paper we argue that the zeros that often replace the mirror poles of fermion two-point functions in an SMG phase are ``kinematical'' singularities, which can be avoided by choosing an appropriate set of interpolating fields that contains both elementary and composite fields. This allows us to apply general constraints on the existence of a chiral fermion spectrum which are valid in the presence of (non-gauge) interactions of arbitrary strength, including in any SMG phase. Using a suitably constructed one-particle lattice hamiltonian describing the fermion spectrum, we discuss the conditions for the applicability of the Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem to this hamiltonian. If these conditions are satisfied, the massless fermion spectrum must be vector-like. We add some general observations on the strong coupling limit of SMG models. Finally, we elaborate on the qualitative differences between four-dimensional and two-dimensional theories that limit the lessons that can be drawn from two-dimensional models.</description>

      <title>Atomic-scale ultrafast dynamics of local charge order in a THz-induced metastable state of 1T-TaS2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Light-induced control of quantum materials enables manipulation of electronic and structural phases on ultrafast timescales. Probing their atomic-scale dynamics is essential to understand the role of defects and domain boundaries, but conventional time-resolved techniques lack the required spatial resolution. Here, we use terahertz (THz) scanning tunneling microscopy to investigate a THz-light-induced metastable state near a defect in 1T-TaS2, and follow its photoinduced dynamics in real space and time. THz excitation induces quasi-stationary changes in the insulating gap on angstrom scales, which we associate with interlayer stacking changes. Simultaneously, THz-lightwave-driven tunneling provides access to ultrafast dynamics of the metastable state, revealing 2.5 THz oscillations of the charge density wave amplitude mode and a 1.3 THz mode attributed to an interlayer shear vibration emerging near the defect. Our results demonstrate the dual role of tip-enhanced THz fields in driving metastability and ultrafast tunneling, opening new avenues for ultrafast atomic-scale control of quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Static and Dynamics of Twisted Skyrmion Tubes in Frustrated Magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stable three-dimensional topological skyrmion structures in frustrated magnets are investigated. The texture exhibits a helicoid pattern along the vertical direction, described by a position-dependent helicity, which interpolates between Neel- and hedgehog-like two-dimensional skyrmions, characterized by the Hopf index, and is referred to as "twisted skyrmion tubes" (TSkTs). The stability and topology of TSkTs are achieved by competing next-nearest-neighbor exchange interactions, the thickness of the magnet, and the applied magnetic field. The dynamical behavior of a twisted structure in frustrated magnets is determined. Specifically, we derive that the helicity dynamics of the TSkT can be driven by an electric current resulting from spin-orbit torque interaction. Furthermore, we address the study of the electronic scattering problem using a spin-orbit-torque-driven TSKT, which offers promising applications for low-power storage nanodevices and nanobatteries with enhanced control.</description>

      <title>Simulating generalised fluids via interacting wave packets evolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One-dimensional integrable and quasi-integrable systems display, on macroscopic scales, a universal form of transport known as Generalized Hydrodynamics (GHD). In its standard Euler-scale formulation, GHD mirrors the equations of a two-dimensional compressible fluid but ignores fluctuations and becomes numerically unwieldy as soon as integrability-breaking perturbations are introduced. We show that GHD can be efficiently simulated as a gas of semiclassical wave packets - a natural generalisation of hard-rod particles - whose trajectories are efficiently mapped onto those of point particles. This representation (i) provides a transparent route to incorporate integrability-breaking terms, and (ii) automatically embeds the exact fluctuating-hydrodynamics extension of GHD. The resulting framework enables fast, large-scale simulations of quasi-integrable systems even in the presence of complicated integrability-breaking perturbations. It also manifest the pivotal role of two-point correlations in systems confined by external potentials: we demonstrate that situations where local one-point observables appear thermalised can nevertheless sustain long-lived, far-from-equilibrium long-range correlations for arbitrarily long times, signaling that, differently from what previously stated, true thermalisation is not reached at diffusive time-scales.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recently discovered twisted bilayer superconductors have suffered from a lack of reliable methods for identifying their nontrivial pairing symmetries and quantum geometry. In this study, we propose nonlinear responses driven by surface acoustic waves as a novel probe to access exotic Bogoliubov quasiparticles in such superconductors. Our approach is particularly suitable for addressing the superconducting gap structure as the gap energies in these systems typically lie within the frequency range of surface acoustic waves, and thus paves the way toward the experimental identification of exotic superconducting states especially in low-$T_c$ superconductors.</description>

Abstract: We show that the standard 1+1d $\mathbb{Z}_2\times \mathbb{Z}_2$ cluster model has a non-invertible global symmetry, described by the fusion category Rep(D$_8$). Therefore, the cluster state is not only a $\mathbb{Z}_2\times \mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry protected topological (SPT) phase, but also a non-invertible SPT phase. We further find two new commuting Pauli Hamiltonians for the other two Rep(D$_8$) SPT phases on a tensor product Hilbert space of qubits, matching the classification in field theory and mathematics. We identify the edge modes and the local projective algebras at the interfaces between these non-invertible SPT phases. Finally, we show that there does not exist a symmetric entangler that maps between these distinct SPT states.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions and remnants of fractionalization at finite temperature in the triangular lattice quantum loop model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01503v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantum loop and dimer models are archetypal correlated systems with local constraints. With natural foundations in statistical mechanics, they are of direct relevance to various important physical concepts and systems, such as topological order, lattice gauge theories, geometric frustrations, or more recently Rydberg arrays quantum simulators. However, how the thermal fluctuations interact with constraints has not been explored in the important class of non-bipartite geometries. Here we study, via unbiased quantum Monte Carlo simulations and field theoretical analysis, the finite-temperature phase diagram of the quantum loop model on the triangular lattice. We discover that the recently identified, "hidden" vison plaquette (VP) quantum crystal [1] experiences a finite-temperature continuous transition, which smoothly connects to the (2+1)d Cubic* quantum critical point separating the VP and $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ quantum spin liquid phases. This finite-temperature phase transition acquires a unique property of ``remnants of fractionalization" at finite temperature, in that, both the cubic order parameter -- the plaquette loop resonance -- and its constituent -- the vison field -- exhibit independent criticality signatures. This phase transition is connected to a 3-state Potts transition between the lattice nematic phase and the high-temperature disordered phase. We discuss the relevance of our results for current experiments on quantum simulation platforms.</description>

      <title>Structural characterization of the candidate Weyl semimetal CeGaGe</title>

Abstract: Weyl semimetals have a variety of intriguing physical properties, including topologically protected electronic states that coexist with conducting states. Possible exploitation of topologically protected states in a conducting material is promising for technological applications. Weyl semimetals that form in a noncentrosymmetric structure that also contain magnetic moments may host a variety of emergent phenomena that cannot be seen in magnetic, centrosymmetric Weyl materials. It can be difficult to distinguish definitively between a centrosymmetric structure and one of its noncentrosymmetric subgroups with standard powder X-ray diffractometers in cases where two atoms in the compound have nearly the same atomic number, as is the case for the candidate Weyl semimetal CeGaGe. In these cases, a careful single-crystal neutron diffraction experiment with high-angle reflections provides complimentary information to X-ray diffraction and definitively resolves any ambiguity between centrosymmetric and noncentrosymmetric crystal structures. Single-crystal neutron diffraction measurements on the candidate Weyl semimetal CeGaGe confirm that its structure is noncentrosymmetric, described by space group 109 $\left(I4_1md\right)$ rather than the centrosymmetric space group 141 $\left(I4_1/amd\right)$. There are many high-angle reflections in the data set that give clear, physically intuitive evidence that CeGaGe forms with $I4_1md$ symmetry since Bragg planes of these reflections can contain Ga with no Ge or vice versa, whereas the Bragg planes for a structure with $I4_1/amd$ symmetry would have a mix of Ga and Ge. Further, in some crystals we have studied, there is clear evidence for a structural transition from body-centered $I4_1md$ symmetry to primitive $P4_3$ and/or $P4_1$ symmetry.</description>

Abstract: Weakly and strongly interacting quantum many-body systems, namely semiconductors and Mott insulators, are combined into a layered heterostructure. Via the hierarchy of correlations, we derive and match the propagating quasi-particle solutions in the different regions and calculate the transmission coefficients through these layered structures. As a proof of principle, we find the well known transmission bands of a semiconductor heterostructure. Extending this idea to semiconductor and Mott insulator structures we calculate the transmittance and the resonance energies. Within a phase accumulation model we find analytical expressions for the scattering phase shift. Lastly, we find transmission curves with skewness for structures with applied voltage.</description>

      <title>Long-range Entanglement and Role of Realistic Interaction in Braiding of Non-Abelian Quasiholes in Fractional Quantum Hall Phases</title>

Abstract: Parity conservation dictates that when fusing pairs of Moore-Read (MR) quasiholes, such that each pair of charge-$e/4$ anyon forms a charge-$e/2$ anyon, the parity of the numbers of $1$-anyon and $\psi$-anyon must be conserved within a given system. This idea is illustrated here using the Jack polynomial formalism, which also provides a basis to numerically study the dynamics of MR anyons. In particular, we examine the effect of two-body electron-electron interaction on the degeneracy of two anyon fusion channels, which affects their mutual statistics of the MR anyons. We find that parity conservation gives rise to a long-range ``entanglement" which affect the experimental measurement of exchange statistics under realistic electron interaction. It is therefore important to account for all quasiholes in an experimental systems in order to accurately predict the outcome of a certain measurement. We also show how understanding the quasihole dynamics can help to fine-tune two-body interactions in order to stabilize any given fusion channel in experiments.</description>

      <title>Spin stiffnesses and stability of magnetic order in the lightly doped two-dimensional Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12191v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the density dependence of the spin stiffnesses and the stability of magnetic order with respect to quantum fluctuations in the two-dimensional Hubbard model close to half-filling. The stiffnesses are computed from the spin susceptibility obtained from a random phase approximation in a magnetically ordered state. For a sizable next-to-nearest neighbor hopping amplitude and a moderate Hubbard interaction, the mean-field ground state is a N\'eel antiferromagnet in the electron doped regime at and above half-filling, and a planar circular spiral state in the hole doped regime below half-filling. Upon electron doping, the N\'eel stiffness decreases smoothly and not very steeply. By contrast, the in-plane and out-of-plane stiffnesses in the spiral state drop abruptly at half-filling. The out-of-plane stiffness even drops to zero, and then increases again very slowly upon increasing hole doping. At finite temperatures, the N\'eel-to-spiral transition is shifted into the hole doped regime, the stiffnesses are continuous functions of the density, and they vanish at the transition. For small hole doping, the spin stiffnesses describe the quantum fluctuations only in a small momentum range, which shrinks to zero upon approaching half-filling. Using the above results, we show that the quantum ground state of the lightly electron doped Hubbard model remains N\'eel ordered, while quantum fluctuations probably destroy the spiral long-range order in the hole doped regime, giving rise to a quantum disordered state with a spin gap.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09685v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Application of a displacement field opens a gap and enhances the Van-Hove singularities in the band structure of Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene. By adjusting the carrier density so that the Fermi energy lies in the vicinity of these singularities, recent experiments observe a plethora of highly correlated electronic phases including isospin polarized phases and high-resistance states with non-linear electric transport indicative of a possible Wigner crystal. We perform Hartree-Fock calculations incorporating long-range Coulomb interactions and allowing for translational and rotational symmetry breaking. We obtain the displacement field vs. carrier density phase diagram which shows isospin polarized metallic phases tracking the Van-Hove singularity in the valence band. Between these metallic phases we observe regions where the ground state is a Wigner crystal. The isospin polarization of the Wigner crystals tracks the isospin polarization of the nearby metallic phases. Depending on whether we have four, three, two or one isospin flavours, we obtain a full, three-quarter, half or quarter Wigner crystal.</description>

      <title>Emergent Orbital Dynamics in Strongly Spin-Orbit Coupled Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16746v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interplay between spin and orbital degrees of freedom gives rise to a variety of emergent phases in correlated 4d and 5d transition-metal systems. Strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC) significantly alters Jahn-Teller (JT) physics, often suppressing static distortions or promoting dynamic fluctuations, thereby reducing or even quenching orbital polarization. While intersite hybridization is a fundamental aspect of crystalline solids, its role in shaping the dynamics of spin-orbit-entangled states has received comparatively little attention. Here, we show that electronic hopping can locally restore orbital polarization when the ground state is perturbed, even in the absence of static orbital order. Using a Matsubara lattice formalism, we analyze how local orbital perturbations propagate through correlated, spin-orbit-entangled systems. When intersite hopping is included, such perturbations induce short-range orbital polarization with a characteristic orthogonal response at nearest-neighbor sites. Although the energy scale of these hybridization-driven orbital reconstructions likely makes their detection challenging, they may still influence low-energy spectral features and interact with other excitations. These results underscore the importance of including orbital dynamics in the interpretation of spectroscopic data and provide a framework for understanding dynamical responses in spin-orbit-entangled materials.</description>

Abstract: Quantum geometry is crucial for understanding intricate condensed matter systems, governing transport phenomena and optical responses. However, traditional studies predominantly consider a static crystal lattice, focusing exclusively on the pure-electronic quantum geometry of the Hilbert space parameterized by electronic wave vectors, thereby overlooking the dynamic effects arising from phonons and their coupling with electrons. In this work, we reveal the intrinsic quantum geometry of the electron-phonon coupling (EPC), which resides in the hybrid Hilbert space parameterized by both the electronic wave vectors and phonon displacements. The EPC quantum metric, EPC Berry curvature and EPC shift vector, as central elements, quantify the EPC-induced velocity, polarization, and anomalous charge-center shift, respectively. We further connect this geometry to phonon-mediated optical responses, particularly in-gap resonances, enabling experimental detection and characterization of EPC quantum geometry.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of edge modes in monitored Su-Schrieffer-Heeger Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05671v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of dissipation on the dynamics of edge modes in the monitored Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model. Our study considers both a linear observable and a nonlinear entanglement measure, namely the two-point correlation function and the Disconnected Entanglement Entropy (DEE), as diagnostic tools. While dissipation inevitably alters the entanglement properties observed in the closed system, statistical analysis of quantum trajectories reveals that by protecting the chain's edges from dissipation, it is possible to recover characteristic features analogous to those found in the unitary limit. This highlights the fundamental role of spatial dissipation patterns in shaping the dynamics of edge modes in monitored systems.</description>

      <title>Vortex lattice states of bilayer electron-hole fluids in quantizing magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08810v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the ground state of a weakly charged two-dimensional electron-hole fluid in a strong magnetic field is a broken translation symmetry state with interpenetrating lattices of localized vortices and antivortices in the electron-hole-pair field. The vortices and antivortices carry fractional charges of equal sign but unequal magnitude and have a honeycomb lattice structure that contrasts with the triangular lattices of superconducting electron-electron-pair vortex lattices. We predict that increasing charge density or weakening magnetic field drives a vortex delocalization transition that would be signaled experimentally by an abrupt increase in counterflow transport resistance.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Dichroism in Rutile NiF$_2$: Separating Altermagnetic and Ferromagnetic Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08056v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present numerical simulations of x-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) at the L$_{2,3}$ edge of Ni in the weakly ferromagnetic altermagnet NiF$_2$. Our results predict a significant XMCD signal for light propagating perpendicular to the magnetic moments, which are approximately aligned along the [100] easy-axis direction. The analysis shows that the altermagnetic and ferromagnetic contributions to the XMCD signal can be uniquely distinguished by their dependence on an applied magnetic field. By varying the angle of the field relative to the easy axis, the in-plane orientation of both the N\'eel vector and the net magnetization can be systematically controlled. We further demonstrate that the XMCD signal, even under fields as strong as 40 T and for any in-plane orientation, can be accurately described as a linear combination of two spectral components, with geometrical prefactors determined by the field magnitude and direction. This insight enables experimental validation of the distinctive relationship between the N\'eel vector orientation and the x-ray Hall vector in the rutile structure. Quantitative simulations supporting these findings are provided.</description>

      <title>Anomalous matrix product operator symmetries and 1D mixed-state phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16985v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The renormalization group for matrix product density operators (MPDOs) provides a powerful framework for describing one-dimensional mixed-state phases of matter and the renormalization fixed points (RFPs) are representative states for analyzing nontrivial phases. Recently, it was found that anomalous symmetries can provide a fundamental obstruction for certain short-range correlated mixed states to be efficiently prepared. In this work, we consider generalized symmetries including non-invertible ones realized microscopically as matrix product operators (MPOs), and study the physical implications of their quantum anomaly on the MPDO RFPs. We prove that MPDOs with strong anomalous MPO symmetries cannot be prepared from a normal matrix product state in the trivial phase via a translationally invariant finite-depth local quantum channel. We explicitly construct a general class of zero-correlation-length MPDO RFPs that exhibit strong anomalous MPO symmetries, and these MPDO RFPs form a distinct class from those that can be efficiently prepared as a consequence of quantum anomaly. Nonetheless, we further prove that all the constructed MPDO RFPs can be prepared from product states by finite-depth quantum circuit with measurements and feedforward.</description>
