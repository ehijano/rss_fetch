      <title>Gamma-ray background from rock: studies for a next-generation dark matter experiment based on liquid xenon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rare event experiments, such as those targeting dark matter interactions and neutrinoless double beta (0$\nu\beta\beta$) decay, should be shielded from gamma-rays that originated in rock. This paper describes the simulation of gamma-ray transport through the water shielding and assessment of the thickness needed to suppress the background from rock down to a negligible level. This study focuses on a next-generation xenon observatory with a wide range of measurements including the search for Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) and 0$\nu\beta\beta$ decay of $^{136}$Xe. Our findings indicate that the gamma-ray background is unlikely to persist through analysis cuts in the WIMP energy range (0 - 20 keV) after 3.5 m of water, complemented by 0.5 m of liquid scintillator. For 0$\nu\beta\beta$ decay, a background below 1 event in 10 years of running can be achieved with a fiducial mass of 39.3 tonnes. Furthermore, for typical radioactivity levels of 1 Bq kg$^{-1}$ of $^{232}$Th and $^{238}$U we have studied the effect of reducing the water shielding by 1 m, resulting in a reduced fiducial mass of 19.1 tonnes for 0$\nu\beta\beta$ decay and still a negligible background for WIMP search. The paper also presents the measurements of radioactivity in rock in the Boulby mine, which hosted several dark matter experiments in the past and is also a potential site for a future dual-phase xenon experiment. The measurements are used to normalise simulation results and assess the required shielding at Boulby.</description>

      <title>Advantages of off-line analysis of digitally recorded pulses in case of neutron-gamma discrimination in scintillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many modern digital analyzers offer the ability to record raw pulses from ionizing radiation detectors. We use this opportunity to investigate the effectiveness of Charge Comparison Method in Pulse Shape Discrimination of neutron and gamma radiation measured with organic glass scintillator and trans-stilbene. The idea of software for automated off-line analysis of digitally recorded data is briefly described. We discuss the difference between Leading Edge and Constant Fraction Discrimination triggering methods and we propose triggering on pulse maximum as an alternative. We observe that the starting point of charge integration gates has major impact on Figure of Merit values, therefore it is important to choose it carefully and report it with other Charge Comparison Method parameters to keep comparison between scintillators reliable. Figure of Merit has a limited usage, so Relative Height of Minimum is proposed as an additional indicator of neutron-gamma discrimination effectiveness in practical applications.</description>

      <title>QSHS: An Axion Dark Matter Resonant Search Apparatus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a resonant cavity search apparatus for axion dark matter constructed by the Quantum Sensors for the Hidden Sector (QSHS) collaboration. The apparatus is configured to search for QCD axion dark matter, though also has the capability to detect axion-like particles (ALPs), dark photons, and some other forms of wave-like dark matter. Initially, a tuneable cylindrical oxygen-free copper cavity is read out using a low noise microwave amplifier feeding a heterodyne receiver. The cavity is housed in a dilution refrigerator and threaded by a solenoidal magnetic field, nominally 8T. The apparatus also houses a magnetic field shield for housing superconducting electronics, and several other fixed-frequency resonators for use in testing and commissioning various prototype quantum electronic devices sensitive at a range of axion masses in the range $\rm 2.0$ to $\rm 40\,eV/c^2$. We present performance data for the resonator, dilution refrigerator, and magnet, and plans for the first science run.</description>

      <title>Comparison of an OGS/Polystyrene scintillator (BSO-406) with pure OGS (BSO-100), EJ-276, EJ-309, and M600 scintillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10072v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an investigation into the scintillation properties and pulse shape discrimination (PSD) performance of the new BSO-406, which is a blend of 40% organic glass scintillator and 60% polystyrene. We tested a cylindrical sample with dimensions of 2x2 inches. The study includes measurements of neutron-gamma discrimination capability, emission spectra, photoelectron yield, and the analysis of light pulse shapes originating from events related to gamma-rays and fast neutrons. The results were compared to data previously recorded using a pure Organic Glass Scintillator (BSO-100), an EJ-309 liquid scintillator, and EJ-276 and M600 polyurethane-based plastic scintillators.</description>
