      <title>A systematic study to investigate the effects of X-ray exposure on electrical properties of silicon dioxide thin films using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) is generally used for chemical analysis of surfaces and interfaces. This method involves the analysis of changes in binding energies and peak shapes of elements under consideration. It is also possible to use XPS to study the effect of X-ray radiation on the electrical properties of thin films. We measured the Si 2p peak using X-ray powers of 300 W and 150 W on approximately 135 nm silicon dioxide (SiO2) thin films grown on both n- and p-type substrates while applying DC or AC external biases. Using the shifts in the binding energy of the Si 2p peak, we calculated the resistances and the capacitances of the SiO2 thin film. The way that the binding energies of the Si 2p peak and the capacitance of the thin film change as a function of the type of Si substrate and the power of the X-ray are explained using band bending.</description>

      <title>Oxygenation of CO and NO on Amorphous Solid Water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: \noindent
  \textit{Context. }The dynamics for molecule formation, relaxation, diffusion, and desorption on amorphous solid water is studied in a quantitative fashion.
  \noindent
  \textit{Aims. }We aim at characterizing, at a quantitative level, the formation probability, stabilization, energy relaxation and diffusion dynamics of CO$_2$ and NO$_2$ on cold amorphous solid water following atom+diatom recombination reactions.
  \noindent
  \textit{Methods. }Accurate machine-learned energy functions combined with fluctuating charge models were used to investigate the diffusion, interactions, and recombination dynamics of atomic oxygen with CO and NO on amorphous solid water (ASW). Energy relaxation to the ASW and into water-internal-degrees of freedom were determined from analysis of the vibrational density of states. The surface diffusion and desorption energetics was investigated from extended and nonequilibrium MD simulations.
  \noindent
  \textit{Results. }The reaction probability on the nanosecond time scale is determined in a quantitative fashion and demonstrates that surface diffusion of the reactants leads to recombination for initial separations up to 20 \AA\/. After recombination both, CO$_2$ and NO$_2$, stabilize by energy transfer to water internal and surface phonon modes on the picosecond time scale. The average diffusion barriers and desorption energies agree with those reported from experiments. After recombination, the triatomic products diffuse easily which contrasts with the equilibrium situation in which both, CO$_2$ and NO$_2$, are stationary on the multi-nanosecond time scale.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking of machine learning interatomic potentials for reactive hydrogen dynamics at metal surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulations of chemical reaction probabilities in gas surface dynamics require the calculation of ensemble averages over many tens of thousands of reaction events to predict dynamical observables that can be compared to experiments. At the same time, the energy landscapes need to be accurately mapped, as small errors in barriers can lead to large deviations in reaction probabilities. This brings a particularly interesting challenge for machine learning interatomic potentials, which are becoming well-established tools to accelerate molecular dynamics simulations. We compare state-of-the-art machine learning interatomic potentials with a particular focus on their inference performance on CPUs and suitability for high throughput simulation of reactive chemistry at surfaces. The considered models include polarizable atom interaction neural networks (PaiNN), recursively embedded atom neural networks (REANN), the MACE equivariant graph neural network, and atomic cluster expansion potentials (ACE). The models are applied to a dataset on reactive molecular hydrogen scattering on low-index surface facets of copper. All models are assessed for their accuracy, time-to-solution, and ability to simulate reactive sticking probabilities as a function of the rovibrational initial state and kinetic incidence energy of the molecule. REANN and MACE models provide the best balance between accuracy and time-to-solution and can be considered the current state-of-the-art in gas-surface dynamics. PaiNN models require many features for the best accuracy, which causes significant losses in computational efficiency. ACE models provide the fastest time-to-solution, however, models trained on the existing dataset were not able to achieve sufficiently accurate predictions in all cases.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this letter, we present an extension to TensorNet, a state-of-the-art equivariant Cartesian tensor neural network potential, allowing it to handle charged molecules and spin states without architectural changes or increased costs. By incorporating these attributes, we address input degeneracy issues, enhancing the model's predictive accuracy across diverse chemical systems. This advancement significantly broadens TensorNet's applicability, maintaining its efficiency and accuracy.</description>

      <title>Paddy: Evolutionary Optimization Algorithm for Chemical Systems and Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimization of chemical systems and processes have been enhanced and enabled by the guidance of algorithms and analytical approaches. While many methods will systematically investigate how underlying variables govern a given outcome, there is often a substantial number of experiments needed to accurately model these relations. As chemical systems increase in complexity, inexhaustive processes must propose experiments that efficiently optimize the underlying objective, while ideally avoiding convergence on unsatisfactory local minima. We have developed the Paddy software package around the Paddy Field Algorithm, a biologically inspired evolutionary optimization algorithm that propagates parameters without direct inference of the underlying objective function. Benchmarked against the Tree of Parzen Estimator, a Bayesian algorithm implemented in the Hyperopt software Library, Paddy displays efficient optimization with lower runtime, and avoidance of early convergence. Herein we report these findings for the cases of: global optimization of a two-dimensional bimodal distribution, interpolation of an irregular sinusoidal function, hyperparameter optimization of an artificial neural network tasked with classification of solvent for reaction components, and targeted molecule generation via optimization of input vectors for a decoder network. We anticipate that the facile nature of Paddy will serve to aid in automated experimentation, where minimization of investigative trials and or diversity of suitable solutions is of high priority.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the mechanisms of triplet state formation in a heavy-atom free photosensitizer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01463v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Triplet excited state generation plays a pivotal role in photosensitizers, however the reliance on transition metals and heavy atoms can limit the utility of these systems. In this study, we demonstrate that an interplay of competing quantum effects control the high triplet quantum yield in a prototypical boron dipyrromethene-anthracene (BD-An) donor-acceptor dyad photosensitizer, which is only captured by an accurate treatment of both inner and outer sphere reorganization energies. Our ab initio-derived model provides excellent agreement with experimentally measured spectra, triplet yields and excited state kinetic data, including the triplet lifetime. We find that rapid triplet state formation occurs primarily via high-energy triplet states through both spin-orbit coupled charge transfer and El-Sayed's rule breaking intersystem crossing, rather than direct spin-orbit coupled charge transfer to the lowest lying triplet state. Our calculations also reveal that competing effects of nuclear tunneling, electronic state recrossing, and electronic polarizability dictate the rate of non-productive ground state recombination. This study sheds light on the quantum effects driving efficient triplet formation in the BD-An system, and offers a promising simulation methodology for diverse photochemical systems.</description>
