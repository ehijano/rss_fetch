      <title>Non-Hausdorff manifolds over locally ordered spaces via sheaf theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Locally ordered spaces can be used as topological models of concurrent programs: in that setting, the local order models the irreversibility of time during execution. Under certain conditions, one can even work with locally ordered manifolds: we build the universal euclidean local order over every locally ordered space (in categorical terms, the subcategory of euclidean local orders is coreflective in the category of locally ordered spaces), and give conditions to ensure that it preserves the execution traces of the corresponding program. To this end, we apply a well-known construction which relates sheaves on a space and \'etale bundles over this space. This is a far reaching generalization of a result about realizations of graph products. We particularize the construction to locally ordered realization of precubical sets, and show that it admits a purely combinatorial description. With the same proof techniques, we show that, unlike for the topological realization, there is a unique precubical set whose locally ordered realization is isomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^n$.</description>

      <title>$e$-invariants of quotients of Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a simply connected compact Lie group and $\mathscr{L}$ be the left invarinat framing of $G$. Let $\mathcal{L}^\lambda$ be the framing obtained by twisting $\mathscr{L}$ by a faithful representation $\lambda$. Given a torus subgroup $T''$ of $G$ we have a framing $(\mathcal{L}^\lambda)_{T''}$ of the quotient $G/T''$ induced from $\mathcal{L}^\lambda$. In this note we show that under a certain dimensional condition the $e_\mathbb{C}$-invariant of $G/T''$ with this framing provides a generator of the $J$-homomorphism or twice that. Thereby we also give a unified proof of the results for $SU(2n)$, $Spin(4n+1)$ and $Spin(8n-2)$ $(n\ge 1)$ previously proved.</description>

      <title>Persistent Local Systems of Periodic Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The topology of periodic spaces has attracted a lot of interest in recent years in order to study and classify crystalline structures and other large homogeneous data sets, such as the distribution of galaxies in cosmology. In practice, these objects are studied by taking a finite sample and introducing periodic boundary conditions, however this introduces and removes many subtle homological features. Here, build on the work of Onus and Robins (2022) and Onus and Skraba (2023) to investigate whether one can recover the (persistent) homology of a periodic cell complex $K$ from a finite quotient space $G$ of equivalence classes under translations. In particular, we search for a computationally friendly method to identify all ''toroidal cycles'' of $G$ which do not lift to cycles in $K$. We show that all toroidal and non-toroidal cycles of $G$ of arbitrary homology degree can be completely classified for $K$ of arbitrary periodicity using the recently developed machinery of bisheaves and persistent local systems. In doing so, we also introduce a framework for a computationally viable persistence theory of periodic spaces. Finally, we outline algorithms for how to apply our results to real data, including a polynomial time algorithm for calculating the canonical persistent local system attributed to a given bisheaf.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The topological space of the stack of $G$-zips can be computed using a refinement process. We extend this refinement process to a more general framework and show that in many situations this process can be used to compute the equivalence classes of a certain equivalence relation, which in the case of $G$-zips is precisely the topological space.</description>

      <title>Counts and end-curves in two-parameter persistence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a finite dimensional, bigraded module over the polynomial ring in two variables, we define its two-parameter count, a natural number, and its end-curves, a set of plane curves. These are two-dimensional analogues of the notions of bar-count and endpoints of singly-graded modules over the polynomial ring in one variable, from persistence theory. We show that our count is the unique one satisfying certain natural conditions; as a consequence, several inclusion-exclusion-type formulas in two-parameter persistence yield the same positive number, which equals our count, and which in turn equals the number of end-curves, giving geometric meaning to this count. We show that the end-curves determine the classical Betti tables by showing that they interpolate between generators, relations, and syzygies. Using the band representations of a certain string algebra, we show that the set of end-curves admits a canonical partition, where each part forms a closed curve on the plane; we call this the boundary of the module. As an invariant, the boundary is neither weaker nor stronger than the rank invariant, but, in contrast to the rank invariant, it is a complete invariant on the set of spread-decomposable representations. Our results connect several lines of work in multiparameter persistence, and their extension to modules over the real-exponent polynomial ring in two variables relates to two-dimensional Morse theory.</description>

      <title>A minimal set of generators for the polynomial algebra of five variables in a generic degree</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16803v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $P_k$ be the graded polynomial algebra $\mathbb F_2[x_1,x_2,\ldots ,x_k]$ over the prime field with two elements, $\mathbb F_2$, with the degree of each $x_i$ being 1. We study the hit problem, set up by Frank Peterson, of finding a minimal set of generators for $P_k$ as a module over the mod-$2$ Steenrod algebra, $\mathcal{A}.$ It is an open problem in Algebraic Topology. In this paper, we explicitly determine a minimal set of $\mathcal{A}$-generators for $P_5$ in the case of the generic degree $m = 2^{d}$ for all $d \geqslant 8$.</description>

      <title>Computing Generalized Ranks of Persistence Modules via Unfolding to Zigzag Modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08110v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a $P$-indexed persistence module ${\sf M}$, the (generalized) rank of ${\sf M}$ is defined as the rank of the limit-to-colimit map for the diagram of vector spaces of ${\sf M}$ over the poset $P$. For $2$-parameter persistence modules, recently a zigzag persistence based algorithm has been proposed that takes advantage of the fact that generalized rank for $2$-parameter modules is equal to the number of full intervals in a zigzag module defined on the boundary of the poset. Analogous definition of boundary for $d$-parameter persistence modules or general $P$-indexed persistence modules does not seem plausible. To overcome this difficulty, we first unfold a given $P$-indexed module ${\sf M}$ into a zigzag module ${\sf M}_{ZZ}$ and then check how many full interval modules in a decomposition of ${\sf M}_{ZZ}$ can be folded back to remain full in a decomposition of ${\sf M}$. This number determines the generalized rank of ${\sf M}$. For special cases of degree-$d$ homology for $d$-complexes, we obtain a more efficient algorithm including a linear time algorithm for degree-$1$ homology in graphs.</description>

Abstract: We prove an essentially surjective Galois-correspondence-like functor for $n$-stacks. More specifically, it gives an essentially surjective functor from the $\infty$-category of $n$-stacks of finite sets with an action of the fundamental group of $X$ to the $\infty$-category of Deligne-Mumford $n$-stacks finite \'etale over a connected scheme $X$.</description>

      <title>Vietoris-Rips Complexes of Split-Decomposable Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15655v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Split-metric decompositions are an important tool in the theory of phylogenetics, particularly because of the link between the tight span and the class of totally decomposable spaces, a generalization of metric trees whose decomposition does not have a ``prime'' component. Their close relationship with trees makes totally decomposable spaces attractive in the search for spaces whose persistent homology can be computed efficiently. We study the subclass of circular decomposable spaces, finite metrics that resemble subsets of $\mathbb{S}^1$ and can be recognized in quadratic time. We give an $O(n^2)$ characterization of the circular decomposable spaces whose Vietoris-Rips complexes are cyclic for all distance parameters, and compute their homotopy type using well-known results on $\mathbb{S}^1$. We extend this result to a recursive formula that computes the homology of certain circular decomposable spaces that fail the previous characterization. Going beyond totally decomposable spaces, we identify an $O(n^3)$ decomposition of $\mathrm{VR}_r(X)$ in terms of the blocks of the tight span of $X$, and use it to induce a direct-sum decomposition of the homology of $\mathrm{VR}_r(X)$.</description>

      <title>Topology-driven identification of repetitions in multi-variate time series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10004v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many multi-variate time series obtained in the natural sciences and engineering possess a repetitive behavior, as for instance state-space trajectories of industrial machines in discrete automation. Recovering the times of recurrence from such a multi-variate time series is of a fundamental importance for many monitoring and control tasks. For a periodic time series this is equivalent to determining its period length. In this work we present a persistent homology framework to estimate recurrence times in multi-variate time series with different generalizations of cyclic behavior (periodic, repetitive, and recurring). To this end, we provide three specialized methods within our framework that are provably stable and validate them using real-world data, including a new benchmark dataset from an injection molding machine.</description>
