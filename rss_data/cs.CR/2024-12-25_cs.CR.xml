      <title>Blockchain-Driven Research in Personality-Based Distributed Pair Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study aims to integrate blockchain technology into personality-based pair programming research to enhance its generalizability and adaptability by offering built-in continuous, reproducible, and transparent research. In the developing Role-Optimization Motivation Alignment (ROMA) framework, human/AI programming roles align with individual Big Five personality traits, optimizing individual motivation and team productivity in Very Small Entities and undergraduate courses. Twelve quasi-experimental sessions were conducted to verify the personality-based pair programming in distributed settings. A mixed-methods approach was employed, combining intrinsic motivation inventories and qualitative insights. Data were stored transparently on the Solana blockchain, and a web-based application was developed in Rust and TypeScript languages to facilitate partner matching based on ROMA suggestions, expertise, and availability. The results suggest that blockchain can enhance research generalizability, reproducibility, and transparency, while ROMA can increase individual motivation and team performance. Future work can focus on integrating smart contracts for transparent and versioned data analysis.</description>

      <title>AEIOU: A Unified Defense Framework against NSFW Prompts in Text-to-Image Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As text-to-image (T2I) models continue to advance and gain widespread adoption, their associated safety issues are becoming increasingly prominent. Malicious users often exploit these models to generate Not-Safe-for-Work (NSFW) images using harmful or adversarial prompts, highlighting the critical need for robust safeguards to ensure the integrity and compliance of model outputs. Current internal safeguards frequently degrade image quality, while external detection methods often suffer from low accuracy and inefficiency.
  In this paper, we introduce AEIOU, a defense framework that is Adaptable, Efficient, Interpretable, Optimizable, and Unified against NSFW prompts in T2I models. AEIOU extracts NSFW features from the hidden states of the model's text encoder, utilizing the separable nature of these features to detect NSFW prompts. The detection process is efficient, requiring minimal inference time. AEIOU also offers real-time interpretation of results and supports optimization through data augmentation techniques. The framework is versatile, accommodating various T2I architectures. Our extensive experiments show that AEIOU significantly outperforms both commercial and open-source moderation tools, achieving over 95% accuracy across all datasets and improving efficiency by at least tenfold. It effectively counters adaptive attacks and excels in few-shot and multi-label scenarios.</description>

      <title>Token Highlighter: Inspecting and Mitigating Jailbreak Prompts for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being integrated into services such as ChatGPT to provide responses to user queries. To mitigate potential harm and prevent misuse, there have been concerted efforts to align the LLMs with human values and legal compliance by incorporating various techniques, such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), into the training of the LLMs. However, recent research has exposed that even aligned LLMs are susceptible to adversarial manipulations known as Jailbreak Attacks. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a method called Token Highlighter to inspect and mitigate the potential jailbreak threats in the user query. Token Highlighter introduced a concept called Affirmation Loss to measure the LLM's willingness to answer the user query. It then uses the gradient of Affirmation Loss for each token in the user query to locate the jailbreak-critical tokens. Further, Token Highlighter exploits our proposed Soft Removal technique to mitigate the jailbreak effects of critical tokens via shrinking their token embeddings. Experimental results on two aligned LLMs (LLaMA-2 and Vicuna-V1.5) demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively defend against a variety of Jailbreak Attacks while maintaining competent performance on benign questions of the AlpacaEval benchmark. In addition, Token Highlighter is a cost-effective and interpretable defense because it only needs to query the protected LLM once to compute the Affirmation Loss and can highlight the critical tokens upon refusal.</description>

      <title>SoK: On the Offensive Potential of AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our society increasingly benefits from Artificial Intelligence (AI). Unfortunately, more and more evidence shows that AI is also used for offensive purposes. Prior works have revealed various examples of use cases in which the deployment of AI can lead to violation of security and privacy objectives. No extant work, however, has been able to draw a holistic picture of the offensive potential of AI. In this SoK paper we seek to lay the ground for a systematic analysis of the heterogeneous capabilities of offensive AI. In particular we (i) account for AI risks to both humans and systems while (ii) consolidating and distilling knowledge from academic literature, expert opinions, industrial venues, as well as laymen -- all of which being valuable sources of information on offensive AI.
  To enable alignment of such diverse sources of knowledge, we devise a common set of criteria reflecting essential technological factors related to offensive AI. With the help of such criteria, we systematically analyze: 95 research papers; 38 InfoSec briefings (from, e.g., BlackHat); the responses of a user study (N=549) entailing individuals with diverse backgrounds and expertise; and the opinion of 12 experts. Our contributions not only reveal concerning ways (some of which overlooked by prior work) in which AI can be offensively used today, but also represent a foothold to address this threat in the years to come.</description>

      <title>Persuasion and Phishing: Analysing the Interplay of Persuasion Tactics in Cyber Threats</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study extends the research of Ferreira and Teles (2019), who synthesized works by Cialdini (2007), Gragg (2003), and Stajano and Wilson (2011) to propose a unique list of persuasion principles in social engineering. While Ferreira and Teles focused on email subject lines, this research analyzed entire email contents to identify principles of human persuasion in phishing emails. This study also examined the goals and targets of phishing emails, providing a novel contribution to the field. Applying these findings to the ontological model by Mouton et al. (2014) reveals that when social engineers use email for phishing, individuals are the primary targets. The goals are typically unauthorized access, followed by financial gain and service disruption, with Distraction as the most commonly used compliance principle. This research highlights the importance of understanding human persuasion in technology-mediated interactions to develop methods for detecting and preventing phishing emails before they reach users. Despite previous identification of luring elements in phishing emails, empirical findings have been inconsistent. For example, Akbar (2014) found 'authority' and 'scarcity' most common, while Ferreira et al. (2015) identified 'liking' and 'similarity.' In this study, 'Distraction' was most frequently used, followed by 'Deception,' 'Integrity,' and 'Authority.' This paper offers additional insights into phishing email tactics and suggests future solutions should leverage socio-technical principles. Future work will apply this methodology to other social engineering techniques beyond phishing emails, using the ontological model to further inform the research community.</description>

      <title>A Survey on the Principles of Persuasion as a Social Engineering Strategy in Phishing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Research shows that phishing emails often utilize persuasion techniques, such as social proof, liking, consistency, authority, scarcity, and reciprocity to gain trust to obtain sensitive information or maliciously infect devices. The link between principles of persuasion and social engineering attacks, particularly in phishing email attacks, is an important topic in cyber security as they are the common and effective method used by cybercriminals to obtain sensitive information or access computer systems. This survey paper concluded that spear phishing, a targeted form of phishing, has been found to be specifically effective as attackers can tailor their messages to the specific characteristics, interests, and vulnerabilities of their targets. Understanding the uses of the principles of persuasion in spear phishing is key to the effective defence against it and eventually its elimination. This survey paper systematically summarizes and presents the current state of the art in understanding the use of principles of persuasion in phishing. Through a systematic review of the existing literature, this survey paper identifies a significant gap in the understanding of the impact of principles of persuasion as a social engineering strategy in phishing attacks and highlights the need for further research in this area.</description>

      <title>Double Spending Analysis of Nakamoto Consensus for Time-Varying Mining Rates with Ruin Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Theoretical guarantees for double spending probabilities for the Nakamoto consensus under the $k$-deep confirmation rule have been extensively studied for zero/bounded network delays and fixed mining rates. In this paper, we introduce a ruin-theoretical model of double spending for Nakamoto consensus under the $k$-deep confirmation rule when the honest mining rate is allowed to be an arbitrary function of time including the block delivery periods, i.e., time periods during which mined blocks are being delivered to all other participants of the network. Time-varying mining rates are considered to capture the intrinsic characteristics of the peer to peer network delays as well as dynamic participation of miners such as the gap game and switching between different cryptocurrencies. Ruin theory is leveraged to obtain the double spend probabilities and numerical examples are presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed analytical method.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Intelligence in GameFi: Embodied AI Agents and the Convergence of DeFi and Virtual Ecosystems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving landscape of GameFi, a fusion of gaming and decentralized finance (DeFi), there exists a critical need to enhance player engagement and economic interaction within gaming ecosystems. Our GameFi ecosystem aims to fundamentally transform this landscape by integrating advanced embodied AI agents into GameFi platforms. These AI agents, developed using cutting-edge large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4 and Claude AI, are capable of proactive, adaptive, and contextually rich interactions with players. By going beyond traditional scripted responses, these agents become integral participants in the game's narrative and economic systems, directly influencing player strategies and in-game economies. We address the limitations of current GameFi platforms, which often lack immersive AI interactions and mechanisms for community engagement or creator monetization. Through the deep integration of AI agents with blockchain technology, we establish a consensus-driven, decentralized GameFi ecosystem. This ecosystem empowers creators to monetize their contributions and fosters democratic collaboration among players and creators. Furthermore, by embedding DeFi mechanisms into the gaming experience, we enhance economic participation and provide new opportunities for financial interactions within the game. Our approach enhances player immersion and retention and advances the GameFi ecosystem by bridging traditional gaming with Web3 technologies. By integrating sophisticated AI and DeFi elements, we contribute to the development of more engaging, economically robust, and community-centric gaming environments. This project represents a significant advancement in the state-of-the-art in GameFi, offering insights and methodologies that can be applied throughout the gaming industry.</description>

      <title>Steganography and Probabilistic Risk Analysis: A Game Theoretical Framework for Quantifying Adversary Advantage and Impact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In high-risk environments where unlawful surveillance is prevalent, securing confidential communications is critical. This study introduces a novel steganographic game-theoretic model to analyze the strategic interactions between a defending company and an adversary. By framing the scenario as a non-cooperative game, there is systematic evaluation of optimal strategies for both parties, incorporating costs and benefits such as implementation expenses, potential data leaks, and operational advantages. The derived equilibrium probabilities enable the assessment of success rates, illustrating conditions under which the company benefits from hiding messages or faces increased risks when not implementing steganography. Sensitivity analysis explores how changes in key parameters impact these strategies, enhancing the understanding of decision-making in secure communications. Furthermore, the introduction of an adversary model that quantifies the adversary's advantage using conditional probabilities derived from success rates allows for a quantitative measure of the adversary's effectiveness based on the defender's strategies. By integrating the adversary's advantage into a novel risk analysis framework and employing Monte Carlo simulations, dynamic interactions are captured across advantage scenarios, considering factors like impact factor, steganography effectiveness, and equilibrium probabilities. This comprehensive framework offers practical insights into optimizing security strategies by quantifying potential risk reductions when the adversary is disadvantaged, providing a clear methodology for assessing and mitigating adversarial threats in complex security environments.</description>

      <title>Are We in the AI-Generated Text World Already? Quantifying and Monitoring AIGT on Social Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social media platforms are experiencing a growing presence of AI-Generated Texts (AIGTs). However, the misuse of AIGTs could have profound implications for public opinion, such as spreading misinformation and manipulating narratives. Despite its importance, a systematic study to assess the prevalence of AIGTs on social media is still lacking. To address this gap, this paper aims to quantify, monitor, and analyze the AIGTs on online social media platforms. We first collect a dataset (SM-D) with around 2.4M posts from 3 major social media platforms: Medium, Quora, and Reddit. Then, we construct a diverse dataset (AIGTBench) to train and evaluate AIGT detectors. AIGTBench combines popular open-source datasets and our AIGT datasets generated from social media texts by 12 LLMs, serving as a benchmark for evaluating mainstream detectors. With this setup, we identify the best-performing detector (OSM-Det). We then apply OSM-Det to SM-D to track AIGTs over time and observe different trends of AI Attribution Rate (AAR) across social media platforms from January 2022 to October 2024. Specifically, Medium and Quora exhibit marked increases in AAR, rising from 1.77% to 37.03% and 2.06% to 38.95%, respectively. In contrast, Reddit shows slower growth, with AAR increasing from 1.31% to 2.45% over the same period. Our further analysis indicates that AIGTs differ from human-written texts across several dimensions, including linguistic patterns, topic distributions, engagement levels, and the follower distribution of authors. We envision our analysis and findings on AIGTs in social media can shed light on future research in this domain.</description>

      <title>On the Effectiveness of Adversarial Training on Malware Classifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adversarial Training (AT) has been widely applied to harden learning-based classifiers against adversarial evasive attacks. However, its effectiveness in identifying and strengthening vulnerable areas of the model's decision space while maintaining high performance on clean data of malware classifiers remains an under-explored area. In this context, the robustness that AT achieves has often been assessed against unrealistic or weak adversarial attacks, which negatively affect performance on clean data and are arguably no longer threats. Previous work seems to suggest robustness is a task-dependent property of AT. We instead argue it is a more complex problem that requires exploring AT and the intertwined roles played by certain factors within data, feature representations, classifiers, and robust optimization settings, as well as proper evaluation factors, such as the realism of evasion attacks, to gain a true sense of AT's effectiveness. In our paper, we address this gap by systematically exploring the role such factors have in hardening malware classifiers through AT. Contrary to recent prior work, a key observation of our research and extensive experiments confirm the hypotheses that all such factors influence the actual effectiveness of AT, as demonstrated by the varying degrees of success from our empirical analysis. We identify five evaluation pitfalls that affect state-of-the-art studies and summarize our insights in ten takeaways to draw promising research directions toward better understanding the factors' settings under which adversarial training works at best.</description>

      <title>FameBias: Embedding Manipulation Bias Attack in Text-to-Image Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion models have rapidly advanced, enabling the generation of high-quality images that align closely with textual descriptions. However, this progress has also raised concerns about their misuse for propaganda and other malicious activities. Recent studies reveal that attackers can embed biases into these models through simple fine-tuning, causing them to generate targeted imagery when triggered by specific phrases. This underscores the potential for T2I models to act as tools for disseminating propaganda, producing images aligned with an attacker's objective for end-users.
  Building on this concept, we introduce FameBias, a T2I biasing attack that manipulates the embeddings of input prompts to generate images featuring specific public figures. Unlike prior methods, Famebias operates solely on the input embedding vectors without requiring additional model training. We evaluate FameBias comprehensively using Stable Diffusion V2, generating a large corpus of images based on various trigger nouns and target public figures. Our experiments demonstrate that FameBias achieves a high attack success rate while preserving the semantic context of the original prompts across multiple trigger-target pairs.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Threat of Fraud Gangs to Graph Neural Networks: Multi-Target Graph Injection Attacks against GNN-Based Fraud Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as an effective tool for fraud detection, identifying fraudulent users, and uncovering malicious behaviors. However, attacks against GNN-based fraud detectors and their risks have rarely been studied, thereby leaving potential threats unaddressed. Recent findings suggest that frauds are increasingly organized as gangs or groups. In this work, we design attack scenarios where fraud gangs aim to make their fraud nodes misclassified as benign by camouflaging their illicit activities in collusion. Based on these scenarios, we study adversarial attacks against GNN-based fraud detectors by simulating attacks of fraud gangs in three real-world fraud cases: spam reviews, fake news, and medical insurance frauds. We define these attacks as multi-target graph injection attacks and propose MonTi, a transformer-based Multi-target one-Time graph injection attack model. MonTi simultaneously generates attributes and edges of all attack nodes with a transformer encoder, capturing interdependencies between attributes and edges more effectively than most existing graph injection attack methods that generate these elements sequentially. Additionally, MonTi adaptively allocates the degree budget for each attack node to explore diverse injection structures involving target, candidate, and attack nodes, unlike existing methods that fix the degree budget across all attack nodes. Experiments show that MonTi outperforms the state-of-the-art graph injection attack methods on five real-world graphs.</description>

      <title>FedGIG: Graph Inversion from Gradient in Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have shown that Federated learning (FL) is vulnerable to Gradient Inversion Attacks (GIA), which can recover private training data from shared gradients. However, existing methods are designed for dense, continuous data such as images or vectorized texts, and cannot be directly applied to sparse and discrete graph data. This paper first explores GIA's impact on Federated Graph Learning (FGL) and introduces Graph Inversion from Gradient in Federated Learning (FedGIG), a novel GIA method specifically designed for graph-structured data. FedGIG includes the adjacency matrix constraining module, which ensures the sparsity and discreteness of the reconstructed graph data, and the subgraph reconstruction module, which is designed to complete missing common subgraph structures. Extensive experiments on molecular datasets demonstrate FedGIG's superior accuracy over existing GIA techniques.</description>

      <title>BlockEmulator: An Emulator Enabling to Test Blockchain Sharding Protocols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03612v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Numerous blockchain simulators have been proposed to allow researchers to simulate mainstream blockchains. However, we have not yet found a testbed that enables researchers to develop and evaluate their new consensus algorithms or new protocols for blockchain sharding systems. To fill this gap, we developed BlockEmulator, which is designed as an experimental platform, particularly for emulating blockchain sharding mechanisms. BlockEmulator adopts a lightweight blockchain architecture so developers can only focus on implementing their new protocols or mechanisms. Using layered modules and useful programming interfaces offered by BlockEmulator, researchers can implement a new protocol with minimum effort. Through experiments, we test various functionalities of BlockEmulator in two steps. Firstly, we prove the correctness of the emulation results yielded by BlockEmulator by comparing the theoretical analysis with the observed experiment results. Secondly, other experimental results demonstrate that BlockEmulator can facilitate measuring a series of metrics, including throughput, transaction confirmation latency, cross-shard transaction ratio, the queuing status of transaction pools, workload distribution across blockchain shards, etc. We have made BlockEmulator open-source in Github.</description>

      <title>CloudLens: Modeling and Detecting Cloud Security Vulnerabilities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10985v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cloud computing services provide scalable and cost-effective solutions for data storage, processing, and collaboration. With their growing popularity, concerns about security vulnerabilities are increasing. To address this, first, we provide a formal model, called CloudLens, that expresses relations between different cloud objects such as users, datastores, security roles, representing access control policies in cloud systems. Second, as access control misconfigurations are often the primary driver for cloud attacks, we develop a planning model for detecting security vulnerabilities. Such vulnerabilities can lead to widespread attacks such as ransomware, sensitive data exfiltration among others. A planner generates attacks to identify such vulnerabilities in the cloud. Finally, we test our approach on 14 real Amazon AWS cloud configurations of different commercial organizations. Our system can identify a broad range of security vulnerabilities, which state-of-the-art industry tools cannot detect.</description>

      <title>SoK: Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs) and Emerging Trends in Restaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00644v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Liquid staking and restaking represent recent innovations in Decentralized Finance (DeFi) that garnered user interest and capital. Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs), tokenized representations of staked tokens on Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchains, are the leading staking method. LSTs offer users the ability to earn staking rewards while maintaining liquidity, enabling seamless integration into DeFi protocols and free tradeability. Restaking builds upon this concept by allowing staked tokens, LSTs or native Bitcoin tokens to secure additional protocols and PoS chains for supplementary rewards. Liquid Restaking Tokens (LRTs) unlock liquidity of restaked assets. This Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) establishes a comprehensive framework for the technical and economic models of liquid staking protocols. Using this framework, we systematically compare protocols mechanics, including node operator selection, staking reward distribution, and slashing. Our empirical analysis of token performance reveals that protocol design and market dynamics impact token market value. We further present the recent developments in restaking and discuss associated risks and security implications. Lastly, we review the emerging literature on liquid staking and restaking.</description>

      <title>SafeAligner: Safety Alignment against Jailbreak Attacks via Response Disparity Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18118v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As the development of large language models (LLMs) rapidly advances, securing these models effectively without compromising their utility has become a pivotal area of research. However, current defense strategies against jailbreak attacks (i.e., efforts to bypass security protocols) often suffer from limited adaptability, restricted general capability, and high cost. To address these challenges, we introduce SafeAligner, a methodology implemented at the decoding stage to fortify defenses against jailbreak attacks. We begin by developing two specialized models: the Sentinel Model, which is trained to foster safety, and the Intruder Model, designed to generate riskier responses. SafeAligner leverages the disparity in security levels between the responses from these models to differentiate between harmful and beneficial tokens, effectively guiding the safety alignment by altering the output token distribution of the target model. Extensive experiments show that SafeAligner can increase the likelihood of beneficial tokens, while reducing the occurrence of harmful ones, thereby ensuring secure alignment with minimal loss to generality.</description>

      <title>Future Events as Backdoor Triggers: Investigating Temporal Vulnerabilities in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04108v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Backdoors are hidden behaviors that are only triggered once an AI system has been deployed. Bad actors looking to create successful backdoors must design them to avoid activation during training and evaluation. Since data used in these stages often only contains information about events that have already occurred, a component of a simple backdoor trigger could be a model recognizing data that is in the future relative to when it was trained. Through prompting experiments and by probing internal activations, we show that current large language models (LLMs) can distinguish past from future events, with probes on model activations achieving 90% accuracy. We train models with backdoors triggered by a temporal distributional shift; they activate when the model is exposed to news headlines beyond their training cut-off dates. Fine-tuning on helpful, harmless and honest (HHH) data does not work well for removing simpler backdoor triggers but is effective on our backdoored models, although this distinction is smaller for the larger-scale model we tested. We also find that an activation-steering vector representing a model's internal representation of the date influences the rate of backdoor activation. We take these results as initial evidence that, at least for models at the modest scale we test, standard safety measures are enough to remove these backdoors.</description>

      <title>The Dark Side of Function Calling: Pathways to Jailbreaking Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17915v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, but their power comes with significant security considerations. While extensive research has been conducted on the safety of LLMs in chat mode, the security implications of their function calling feature have been largely overlooked. This paper uncovers a critical vulnerability in the function calling process of LLMs, introducing a novel "jailbreak function" attack method that exploits alignment discrepancies, user coercion, and the absence of rigorous safety filters. Our empirical study, conducted on six state-of-the-art LLMs including GPT-4o, Claude-3.5-Sonnet, and Gemini-1.5-pro, reveals an alarming average success rate of over 90\% for this attack. We provide a comprehensive analysis of why function calls are susceptible to such attacks and propose defensive strategies, including the use of defensive prompts. Our findings highlight the urgent need for enhanced security measures in the function calling capabilities of LLMs, contributing to the field of AI safety by identifying a previously unexplored risk, designing an effective attack method, and suggesting practical defensive measures.

      <title>An Approach To Enhance IoT Security In 6G Networks Through Explainable AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05310v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wireless communication has evolved significantly, with 6G offering groundbreaking capabilities, particularly for IoT. However, the integration of IoT into 6G presents new security challenges, expanding the attack surface due to vulnerabilities introduced by advanced technologies such as open RAN, terahertz (THz) communication, IRS, massive MIMO, and AI. Emerging threats like AI exploitation, virtualization risks, and evolving attacks, including data manipulation and signal interference, further complicate security efforts. As 6G standards are set to be finalized by 2030, work continues to align security measures with technological advances. However, substantial gaps remain in frameworks designed to secure integrated IoT and 6G systems. Our research addresses these challenges by utilizing tree-based machine learning algorithms to manage complex datasets and evaluate feature importance. We apply data balancing techniques to ensure fair attack representation and use SHAP and LIME to improve model transparency. By aligning feature importance with XAI methods and cross-validating for consistency, we boost model accuracy and enhance IoT security within the 6G ecosystem.</description>

      <title>Can LLMs Obfuscate Code? A Systematic Analysis of Large Language Models into Assembly Code Obfuscation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16135v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Malware authors often employ code obfuscations to make their malware harder to detect. Existing tools for generating obfuscated code often require access to the original source code (e.g., C++ or Java), and adding new obfuscations is a non-trivial, labor-intensive process. In this study, we ask the following question: Can Large Language Models (LLMs) potentially generate a new obfuscated assembly code? If so, this poses a risk to anti-virus engines and potentially increases the flexibility of attackers to create new obfuscation patterns. We answer this in the affirmative by developing the MetamorphASM benchmark comprising MetamorphASM Dataset (MAD) along with three code obfuscation techniques: dead code, register substitution, and control flow change. The MetamorphASM systematically evaluates the ability of LLMs to generate and analyze obfuscated code using MAD, which contains 328,200 obfuscated assembly code samples. We release this dataset and analyze the success rate of various LLMs (e.g., GPT-3.5/4, GPT-4o-mini, Starcoder, CodeGemma, CodeLlama, CodeT5, and LLaMA 3.1) in generating obfuscated assembly code. The evaluation was performed using established information-theoretic metrics and manual human review to ensure correctness and provide the foundation for researchers to study and develop remediations to this risk. The source code can be found at the following GitHub link: https://github.com/mohammadi-ali/MetamorphASM.</description>

      <title>Level Up with ML Vulnerability Identification: Leveraging Domain Constraints in Feature Space for Robust Android Malware Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.15128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.15128v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) promises to enhance the efficacy of Android Malware Detection (AMD); however, ML models are vulnerable to realistic evasion attacks--crafting realizable Adversarial Examples (AEs) that satisfy Android malware domain constraints. To eliminate ML vulnerabilities, defenders aim to identify susceptible regions in the feature space where ML models are prone to deception. The primary approach to identifying vulnerable regions involves investigating realizable AEs, but generating these feasible apps poses a challenge. For instance, previous work has relied on generating either feature-space norm-bounded AEs or problem-space realizable AEs in adversarial hardening. The former is efficient but lacks full coverage of vulnerable regions while the latter can uncover these regions by satisfying domain constraints but is known to be time-consuming. To address these limitations, we propose an approach to facilitate the identification of vulnerable regions. Specifically, we introduce a new interpretation of Android domain constraints in the feature space, followed by a novel technique that learns them. Our empirical evaluations across various evasion attacks indicate effective detection of AEs using learned domain constraints, with an average of 89.6%. Furthermore, extensive experiments on different Android malware detectors demonstrate that utilizing our learned domain constraints in Adversarial Training (AT) outperforms other AT-based defenses that rely on norm-bounded AEs or state-of-the-art non-uniform perturbations. Finally, we show that retraining a malware detector with a wide variety of feature-space realizable AEs results in a 77.9% robustness improvement against realizable AEs generated by unknown problem-space transformations, with up to 70x faster training than using problem-space realizable AEs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08309v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spear-phishing attacks present a significant security challenge, with large language models (LLMs) escalating the threat by generating convincing emails and facilitating target reconnaissance. To address this, we propose a detection approach based on a novel document vectorization method that utilizes an ensemble of LLMs to create representation vectors. By prompting LLMs to reason and respond to human-crafted questions, we quantify the presence of common persuasion principles in the email's content, producing prompted contextual document vectors for a downstream supervised machine learning model. We evaluate our method using a unique dataset generated by a proprietary system that automates target reconnaissance and spear-phishing email creation. Our method achieves a 91\% F1 score in identifying LLM-generated spear-phishing emails, with the training set comprising only traditional phishing and benign emails. Key contributions include a novel document vectorization method utilizing LLM reasoning, a publicly available dataset of high-quality spear-phishing emails, and the demonstrated effectiveness of our method in detecting such emails. This methodology can be utilized for various document classification tasks, particularly in adversarial problem domains.</description>

      <title>Security Attacks on LLM-based Code Completion Tools</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11006v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has significantly advanced code completion capabilities, giving rise to a new generation of LLM-based Code Completion Tools (LCCTs). Unlike general-purpose LLMs, these tools possess unique workflows, integrating multiple information sources as input and prioritizing code suggestions over natural language interaction, which introduces distinct security challenges. Additionally, LCCTs often rely on proprietary code datasets for training, raising concerns about the potential exposure of sensitive data. This paper exploits these distinct characteristics of LCCTs to develop targeted attack methodologies on two critical security risks: jailbreaking and training data extraction attacks. Our experimental results expose significant vulnerabilities within LCCTs, including a 99.4% success rate in jailbreaking attacks on GitHub Copilot and a 46.3% success rate on Amazon Q. Furthermore, We successfully extracted sensitive user data from GitHub Copilot, including 54 real email addresses and 314 physical addresses associated with GitHub usernames. Our study also demonstrates that these code-based attack methods are effective against general-purpose LLMs, such as the GPT series, highlighting a broader security misalignment in the handling of code by modern LLMs. These findings underscore critical security challenges associated with LCCTs and suggest essential directions for strengthening their security frameworks. The example code and attack samples from our research are provided at https://github.com/Sensente/Security-Attacks-on-LCCTs.</description>

      <title>Quantum Sieving for Code-Based Cryptanalysis and Its Limitations for ISD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16458v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sieving using near-neighbor search techniques is a well-known method in lattice-based cryptanalysis, yielding the current best runtime for the shortest vector problem in both the classical [BDGL16] and quantum [BCSS23] setting. Recently, sieving has also become an important tool in code-based cryptanalysis. Specifically, using a sieving subroutine, [GJN23, DEEK24] presented a variant of the information-set decoding (ISD) framework, which is commonly used for attacking cryptographically relevant instances of the decoding problem. The resulting sieving-based ISD framework yields complexities close to the best-performing classical algorithms for the decoding problem such as [BJMM12, BM18]. It is therefore natural to ask how well quantum versions perform. In this work, we introduce the first quantum algorithms for code sieving by designing quantum variants of the aforementioned sieving subroutine. In particular, using quantum-walk techniques, we provide a speed-up over the best known classical algorithm from [DEEK24] and over a variant using Grover's algorithm [Gro96]. Our quantum-walk algorithm exploits the structure of the underlying search problem by adding a layer of locality-sensitive filtering, inspired by the quantum-walk algorithm for lattice sieving from [CL21]. We complement our asymptotic analysis of the quantum algorithms with numerical results, and observe that our quantum speed-ups for code sieving behave similarly as those observed in lattice sieving. In addition, we show that a natural quantum analog of the sieving-based ISD framework does not provide any speed-up over the first presented quantum ISD algorithm [Ber10]. Our analysis highlights that the framework should be adapted in order to outperform the state-of-the-art of quantum ISD algorithms [KT17, Kir18].</description>

      <title>Validated Strong Consensus Protocol for Asynchronous Vote-based Blockchains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08161v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vote-based blockchains construct a state machine replication (SMR) system among participating nodes, using Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) consensus protocols to transition from one state to another. Currently, they rely on either synchronous or partially synchronous networks with leader-based coordination or costly Asynchronous Common Subset (ACS) protocols in asynchronous settings, making them impractical for large-scale asynchronous applications.
  To make Asynchronous SMR scalable, this paper proposes a \emph{validated strong} BFT consensus model that allows leader-based coordination in asynchronous settings. Our BFT consensus model offers the same level of tolerance as binary byzantine agreement but does not demand consistency among honest nodes before they vote. An SMR using our model allows nodes to operate in different, tentative, but mutually exclusive states until they eventually converge on the same state. We propose an asynchronous BFT protocol for vote-based blockchains employing our consensus model to address several critical challenges: how to ensure that nodes eventually converge on the same state across voting rounds, how to assure that a blockchain will steadily progress through epochs while reaching consensus for previous epochs, and how to maintain robust byzantine fault tolerance.
  Our protocol greatly reduces message complexity and is the first one to achieve linear view changes without relying on threshold signatures. We prove that an asynchronous blockchain built on our protocol can operate with the \emph{same} simplicity and efficiency as partially synchronous blockchains built on, e.g. HotStuff-2. This facilitates deploying asynchronous blockchains across large-scale networks.</description>

      <title>LLM for Barcodes: Generating Diverse Synthetic Data for Identity Documents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14962v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate barcode detection and decoding in Identity documents is crucial for applications like security, healthcare, and education, where reliable data extraction and verification are essential. However, building robust detection models is challenging due to the lack of diverse, realistic datasets an issue often tied to privacy concerns and the wide variety of document formats. Traditional tools like Faker rely on predefined templates, making them less effective for capturing the complexity of real-world identity documents. In this paper, we introduce a new approach to synthetic data generation that uses LLMs to create contextually rich and realistic data without relying on predefined field. Using the vast knowledge LLMs have about different documents and content, our method creates data that reflects the variety found in real identity documents. This data is then encoded into barcode and overlayed on templates for documents such as Driver's licenses, Insurance cards, Student IDs. Our approach simplifies the process of dataset creation, eliminating the need for extensive domain knowledge or predefined fields. Compared to traditional methods like Faker, data generated by LLM demonstrates greater diversity and contextual relevance, leading to improved performance in barcode detection models. This scalable, privacy-first solution is a big step forward in advancing machine learning for automated document processing and identity verification.</description>

      <title>TSCheater: Generating High-Quality Tibetan Adversarial Texts via Visual Similarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02371v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Language models based on deep neural networks are vulnerable to textual adversarial attacks. While rich-resource languages like English are receiving focused attention, Tibetan, a cross-border language, is gradually being studied due to its abundant ancient literature and critical language strategy. Currently, there are several Tibetan adversarial text generation methods, but they do not fully consider the textual features of Tibetan script and overestimate the quality of generated adversarial texts. To address this issue, we propose a novel Tibetan adversarial text generation method called TSCheater, which considers the characteristic of Tibetan encoding and the feature that visually similar syllables have similar semantics. This method can also be transferred to other abugidas, such as Devanagari script. We utilize a self-constructed Tibetan syllable visual similarity database called TSVSDB to generate substitution candidates and adopt a greedy algorithm-based scoring mechanism to determine substitution order. After that, we conduct the method on eight victim language models. Experimentally, TSCheater outperforms existing methods in attack effectiveness, perturbation magnitude, semantic similarity, visual similarity, and human acceptance. Finally, we construct the first Tibetan adversarial robustness evaluation benchmark called AdvTS, which is generated by existing methods and proofread by humans.</description>
