      <title>In models of spontaneous wave-function collapse, why only fermions collapse, not bosons?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective collapse models are often implemented so that collapse acts only on the fermionic (matter) sector, while bosonic fields do not undergo fundamental collapse. In generalized trace dynamics (GTD), spontaneous localization is expected to arise when the trace Hamiltonian has a significant anti-self-adjoint component. In this note we show, starting from the STM-atom (spacetime-matter atom) trace Lagrangian written in terms of two inequivalent matrix velocities $\dot Q_1$ and $\dot Q_2$, that the purely bosonic subsector admits a self-adjoint Hamiltonian, whereas the fermionic sector carries an intrinsic anti-self-adjoint contribution. The key structural input is that making the trace Lagrangian bosonic requires insertion of two \emph{unequal} odd-grade Grassmann elements $\beta_1\neq \beta_2$. Assuming natural adjoint properties for these elements, we compute the trace Hamiltonian explicitly via trace-derivative canonical momenta (with bosonic and fermionic variations treated separately) and isolate the resulting anti-self-adjoint term. This provides a first-principles mechanism, within GTD, for why only fermionic degrees of freedom act as collapse channels.</description>

      <title>Model selection with the Pantheon+ Type Ia SN sample</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent discoveries, e.g., by JWST and DESI, have elevated the level of tension with inflationary $\Lambda$CDM. For example, the empirical evidence now suggests that the standard model violates at least one of the energy conditions from general relativity, which were designed to ensure that systems have positive energy, attractive gravity and non-superluminal energy flows. In this Letter, we use a recently compiled Type Ia supernova sample to examine whether $\Lambda$CDM violates the energy conditions in the local Universe, and carry out model selection with its principal competitor, the $R_{\rm h}=ct$ universe. We derive model-independent constraints on the distance modulus based on the energy conditions and compare these with the Hubble diagram predicted by both $\Lambda$CDM and $R_{\rm h}=ct$, using the Pantheon+ Type Ia supernova catalog. We find that $\Lambda$CDM violates the strong energy condition over the redshift range $z \subset (0, 2)$, whereas $R_{\rm h}=ct$ satisfies all four energy constraints. At the same time, $R_{\rm h}=ct$ is favored by these data over $\Lambda$CDM with a likelihood of $\sim 89.5\%$ versus $\sim 10.5\%$. The $R_{\rm h}=ct$ model without inflation is strongly favored by the Type Ia supernova data over the currrent standard model, while simultaneously adhering to the general relativistic energy conditions at both high and low redshifts.</description>

      <title>Quantum mechanics provides the physical basis of teleological evolutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07849v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the quantum computational speedup is due to the teleological character of quantum algorithms, their being evolutions toward a goal (the solution of the problem) with an attractor in the very goal they will produce in the future (the solution of the problem again). We also show that, under the quantum cosmological assumption and for the Fine-tuned Universe version of the Anthropic Principle, the physical basis of the teleological character of quantum algorithms applies as well to the evolutions of the living for which the teleological notion was originally conceived.</description>
