      <title>An Artificial Intelligence Framework for Conflict Mapping and Resolution for Sustainability of Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Early design decisions strongly influence environmental, economic and social outcomes, yet sustainability assessment tools rarely reveal trade-offs among these three pillars. This study presents a framework for Conflict Mapping and Resolution for Sustainability of Systems (CONFARM). CONFARM consists of four steps: lifecycle documentation, cause-effect mapping, conflict database construction and multi-criteria scoring. A conflict is recorded when a single decision produces positive and negative effects across pillars. Each effect is evaluated using impact magnitude and pillar weight to generate a sustainability ratio. CONFARM may be applied manually or through automated extraction using natural-language processing and large language models. The method is demonstrated in three sectors representing different data structures and system scales: agriculture (rice and corn), fashion (slow and fast fashion) and energy (nuclear and natural gas). Each system was analysed at increasing conflict densities. Results consistently showed that sustainability scores converged as more conflicts were mapped, indicating stable evaluation across methods. Slow fashion and nuclear systems exhibited relatively higher sustainability performance, while fast fashion and natural gas systems showed lower performance. CONFARM improves early-stage decision support by making trade-offs explicit and enabling comparative evaluation. It offers a structured approach for cleaner production and scalable sustainability assessment across domains.</description>

      <title>Optimal dismantling of directed networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a fundamental problem in network science, network dismantling focuses on identifying a set of critical nodes whose removal sharply reduces a network's connectivity and functionality. Potential applications include stopping rumor spread, blocking sentiment propagation, and controlling epidemics and pandemics. Previous studies have mainly focused on undirected networks, whereas many real-world networks are inherently directed, such as the World Wide Web and the global trade system. Moreover, the functionality of directed networks depends on the giant strongly connected component (GSCC), where nodes are mutually reachable. Considering both the directionality and heterogeneity of these networks, we propose a novel centrality measure, network incoherence (NI) centrality, and develop a trophic analysis-based dismantling (TAD) method, in which nodes are removed in descending order according to their NI centrality scores, aiming to efficiently dismantle directed networks by reducing the GSCC. When applied to a wide range of benchmark synthetic networks with varying degree heterogeneity and 15 real-world directed networks, our TAD method consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. Significantly, TAD also induces the largest maximum avalanches during the dismantling process, highlighting its ability to capture structurally critical nodes. These findings provide new insight into the structure-function relationship of directed networks and inform the design of more resilient systems against perturbations.</description>

      <title>Targeted cooling of urban cycling networks for heat-resilient mobility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cities are increasingly challenged by extreme heat events, which pose serious risks to public health and urban livability. Micromobility users, whose numbers have increased rapidly in recent years, are particularly vulnerable to outdoor heat exposure. Yet, their exposure patterns and the effectiveness of mitigation measures remain poorly understood. Here, we couple a high-resolution urban microclimate model (WRF--BEP--SOLWEIG) with 4.76 million Citi Bike trips in New York City to quantify cyclists' thermal exposure during the June 2024 heatwave and to evaluate targeted cooling strategies. Results show that a small fraction of the street network concentrates the majority of rider heat exposure, and that localized interventions along these segments yield the greatest benefits. Targeted tree planting along just 1.5% of the city's street network reduces total heat-exposed kilometers ridden by 19%, equivalent to a thermal stress reduction of about 4{\deg}C, with its impact maximized during midday hours. In contrast, randomized citywide tree planting produces diffuse, resource-intensive cooling, highlighting the superior efficiency of spatially prioritized interventions. Baseline results further indicate that daytime heat stress is higher in lower-income neighborhoods, adding an important social dimension of urban heat exposure. Together, these findings provide a quantitative basis for designing heat-resilient and equitable cycling networks in a warming climate.</description>

      <title>Meso-scale structures in signed networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Meso-scale structures in signed networks have been studied under the limiting assumption of the validity of social balance theory, which predicts positive connections within groups and negative connections between groups. Here, we propose and apply a methodology that overcomes this limitation and is able to find and characterize also the different possible unbalanced structures in signed networks. Applying our methodology to 24 empirical networks, from social-political, financial, and biological domains, we find that unbalanced meso-scale structures are prevalent in real-world networks, including cases with substantial balance at the micro-scale of triangles. In particular, we find that assortativity often prevails regardless of the interaction sign and that core-periphery structures are typical in online social networks. Our findings highlight the complexity of meso-scale relational structures, the importance of using computational methods that are a priori agnostic to specific patterns, and the importance of independently evaluating micro- and meso-scale predictions of social balance theory.</description>

      <title>Causal symmetrization as an empirical signature of operational autonomy in complex systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09352v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Theoretical biology has long proposed that autonomous systems sustain their identity through reciprocal constraints between structure and activity, a dynamical regime underlying concepts such as closure to efficient causation and autopoiesis. Despite their influence, these principles have resisted direct empirical assessment outside biological systems.
  Here, we empirically assess this framework in artificial sociotechnical systems by identifying a statistical signature consistent with operational autonomy. Analyzing 50 large-scale collaborative software ecosystems spanning 11,042 system-months, we develop an order parameter ($\Gamma$) quantifying structural persistence under component turnover and use Granger causality to characterize directional coupling between organizational architecture and collective activity. $\Gamma$ exhibits a bimodal distribution (Hartigan's dip test $p = 0.0126$; $\Delta$BIC = 2000), revealing a sharp phase transition between an exploratory regime of high variance and a mature regime characterized by a 1.77-fold variance collapse. At maturity, causal symmetrization emerges, with the structure--activity coupling ratio shifting from 0.71 (activity-driven) to 0.94 (bidirectional).
  A composite viability index combining activity and structural persistence outperforms activity-based prediction alone (AUC = 0.88 vs. 0.81), identifying ``structural zombie'' systems in which sustained activity masks architectural decay.
  Together, these results show that causal symmetrization functions as a necessary statistical signature consistent with theoretical notions of operational closure, without implying biological life or mechanistic closure. They demonstrate that core principles of autonomy can be empirically probed in artificial collaborative systems, supporting substrate-independent dynamical signatures of self-organizing autonomy across complex adaptive systems.</description>

      <title>Measuring Online Behavior Change with Observational Studies: a Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19951v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exploring online behavior change is imperative for societal progress in the context of 21st-century challenges. We analyze 148 articles (2000-2023) focusing on behavior change in the digital space and build a map that categorizes behaviors, behavior change detection methodologies, platforms of reference, and theoretical frameworks that characterize the analysis of online behavior change. Our findings reveal a focus on sentiment shifts, an emphasis on API-restricted platforms, and limited integration of theory. We call for methodologies able to capture a wider range of behavior types, diverse data sources, and stronger theory-practice alignment in the study of online behavior and its change.</description>

      <title>Analytical results for the distribution of first return times of non-backtracking random walks on configuration model networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12341v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present analytical results for the distribution of first return (FR) times of non-backtracking random walks (NBWs) on undirected configuration model networks consisting of $N$ nodes with degree distribution $P(k)$. We focus on the case in which the network consists of a single connected component. Starting from a random initial node $i$ at time $t=0$, an NBW hops into a random neighbor of $i$ at time $t=1$ and at each subsequent step it continues to hop into a random neighbor of its current node, excluding the previous node. We calculate the tail distribution $P ( T_{\rm FR} &gt; t )$ of first return times from a random initial node to itself. It is found that $P ( T_{\rm FR} &gt; t )$ is given by a discrete Laplace transform of the degree distribution $P(k)$. This result exemplifies the relation between structural properties of a network, captured by the degree distribution, and properties of dynamical processes taking place on the network. Using the tail-sum formula, we calculate the mean first return time ${\mathbb E}[ T_{\rm FR} ]$. Surprisingly, ${\mathbb E}[ T_{\rm FR} ]$ coincides with the result obtained from Kac's lemma that applies to simple random walks (RWs). We also calculate the variance ${\rm Var}(T_{\rm FR})$, which accounts for the variability of first return times between different NBW trajectories. We apply this formalism to Erd{\H o}s-R\'enyi networks, random regular graphs and configuration model networks with exponential and power-law degree distributions and obtain closed-form expressions for $P( T_{\rm FR} &gt; t )$ as well as its mean and variance. These results provide useful insight on the advantages of NBWs over simple RWs in network exploration, sampling and search processes.</description>
