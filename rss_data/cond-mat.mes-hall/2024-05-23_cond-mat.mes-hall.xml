      <title>Engineering Miniband Topology via Band-Folding in Moir\'e Superlattice Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of topologically non-trivial flat bands in moir\'e materials provides an opportunity to explore the interplay between topological physics and correlation effects, leading to the recent experimental realization of interacting topological phases, e.g. fractional Chern insulators. In this work, we propose a mechanism of band inversion induced by band-folding from the moir\'e superlattice potential for engineering topological minibands in moir\'e materials. We illustrate this mechanism via two classes of model Hamiltonians, namely the Rashba model and the Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang (BHZ) model, under the moir\'e superlattice potentials. Moir\'e minibands with non-trivial band topology, including Z2 number, mirror Chern number and fragile topology, have been found and the topological phase diagram is constructed for these moir\'e models. A general theory based on band representations in the mori\'e Brillouin zone is also developed for a generalization of this mechanism to other space groups. Possible experimental realizations of our model Hamiltonian are discussed.</description>

      <title>Lee-Yang theory of the superradiant phase transition in the open Dicke model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Dicke model describes an ensemble of two-level atoms that are coupled to a confined light mode of an optical cavity. Above a critical coupling, the cavity becomes macroscopically occupied, and the system enters the superradiant phase. This phase transition can be observed by detecting the photons that are emitted from the cavity; however, it only becomes apparent in the limit of long observation times, while actual experiments are of a finite duration. To circumvent this problem, we here make use of recent advances in Lee-Yang theories of phase transitions to show that the superradiant phase transition can be inferred from the factorial cumulants of the photon emission statistics obtained during a finite measurement time. Specifically, from the factorial cumulants, we can determine the complex singularities of generating functions that describe the photon emission statistics, and by extrapolating their positions to the long-time limit, one can detect the superradiant phase transition. We also show that the convergence points determine the tails of the large-deviation statistics of the photon current. Our work demonstrates how phase transitions in the Dicke model and in other quantum many-body systems can be detected from measurements of a finite duration.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-heating effects can significantly degrade the performance in nanoscale devices. We investigate self-heating effects in such devices based on two-dimensional materials using ab-initio techniques. A new algorithm was developed to allow for efficient self-energy computations, achieving a $\sim$500 times speedup. It is found that for the simple case of free-standing MoS$_2$ without explicit metal leads, the self-heating effects do not result in significant performance degradation.</description>

      <title>Direct measurement of a $\sin(2\varphi)$ current phase relation in a graphene superconducting quantum interference device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a Josephson junction, the current phase relation relates the phase variation of the superconducting order parameter, $\varphi$, between the two superconducting leads connected through a weak link, to the dissipationless current . This relation is the fingerprint of the junction. It is usually dominated by a $\sin(\varphi)$ harmonic, however its precise knowledge is necessary to design superconducting quantum circuits with tailored properties. Here, we directly measure the current phase relation of a superconducting quantum interference device made with gate-tunable graphene Josephson junctions and we show that it can behave as a $\sin(2\varphi)$ Josephson element, free of the traditionally dominant $\sin(\varphi)$ harmonic. Such element will be instrumental for the development of superconducting quantum bits protected from decoherence.</description>

      <title>Electronic state back action on mechanical motion in a quantum point contact coupled to a nanomechanical resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a nanomechanical resonator coupled to a quantum point contact, the back action of the electronic state on mechanical motion is studied. The quantum point contact conductance changing with subband index and the eigenfrequency of the resonator are found to correlate. A model is constructed explaining the frequency deviations by the alternating ability of the quantum point contact to screen the piezoelectric charge induced by mechanical oscillations. The observed effects can be used to develop electromechanical methods for studying the density of states in quasi-one-dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>Direct observation of linear dispersion close to the Fermi level in the topological semimetal WTe$_2$ through Landau quantization at atomic scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the topological Weyl type-II semimetal WTe$_2$ via Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) and Density Functional Theory calculations (DFT). We succesfully determine the band structure at zero field close to the Fermi level by comparing quasiparticle interference (QPI) experiments with DFT. Under magnetic fields, we observe Landau level quantization on atomic scale measurements and find a level sequence evidencing a linearly dispersing portion of the band structure. Our results establish the long sought connection between Weyl cones and Landau quantization in WTe$_2$. Atomic scale Landau quantization emerges as a powerful probe of topological surface states for semimetals, superconductors and topological insulators.</description>

      <title>Heavy Fermions as an Efficient Representation of Atomistic Strain and Relaxation in Twisted Bilayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although the strongly interacting flat bands in twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) have been approached using the minimal Bistritzer-MacDonald (BM) Hamiltonian, there is mounting evidence that strain and lattice relaxation are essential in correctly determining the order of the correlated insulator groundstates. These effects can be incorporated in an enhanced continuum model by introducing additional terms computed from the relaxation profile. To develop an analytical and physical understanding of these effects, we include strain and relaxation in the topological heavy fermion (HF) model of TBG. We find that strain and relaxation are very well captured in first order perturbation theory by projection onto the fully symmetric HF Hilbert space, and remarkably do not alter the interacting terms in the periodic Anderson model. Their effects are fully incorporated in the single-particle HF Hamiltonian, and can be reproduced in a minimal model with only 4 symmetry-breaking terms. Our results demonstrate that the heavy fermion framework of TBG is an efficient and robust representation of the perturbations encountered in experiment.</description>

      <title>Simulating graphene-based single-electron transistor: incoherent current effects due to the presence of electron-electron interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Carbon-based nanostructures have unparalleled electronic properties. At the same time, using an allotrope of carbon as the contacts can yield better device control and reproducibility. In this work, we simulate a single-electron transistor composed of a segment of a graphene nanoribbon coupled to carbon nanotubes electrodes. Using the non-equilibrium Green's function formalism we atomistically describe the electronic transport properties of the system including electron-electron interactions. Using this methodology we are able to recover experimentally observed phenomena, such as the Coulomb blockade, as well as the corresponding Coulomb diamonds. Furthermore, we are able to separate the different contributions to transport and show that incoherent effects due to the interaction play a crucial role in the transport properties depending on the region of the stability diagram being considered.</description>

      <title>Ballast charges for semiconductor spin qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semiconductor spin qubits are an attractive platform for quantum computing, but their performance is degraded primarily by fluctuating electromagnetic environments. We introduce the concept of ballast charges, which are induced charges on the surface of an additional screening layer situated below the qubits. The counteractive behavior of these charges can significantly reduce the power spectral density associated with fluctuations from two-level systems that contribute to charge noise. Our simulations show that the dephasing time of a spin qubit in a Si/SiGe device increases by a factor of 4 to 6 on average when using this method. We also discuss the physical implementation and potential challenges of this approach.</description>

      <title>Effect of boundary roughness on the attenuation of specular phonon reflection in graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reduced phonon specularity $p$ from boundary roughness scattering plays a major role in the lower thermal conductivity in semiconducting and insulating nanowires and films. Although the well-known Ziman formula $p=\exp(-4\sigma^{2}q_{x}^{2})$, where $\sigma$ and $q_{x}$ denote the root-mean-square boundary roughness and the normal component of the incident phonon wave vector, respectively, and its variants are commonly used in the literature to estimate how roughness attenuates $p$, their validity and accuracy remain poorly understood, especially when the effects of mode conversion cannot be ignored. In this paper, we investigate the accuracy and validity of the more general Ogilvy formula, from which the Ziman formula is derived, by comparing its predictions to the $p$ values computed from Atomistic Green's Function (AGF) simulations for an ensemble of rough boundaries in single-layer graphene. The effects of phonon dispersion, incident angle, polarization, mode conversion, and correlation length are analyzed. Our results suggest that the Ogilvy formula is remarkably accurate for $0&lt;q_{x}&lt;\frac{\pi}{4\sigma}$ when the lateral correlation length $L$ is large or the phonon is at normal incidence. At large $q_{x}$ in the short-wavelength limit, the $q_{x}$-dependence of $p$ becomes significantly weaker. In the large-$L$ limit, the numerical results suggest the existence of a minimum $p$ for short-wavelength phonons, given by $p\sim p_{0}\exp(-\pi^{2}/4)$, where $p_{0}$ is the baseline specularity for the ideal boundary.</description>

      <title>High transparency induced superconductivity in field effect two-dimensional electron gases in undoped InAs/AlGaSb surface quantum wells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on transport characteristics of field effect two-dimensional electron gases (2DEG) in 24 nm wide indium arsenide surface quantum wells. High quality single-subband magnetotransport with clear quantized integer quantum Hall plateaus are observed to filling factor $\nu=2$ in magnetic fields of up to B = 18 T, at electron densities up to 8$\times 10^{11}$ /cm$^2$. Peak mobility is 11,000 cm$^2$/Vs at 2$\times 10^{12}$ /cm$^2$. Large Rashba spin-orbit coefficients up to 124 meV$\cdot$\r{A} are obtained through weak anti-localization (WAL) measurements. Proximitized superconductivity is demonstrated in Nb-based superconductor-normal-superconductor (SNS) junctions, yielding 78$-$99% interface transparencies from superconducting contacts fabricated ex-situ (post-growth), using two commonly-used experimental techniques for measuring transparencies. These transparencies are on a par with those reported for epitaxially-grown superconductors. These SNS junctions show characteristic voltages $I_c R_{\text{N}}$ up to 870 $\mu$V and critical current densities up to 9.6 $\mu$A/$\mu$m, among the largest values reported for Nb-InAs SNS devices.</description>

      <title>Embedded Majorana Islands</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mesoscopic superconducting islands hosting Majorana zero modes (MZMs), or Majorana islands in short, offer a prototype of topological qubits. In this work we investigate theoretically the model of a generic Majorana island tunneling-coupled to a single-piece metallic substrate, hence an \textit{embedded Majorana island}. We show the crucial consequences of an interplay between the topological ground states nonlocally addressed by the MZMs and the metallic bath with coherent electron propagation: on the one hand, the topological degeneracy on the Majorana island can be preserved, by virtue of the particle-hole symmetry, despite the apparent bath-induced coupling between MZMs; on the other hand, the electronic interference in the metallic bath may lead to profound alterations to the renormalization group behavior of the hybrid system towards low energy/temperature compared with conventional Kondo physics. This work serves to establish the model of embedded Majorana islands as an experimentally relevant and theoretically intriguing problem particularly in the direction of topological quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Differential conductance and noise spectrum in a quantum dot coupled to a superconducting nanowire</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum transport through a quantum dot coupled with a superconducting (SC) nanowire. The distinguishing characteristics between the Majorana bound states (MBSs) and Andreev bound states (ABSs) hosted in SC wire are demonstrated in the differential conductance and finite-frequency current noise spectrum. The former shows the well-known zero-bias peak (ZBP), while the latter displays the degenerate Rabi dip (DRD) for MBSs with topological quality factor q = 1. However, for ABSs with q &lt; 1, the ZBP and DRD split. We confirm that the ABSs with high quality factors greater than critical values can mimic the signatures of topological MBSs. Especially, the corresponding critical quality factors for the occurrence of ZBP and DRD are explicitly obtained and their underlying mechanisms are addressed.</description>

      <title>Recursive Green's functions optimized for atomistic modelling of large superlattice-based devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Green's function method is recognized to be a very powerful tool for modelling quantum transport in nanoscale electronic devices. As atomistic calculations are generally expensive, numerical methods and related algorithms have been developed accordingly to optimize their computation cost. In particular, recursive techniques have been efficiently applied within the Green's function calculation approach. Recently, with the discovery of Moir\'e materials, several attractive superlattices have been explored using these recursive Green's function techniques. However, numerical difficulty issues were reported as most of these superlattices have relatively large supercells, and consequently a huge number of atoms to be considered. In this article, improvements to solve these issues are proposed in order to keep optimizing the recursive Green's function calculations. These improvements make the electronic structure calculations feasible and efficient in modelling large superlattice-based devices. As an illustrative example, twisted bilayer graphene superlattices are computed and presented to demonstrate the efficiency of the method.</description>

      <title>Theory of Generalized Landau Levels and Implication for non-Abelian States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum geometry is a fundamental concept to characterize the local properties of quantum states. It is recently demonstrated that saturating certain quantum geometric bounds allows a topological Chern band to share many essential features with the lowest Landau level, facilitating fractionalized phases in moir\'e flat bands. In this work, we systematically extend the consequence and universality of saturated geometric bounds to arbitrary Landau levels by introducing a set of single-particle states, which we term as ``generalized Landau levels''. These generalized Landau levels exhibit exactly quantized values of integrated trace of quantum metric determined by their corresponding Landau level indices, regardless of the nonuniformity of their quantum geometric quantities. We derive all geometric quantities for individual and multiple generalized Landau levels, discuss their relations, and understand them in light of the theory of holomorphic curves and moving frames. We further propose a model by superposing few generalized Landau levels which is supposed to capture a large portion of the single-particle Hilbert space of a generic Chern band analogous to the first Landau level. Using this model, we employ exact diagonalization to identify a single-particle geometric criterion for permitting the non-Abelian Moore-Read phase, which is potentially useful for future engineering of moir\'e materials and beyond. We use a double twisted bilayer graphene model with only adjacent layer hopping term to show the existence of first generalized Landau level type narrow band and zero-field Moore-Read state at the second magic angle which serves as a promising starting point for more detailed future studies. We expect that generalized Landau levels will serve as a systematic tool for analyzing topological Chern bands and fractionalized phases therein.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Casimir-Lifshitz force (CLF) between a gold plate and a graphene-covered dielectric grating. Using a scattering matrix (S-matrix) approach derived from the Fourier Modal Method (FMM), we find a significant enhancement in the CLF as compared to a mere dielectric slab coated with graphene, over a wide range of temperatures. Additionally, we demonstrate that the CLF depends strongly on the chemical potential of graphene, with maximal effects observed at lower filling fractions. Finally, we analyse the Casimir force gradient between a gold sphere and a graphene-coated dielectric grating, highlighting potential avenues for experimental measurements.</description>

      <title>Low-frequency signature of magnetization nutation in nanomagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we show that surface anisotropy in nanomagnets induces a nutational motion of their magnetization at various frequencies, the lowest of which can be described by the macrospin model whose dynamics is governed by an effective energy potential. We derive analytical expressions for the precession and nutation frequencies and amplitudes as functions of the size of the nanomagnet and its atomistic parameters, such as the exchange coupling and the onsite anisotropy. Our analytical model predicts a reduction of the precession frequency with increased surface anisotropy. We also simulate the dynamics of the corresponding atomistic many-spin system and compare the results with the effective model. We thereby show that the first nutation mode induced by the finite size and surface anisotropy occurs at a frequency that is four times larger than the precession frequency, thus lending itself to a relatively easy detection by standard experiments of magnetic resonance.</description>

      <title>Suppression of the skyrmion Hall effect in synthetic ferrimagnets with gradient magnetization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions are promising building blocks for future spintronic devices. However, the skyrmion Hall effect (SkHE) remains an obstacle for practical applications based on the in-line transport of skyrmions. Here, we numerically study the static properties and current-driven dynamics of synthetic ferrimagnetic skyrmions. Inspired by graded-index magnonics, we introduce a linear gradient of saturation magnetization (Ms) in the skyrmion-hosting sample, which effectively modulates the skyrmion Hall angle and suppresses the SkHE. Micromagnetic simulations reveal that ferrimagnetic skyrmions could exhibit greater susceptibility to the variation of Ms as compared to their ferromagnetic counterparts. The Thiele analysis is also applied to support the simulation results, which elucidates that the Ms gradient dynamically modifies the intrinsic normalized size of skyrmions, consequently impacting the SkHE. Our results pave the way to the graded-index skyrmionics, which offers novel insights for designing ferrimagnet-based skyrmionic devices.</description>

Abstract: Recently, topolectrical circuits (TECs) boom in studying the topological states of matter. The resemblance between circuit Laplacians and tight-binding models in condensed matter physics allows for the exploration of exotic topological phases on the circuit platform. In this review, we begin by presenting the basic equations for the circuit elements and units, along with the fundamentals and experimental methods for TECs. Subsequently, we retrospect the main literature in this field, encompassing the circuit realization of (higher-order) topological insulators and semimetals. Due to the abundant electrical elements and flexible connections, many unconventional topological states like the non-Hermitian, nonlinear, non-Abelian, non-periodic, non-Euclidean, and higher-dimensional topological states that are challenging to observe in conventional condensed matter physics, have been observed in circuits and summarized in this review. Furthermore, we show the capability of electrical circuits for exploring the physical phenomena in other systems, such as photonic and magnetic ones. Importantly, we highlight TEC systems are convenient for manufacture and miniaturization because of their compatibility with the traditional integrated circuits. Finally, we prospect the future directions in this exciting field, and connect the emerging TECs with the development of topology physics, (meta)material designs, and device applications.</description>

      <title>Engineering ultra-strong electron-phonon coupling and nonclassical electron transport in crystalline gold with nanoscale interfaces</title>

Abstract: Electrical resistivity in good metals, particularly noble metals such as gold (Au), silver (Ag), or copper, increases linearly with temperature ($T$) for $T &gt; \Theta_{\mathrm{D}}$, where $\Theta_{\mathrm{D}}$ is the Debye temperature. This is because the coupling ($\lambda$) between the electrons and the lattice vibrations, or phonons, in these metals is rather weak with $\lambda \sim 0.1-0.2$, and a perturbative analysis suffices to explain the $T$-linear electron-phonon scattering rate. In this work, we outline a new nanostructuring strategy of crystalline Au where this foundational concept of metallic transport breaks down. We show that by embedding a distributed network of ultra-small Ag nanoparticles (AgNPs) of radius $\sim1-2$ nm inside a crystalline Au shell, an unprecedented enhancement in the electron-phonon interaction, with $\lambda$ as high as $\approx 20$, can be achieved. This is over hundred times that of bare Au or Ag, and ten times larger than any known metal. With increasing AgNP density, the electrical resistivity deviates from $T$-linearity, and approaches a saturation to the Mott-Ioffe-Regel scale $\rho_{\mathrm{MIR}}\sim h a /e^2$ for both disorder ($T\to 0$) and phonon ($T \gg \Theta_{\mathrm{D}}$)-dependent components of resistivity (here, $a=0.3$~nm, is the lattice constant of Au). This giant electron-phonon interaction, which we suggest arises from the coulomb interaction-induced coupling of conduction electrons to the localized phonon modes at the buried Au-Ag hetero-interfaces, allows experimental access to a regime of nonclassical metallic transport that has never been probed before.</description>

      <title>Controlling dephasing of coupled qubits via shared-bath coherence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction of a quantum system with its environment limits qubit coherence times and restricts its utility in quantum information processing applications. In this Letter, we show that the decoherence of a coupled qubit system can be minimized, or even eliminated by exploiting the quantum coherence of the bath itself. We investigate the dephasing in a system of two spatially separated, electronically decoupled qubits, with direct or mediated coupling, interacting with a shared bath. For illustration we treat F\"orster or cavity-mediated coupling between semiconductor quantum dots interacting with acoustic phonons. Using the rigorous method of Trotter's decomposition with cumulant expansion, we demonstrate a reduction in the dephasing rates at specific distances. This control is a coherent effect of the shared bath and is absent for independent baths. It can be understood in terms of phonon-assisted transitions between the entangled qubit states of the coupled system.</description>

      <title>Gate and flux tunable $\sin(2\varphi)$ Josephson element in proximitized junctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid superconductor-semiconductor Josephson field-effect transistors (JoFETs) function as Josephson junctions with a gate-tunable critical current. Additionally, they can feature a non-sinusoidal current-phase relation (CPR) containing multiple harmonics of the superconducting phase difference, a so-far underutilized property. In this work, we exploit this multi-harmonicity to create a Josephson circuit element with an almost perfectly $\pi$-periodic CPR, indicative of a largely dominant charge-4e supercurrent transport. Such a Josephson element was recently proposed as the basic building block of a protected superconducting qubit. Here, it is realized using a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) with low-inductance aluminum arms and two nominally identical JoFETs. The latter are fabricated from a SiGe/Ge/SiGe quantum-well heterostructure embedding a high-mobility two-dimensional hole gas. By carefully adjusting the JoFET gate voltages and finely tuning the magnetic flux through the SQUID close to half a flux quantum, we achieve a regime where the $\sin(2\varphi)$ component accounts for more than \SI{95}{\percent} of the total supercurrent. This result demonstrates a new promising route for the realization of superconducting qubits with enhanced coherence properties.</description>

      <title>Unconventional superconductivity in twisted bilayer WSe2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Moir\'e materials have enabled the realization of flat electron bands and quantum phases that are driven by strong correlations associated with flat bands. Superconductivity has been observed, but solely, in graphene moir\'e materials. The absence of robust superconductivity in moir\'e materials beyond graphene, such as semiconductor moir\'e materials, has remained a mystery and challenged our current understanding of superconductivity in flat bands. Here, we report the observation of robust superconductivity in 3.65-degree twisted bilayer WSe2 which hosts a honeycomb moir\'e lattice. Superconductivity emerges at half-band filling and under small sublattice potential differences, where the moir\'e band is a flat Chern band. The optimal superconducting transition temperature is about 220 mK and constitutes 2% of the effective Fermi temperature; the latter is comparable to the value in high-temperature cuprate superconductors and suggests strong pairing. The superconductor borders on two distinct metals below and above half-band filling; it undergoes a continuous transition to a correlated insulator by tuning the sublattice potential difference. The observed superconductivity on the verge of Coulomb-induced charge localization suggests roots in strong electron correlations.</description>

      <title>Pseudospin density wave intability in 2D electron bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the instability of layer pseudospin paramagnetic (PSP) state to the formation of pseudospin density wave (PSDW) in two-dimensional (2D) electron bilayers, analogous to the formation of Overhauser spin density wave (SDW) in a single-layer 2D electron gas (2DEG) with spin 1/2. Our comprehensive study on phase diagrams, based on the self-consistent Hartree-Fock (HF) theory, reveals that the PSDW has a lower energy than both PSP and pseudospin ferromagnetic (PSF) states near the PSP-PSF phase transition boundary. When the two layers are populated by the same number of electrons, the PSDW momentum $Q_c \sim 2k_F$ near the PSP-PSDW boundary, where $k_F= (2\pi n)^{1/2}$ is the Fermi momentum characterized by the density in one of the two layers, and $Q_c$ decreases as the system transitions to the PSF regime. Extending the HF study to the case of unequal layer densities, the PSP phase is unstable to PSDW for small density imbalances, with momentum $Q_c \sim k_{F,t} + k_{F,b}$, where $k_{F,t}$ and $k_{F,b}$ are Fermi momenta of top and bottom layers, respectively. In PSDW regime, the ground state stability, defined by the energy difference between PSDW and the second lowest-energy state, is one order of magnitude lower than that in PSF regime, and decreases with increasing layer separation $d$. Furthermore, incorporating RPA static screening with the Hubbard-type local field correction leads to disappearance of both SDW and PSDW phases, and pushes the phase boundaries of paramagnetic to ferromagnetic transitions to larger $r_s$ values. Our study on PSDW in 2D electron bilayers is equally applicable to 2D hole bilayers. The idea of pursuing PSDW is, in general, relevant across various 2D bilayer systems, not limited to the parabolic model that we investigate in this paper, and provides a new possibility of exploring novel coherent phases.</description>

      <title>Unraveling electronic structure of GeS through ARPES and its correlation with anisotropic optical and transport behavior</title>

Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) materials with lower symmetry (triclinic, monoclinic or orthorhombic) exhibit intrinsic anisotropic in-plane structure desirable for future optoelectronic surface operating devices. Herein, we report one such material, 2D $p$-type semiconductor germanium sulfide (GeS), a group IV monochalcogenide with puckered orthorhombic morphology, in which in-plane optical and transport properties can be correlated with its electronic structure. We systematically investigate the electronic band structure of the bulk GeS with micro-focused angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy ($\mu$-ARPES) and correspond the charge transport properties using the field-effect transistor (FET) device architecture, and optical anisotropy $via$ angle-resolved polarization dependent Raman spectroscopy (ARPRS) on a micron-sized rectangle-shaped exfoliated bulk flake. The experimental valence band dispersion along the two high symmetry directions indicate highly anisotropic in-plane behavior of the charge carrier that agrees well with the density functional theory (DFT) calculations. In addition, we demonstrate the variation of the in-plane hole mobility (ratio $\sim$ 3.4) from the electrical conductivity with gate-sweep in a GeS-on-SiO$_2$ FET. Moreover, we use the angle-resolved fluctuation of the Raman intensity of the characteristic phonon modes to precisely determine the armchair and zigzag edges of the particular flake. The unique structural motif of GeS with correlated electronic and optical properties are of great interest both for the physical understanding of the all-optical switch and their applications in memory devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We continue our investigation of the response tensors in planar Hall (or planar thermal Hall) configurations where a three-dimensional Weyl/multi-Weyl semimetal is subjected to the combined influence of an electric field $\mathbf E $ (or temperature gradient $\nabla_{\mathbf r } T$) and an effective magnetic field $\mathbf B_\chi $, generalizing the considerations of Phys. Rev. B 108 (2023) 155132 and Physica E 159 (2024) 115914. The electromagnetic fields are oriented at a generic angle with respect to each other, thus leading to the possibility of having a collinear component, which does not arise in a Hall set-up. The net effective magnetic field $\mathbf B_\chi $ consists of two parts - (a) an actual/physical magnetic field $\mathbf B $ applied externally; and (b) an emergent magnetic field $\mathbf B_5 $ which quantifies the elastic deformations of the sample. $\mathbf B_5 $ is an axial pseudomagnetic field because it couples to conjugate nodal points with opposite chiralities with opposite signs. Using a semiclassical Boltzmann formalism, we derive the generic expressions for the response tensors, including the effects of the Berry curvature (BC) and the orbital magnetic moment (OMM), which arise due to a nontrivial topology of the bandstructures. We elucidate the interplay of the BC-only and the OMM-dependent parts in the longitudinal and transverse (or Hall) components of the electric, thermal, and thermoelectric response tensors. Especially, for the planar transverse components of the response tensors, the OMM part acts exclusively in opposition (sync) with the BC-only part for the Weyl (multi-Weyl) semimetals.</description>

      <title>Quadrupolar resonance spectroscopy of individual nuclei using a room-temperature quantum sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nuclear quadrupolar resonance (NQR) spectroscopy reveals chemical bonding patterns in materials and molecules through the unique coupling between nuclear spins and local fields. However, traditional NQR techniques require macroscopic ensembles of nuclei to yield a detectable signal, which precludes the study of individual molecules and obscures molecule-to-molecule variations due to local perturbations or deformations. Optically active electronic spin qubits, such as the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond, facilitate the detection and control of individual nuclei through their local magnetic couplings. Here, we use NV centers to perform NQR spectroscopy on their associated nitrogen-14 ($^{14}$N) nuclei at room temperature. In mapping the nuclear quadrupolar Hamiltonian, we resolve minute variations between individual nuclei. The measurements further reveal correlations between the parameters in the NV center's electronic spin Hamiltonian and the $^{14}$N quadropolar Hamiltonian, as well as a previously unreported Hamiltonian term that results from symmetry breaking. We further design pulse sequences to initialize, readout, and control the quantum evolution of the $^{14}$N nuclear state using the nuclear quadrupolar Hamiltonian.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultrathin topological insulator membranes are building blocks of exotic quantum matter. However, traditional epitaxy of these materials does not facilitate stacking in arbitrary orders, while mechanical exfoliation from bulk crystals is also challenging due to the non-negligible interlayer coupling therein. Here we liberate millimeter-scale films of topological insulator Bi$_2$Se$_3$, grown by molecular beam epitaxy, down to 3 quintuple layers. We characterize the preservation of the topological surface states and quantum well states in transferred Bi$_{2}$Se$_{3}$ films using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. Leveraging the photon-energy-dependent surface sensitivity, the photoemission spectra taken with $6$ eV and $21.2$ eV photons reveal a transfer-induced migration of the topological surface states from the top to the inner layers. By establishing clear electronic structures of the transferred films and unveiling the wavefunction relocation of the topological surface states, our work paves the physics foundation crucial for the future fabrication of artificially stacked topological materials with single-layer precision.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Light propagation in random media is notorious for its resilience to (Anderson) wave localization. We here argue that in materials with slow helicity relaxation previously unnoticed principles of topology reinforce delocalization. We show that the effective electromagnetic action is governed by principles, identical to those protecting delocalization at topological insulator surface states. The length scales over which these exert a protective influence depend on the conservation of helicity, leading to the prediction that light scattering in media with, e.g., strong magnetic and electric dipolar resonances evades localization over large scales.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the magnetic order in single crystalline EuCd$_2$Sb$_2$ thin films using a combined theoretical and experimental approach. Resonant elastic x-ray scattering experiments reveal a sharp magnetic peak at $q = (0, 0, \frac{1}{2})$ below $T_N = 7.2$ K, indicative of interlayer antiferromagnetic ordering. Additionally, we observe a weak diffuse magnetic signal centered at $q = (0, 0, 1)$ that persists above $T_N$, up to $T_C \sim 11$ K. Our Monte-Carlo simulations of a classical spin model approximation of the Eu magnetic sublattice demonstrate that the diffuse signal can arise from ferromagnetic coupling in the top few layers due to surface oxidation. On the other hand, the bulk of the sample exhibits antiferromagnetic coupling between layers. Finally, our fit of the model parameters to the magnetic ordering temperatures, shed light on the exchange couplings that are key in stabilizing the observed composite magnetic order.</description>

Abstract: We explore the statistical behavior of the light emanating from a coherently driven Jaynes-Cummings (JC) oscillator operating in the regime of multiphoton blockade with two monitored output channels causing the loss of coherence at equal rates. We do so by adopting an operational approach which draws the particle and wave aspects of the forwards scattered radiation together, building upon the relationship between quantum optical correlation functions and conditional measurements. We first derive an analytical expression of the intensity cross-correlation function at the peak of the two-photon JC resonance to demonstrate the breakdown of detailed balance. The application of quantum trajectory theory in parallel with the quantum regression formula subsequently uncovers various aspects of temporal asymmetry in the quantum fluctuations characterizing the cascaded process through which a multiphoton resonance is established and read out. We find that monitoring different quadratures of the cavity field in conditional homodyne detection affects the times waited between successive photon counter ``clicks'', which in turn trigger the sampling of the homodyne current. Despite the fact that the steady-state cavity occupation is of the order of a photon, monitoring of the developing bimodality also impacts on the ratio between the emissions directed along the two decoherence channels.</description>

      <title>Drastic modification in thermal conductivity of TiCoSb Half-Heusler alloy: Phonon engineering by lattice softening and ionic polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A drastic variation in thermal conductivity (\k{appa}) for synthesized samples (TiCoSb1+x, x=0.0, 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04, and 0.06) is observed and ~47% reduction in \k{appa} is reported for TiCoSb1.02 sample. In depth structural analysis is performed, employing mixed-phase Rietveld refinement technique. Embedded phases and vacancy are analyzed from X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Scanning electron microscopy data. Local structures of the synthesized samples are explored for the first time by X-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements for TiCoSb system and corroborated with Rietveld refinement data. Lattice dynamics are revealed using Raman Spectroscopy (RS) measurements in unprecedented attempts for TiCoSb system. XRD and RS data accomplishes that variation in \k{appa} as a function of Sb concentration is observed owing to an alteration in phonon group velocity related to lattice softening. Polar nature of TiCoSb HH sample is revealed. LO-TO splitting (related to polar optical phonon scattering) in phonon vibration is observed due to polar nature of TiCoSb synthesized samples. Tailoring in LO-TO splitting due to screening effect, correlated with Co vacancies is reported for TiCoSb1+x synthesized samples. Lattice softening and LO-TO splitting lead to decreases in \k{appa}~47% for TiCoSb1.02 synthesized sample.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Complexity: Nonlinear Optical Phenomena in L-Shapes, Nanocrescents, and Split-Ring Resonators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We conduct systematic studies of the optical characteristics of plasmonic nanoparticles that exhibit C2v symmetry. We analyze three distinct geometric configurations: an L-type shape, a crescent, and a split-ring resonator. Optical properties are examined using the FDTD method. It is demonstrated that all three shapes exhibit two prominent plasmon bands associated with the two axes of symmetry. This is in addition to a wide range of resonances observed at high frequencies corresponding to quadrupole modes and peaks due to sharp corners. Next, to facilitate nonlinear analysis, we employ a semiclassical hydrodynamic model where the electron pressure term is explicitly accounted for. Employing this model enables us to rigorously examine the second-order angular resolved nonlinear optical response of these nanoparticles in each of the three configurations. For CW pumping, we explore properties of the SHG. Polarization and angle-resolved SHG spectra are obtained, revealing strong dependence on the nanoparticle geometry and incident wave polarization. For pulsed excitations, we discuss the phenomenon of broadband THz generation induced by the DFG. It is shown that the THz emission spectra exhibit unique features attributed to the plasmonic resonances and symmetry of the nanoparticles. The polarization of the generated THz waves is also examined, revealing interesting patterns tied to the nanoparticle geometry. To gain deeper insight, we propose a simple analytical theory that agrees very well with the numerical experiments. An expression for the far-field THz intensity is derived in terms of the incident pulse parameters and the nonlinear response tensor of the nanoparticle. The results presented in this work offer new insights into the linear and nonlinear optical properties of nanoparticles with C2v symmetry.</description>

      <title>Pentacene-Doped Naphthalene for Levitated Optomechanics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce pentacene-doped naphthalene as a material for diamagnetic levitation, offering compelling applications in matter-wave interferometry and nuclear magnetic resonance. Pentacene-doped naphthalene offers remarkable polarizability of its nuclear spin ensemble, achieving polarization rates exceeding 80 % at cryogenic temperatures with polarization lifetimes extending weeks. We design a multi-spin Stern-Gerlach-type interferometry protocol which, thanks to the homogeneous spin distribution and the absence of a preferential nuclear-spin quantization axis, avoids many of the limitations associated with materials hosting electronic spin defects, such as nanodiamonds containing NV centers. We assess the potential of our interferometer to enhance existing bounds on the free parameters of objective collapse models. Beyond matter-wave interferometry, we analyze the prospects for implementing magic angle spinning at frequencies surpassing the current standard in NMR, capitalizing on the exceptional rotational capabilities offered by levitation. Additionally, we outline a novel protocol for measuring spin ensemble polarization via the position of the nanoparticle and conduct an analysis of dominant noise sources, benchmarking the required isolation levels for various applications.</description>

      <title>Bias-field digitized counterdiabatic quantum optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a method for solving combinatorial optimization problems on digital quantum computers, where we incorporate auxiliary counterdiabatic (CD) terms into the adiabatic Hamiltonian, while integrating bias terms derived from an iterative digitized counterdiabatic quantum algorithm. We call this protocol bias-field digitized counterdiabatic quantum optimization (BF-DCQO). Designed to effectively tackle large-scale combinatorial optimization problems, BF-DCQO demonstrates resilience against the limitations posed by the restricted coherence times of current quantum processors and shows clear enhancement even in the presence of noise. Additionally, our purely quantum approach eliminates the dependency on classical optimization required in hybrid classical-quantum schemes, thereby circumventing the trainability issues often associated with variational quantum algorithms. Through the analysis of an all-to-all connected general Ising spin-glass problem, we exhibit a polynomial scaling enhancement in ground state success probability compared to traditional DCQO and finite-time adiabatic quantum optimization methods. Furthermore, it achieves scaling improvements in ground state success probabilities, increasing by up to two orders of magnitude, and offers an average 1.3x better approximation ratio than the quantum approximate optimization algorithm for the problem sizes studied. We validate these findings through experimental implementations on both trapped-ion quantum computers and superconducting processors, tackling a maximum weighted independent set problem with 36 qubits and a spin-glass on a heavy-hex lattice with 100 qubits, respectively. These results mark a significant advancement in gate-based quantum computing, employing a fully quantum algorithmic approach.</description>

      <title>Giant Acoustic Geometric Spin and Orbital Hall Effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Acoustic waves in fluid with spin-0 nature have been long believed not to support spin Hall effect and strong orbital Hall effect that enables experimental observation. Here we report the first theoretical explication and experimental demonstration of giant acoustic geometric spin and orbital Hall effect characterized by a large transverse shift. We reveal that this effect occurs when a vortex beam is observed from a tilted reference frame free of wave-interface interactions or gradient-index media needed for observing conventional ones, and can be amplified by simply binding the beam tightly. Thanks to this mechanism, large transverse shifts proportional to angular momentum are observed in a compact system. Our work provides deeper insights into the physics of angular momentum of classic waves.</description>

      <title>Magnetic microstructure of nanocrystalline Fe-Nb-B alloys as seen by small-angle neutron and X-ray scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have investigated the magnetic microstructure of two-phase Fe-Nb-B~based Nanoperm alloys using unpolarized small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). Our SANS analysis reveals a significantly large magnetic scattering contribution due to spin misalignment, primarily originating from the substantial jump in the longitudinal magnetization at the interfaces between the particles and the matrix. The magnetic scattering exhibits an angular anisotropy that resembles a clover-leaf-type pattern, consistent with the predictions of micromagnetic SANS theory. Analysis of the one-dimensional SANS data yields values for the exchange-stiffness constant and the average anisotropy and magnetostatic fields. The micromagnetic correlation lengths for all three samples exhibit a similar field variation with sizes ranging between about 10-35 nm. We also find that the nuclear and magnetic residual scattering component of the SANS cross section exhibits a similar $q$ dependency as the SAXS data. These findings further validate the applicability of the micromagnetic SANS theory, and the mesoscopic information obtained is important for the advancement of the soft magnetic properties of this class of material.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Slow magnetization relaxation processes are an important time-dependent property of many magnetic materials. We show that magnetotransport measurements based on a well-established current-reversal method can be utilized to implement a simple and robust screening scheme for such relaxation processes. We demonstrate our approach considering the anomalous Hall effect in a Pt/Co/AlOx trilayer model system, and then explore relaxation in {\tau} -MnAl films. Compared to magnetotransport experiments based on ac lock-in techniques, we find that the dc current-reversal method is particulary sensitive to relaxation processes with relaxation time scales on the order of seconds, comparable to the current-reversal measurement time scales.</description>

Abstract: Recently the field of cavity magnonics, a field focused on controlling the interaction between magnons and confined microwave photons within microwave resonators, has drawn significant attention as it offers a platform for enabling advancements in quantum- and spin-based technologies. Here, we introduce excitation vector fields, whose polarisation and profile can be easily tuned in a two-port cavity setup, thus acting as an effective experimental knob to explore the coupled dynamics of cavity magnon-polaritons. Moreover, we develop theoretical models that accurately predict and reproduce the experimental results for any polarisation state and field profile within the cavity resonator. This versatile experimental platform offers a new avenue for controlling spin-photon interactions and as such also delivering a mechanism to readily control the exchange of information between hybrid systems.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Machine Learning for Advanced Nanoscale X-ray Analysis: Unmixing Multicomponent Signals and Enhancing Chemical Quantification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy in the transmission electron microscope is a key tool for nanomaterials analysis, providing a direct link between spatial and chemical information. However, using it for precisely determining chemical compositions presents challenges of noisy data from low X-ray yields and mixed signals from phases that overlap along the electron beam trajectory. Here, we introduce a novel method, non-negative matrix factorisation based pan-sharpening (PSNMF), to address these limitations. Leveraging the Poisson nature of EDX spectral noise and binning operations, PSNMF retrieves high quality phase spectral and spatial signatures via consecutive factorisations. After validating PSNMF with synthetic datasets of different noise levels, we illustrate its effectiveness on two distinct experimental cases: a nano-mineralogical lamella, and supported catalytic nanoparticles. Not only does PSNMF obtain accurate phase signatures, datasets reconstructed from the outputs have demonstrably lower noise and better fidelity than from the benchmark denoising method of principle component analysis.</description>

      <title>The Non-collinear Path to Topological Superconductivity</title>

Abstract: Combining spin textures in ultra-thin films with conventional superconductors has emerged as a powerful and versatile platform for designing topologically non-trivial superconducting phases as well as spin-triplet Cooper pairs. As a consequence, two-dimensional magnet-superconductor hybrids (2D MSHs) are promising candidate systems to realize devices for topology-based quantum technologies and superconducting spintronics. So far, studies have focused mostly on systems hosting collinear ferromagnets or antiferromagnets. However, topologically non-trivial phases have been predicted to emerge in MSH systems with non-collinear spin textures as well. In this article, we present the experimental discovery of topological superconductivity in the MSH system Fe/Ta(110) where a magnetic spiral is realized in the Fe monolayer on the surface of the s-wave superconductor Ta. By combining low-temperature spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy measurements with theoretical modeling, we are able to conclude that the system is in a topological nodal-point superconducting phase with low-energy edge modes. Due to the non-collinear spin texture in our MSH system, these edge modes exhibit a magnetization direction-dependent dispersion. Furthermore, we identify direct signatures of Rashba spin-orbit coupling in the experimentally measured differential tunneling conductance. The present work realizes a non-collinear spin texture-based path to topological superconductivity.</description>

The 3D phase diagram showing the evolution of competing phases with $B$, interaction strength and an out-of-plane electric field is presented at electron fillings that follow the Diophantine equation along Chern number $-\text{sign}\left(B\right)$ line, that is pointing away from the charge neutral filling, where we find prominent Chern insulators consistent with the experiments. We also explain the experimental absence of prominent Chern insulators along the Chern number $+\text{sign}\left(B\right)$ line.</description>

Abstract: We propose analog counterdiabatic quantum computing (ACQC) to tackle combinatorial optimization problems on neutral-atom quantum processors. While these devices allow for the use of hundreds of qubits, adiabatic quantum computing struggles with non-adiabatic errors, which are inevitable due to the hardware's restricted coherence time. We design counterdiabatic protocols to circumvent those limitations via ACQC on analog quantum devices with ground-Rydberg qubits. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our paradigm, we experimentally apply it to the maximum independent set (MIS) problem with up to 100 qubits and show an enhancement in the approximation ratio with a short evolution time. We believe ACQC establishes a path toward quantum advantage for a variety of industry use cases.</description>

Abstract: In spiking neural networks, neuron dynamics are described by the biologically realistic integrate-and-fire model that captures membrane potential accumulation and above-threshold firing behaviors. Among the hardware implementations of integrate-and-fire neuron devices, one important feature, reset, has been largely ignored. Here, we present the design and fabrication of a magnetic domain wall and magnetic tunnel junction based artificial integrate-and-fire neuron device that achieves reliable reset at the end of the integrate-fire cycle. We demonstrate the domain propagation in the domain wall racetrack (integration), reading using a magnetic tunnel junction (fire), and reset as the domain is ejected from the racetrack, showing the artificial neuron can be operated continuously over 100 integrate-fire-reset cycles. Both pulse amplitude and pulse number encoding is demonstrated. The device data is applied on an image classification task using a spiking neural network and shown to have comparable performance to an ideal leaky, integrate-and-fire neural network. These results achieve the first demonstration of reliable integrate-fire-reset in domain wall-magnetic tunnel junction-based neuron devices and shows the promise of spintronics for neuromorphic computing.</description>

Abstract: Three-dimensional magnetic metamaterials feature interesting phenomena that arise from a delicate interplay of material properties, local anisotropy, curvature, and connectivity. A particularly interesting magnetic lattice that combines these aspects is that of nanoscale gyroids, with a highly-interconnected chiral network with local three-connectivity reminiscent of three-dimensional artificial spin ices. Here, we use finite-element micromagnetic simulations to elucidate the anisotropic behaviour of nanoscale nickel gyroid networks at applied fields and at remanence. We simplify the description of the micromagnetic spin states with a macrospin model to explain the anistropic global response, to quantify the extent of ice-like correlations, and to discuss qualitative features of the anisotropic magnetoresistance in the three-dimensional network. Our results demonstrate the large variability of the magnetic order in extended gyroid networks, which might enable future spintronic functionalities, including neuromorphic computing and non-reciprocal transport.</description>

Abstract: We consider adiabatic quantum pumping through a resonant level model, a single-level quantum dot connected to two fermionic leads. Using the tools of adiabatic expansion, we develop a consistent thermodynamic description of this model accounting for the variation of the energy level of the dot and the tunnelling rates with the thermal baths. This enables us to study various examples of pumping cycles computing the relevant thermodynamic quantities, such as the entropy produced and the dissipated power. These quantities are compared with the transport properties of the system, i.e. the pumped charge and the charge noise. Among other results, we find that the entropy production rate vanishes in the charge quantization limit while the dissipated power is quantized in the same limit.</description>

      <title>Velocity-gauge real-time time-dependent density functional tight-binding for large-scale condensed matter systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.09782v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new velocity-gauge real-time, time-dependent density functional tight-binding (VG-rtTDDFTB) implementation in the open-source DFTB+ software package (https://dftbplus.org) for probing electronic excitations in large, condensed matter systems. Our VG-rtTDDFTB approach enables real-time electron dynamics simulations of large, periodic, condensed matter systems containing thousands of atoms with a favorable computational scaling as a function of system size. We provide computational details and benchmark calculations to demonstrate its accuracy and computational parallelizability on a variety of large material systems. As a representative example, we calculate laser-induced electron dynamics in a 512-atom amorphous silicon supercell to highlight the large periodic systems that can be examined with our implementation. Taken together, our VG-rtTDDFTB approach enables new electron dynamics simulations of complex systems that require large periodic supercells, such as crystal defects, complex surfaces, nanowires, and amorphous materials.</description>

      <title>Position operators and interband matrix elements of scalar and vector potentials in the 8-band Kane model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09349v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We diagonalize the 8-band Kane Hamiltonian with a proper inclusion of the interband matrix elements of the scalar and vector potentials. This leads, among other results, to a modification of the conventional expression for the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) strength in narrow-gap semiconductors with the zinc blende symmetry. We find that in GaAs, at low temperatures, the correct expression for the SOC strength is actually twice as large as usually considered. In InSb it is $1.76$ times larger. We also provide a proper treatment of the interband matrix elements of the position operator. We show that the velocity operator in a crystal should be defined as a time-derivative of a fictitious position operator rather than the physical one. We compute the expressions for both these position operators projected to the conduction band of the 8-band Kane model. We also derive an expression for the velocity operator and demonstrate that the SOC strength in it differs from the SOC strength in the Hamiltonian. The ratio between them is not equal to $1$, as it is often assumed for the Rashba model. It does not equal $2$ either. The correct result for this ratio is given by a rational function of the parameters of the model. This function takes values between $4(23+3\sqrt{2})/73\approx 1.49$ and $2$. Our findings modify a vast number of research results obtained using the Rashba model and provide a path for a consistent treatment of the latter in future applications.</description>

      <title>Opportunities for the direct manipulation of a phase-driven Andreev spin qubit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14865v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a Josephson junction, the transfer of Cooper pairs from one superconductor to the other one can be associated with the formation of Andreev bound states. In a Josephson junction made with a semiconducting nanowire, the spin degeneracy of these Andreev states can be broken thanks to the presence of spin-orbit coupling and a finite phase difference between the two superconducting electrodes. The lifting of the spin degeneracy opened the way to the realization of Andreev spin qubits that do not require the application of a large magnetic field. So far the operation of these qubits relied on a Raman process involving two microwave tones and a third Andreev state [M. Hays et al., Science 373, 430 (2021)]. Still, time-reversal preserving impurities in the nanowire allow for spin-flip scattering processes. Here, using the formalism of scattering matrices, we show that these processes generically couple Andreev states with opposite spins. In particular, the non-vanishing current matrix element between them allows for the direct manipulation of phase-driven Andreev spin qubits, thereby circumventing the use of the above-mentioned Raman process.</description>

Abstract: Electron doping is an excellent tuning knob to explore different phases of matter in two-dimensional (2D) materials. For example, tuning the Fermi level at a van Hove singularity in twisted bilayer graphene can enhance electron-electron interactions and induce a diverse range of correlated phases. Here, using a single-particle picture, we study the electronic reconstruction of the band edges of a 2D semiconductor, monolayer MoS2, on a hexagonal moire potential induced by another MoS2 monolayer. We find that such system transitions from a honeycomb to a hexagonal symmetry when the Fermi level is tuned from the conduction to the valence side. We also study the system under magnetic fields, and construct the Hofstadter's butterfly in the electron- and hole-doped side. Our findings are confirmed by simulating the conductance across a large-scale two-terminal device. We conclude that this duality is a general property that MoS2 and other transition-metal-dichalcogenides exhibit under non-symmetric superlattice potentials.</description>

      <title>Compromise-Free Scaling of Qubit Speed and Coherence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07313v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Across a broad range of qubits, a pervasive trade-off becomes obvious: increased coherence seems to be only possible at the cost of qubit speed. This is consistent with the notion that protecting a qubit from its noisy surroundings also limits the control over it. Indeed, from ions to atoms, to superconductors and spins, the leading qubits share a similar Q-factor - the product of speed and coherence time - even though the speed and coherence of various qubits can differ by up to 8 orders of magnitude. This is the qubit speed-coherence dilemma: qubits are either coherent but slow or fast but short-lived. Here, we demonstrate a qubit for which we can triple the speed while simultaneously quadrupling the Hahn-echo coherence time when tuning a local electric field. In this way, the qubit speed and coherence scale together without compromise on either quantity, boosting the Q-factor by over an order of magnitude. Our qubit is a hole spin in a Ge/Si core/shell nanowire providing strong 1D confinement, resulting in the direct Rashba spin-orbit interaction. Due to Heavy-hole light-hole mixing a maximum of the spin-orbit strength is reached at finite electrical field. At the local maximum, charge fluctuations are decoupled from the qubit and coherence is enhanced, yet the drive speed becomes maximal. Our proof-of-concept experiment shows that a properly engineered qubit can be made faster and simultaneously more coherent, removing an important roadblock. Further, it demonstrates that through all-electrical control a qubit can be sped up, without coupling more strongly to the electrical noise environment. As charge fluctuators are unavoidable in semiconductors and all-electrical control is highly scalable, our results improve the prospects for quantum computing in Si and Ge.</description>

      <title>Isolated nearly flat higher Chern band in monolayer transition metal trihalides</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07551v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interplay between non-trivial topology and strong electron interaction can generate a variety of exotic quantum matter. Here we theoretically propose that monolayer transition metal trihalides MoF$_3$ and W$X_3$ ($X$= Cl, Br, I) have isolated nearly flat band near the Fermi level with higher Chern number $\mathcal{C}=+3$ and $\mathcal{C}=-2$, respectively. The nontrivial topology of these flat Chern bands originates from the effective $sd^2$ hybridization of transition metal atom, which transform the apparent atomic $d$ orbitals on a hexagonal lattice into $(s, p_+, p_-)$ orbitals on a triangular lattice. Interestingly, the quantum geometry of flat Chern bands in these materials are comparable with those in moir\'e systems exhibiting fractional Chern insulator state. The Hofstadter butterfly of such flat Chern bands are further studied. These natural materials, if realized experimentally, could offer new platforms to explore correlated phenomena driven by flat Chern band with higher Chern number.</description>

Abstract: The magnetic properties of a circular graphene nanoribbon (carbon belt) in a magnetic field parallel to its central axis is studied using a tight-binding model. Orbital magnetic susceptibility is calculated using an analytical expression of the energy eigenvalues as a function of the magnetic flux density for any size, and its temperature dependence is considered. In the absence of electron hopping parallel to the magnetic field, the orbital magnetic susceptibility diverges at absolute zero if the chemical potential is zero and the number of atoms is a multiple of four. As the temperature increases, the magnitude of susceptibility decreases according to the power law, whose exponent depends on the size. In the presence of electron hopping parallel to the magnetic field, the divergence of the susceptibility near absolute zero disappears, and the sign changes with the transfer integral parallel to the magnetic field and the temperature.</description>

Abstract: There have been numerous studies on topological superconductivity in magnetic atomic chains deposited on s-wave superconductors. Most of these investigations have focused on spin-orbit interactions or helical spin orders. In this paper, we propose a model for achieving one-dimensional topological superconductivity in a magnetic atomic ring. This model utilizes a magnetic field and an antiferromagnetic/ferromagnetic order, under the condition that the magnetic field is perpendicular to the moments of the magnetic order. On a quasi-one-dimensional substrate surface, where the half-filled ring favors an antiferromagnetic configuration, we demonstrate that either the magnetic field itself or a Rashba spin-orbit coupling guarantees the perpendicularity. On a two-dimensional surface, where the ring favors ferromagnetic orders, the perpendicularity is achieved by introducing a minor Rashba spin-orbit coupling.</description>

      <title>Strategies for enhancing spin-shuttling fidelities in Si/SiGe quantum wells with random-alloy disorder</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01832v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coherent coupling between distant qubits is needed for any scalable quantum computing scheme. In quantum dot systems, one proposal for long-distance coupling is to coherently transfer electron spins across a chip in a moving potential. Here, we use simulations to study challenges for spin shuttling in Si/SiGe heterostructures caused by the valley degree of freedom. We show that for devices with valley splitting dominated by alloy disorder, one can expect to encounter pockets of low valley splitting, given a long-enough shuttling path. At such locations, inter-valley tunneling leads to dephasing of the spin wavefunction, substantially reducing the shuttling fidelity. We show how to mitigate this problem by modifying the heterostructure composition, or by varying the vertical electric field, the shuttling velocity, the shape and size of the dot, or the shuttling path. We further show that combinations of these strategies can reduce the shuttling infidelity by several orders of magnitude, putting shuttling fidelities sufficient for error correction within reach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08181v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ systems at fractional fillings of the lowest hole band under applied out-of-plane displacement fields. By employing exact diagonalization in finite-size systems, we systematically map out the ground state quantum phase diagram for two filling fractions, $\nu=1/3$ and $2/3$, and provide a detailed characterization of each phase. We identify the phase transition between a fractional Chern insulator (FCI) and a layer-polarized charge density wave (CDW) at a filling fraction of $\nu=1/3$, denoted as CDW-$1$. Additionally, we demonstrate that the competition between the displacement field and twist angle leads to another phase transition from a layer-polarized CDW-$1$ to a layer-hybridized CDW-$2$, identified as a first-order phase transition. Furthermore, at $\nu=2/3$ filling of the lowest hole band, we observe that the FCI remains stable against the displacement field until it approaches proximity to a transition in single-particle band topology at a smaller twist angle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09632v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topologically protected magnetic skyrmions in magnetic materials are stabilized by interfacial or bulk Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI). Interfacial DMI decays with increase of the magnetic layer thickness in just a few nanometers and bulk DMI only stabilizes magnetic skyrmions at low temperatures. Consequently, more flexibility in manipulation of DMI is required for utilizing nanoscale skyrmions in energy efficient memory and logic devices at room temperature (RT). Here, we demonstrate the observation of RT skyrmions stabilized by gradient DMI (g-DMI) in composition gradient engineered CoPt single layer films by employing topological Hall effect, magnetic force microscopy, and nitrogen vacancy scanning magnetometry. Skyrmions remain stable at a wide range of applied magnetic fields and are confirmed to be Bloch-type from micromagnetic simulation and analytical magnetization reconstruction. Furthermore, we observe skyrmion pairs which may be explained by skyrmion-antiskyrmion interactions. Our findings expand the family of magnetic materials hosting RT magnetic skyrmions by tuning g-DMI via gradient polarity and choice of magnetic elements.</description>

Abstract: Moir\'e systems featuring flat electronic bands exhibit a vast landscape of emergent exotic quantum states, making them one of the resourceful platforms in condensed matter physics in recent times. Tuning these systems via twist angle and the electric field greatly enhances our comprehension of their strongly correlated ground states. Here, we report a technique to investigate the nuanced intricacies of band structures in dual-gated multilayer graphene systems. We utilize the Landau levels of a decoupled monolayer graphene to extract the electric field-dependent bilayer graphene charge neutrality point gap. Then, we extend this method to analyze the evolution of the band gap and the flat bandwidth in twisted mono-bilayer graphene. The band gap maximizes at the same displacement field where the flat bandwidth minimizes, indicating the strongest electron-electron correlation, which is supported by directly observing the emergence of a strongly correlated phase. Moreover, we extract integer and fractional gaps to further demonstrate the strength of this method. Our technique gives a new perspective and paves the way for improving the understanding of electronic band structure in versatile flat band systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2204.00499v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The innate complexity of solid state physics exposes superconducting quantum circuits to interactions with uncontrolled degrees of freedom degrading their coherence. By using a simple stabilization sequence we show that a superconducting fluxonium qubit is coupled to a two-level system (TLS) environment of unknown origin, with a relatively long energy relaxation time exceeding $50\,\text{ms}$. Implementing a quantum Szilard engine with an active feedback control loop allows us to decide whether the qubit heats or cools its TLS environment. The TLSs can be cooled down resulting in a four times lower qubit population, or they can be heated to manifest themselves as a negative temperature environment corresponding to a qubit population of $\sim 80\,\%$. We show that the TLSs and the qubit are each other's dominant loss mechanism and that the qubit relaxation is independent of the TLS populations. Understanding and mitigating TLS environments is therefore not only crucial to improve qubit lifetimes but also to avoid non-Markovian qubit dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.15917v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the hydrodynamic flow of electrons through a smooth potential energy landscape in two dimensions, for which the electrical current is concentrated along thin channels that follow percolating equipotential contours. The width of these channels, and hence the electrical resistance, is determined by a competition between viscous and thermoelectric forces. For the case of periodic (moir\'{e}) potentials, we find that hydrodynamic flow provides a new route to linear-in-$T$ resistivity. We calculate the associated prefactors for potentials with $C_3$ and $C_4$ symmetry. On the other hand, for a random potential the resistivity has qualitatively different behavior because equipotential paths become increasingly tortuous as their width is reduced. This effect leads to a resistivity that grows with temperature as $T^{10/3}$.</description>

      <title>Cross-cap defects and fault-tolerant logical gates in the surface code and the honeycomb Floquet code</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.06917v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ toric code, surface code and Floquet code defined on a non-orientable surface, which can be considered as families of codes extending Shor's 9-qubit code. We investigate the fault-tolerant logical gates of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ toric code in this setup, which corresponds to $e\leftrightarrow m$ exchanging symmetry of the underlying $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory. We find that non-orientable geometry provides a new way the emergent symmetry acts on the code space, and discover the new realization of the fault-tolerant Hadamard gate of 2d $\mathbb{Z}_2$ toric code on a surface with a single cross-cap, dubbed a non-orientable toric code. This Hadamard gate can be realized by a constant-depth local unitary circuit modulo non-locality caused by a cross-cap. Via folding, the non-orientable surface code can be turned into a bilayer local quantum code, where the folded cross-cap is equivalent to a bi-layer twist terminated on a gapped boundary and the logical Hadamard only contains local gates with intra-layer couplings. We further obtain the complete logical Clifford gate set for a stack of non-orientable surface codes. We then construct the honeycomb Floquet code in the presence of a single cross-cap, and find that the period of the sequential Pauli measurements acts as a $HZ$ logical gate on the single logical qubit, where the cross-cap enriches the dynamics compared with the orientable case. We find that the dynamics of the honeycomb Floquet code is precisely described by a condensation operator of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory, and illustrate the exotic dynamics of our code in terms of a condensation operator supported at a non-orientable surface.</description>

      <title>Robust effective ground state in a nonintegrable Floquet quantum circuit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16217v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An external periodic (Floquet) drive is believed to bring any initial state to the featureless infinite temperature state in generic nonintegrable isolated quantum many-body systems in the thermodynamic limit, irrespective of the driving frequency $\Omega$. However, numerical or analytical evidence either proving or disproving this hypothesis is very limited and the issue has remained unsettled. Here, we study the initial state dependence of Floquet heating in a nonintegrable kicked Ising chain of length up to $L=30$ with an efficient quantum circuit simulator, showing a possible counterexample: The ground state of the effective Floquet Hamiltonian is exceptionally robust against heating, and could stay at finite energy density even after infinitely many Floquet cycles, if the driving period is shorter than a threshold value. This sharp energy localization transition/crossover does not happen for generic excited states. The exceptional robustness of the ground state is interpreted by (i) its isolation in the energy spectrum and (ii) the fact that those states with $L$-independent $\hbar\Omega$ energy above the ground state energy of any generic local Hamiltonian, like the approximate Floquet Hamiltonian, are atypical and viewed as a collection of noninteracting quasipartiles. Our finding paves the way for engineering Floquet protocols with finite driving periods realizing long-lived, or possibly even perpetual, Floquet phases by initial state design.</description>

      <title>Statistical Reproducibility of Selective Area Grown InAs Nanowire Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05084v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: New approaches such as selective area growth, where crystal growth is lithographically controlled, allow the integration of bottom-up grown semiconductor nanomaterials in large-scale classical and quantum nanoelectronics. This calls for assessment and optimization of the reproducibility between individual components. We quantify the structural and electronic statistical reproducibility within large arrays of nominally identical selective area growth InAs nanowires. The distribution of structural parameters is acquired through comprehensive atomic force microscopy studies and transmission electron microscopy. These are compared to the statistical distributions of the cryogenic electrical properties of 256 individual SAG nanowire field effect transistors addressed using cryogenic multiplexer circuits. Correlating measurements between successive thermal cycles allows distinguishing between the contributions of surface impurity scattering and fixed structural properties to device reproducibility. The results confirm the potential of SAG nanomaterials, and the methodologies for quantifying statistical metrics are essential for further optimization of reproducibility.</description>

      <title>Helical Luttinger liquid on a space-time lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10828v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Luttinger model is a paradigm for the breakdown due to interactions of the Fermi liquid description of one-dimensional massless Dirac fermions. Attempts to discretize the model on a one-dimensional lattice have failed to reproduce the established bosonization results, because of the fermion-doubling obstruction: A local and symmetry-preserving discretization of the Hamiltonian introduces a spurious second species of low-energy excitations, while a nonlocal discretization opens a single-particle gap at the Dirac point. Here we show how to work around this obstruction, by discretizing both space and time to obtain a \textit{local} Lagrangian for a helical Luttinger liquid with Hubbard interaction. The approach enables quantum Monte Carlo simulations that preserve the topological protection of an unpaired Dirac cone.</description>

      <title>Controlling measurement induced phase transitions with tunable detector coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07918v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the evolution of a quantum many-body system driven by two competing measurements, which induces a topological entanglement transition between two distinct area law phases. We employ a positive operator-valued measurement with variable coupling between the system and detector within free Fermion dynamics. This approach allows us to continuously track the universal properties of the transition between projective and continuous monitoring. Our findings suggest that the percolation universality of the transition in the projective limit is unstable when the system-detector coupling is reduced.</description>

      <title>Quantum optimal control robust to $1/f^\alpha$ noises using fractional calculus: voltage-controlled exchange in semiconductor spin qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12922v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-frequency $1/f^\alpha$ charge noise significantly hinders the performance of voltage-controlled spin qubits in quantum dots. Here, we utilize fractional calculus to design voltage control pulses yielding the highest average fidelities for noisy quantum gate operations. We focus specifically on the exponential voltage control of the exchange interaction generating two-spin $\mathrm{SWAP}^k$ gates. When stationary charge noise is the dominant source of gate infidelity, we derive that the optimal exchange pulse is long and weak, with the broad shape of the symmetric beta distribution function with parameter $1-\alpha/2$. The common practice of making exchange pulses fast and high-amplitude still remains beneficial in the case of strongly nonstationary noise dynamics, modeled as fractional Brownian motion. The proposed methods are applicable to the characterization and optimization of quantum gate operations in various voltage-controlled qubit architectures.</description>
