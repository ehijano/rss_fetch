      <title>Double Trouble: Two spectroscopically confirmed low-mass quiescent galaxies at z&gt;5 in overdensities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the discovery of two low-mass, high-redshift, quiescent galaxies, GS-z5-Q1 and COS-z5-Q1, using JWST NIRSpec spectroscopy alongside NIRCam and MIRI photometry. Observed at a redshift of z=5.39 and z=5.11 respectively, and with stellar masses of $\rm 10^{9.6}M_\odot$ and $\rm 10^{9.5}M_\odot$, GS-z5-Q1 and COS-z5-Q1 are two of the most distant quiescent galaxies spectroscopically confirmed to-date, and are by far the least massive ($\sim10\times$ lower mass). Full spectrophotometric modelling reveals that COS-z5-Q1 appears to have quenched more than 300Myr prior to observation ($z\sim 7$) and has a formation redshift of around z$\sim$11, whilst GS-z5-Q1 formed and quenched in a single burst around 150Myr prior to observation ($z\sim6$). GS-z5-Q1 is found to lie near the centre of a known high-z overdensity in GOODS-S, as would be expected by galaxy formation models, while COS-z5-Q1 lies towards the outskirts of an overdense region. This highlights the role that environment could play in accelerating galaxy evolutionary processes and could possibly be linked to the galaxies' quiescent nature. By modelling their stellar populations, we show that these types of low-mass quiescent galaxies could potentially be descendants of the higher-z "mini-quenched" galaxies. The discovery of these two low-mass $z&gt;5$ quiescent galaxies illuminates a previously undiscovered galaxy population and motivates dedicated follow-up surveys to investigate the overall population.</description>

      <title>Witnessing downsizing in the making: quiescent and breathing galaxies at the dawn of the Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: [Shortened for arXiv] We conduct a systematic search for $\log(M_\ast/M_\odot) \geq 9.5$ quiescent galaxies at $z &gt; 3$ in six extragalactic deep fields observed with NIRCam, with the goal of extracting their physical and statistical features in a uniform and self-consistent manner. We exploit the ASTRODEEP-JWST photometric catalogs to single out robust candidates, including sources quenched only a few tens of Myr before the observation. We apply a SED-fitting procedure which explores three functional forms of star formation history and the $\chi^2$ probabilities of the solutions, with additional checks to minimise the contamination from interlopers, tuning our selection criteria against available spectroscopic data from the DAWN archive and simulated catalogs. We select 633 candidates, which we rank by a reliability parameter based on the probabilities of the quiescent and alternative star-forming solutions, with 291 candidates tagged as "gold". According to the best-fit models, 79\% of the massive ($\log(M_\ast/M_\odot) \geq 10.5$) quiescent galaxies at $3 &lt; z &lt; 5$ stopped forming stars at least 150 Myr before the time of observation, while 89\% of low-mass sources have been quenched for less than 150 Myr. The abundance of low-mass old quiescent systems does not increase significantly with time from $z = 5$ to 3: low-mass objects seem to be experiencing a short episode of quenching followed by rejuvenation (``breathing''), consistent with a downsizing scenario of galaxy formation. We also find an abrupt drop in the density of massive quiescent candidates at $z &gt; 5$. We derive estimates for the number density of early passive galaxies up to $z = 10$ and compare them against various models: tensions with data remain in the modeling of the observed bimodality of time passed since quenching as a function of mass.</description>

      <title>Spatially Offset Active Galactic Nuclei in the Very Large Array Sky Survey: Tracers of Galaxy Mergers and Wandering Massive Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The remnants of galaxy mergers may host multiple off-nuclear massive black holes (MBHs), some of which may wander indefinitely within the host galaxy halos. Tracing the population of offset MBHs is essential for understanding how the distribution of MBHs in the Universe evolves through galaxy mergers, the efficiency of binary MBH formation, and the rates at which MBHs are seeded in low-mass satellite galaxies. Offset MBHs can be observationally traced if they are accreting and detectable as spatially offset active galactic nuclei (AGN). In this work, we build the largest uniform sample of spatially offset AGN candidates (328) by matching sources from the Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS) to galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Based on the radio source surface density, 29+/-3% are unrelated chance projections. The offset AGN occupation fraction is positively correlated with host galaxy stellar mass, consistent with predictions that most offset MBHs will reside in massive halos. However, this trend vanishes, and may reverse, at the lowest stellar masses, potentially reflecting the weaker host galaxy gravitational potentials. The offset AGN occupation fraction shows no significant evolution with orbital radius, and the agreement with predictions suggests a binary MBH formation rate of &lt;0.5 per merger. Finally, for offset MBHs down to masses of 10^5 Solar masses, the occupation fraction is ~30-70 times lower than the expected value assuming all accreted satellites host a MBH. This result may suggest a relatively low MBH seeding efficiency.</description>

      <title>Early Stages of Dusty Tori: The First Infrared Spectra from a Highly Multiscale Quasar Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first infrared spectral predictions from a self-consistent simulation of the formation of a quasar in a starburst galaxy, spanning cosmological to innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) scales. The infrared emission is dominated by a torus-like dust structure composed of the highly magnetized, turbulence-supported outer accretion disk and of accreting gas tidally torn from the interstellar medium (ISM). At these early stages, the AGN is buried and Compton-thick. The near- to mid-IR escaping luminosity varies by almost an order of magnitude across sightlines, largely due to extinction from the inflowing stream of cold dust. Self-absorption within the torus suppresses silicate emission features, and further reprocessing by the ambient ISM leads to prominent silicate absorption and colder IR emission. The sublimation structure is stratified by composition and size, producing sightline-dependent extinction curves that intrinsically vary in shape. However, after repeated scattering in the optically thick dusty medium, these curves emerge substantially grayed. We also demonstrate that bipolar outflows from the central black hole that carve biconical cavities and reveal the central engine in later stages can preserve IR anisotropy and silicate features. These results suggest that dusty starburst quasars can undergo a buried, IR-bright phase early in their evolution.</description>

      <title>The Last Stand Before Rubin: a consolidated sample of strong lensing systems in wide-field surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the Vera Rubin Observatory begins its ten-year survey in 2025, it will probe key observables such as strong lensing (SL) by galaxies and clusters. In preparation for this new era, we assemble an extensive compilation of SL candidate systems from the literature, comprising over 30,000 unique objects that can be used as a watch list of known systems. By cross-matching this sample with photometric and spectroscopic catalogs, we construct two value-added tables containing key parameters for SL analysis, including lens and source redshifts and lens velocity dispersions $\sigma_v$. As a preparation for Rubin, we generate image cutouts for these systems in existing wide-field surveys with subarcsecond seeing, namely CFHTLens, CS82, RCSLens, KiDS, HSC, DES, and DESI Legacy. This sample, dubbed the "Last Stand Before Rubin" (LaStBeRu), has a myriad of applications, from using archival data to selections for follow-up projects and training of machine learning algorithms. As an application, we perform a test of General Relativity using these data, combining the effects of motion of massless particles (through SL modeling) and non-relativistic bodies through $\sigma_v$, which allow one to set constraints on the Post-Newtonian parameter $\gamma_\mathrm{PPN}$. Using the LaStBeRu database, we present an independent test of $\gamma_\mathrm{PPN}$ (distinct from previous analyses) and, for the first time, we present such a test exclusively with systems identifiable in ground-based images. By combining these data with the previously published samples, we obtain the most stringent constraint on $\gamma_\mathrm{PPN}$. Our results are consistent with GR at the $\sim$~1-$\sigma$ level and with the previous results from the literature.</description>

      <title>An Improved Fit to the Density Distribution in Supersonic Isothermal Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The density distribution of supersonic isothermal turbulence plays a critical role in many astrophysical systems. It is commonly approximated by a lognormal distribution with a variance of $\sigma_{s,V}^2 \approx \ln(1 + b^2 M_{\rm V}^2),$ where $s \equiv \ln \rho/\rho_0,$ $M_{\rm V}$ is the rms volume-weighted Mach number, and $b$ is a parameter that depends on the driving mechanism, which can be solenoidal (divergence-free), compressive (curl-free), or a mix of the two. However, this neglects the correlation time of driving ($\tau_{\rm a}$), which plays a key role whenever compressive driving is significant. Here we conduct turbulence simulations spanning a wide range of Mach numbers, $1\lesssim M_{\rm V}\lesssim 10$, driving mechanisms, and $\tau_{\rm a}$ values. In the compressive case, we find that $\sigma_{s,V}^2$ scales approximately linearly with $M_{\rm V},$ and its dependence on $\tau_{\rm a}$ is $\sigma_{s,V}^2 \approx M_{\rm V} [1 + \frac{2}{3}(\lambda_{\rm a} + 1)\Theta(\lambda_{\rm a} + 1)]$, where $\lambda_{\rm a} \equiv \ln(\tau_{\rm a}/\tau_{\rm e})$, $\tau_{\rm e}$ is the eddy turnover time, and $\Theta$ is the Heaviside step function. Mixed-driven turbulence shows a weaker dependence on $\tau_{\rm a},$ and for solenoidally-driven turbulence, $\sigma_{s,V}^2 \approx \frac{1}{3}M_{\rm V}$, independent of $\tau_{\rm a}$ and consistent with the standard expression when $M_V \lesssim 10.$ The volume-weighted mean and skewness also show systematic trends with $M_{\rm V}$ and $\tau_{\rm a}$, deviating from lognormal expectations. For the mass-weighted density distribution, we observe significant broadening and skewness in compressively driven cases, especially at large $\tau_{\rm a}/\tau_{\rm e}$. These results provide a refined framework for modeling astrophysical turbulence.</description>

      <title>Optimized HDBSCAN clustering for reconstructing the merger history of the Milky Way: applications and limitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clustering algorithms can help reconstruct the assembly history of the Milky Way by identifying groups of stars sharing similar properties in a kinematical or chemical abundance space. However, although being promising tools, their efficiency has not yet been fully tested in a realistic cosmological framework. We investigate the effectiveness of the HDBSCAN clustering algorithm in the recovery of the progenitors of Milky Way-type galaxies, using several systems from the Auriga suite of simulations. We develop a methodology aimed at improving the efficiency of the algorithm and avoiding fragmentation: First, we use a 12-dimensional feature space including a range of chemodynamical properties and stellar ages; furthermore, we optimise the algorithm using information from the internal structure of the clusters of accreted stars. We show that our approach yields good results in terms of both purity and completeness of clusters for galaxies with different types of accretion histories. We also evaluate the decrease in efficiency due to contamination by in situ stars. While for accreted-only haloes the algorithm matches well the recovered clusters with the individual progenitors and is able to recover accretion events up to a redshift of accretion $z_{\rm acc}\sim3$, for accreted + in situ haloes it can only identify the more recent accretion events ($z_{\rm acc} &lt; 1$). However, the purity of the identified clusters remains remarkably high even in this case. Our results suggest that HDBSCAN can efficiently identify accreted debris in Milky Way-type galaxies in realistic conditions, however, it requires careful optimization to provide valid results.</description>

      <title>PeV particle acceleration and non-thermal emission in the `minimalist' model of the extended jets in W50/SS433</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The W50 nebula around microquasar SS~433, powered by supercritical accretion, features two `extended jets' (tens of pc long and a few pc wide) from which polarized X-ray and very high energy radiation above 100 TeV is detected. Here we present a model of very high energy particle acceleration in these extended jets. In the `minimalist' model (discussed in Churazov, Khabibullin, and Bykov, 2024), a collimated outflow aligned with the rotation axis is propagating through a more isotropic wind produced by the accretion disk. The observed extended X-ray jets with bright knots in this model are associated with the formation of strong recollimation MHD shocks after the collision of the collimated outflow with the isotropic wind termination surface. The spectra of electrons and protons up to PeV energies are simulated with a nonlinear Monte Carlo model of diffusive shock acceleration with turbulent magnetic field amplification. The overall efficiency of the jets power transfer to accelerated protons in this model is above 10\% and about 0.5\% for electrons above 50 TeV. The magnetic field amplification by Bell's instability due to the electric current of cosmic rays escaping the accelerator produces highly anisotropic magnetic turbulence in the shock downstream. This results in the polarized synchrotron X-ray emission with the photon electric vector predominantly transverse to the jet direction and the degree of polarization above 20\%. The model is able to reproduce the observed spectra and intensity profiles of non-thermal X-ray and gamma-ray emission, which are both dominated by the leptonic radiation.</description>

      <title>Kinematics of the lens host S0 galaxy NGC 1553: role of secular processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an investigation of the central structure of the S0 galaxy NGC 1553, to understand its origin and the underlying dynamical processes that shape it. The high-resolution integral field spectroscopic data from the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) reveal a well-ordered rotation pattern, consisting of a rapidly rotating nuclear disc that is somewhat decoupled from the main disc, together with an inner lens; we collectively refer to these structures as the "disc-lens". The central peak in the velocity dispersion indicates the presence of a classical bulge. The nuclear disc is dynamically colder than the surrounding disc, while the lens is dynamically hotter. The higher-order Gauss-Hermite moments, $h_{3}$ and $h_{4}$, further characterise the stellar kinematics. An anti-correlation between the line-of-sight velocity and skewness ($h_{3}$) is consistent with regular rotation. In contrast, the ring-like enhancement in kurtosis ($h_{4}$) confirms the presence of the nuclear disc component. Unsharp masking of HST images (Erwin et al. 2015) reveals a nuclear bar and faint spiral structures within the central 10 arcsec, supporting the role of secular evolution. The mass-weighted stellar age map shows an old stellar population in the central regions, with high metallicity that suggests the in-situ formation of the disc-lens from disc material. We discuss possible formation scenarios for the disc-lens, including both minor mergers and secular processes, and examine the influence of the Dorado group environment on NGC 1553. Our findings suggest that the disc-lens in NGC 1553 formed during the early stages of the galaxy's evolution. However, its subsequent development has been shaped by internal and external processes. These results provide new insights into the origin and evolution of kinematically distinct substructures in S0 galaxies.</description>

      <title>ALMA reveals diverse dust-to-gas mass ratios and quenching modes in old quiescent galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent discoveries of dust and molecular gas in quiescent galaxies (QGs) up to $z\sim3$ challenge the long-standing view that the interstellar medium depletes rapidly once star formation ceases, raising key questions of whether dust and gas co-evolve in QGs, and how their depletion links to stellar aging. We present deep Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Band~6 continuum and CO(3--2) observations of 17 QGs at $z\sim0.4$ in the COSMOS field. Using the dust-to-molecular gas mass ratio ($\delta_{\rm DGR}$) as a key diagnostic, we trace post-quenching evolution of the cold interstellar medium. Our study triples the number of QGs with direct $\delta_{\rm DGR}$ estimates, constraining 12 systems with stellar population ages of $\sim$5--10 Gyr. For the first time, we show that $\delta_{\rm DGR}$ in QGs ranges from $\sim8\times$ below to $\sim2.5\times$ above the canonical value of $\delta_{\rm DGR}\sim1/100$. Despite uniformly low molecular gas fractions (median $f_{\rm H_2}=M_{\rm H_2}/M_{\star}\sim4.1\%$), QGs follow diverse evolutionary paths: about half exhibit rapid ($\sim700$ Myr) exponential dust decline with age, while the rest show mild decline over $\gtrsim$2 Gyr, maintaining elevated $\delta_{\rm DGR}\gtrsim1/100$. Our results support simulations predictions of dust and molecular gas evolving independently post-quenching, without a preferred quenching mode. This challenges the use of dust continuum as a $\rm H_2$ tracer, implying that quenching cannot be robustly linked to interstellar medium conditions when relying solely on dust or gas.</description>

      <title>Impact of stochastic star-formation histories and dust on selecting quiescent galaxies with JWST photometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) now allows identifying quiescent galaxies (QGs) out to early epochs, the photometric selection of quiescent galaxy candidates (QGCs) and the derivation of key physical quantities are highly sensitive to the assumed star-formation histories (SFHs). We aim to quantify how the inclusion of JWST/MIRI data and different SFH models impacts the selection and characterisation of QGCs. We test the robustness of the physical properties inferred from the spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting, such as M*, age, star formation rate (SFR), and AV, and study how they impact the quiescence criteria of the galaxies across cosmic time. We perform SED fitting for ~13000 galaxies at z&lt;6 from the CEERS/MIRI fields with up to 20 optical-mid infrared (MIR) broadband coverage. We implement three SFH prescriptions: flexible delayed, NonParametric, and extended Regulator. For each model, we compare results obtained with and without MIRI photometry and dust emission models. We evaluate the impact of these configurations on the number of candidate QGCs, selected based on rest UVJ colours, sSFR and main-sequence offset, and on their key physical properties such as M*, AV, and stellar ages. The number of QGCs selected varies significantly with the choice of SFH from 171 to 224 out of 13000 galaxies, depending on the model. This number increases to 222-327 when MIRI data are used (up to ~45% more QGCs). This enhancement is driven by improved constraints on dust attenuation and M*. We find a strong correlation between AV and M*, with massive galaxies (M*~10^11 M\odot) being 1.5-4.2 times more attenuated in magnitude than low-mass systems (M*~10^9 M\odot), depending on SFH. Regardless of the SFH assumption, ~13% of QGCs exhibit significant attenuation (AV &gt; 0.5) in support of recent JWST studies challenging the notion that quiescent galaxies are uniformly dust-free.</description>

      <title>Cluster Ages to Reconstruct the Milky Way Assembly (CARMA) IV. Chrono-dynamics of seven old star clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud and the peculiar origin of NGC 1841</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we report conclusive evidence for an ancient star cluster that has been accreted by the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). By leveraging observations from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), we investigate the chrono-dynamical structure of a sample of seven old star clusters within the LMC in a self-consistent way. The multi-epoch nature of the dataset allowed the determination of high-precision proper motions for the clusters. Employing an isochrone-fitting methodology, we additionally infer from the deep high-resolution HST data homogeneous and robust estimates for their distances, ages and metallicities. Supplementing these data with literature line-of-sight velocities, we investigate the full 3-dimensional dynamics of the clusters within the frame of the LMC. With respect to the other clusters in our sample, NGC 1841 depicts a peculiar case. Its position in the age-metallicity plane, that makes it about 1 Gyr younger than the other metal-poor LMC clusters, but also its dynamical properties with a radial orbit almost perpendicular to the LMC disc plane, clearly advocates for a different origin. We thus conclude that NGC 1841 has likely been accreted by the LMC from a smaller galaxy. The other clusters in our sample show disc-like kinematics, with the case of NGC 2210 being peculiar, based on its inclined orbit. Their coherent age-metallicity relation closely resembles that of Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus globular clusters, thus suggesting a similar early evolution for the two dwarf galaxies. We do not find clear-cut chrono-kinematic evidence that NGC 2005 has been accreted by the LMC as suggested by a previous study based on its chemical abundance pattern. Regardless of its nature, its very old age illustrates that peculiar chemical evolutions already emerge at very early times.</description>

      <title>Towards Precision Cosmology With Improved PNLF Distances Using VLT-MUSE. III. Impact of Stellar Populations in Early-Type Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distance measurements using the planetary nebula luminosity function (PNLF) rely on the bright-end power-law cut-off magnitude ($M^*$), which is defined by a number of the [OIII]$\lambda5007$-brightest planetary nebulae (PNe). In early-type galaxies (ETGs), the formation of these PNe is enigmatic; the population is typically too old to form the expected $M^*$ PNe from single star evolution. We aim to give a solution to this problem. We selected five ETGs with known MUSE-PNLF distances. The MUSE instrument allows us to calculate the PNLF and consistently investigate the underlying stellar populations. Using stellar population synthesis, we derive the population age, star formation history, metallicity, and alpha abundance. We compare these parameters to the PNLF variables: $M^*$ and luminosity-specific PN number at the top 0.5 mag of the PNLF ($\alpha_{0.5}$). We also compare our results with PNe In Cosmological Simulations (PICS) model applied to Magneticum Pathfinder analogue galaxies. The average mass-weighted ages and metallicities of our observations are typically old ($9 &lt;\mathrm{Age}&lt; 13.5$ Gyr) and rather metal-rich ($-0.4 &lt;\mathrm{[M/H]}&lt; +0.2$). We find $M^*$ to be independent of age and metallicity in these ages and metallicity intervals. We discover a positive correlation between $\alpha_{0.5}$ values and the mass fraction of stellar population ages of 2--10 Gyr, implying that most of the PNe originate from stars with intermediate ages. Similar trends are also found in the PICS analogue galaxies. We show that the presence of at least $\sim 2\%$ of stellar mass younger than 10 Gyr is, in principle, sufficient to form the $M^*$ PNe in ETGs. We also present observing requirements for an ideal PNLF distance determination in ETGs.</description>

      <title>UV-irradiated outflows from low-mass protostars in Ophiuchus with JWST/MIRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main accretion phase of protostars is characterized by the ejection of material in the form of jets/outflows. External UV irradiation can potentially have a significant impact on the excitation conditions within these outflows. High-resolution observations in the mid-infrared allow us to investigate the details of those energetic processes through the emission of shock-excited H$_2$ . Our aim is to spatially resolve H$_2$ and ionic/atomic emission within the outflows of low-mass protostars, and investigate its origin in connection to shocks influenced by external ultraviolet irradiation. We analyze spectral maps of 5 Class I protostars in the Ophiuchus molecular cloud from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Medium Resolution Spectrometer (MIRI/MRS). Four out of five protostars show strong H$_2$, [\ion{Ne}{II}], and [\ion{Fe}{II}] emission associated with outflows/jets. Pure rotational H$_2$ transitions from S(1) to S(8) are found and show two distinct temperature components on Boltzmann diagrams with rotational temperatures of $\sim$500-600 K and $\sim$1000-3000 K respectively. Both $C$-type shocks propagating at high pre-shock densities (n$_\text{H} \ge$10$^4$ cm$^{-3}$) and $J$-type shocks at low pre-shock densities (n$_\text{H} \le$10$^3$ cm$^{-3}$) reproduce the observed line ratios. However, only $C$-type shocks produce sufficiently high column densities of H$_2$, whereas predictions from a single $J$-type shock reproduce the observed rotational temperatures of the gas better. A combination of various types of shocks could play a role in protostellar outflows as long as UV irradiation is included in the models. The origin of this radiation is likely internal, since no significant differences in the excitation conditions of outflows are seen at various locations in the cloud.</description>

      <title>Stellar populations of quasar host galaxies with MFICA decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy evolution theories require co-evolution between accreting supermassive black holes (SMBH) and galaxies to explain many properties of the local galaxy population, yet observational evidence for the mechanisms driving this co-evolution is lacking. The recent star-formation histories of the host galaxies of accreting SMBHs (Active Galactic Nuclei, AGNs) can help constrain the processes that feed SMBHs and halt star formation in galaxies, but are difficult to obtain for the most luminous AGNs (quasars). We introduce Mean-Field Independent Component Analysis (MFICA) to decompose quasar spectra and obtain recent star formation histories of their host galaxies. Applying MFICA to quasar spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) DR7 Quasar Catalogue in the redshift range $0.16 \leq z \leq 0.76$, we find that 53 per cent of quasar host galaxies are star-forming, 17 per cent lie in the green-valley, while only 5 per cent are quiescent. This contrasts with 14, 11, and 74 per cent of a mass-matched control sample that are star-forming, green-valley, and quiescent, respectively. We find that $\sim25$ per cent of quasars are hosted by post-starburst galaxies, an excess of $28\pm1$ compared to our control sample. While the heterogeneity of recent star formation histories implies multiple SMBH feeding mechanisms, the excess of post-starburst host galaxies demonstrates the link between accreting SMBHs and a recent starburst followed by rapid quenching. Given that massive post-starburst galaxies are predominantly caused by gas-rich major mergers, our results indicate that $30-50$ per cent of quasars originate from merger-induced starbursts.</description>

      <title>Is cosmic dust porous?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is a long-standing discussion in the astrophysical/astrochemical community as to the structure and morphology of dust grains in various astrophysical environments (e.g., interstellar clouds, protostellar envelopes, protoplanetary and debris disks, and the atmospheres of exoplanets). Typical grain models assume a compact dust core which becomes covered in a thick ice mantle in cold dense environments. In contrast, less compact cores are likely to exhibit porosity, leading to a pronounced increase in surface area with concomitant much thinner ice films and higher accessibility to the bare grain surface. Several laboratory experimental and theoretical studies have shown that this type of dust structure can have a marked effect on several physico-chemical processes, including adsorption, desorption, mobility, and reactivity of chemical species. Porous grains are thus thought to likely play a particularly important and wide-ranging astrochemical role. Herein, we clarify what is meant by porosity in relation to grains and grain agglomerates, assess the likely astrochemical effects of porosity and ask whether a fractal/porous structural/morphological description of dust grains is appropriate from an astronomical perspective. We provide evidence for high porosity from laboratory experiments and computational simulations of grains and their growth in various astrophysical environments. Finally, we assess the observational constraints and perspectives on cosmic dust porosity. Overall, our paper discusses the effects of including porosity in dust models and the need to use such models for future astrophysical, astrochemical and astrobiological studies involving surface or solid-state processes.</description>

      <title>The large-scale kinematics of young stars in the Milky Way disc: first results from SDSS-V</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10387v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a first large-scale kinematic map of $\sim$50,000 young OB stars ($T_{\rm eff} \geq 10,000$ K), based on BOSS spectroscopy from the Milky Way Mapper OB program in the ongoing Sloan Digital Sky Survey V (SDSS-V). Using photogeometric distances, line-of-sight velocities and Gaia DR3 proper motions, we map 3D Galactocentric velocities across the Galactic plane to $\sim$5 kpc from the Sun, with a focus on radial motions ($v_R$). Our results reveal mean radial motion with amplitudes of $\pm 30$ km/s that are coherent on kiloparsec scales, alternating between inward and outward motions. These $\bar{v}_R$ amplitudes are considerably higher than those observed for older, red giant populations. These kinematic patterns show only a weak correlation with spiral arm over-densities. Age estimates, derived from MIST isochrones, indicate that 85% of the sample is younger than $\sim300$ Myr and that the youngest stars ($\le 30$ Myr) align well with density enhancements. The age-dependent $\bar{v}_R$ in Auriga makes it plausible that younger stars exhibits different velocity variations than older giants. The origin of the radial velocity features remains uncertain, and may result from a combination of factors, including spiral arm dynamics, the Galactic bar, resonant interactions, or phase mixing following a perturbation. The present analysis is based on approximately one-third of the full target sample. The completed survey will enable a more comprehensive investigation of these features and a detailed dynamical interpretation.</description>

      <title>Statistic of stars with poor astrometric solutions of Gaia DR3 in open star clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We performed counts of stars with poor astrometric solutions of Gaia DR3 in the regions of open star clusters: NGC 188, NGC 1039, NGC 2287, NGC 2301, NGC 2360, NGC 2420, NGC 2527, NGC 2548, NGC 2682 (M 67), NGC 3114, NGC 3766, NGC 5460, NGC 6649. The selection of the possible cluster members is based on the Gaia photometry using the Hess diagram. We look for stars that fall within the region of the Hess diagram plotted from probable cluster members based on Hunt &amp; Reffert data. We take stars with two-parameter solutions, with the parameter RUWE&gt;1.4, as well as with large relative parallax errors that fall within the Hess diagram region for probable cluster members. The radii of clusters based on stars with poor astrometric solutions and the number of such possible cluster members were estimated. The number of stars with poor astrometric solutions relative to the number of stars from the Hunt &amp; Reffert sample N_bad/N varies very widely with a median average of approximately 30%. This means that when one selects probable cluster members based on precise astrometric data from Gaia DR3, an average of about 23% of cluster members may be lost. Among the lost stars there may be a significant number of unresolved binary and multiple systems. We investigated the dependence of the relative number of stars with poor astrometric solutions on the galactic latitude and on the average number density of stars. The brightness functions with and without stars with poor solutions differ significantly in the region of faint stars 14&lt;G&lt;18 mag for clusters with a relative number of possible cluster members with poor astrometric solutions of N_bad/N&gt;=0.15.</description>

      <title>Euclid: Early Release Observations -- The star cluster systems of the Local Group dwarf galaxies IC 10 and NGC 6822</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10440v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Star clusters are valuable indicators of galaxy evolution, offering insights into the buildup of stellar populations across cosmic time. Understanding intrinsic star cluster populations of dwarf galaxies is particularly important given their role in the hierarchical growth of larger systems. Using Euclid Early Release Observation data, we study star clusters in two star-forming dwarf irregulars in the Local Group, NGC 6822 and IC 10 [$M_\star \sim$ (1--4) $\times10^8 M_\odot$]. With Euclid, clusters are resolved into individual stars across the main bodies and haloes of both galaxies. Visual inspection of $I_E$ images uncovers 30 new cluster candidates in NGC 6822 and 16 in IC 10, from compact to extended clusters. We re-evaluate literature candidates, producing combined catalogues of 52 (NGC 6822) and 71 (IC 10) clusters with confidence-based classifications. We present homogeneous photometry in $I_E$, $Y_E$, $J_E$, $H_E$, and archival UBVRI data, alongside size measurements and properties from BAGPIPES SED fitting. Synthetic cluster injection shows our sample is $\sim 50$% complete to $M \lesssim 10^3 M_\odot$ for ages $\lesssim 100$ Myr, and to $M \lesssim 3\times10^4 M_\odot$ for $\sim 10$ Gyr. IC 10 has more young clusters than NGC 6822, extending to higher masses, consistent with its starburst nature. Both dwarfs host several old massive ($\gtrsim 10^5 M_\odot$) clusters, including an exceptional $1.3 \times 10^6 M_\odot$ cluster in NGC 6822's outskirts. In NGC 6822, we identify a previously undetected, old, extended cluster ($R_h = 12.4 \pm 0.11$ pc). Using well-defined criteria, we identify 11 candidate GCs in NGC 6822 and eight in IC 10. Both galaxies have high specific frequencies ($S_N$) but remain consistent with known GC scaling relations at low luminosity [abridged].</description>

Abstract: Recent efforts to identify secondary variations in the Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) have primarily focused on simulations examining the role of large-scale cosmic environments such as superclusters, filaments, and underdense regions or voids. If present, these variations could yield valuable insights into galaxy formation mechanisms, halo assembly processes, and the influence of external factors on cosmic structure. We aim to test whether secondary trends in the HOD driven by the large-scale structure of the Universe are detectable observationally. In particular, we examine whether the HOD depends on distance to key features of the cosmic web by explicitly quantifying these spatial relationships. We also analyze whether HODs vary across different cosmic environments, defined by critical point classifications, and assess the influence of intrinsic galaxy properties such as central galaxy color. We create volume-limited galaxy samples from SDSS-DR18 and use a group catalog to determine halo masses and identify central and satellite membership. Additionally, we employ a DisPerSE catalog to locate critical points such as maxima, minima, and filaments in the cosmic web. We evaluate how the HOD varies with proximity to these features and across five distinct cosmic environments. We further examine trends related to the color of central galaxies and test the robustness of our results with alternative DisPerSE catalogs generated using different smoothing scales and persistence thresholds. Our analysis shows that large-scale environments only weakly influence the HOD. However, second-order dependencies may be revealed through a multivariate approach that combines local and large-scale metrics with intrinsic galaxy properties. Future work with next-generation surveys and advanced modeling may achieve the precision required to detect and characterize these subtle environmental correlations.</description>

Abstract: The coronal soft X-ray emission of cool stars, especially when taken in combination with their measured rotation periods, offers insights into their levels of magnetic activity and related transitions. We study the X-ray properties of low-mass members of the open cluster NGC 2516 to explicate their detailed dependencies on mass and rotation. We analysed the pointed SRG/eROSITA satellite observations of NGC 2516 obtained during the calibration and performance verification phase of the mission. We found 1561 X-ray sources within the field of view and related 1007 of them to their optical stellar counterparts, including 655 members of NGC 2516 (433 with rotation periods). We combined these detections with auxiliary optical data to facilitate their interpretation. Furthermore, we extracted X-ray spectra for all sources and fit two-component APEC models to them. To aid the analysis, we grouped stars with similar mass and rotational properties together, which allowed us to investigate the influence of rotation on various X-ray properties. The colour-activity diagram of NGC 2516 displays a general increase in the fractional X-ray luminosity with spectral type change from F through G and K to M-type. However, the behaviour of K-type stars, representing the ones that best sample the fast-to-slow rotational transition, is more complex, with both increased and decreased X-ray emission relative to G-type stars for fast and slow rotators, respectively. The rotation-activity diagram is analogous, with an identifiable desaturated group of X-ray emitters that corresponds to stars in the rotational gap between the fast and slow rotator sequences. We prefer to describe the normalised X-ray emission for all cluster stars as declining logarithmically with Rossby number over those using broken power laws. Coronal temperatures appear to be largely independent of mass or rotation. (abridged)</description>

      <title>Reionization in HESTIA: Studying reionization in the LG through zoom simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While cosmic reionization has been broadly constrained by global observables, the interplay between internal sources (Milky Way, M31, and their satellites) and external ionization fronts remains poorly understood in a realistic Local Group (LG) context. To address this issue, we perform radiative transfer post-processing on the original HESTIA LG constrained simulation. We calibrate our source models using a uniform 1024^3 particle, dark-matter only, HESTIA simulation coupled with a subgrid collapse-fraction model to match the global reionization observables. These source models are then applied to the HESTIA zoom-in simulations, which consist of a 4096^3 particle effective resolution in the zoom region centered on the Milky Way (MW) and M31 haloes, which resolves haloes down to 10^8 solar masses. We find that in all scenarios, reionization within the LG proceeds in an inside-out manner with the progenitors of the MW and M31 having 50 percent of their material ionized by z ~ 9-8.6, significantly earlier than the global midpoint at z ~ 7-7.7, noting that external fronts from large-scale structure play a negligible role, even under the most permissive feedback model. We further show that present-day satellite galaxies exhibit only a weak correlation between their reionization redshift and their present-day radial distance from their host halo, with somewhat tighter trends around M31 than the MW. Finally, we find that satellites which assembled before reionization are systematically more massive today, suggesting that the oldest stellar populations preferentially reside in the most massive subhaloes.</description>

      <title>Signatures of dynamical activity in the hot gas profiles of groups and clusters in the FLAMINGO simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In anticipation of upcoming cosmological surveys, we use the large volume Flamingo hydrodynamical simulations to look for signatures of dynamical activity, focusing on the hot gas profiles of groups and clusters out to redshift $z=1$. To determine the dynamical state of each object, we consider the halo mass accretion rate, $\Gamma$, as well as three observational proxies: stellar mass gap, $\Mstar$; X-ray concentration, $c_\mathrm{x}$, and X-ray centroid shift, $\left&lt;w\right&gt;$. In general, the median values of these indicators vary in accordance with an increase in dynamical activity with both mass and redshift. We find $\left&lt;w\right&gt;$ to be the most reliable proxy, while $c_\mathrm{x}$ and $\Mstar$ are more sensitive to resolution and feedback model details. Looking at the profiles, the correlation between dark matter density and $\Gamma$ has a characteristic radial dependence, being negatively (positively) correlated at small (large) radii. This trend is insensitive to both halo mass and redshift. Similar behaviour is also seen for the hot gas densities in low redshift clusters, particularly when using $\left&lt;w\right&gt;$, but the correlations become weaker in groups, at higher redshift and when stronger feedback is employed. We also find the intrinsic scatter in the gas density profiles to decrease with redshift, particularly in groups, contrary to what is seen for the dark matter. Interestingly, the radius of minimum gas density scatter increases with feedback strength, suggesting that this property could be a useful feedback diagnostic in future observational studies.</description>

      <title>The 21-cm signature of X-ray heated halos around galaxies during cosmic dawn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: X-rays emitted by high mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs) and supernovae-driven winds in the first galaxies during Cosmic Dawn are expected to warm the intergalactic medium prior to its reionization. While most of the heating will be uniform on measurable scales, exceptionally bright sources will produce a warm ring around them with a distinctive 21-cm signature. The detection of such systems would confirm X-rays are a source of IGM heating during Cosmic Dawn and provide a test of models predicting higher X-ray luminosities per star formation rate compared with present-day galaxies. We illustrate the effect for a star-forming galaxy in a $10^{11}\, M_\odot$ halo at $z=12$, treating the photoionizing radiation and X-rays using a novel fully time-dependent 3D ray-tracing radiative transfer code. We consider a range in possible spectra for the HMXBs and star formation efficiencies, as well as the possible effect of an extended halo around the galaxy. We find detection of the signal would require integration times of a few thousand hours using SKA1-Low except for a bright galaxy like a starburst, but only a thousand hours for the expected noise levels of SKA2-Low. Depending on the surrounding gas density profile, the 21-cm signature of X-ray heating may still require an exceptionally high star formation rate, either intrinsic to the source or provided by other systems clustered near it, to avoid dominance of the signal by absorption from the surrounding gas.</description>

      <title>Joint X-ray, kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich, and weak lensing measurements: toward a consensus picture of efficient gas expulsion from groups and clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is no consensus on how baryon feedback shapes the underlying matter distribution from either simulations or observations. We confront the uncertain landscape by jointly analyzing new measurements of the gas distribution around groups and clusters -- DESI+ACT kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect profiles and eROSITA X-ray gas masses -- with mean halo masses characterized by galaxy-galaxy lensing. Across a wide range of halo masses ($M_{500}=10^{13-14}M_\odot$) and redshifts ($0&lt;z&lt;1$), we find evidence of more efficient gas expulsion beyond several $R_{500}$ than predicted by most state-of-the-art simulations. A like-with-like comparison reveals all kSZ and X-ray observations are inconsistent with the fiducial 1 Gpc$^{3}$ hydrodynamical FLAMINGO simulation, which was calibrated to reproduce pre-eROSITA X-ray gas fractions: eROSITA X-ray gas fractions are $2\times$ lower than the simulation, and the kSZ measurements are combined $&gt;8 \sigma$ discrepant. The FLAMINGO simulation variant with the most gas expulsion, and therefore the most suppression of the matter power spectrum relative to a dark matter only simulation, provides a good description of how much gas is expelled and how far it extends; the enhanced gas depletion is achieved by more powerful but less frequent AGN outbursts. Joint kSZ, X-ray, and lensing measurements form a consistent picture of gas expulsion beyond several $R_{500}$, implying a more suppressed matter power spectrum than predicted by most recent simulations. Complementary observables and next-generation simulations are critical to understanding the physical mechanism behind this extreme gas expulsion and mapping its impact on the large-scale matter distribution.</description>

      <title>Different physical and numerical sources of scatter in the $M_{\star}$-$M_{\mathrm{BH}}$ relation and their connection to galaxy evolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06203v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Observations have established that the masses of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) correlate tightly with the stellar masses of their host galaxies, albeit with substantial scatter. The magnitude of this scatter as a function of galaxy mass and redshift contains valuable information about the origin of SMBHs and the physical nature of their co-evolution with galaxies. In this work, we highlight this connection by studying the scatter in the $M_{\rm BH}$-$M_\star$ relation for massive galaxies in the Illustris, TNG100, and EAGLE cosmological simulations. We find that TNG100 shows significantly lower scatter than Illustris and EAGLE, reflecting different BH feedback models. Using numerical experiments, we separate different contributions to the scatter, including an intrinsic component. At $z=0$, Illustris and EAGLE show $\sim 0.3$ dex intrinsic scatter dominated by BH accretion, while the smaller scatter in TNG100 is dominated by hierarchical merging, implying more tightly quenched massive galaxies. BH seed mass variations can add scatter, though their impact at $z=0$ depends on the feedback model. Without AGN feedback the scatter is much larger for low-mass galaxies ($\gtrsim 0.5$ dex for $\log M_\star &lt; 10^{10.5},\mathrm{M_\odot}$ at $z=0-3$), underscoring the crucial role of feedback in SMBH-galaxy co-evolution. In contrast, hierarchical merging of quenched systems is the main factor reducing scatter for massive galaxies. Based on our results, we expect that the scatter in the $M_{\rm BH}$-$M_\star$ relation at high redshift could be particularly powerful in providing clues to the origin of SMBHs.</description>

      <title>MARTA: Temperature-temperature relationships and strong-line metallicity calibrations from multiple auroral-line detections at cosmic noon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03839v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first results from MARTA (Measuring Abundances at high Redshift with the T$_e$ Approach), a programme leveraging ultra-deep, medium-resolution JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy to probe the interstellar medium (ISM) of star-forming galaxies at $z \sim 2 - 3$. We report detections of one or more auroral lines, including [O III]$\lambda4363$, [O II]$\lambda\lambda7320,7330$, [S II] $\lambda4068$, and [S III] $\lambda6312$ for 16 galaxies in the sample, providing measurements of multiple ionic temperatures. We tested the validity of the T[O II]-T[O III] relation at high redshift considering a total sample of 21 objects including literature data, and obtained a shallower slope than in the low-$z$ literature. However, such a slope is consistent with low-redshift data when ultra-low metallicity objects are considered. We assessed the correlation of the T[O II]-T[O III] relationship and its scatter on different physical parameters, finding a mild correlation with the ionisation parameter and radiation field hardness, while no significant correlation with gas density. The location of high-redshift data is also consistent with the low-$z$ literature in the T[O II]-T[S II], and T[S III]-T[O III] relations, although this conclusion is limited with low-number statistics. Finally, we leveraged our sample together with a comprehensive compilation of galaxies with [O III]$\lambda4363$ detections from the literature to recalibrate classical strong-line diagnostics at high redshift. MARTA represents a key addition in this space because it provides direct metallicities at moderately high oxygen abundances (12+log(O/H) $\sim8.0-8.4$).</description>

      <title>Quantifying the intrinsic variability due to randomness of the Auriga galaxy formation model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13440v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Numerical simulations have become an indispensable tool in astrophysics. To interpret their results, it is critical to understand their intrinsic variability, that is, how much the results change with numerical noise or inherent stochasticity of the physics model. We present a set of seven realisations of high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulations of a Milky Way-like galaxy with the Auriga galaxy formation model. All realisations share the same initial conditions and code parameters, but draw different random numbers for the inherently stochastic parts of the model. We show that global galaxy properties at $z=0$, including stellar mass, star formation history, masses of stellar bulge and stellar disc, the radius and height of the stellar disk change by less than $10\%$ between the different realisations, and that magnetic field structures in the disc and the halo are very similar. In contrast, the star formation rate today can vary by a factor of two and the internal morphological structure of the stellar disc can change. The time and orbit of satellite galaxies and their galaxy properties when falling into the main halo are again very similar, but their orbits start to deviate after first pericenter passage. Finally, we show that changing the mass resolution of all matter components by a factor of $8$ in the Auriga model changes galaxy properties significantly more than the intrinsic variability of the model, and that these changes are systematic. This limits detailed comparisons between simulations at different numerical resolutions.</description>

      <title>Atomic hydrogen reservoirs in quiescent galaxies at z = 0.4</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16917v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context. Based on Local Universe observations, quiescent galaxies (QGs) host lower to no HI compared to star-forming galaxies (SFGs), but no constraints have been derived so far at higher redshift (z&gt;0.1). Understanding whether QGs can retain significant HI reservoirs at higher z is crucial to refine quenching and gas accretion models and to constrain overall star formation efficiency at different epochs. Aims. We aim to probe HI in candidate QGs at intermediate redshifts (z=0.36) and to understand whether there exists a class of QGs retaining consistent HI reservoirs and which parameters (dust content, stellar mass, Dn4000, morphology, environment) effectively capture HI-rich QGs. Methods. We perform 21-cm spectral line stacking on MIGHTEE-HI data at z=0.36, targeting two different samples of QGs, defined by means of a color-selection criterion and a spectroscopic criterion based on Dn4000, respectively. We also perform stacking on subsamples of the spectroscopically-selected quiescent sample to investigate the correlation between the HI content and other galaxy properties. Results. We find that QGs with an IR counterpart (i.e., dusty galaxies) are found to host a substantial HI content, on average just 40% lower than SFGs. In contrast, color-selected QGs still hold HI, but lower than SFGs by a factor 3. Among dusty objects, we find morphology to have a mild impact on the atomic gas content, with spirals hosting approximately 15-30% more HI than spheroids. Environmental effects are also present, with low-density regions hosting galaxies that are HI-richer than in high-density ones, by approximately 30% for spirals and 60% for spheroids. We suggest that, in general, HI content is driven by several factors, including quenching mechanisms and ISM enrichment processes. Also, quiescent galaxies - and especially dusty systems - seem to yield HI more consistently than in the Local Universe.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Classification of COSMOS2020 Galaxies: Quiescent vs. Star-Forming</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03039v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurately distinguishing between quiescent and star-forming galaxies is essential for understanding galaxy evolution. Traditional methods, such as spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting, can be computationally expensive and may struggle to capture complex galaxy properties. This study aims to develop a robust and efficient machine learning (ML) classification method to identify quiescent and star-forming galaxies within the Farmer COSMOS2020 catalog. We utilized JWST wide-field light cones from the Santa Cruz semi-analytical modeling framework to train a supervised ML model, the CatBoostClassifier, using 28 color features derived from 8 mutual photometric bands within the COSMOS catalog. The model was validated against a testing set and compared to the SED-fitting method in terms of precision, recall, F1-score, and execution time. Preprocessing steps included addressing missing data, injecting observational noise, and applying a magnitude cut (ch1 &lt; 26 AB) along with a redshift range of 0.2 &lt; z &lt; 3.5 to align the simulated and observational datasets. The ML method achieved an F1-score of 89\% for quiescent galaxies, significantly outperforming the SED-fitting method, which achieved 54%. The ML model demonstrated superior recall (88% vs. 38%) while maintaining comparable precision. When applied to the COSMOS2020 catalog, the ML model predicted a systematically higher fraction of quiescent galaxies across all redshift bins within 0.2 &lt; z &lt; 3.5 compared to traditional methods like NUVrJ and SED-fitting. This study shows that ML, combined with multi-wavelength data, can effectively identify quiescent and star-forming galaxies, providing valuable insights into galaxy evolution. The trained classifier and full classification catalog are publicly available.</description>

      <title>Detection of a septuple stellar system in formation via disk fragmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06787v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stellar multiple systems play a pivotal role in cluster dynamics and stellar evolution, leading to intense astronomical phenomena like X-ray binaries, gamma-ray bursts, Type Ia supernova, and stellar mergers, which are prime sources of gravitational waves. However, their origin remains poorly understood. Here we report the discovery of a septuple protostellar system embedded in a Keplerian disk within the high-mass star-forming region NGC\,6334IN, with close separations of 181-461 AU. The stability analysis reveals that the disk surrounding the septuple system is dynamically unstable, indicating that the septuple system formed via disk fragmentation. Previous studies have typically found only 2--3 members forming via disk fragmentation in both low- and high-mass star-forming regions. Our findings provide compelling observational evidence that the fragmentation of a gravitationally unstable disk is a viable mechanism for the formation of extreme high-order multiplicity, confirming what was previously only a theoretical concept. The results shed new light on the formation of extreme high-order multiplicity in cluster environments.</description>

      <title>Auriga Streams III: the mass-metallicity relation does not rule out tidal mass loss in Local Group satellites</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06859v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mass-metallicity relation is a fundamental galaxy scaling law that has been extended to the faintest systems in the Local Group. We show that the small scatter in this relation, which has been used to argue against tidal mass loss in Local Group satellites, is consistent with the level of disruption in the Auriga simulations. For every accreted system in Auriga, we compute stellar masses and metallicities two ways: considering the total system (bound + lost material) and only considering the progenitor. Accreted systems in Auriga have a tight relation between total stellar mass and metallicity, with scatter at a fixed stellar mass driven by age. When only considering the progenitor, the tidally evolved mass-metallicity relation has similar scatter ($\sim$0.27 dex) as observed for the Local Group satellites ($\sim$0.23 dex). Satellites that lie above the relation have experienced substantial mass loss and typically have low metallicity for their total stellar mass. Even satellites that fall exactly on the evolved relation can lose over half of their stellar mass. Only satellites substantially below the evolved relation are reliably intact. Based on their offset from the observed relation, we predict which Milky Way and M31 satellites have tidal tails waiting to be discovered.</description>

Abstract: The fundamental process of star formation in galaxies involves the interplay between the fueling of star formation via molecular gas and the feedback from recently formed massive stars. This process, by which galaxies evolve, is also closely connected to the intrinsic properties of the interstellar medium (ISM). To study the role that different molecular and atomic phases of the ISM play in star formation, and to characterize their physical conditions, we zoom into our nearest neighboring galaxy, the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC; 50 kpc). The LMC offers a view of the ISM and star formation conditions in a low metallicity environment similar to, in that regard, the epoch of the peak of star formation in the earlier universe. We present an unprecedentedly detailed analysis of a well-known star-forming regions (SFRs) at a spatial resolution of a few pc. We mapped a 610pcx260pc region in the LMC molecular ridge in [CII] and the [OIII] using the FIFI-LS instrument on the SOFIA telescope. We compare the data with the distribution of the CO (2-1) emission from ALMA, the modeled TIR luminosity as well as Spitzer/MIPS continuum and Halpha. We also provide a detailed description of the observing strategy and the data reduction. We find that [CII] and [OIII] emission is associated with the SFRs in the molecular ridge, but also extends throughout the mapped region, not obviously associated with ongoing star formation. The CO emission is clumpier than the [CII] emission and we find plentiful [CII] present where there is little CO emission, possibly holding important implications for CO-dark gas. We find a clear trend of the [CII]/TIR ratio decreasing with increasing TIR. This suggests a strong link between the [CII]-deficit and the local physical conditions instead of global properties.</description>

      <title>Bridging the micro-Hz gravitational wave gap via Doppler tracking with the Uranus Orbiter and Probe Mission: Massive black hole binaries, early universe signals and ultra-light dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02306v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the recent announcement by NASA's \textit{Planetary Science and Astrobiology Decadal Survey 2023-2032}, a priority flagship mission to the planet Uranus is anticipated. Here, we explore the prospects of using the mission's radio Doppler tracking equipment to detect gravitational waves (GWs) and other analogous signals related to dark matter (DM) over the duration of its interplanetary cruise. We develop a methodology to stack tracking data and account for time varying detector geometry, thereby constructing the sensitivity of the mission to GWs over the wide frequency range of $3\times 10^{-9}$ Hz to $10^{-4}$ Hz. We find that the mission has the potential to fill the gap between pulsar timing and space-based-interferometry GW observatories. If improvements in reducing \textit{Cassini} era noise by a factor of $\sim$10 are implemented, we forecast the detection of $\mathcal{\mathcal{O}}(\rm{few})$ individual massive black hole binaries using two independent population models. Additionally, we determine the mission's sensitivity to both astrophysical and primordial stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds, as well as its capacity to test, or even confirm via detection, ultralight DM models. In all these cases, the tracking of the spacecraft over its interplanetary cruise would enable coverage of unexplored regions of parameter space, where signals from new phenomena in our Universe may be lurking.</description>

      <title>The Power of the Cosmic Web</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11778v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the cosmological information contained in the cosmic web, categorized as four structure types: nodes, filaments, walls, and voids, using the Quijote simulations and a modified nexus+ algorithm. We show that splitting the density field by the four structure types and combining the power spectrum in each provides much tighter constraints on cosmological parameters than using the power spectrum without splitting. We show the rich information contained in the cosmic web structures -- related to the Hessian of the density field -- for measuring all of the cosmological parameters, and in particular for constraining neutrino mass. We study the constraints as a function of Fourier scale, configuration space smoothing scale, and the underlying field. For the matter field with $k_{\rm max}=0.5\,h/{\rm Mpc}$, we find a factor of $\times20$ tighter constraints on neutrino mass when using smoothing scales larger than 12.5~Mpc/$h$, and $\times80$ tighter when using smoothing scales down to 1.95~Mpc/$h$. However, for the CDM+Baryon field we observe a more modest $\times1.7$ or $\times3.6$ improvement, for large and small smoothing scales respectively. We release our new python package for identifying cosmic structures pycosmmommf at https://github.com/James11222/pycosmommf to enable future studies of the cosmological information of the cosmic web.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-Based Analytical Expressions for Gray-Body Factors and Application to Primordial Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18270v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symbolic Regression (SR) is a machine learning approach that explores the space of mathematical expressions to identify those that best fit a given dataset, balancing both accuracy and simplicity. We apply SR to the study of Gray-Body Factors (GBFs), which play a crucial role in the derivation of Hawking radiation and are recognized for their computational complexity. We explore simple analytical forms for the GBFs of the Schwarzschild Black Hole (BH). We compare the results obtained with different approaches and quantify their consistency with those obtained by solving the Teukolsky equation. As a case study, we apply our pipeline, which we call \texttt{ReGrayssion}, to the study of Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) as Dark Matter (DM) candidates, deriving constraints on the abundance from observations of diffuse extragalactic $\gamma$-ray background. These results highlight the possible role of SR in providing human-interpretable, approximate analytical GBF expressions, offering a new pathway for investigating PBH as a DM candidate.</description>
