      <title>Double unstable avoided crossings and complex domain patterns formation in spin-orbit coupled spin-1 condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the impact of spin-orbit and Rabi couplings on the dynamical stability of spin-orbit-coupled spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensates for ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic (AFM) interactions. Determining the collective excitation spectrum through Bogoliubov-de-Gennes theory, we characterize the dynamical stability regime via modulational instability. For AFM interactions, the eigenspectrum reveals the presence of both stable and unstable avoided crossings (UAC), with the first-excited branch undergoing a double unstable avoided crossing. In contrast, with ferromagnetic interactions, only a single UAC, which occurs between the low-lying and first-excited branches, is observed. Furthermore, the eigenvectors demonstrate the transition from density-like to spin-like behaviour, as the collective excitation shows the transition from stable to unstable mode for both the FM and AFM interactions. In the multi-band instability state, eigenvectors display spin-density mixed mode, while they show spin-flip nature in the avoided crossing regime. Our analysis suggests that spin-orbit coupling enhances the instability gain, while Rabi coupling plays the opposite role. Finally, we corroborate our analytical findings of stable and unstable regimes through numerical simulations of the dynamical evolution of the condensates by introducing the perturbations upon quenching the trap strength. The dynamical phases show the formation of complex domains with AFM interaction, which may be attributed to the double unstable avoided crossings in such a system.</description>

      <title>A steady solution to the hydrodynamic equation and incommensurate magnetization in a U(2) invariant superfluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At the zero temperature limit, a one-dimensional steady solution to the hydrodynamic equation of a U(2) invariant superfluid is obtained. This solution reveals that the magnitude of magnetization is always directly proportional to the particle number density. Furthermore, the problem can be interpreted as a particle's motion in a central force field. It is demonstrated that the particle's orbits are elliptical in shape, with a precession angle determined by a non-zero mass current. This suggests that the spatial periods of the three component magnetizations are not commensurate. These findings indicate that the coupling of mass superflow and magnetization distortions usually results in an incommensurate magnetization.</description>

      <title>Observing Spatial Charge and Spin Correlations in a Strongly-Interacting Fermi Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional correlated fermions constitute a cornerstone of quantum matter, covering a broad fundamental and technological scope, and have attracted increasing interest with the emergence of modern materials such as high-$T_{\rm c}$ superconductors, graphene, topological insulators, and Moir\'e structures. Atom-based quantum simulators provide a new pathway to understand the microscopic mechanisms occurring at the heart of such systems. In this work, we explore two-dimensional attractive Fermi gases at the microscopic level by probing spatial charge and spin correlations in situ. Using atom-resolved continuum quantum gas microscopy, we directly observe fermion pairing and study the evolution of two- and three-point correlation functions as inter-spin attraction is increased. The precision of our measurement allows us to reveal a marked dip in the pair correlation function, fundamentally forbidden by the mean-field result based on Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory but whose existence we confirm in exact auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo calculations. We demonstrate that the BCS prediction is critically deficient not only in the superfluid crossover regime but also deep in the weakly attractive side. Guided by our measurements, we find a remarkable relation between two- and three-point correlations that establishes the dominant role of pair-correlations. Finally, leveraging local single-pair losses, we independently characterize the short-range behavior of pair correlations, via the measurement of Tan's Contact, and find excellent agreement with numerical predictions. Our measurements provide an unprecedented microscopic view into two-dimensional Fermi gases and constitute a paradigm shift for future studies of strongly-correlated fermionic matter in the continuum.</description>

      <title>Chiral vortex-line liquid of three-dimensional interacting Bose systems with moat dispersion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formulate and investigate a novel quantum state, the Chiral Vortex-Line Liquid (CVLL), emerging in three-dimensional interacting Bose systems exhibiting moat-band dispersions. Such dispersions feature extensive degeneracy along closed manifolds in momentum space, significantly amplifying quantum fluctuations that suppress conventional Bose-Einstein condensation. By extending the two-dimensional Chern-Simons flux-attachment transformation to three dimensions through a combination of planar CS phases and Jordan-Wigner fermionization along vortex lines, we construct the CVLL state, characterized by nontrivial vortex-line excitations with topological properties. We develop an associated topological field theory in a curved spatial geometry and study the low-energy effective theory of the CVLL state. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we numerically determine the CVLL ground state's chemical potential for interacting bosons in cylindrical moat-band geometries and demonstrate that the CVLL phase energetically outcompetes traditional condensate phases at low densities, highlighting its relevance to experimental platforms including frustrated quantum magnets, ultracold atomic gases, physics of rotons in $^4$He, and moat regimes in heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Characterization of the chaotic phase in the tilted Bose-Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The chaotic phase of the tilted Bose-Hubbard model is identified as a function of energy, tilt strength and particle interaction, from the eigenstate structure and the statistical features of the energy spectrum. Our analysis reveals that the chaotic phase of the bare Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian can actually be enhanced by the presence of a moderate tilt. We further unveil the development and scaling of the chaotic regime from the perspective of a homogeneous density configuration typically used in cold atom experiments, providing a valuable phase diagram for future theoretical and experimental studies of this system.</description>

      <title>Measuring entanglement without local addressing in quantum many-body simulators via spiral quantum state tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16603v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum state tomography serves as a key tool for identifying quantum states generated in quantum computers and simulators, typically involving local operations on individual particles or qubits to enable independent measurements. However, this approach requires an exponentially larger number of measurement setups as quantum platforms grow in size, highlighting the necessity of more scalable methods to efficiently perform quantum state estimation. Here, we present a tomography scheme that scales far more efficiently and, remarkably, eliminates the need for local addressing of single constituents before measurements. Inspired by the ``spin-spiral'' structure in magnetic materials, our scheme combines a series of measurement setups, each with different spiraling patterns, with compressed sensing techniques. The results of the numerical simulations demonstrate a high degree of tomographic efficiency and accuracy. Additionally, we show how this method is suitable for the measurement of specific entanglement properties of interesting quantum many-body states, such as entanglement entropy, under various realistic experimental conditions. This method offers a positive outlook across a wide range of quantum platforms, including those in which precise individual operations are challenging, such as optical lattice systems.</description>

      <title>Vacancy-assisted superfluid drag</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00542v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study superfluid drag in the two-component Bose-Hubbard model with infinitely strong repulsive interactions. In this system, all transport is mediated by the motion of empty sites, or ``holes", and it is hard to move one component without moving the other. We demonstrate, with a combination of analytic and numeric techniques, that the motion of holes leads to strong dissipationless coupling between currents in the two components. This behavior is attributable to polaronic correlations that emerge in the presence of spin currents, which can be observed in experiments. We derive a closed-form expression for the coupling on various lattices in arbitrary spatial dimensions, which we verify through numerical simulations on two dimensional lattices.</description>

      <title>Double commutator method for a two band Bose-Einstein condensate: superfluid density of a flat band superfluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23656v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a double commutator method for a general two-band bosonic superfluid. First and foremost, we prove that the sum of the superfluid and normal densities is equal to the weight of the f-sum rule. This weight can be easily determined by analyzing the ground state wave function. Once we have determined the excitation gap of the upper band, we can calculate the normal density by evaluating the average value of a double commutator between the velocity operator and the Hamiltonian. As an application of this method, we investigate the superfluid density of a flat band Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). Using the Bogoliubov method, we calculate the sound velocity and excitation gap, which allows us to obtain the normal and superfluid densities explicitly. Our findings indicate that the superfluid density is directly proportional to the product of the square of the sound velocity and the compressibility. Furthermore, the existence of a non-vanishing superfluid density depends on the form of the interaction. For example, in the case of U(2) invariant interactions, the superfluid density is zero. Additionally, we have observed that for small interactions, the superfluid density is directly proportional to the product of the interaction parameter and the quantum metric. The double commutator method indicates that the correction of the excitation gap by interactions is the origin of the non-vanishing superfluid density of a flat band BEC. Up to the linear order of the interaction parameters, all the results for the excitation gap, the normal and superfluid densities in a flat band BEC can also be obtained through a simple perturbation theory. Our work provides another unique perspective on the superfluid behavior of a flat band BEC.</description>
