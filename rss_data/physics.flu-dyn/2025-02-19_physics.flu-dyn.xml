      <title>New Calculations of the Turbulence-Turbulence Contribution to the Wind Noise Pressure Spectra within Homogeneous Anisotropic Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The turbulence-turbulence interaction and the turbulence-shear interaction are the sources of intrinsic pressure fluctuation for wind noise generated by atmospheric turbulence. In previous research [Yu et al., J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 129(2), 622-632 (2011)], it was shown that the measured turbulent fields outdoors can be realistically modeled with Kraichnan's mirror flow model [Kraichnan, J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 28(3), 378-390 (1956)]. This paper applies Kraichnan's mirror flow idea to develop theory for calculating the turbulence-turbulence interaction wind noise pressure spectra within homogeneous anisotropic turbulence. New calculations of the turbulence-turbulence contribution to the wind noise pressure spectra by incorporating turbulence anisotropy are performed and compared to the result using the same approach but with isotropic input and the result of the turbulence-turbulence interaction pressure spectrum for homogeneous isotropic turbulence using George et al.'s method [George et al., J. Fluid Mech. 148, 155-191 (1984)]. We also evaluated different contributions to the turbulence-turbulence interaction pressure spectra using our approach with both anisotropic and isotropic inputs. Our results indicate that the turbulence anisotropy has small effect on the turbulence-turbulence interaction pressure in source region, but changes the spectral slope in inertial region to about -5/3. The turbulence-turbulence interaction pressure spectrum incorporating turbulence anisotropy is not sensitive to height. The F33F33 term and the F11F11 term are the most dominant contributions to the anisotropic turbulence pressure spectra in the source region and inertial region, respectively.</description>

      <title>Large-scale clustering of inertial particles in a rotating, stratified and inhomogeneous turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a theory of various kinds of large-scale clustering of inertial particles in a rotating density stratified or inhomogeneous turbulent fluid flows. The large-scale particle clustering occurs in scales which are much larger than the integral scale of turbulence, and it is described in terms of the effective pumping velocity in a turbulent flux of particles. We show that for a fast rotating strongly anisotropic turbulence, the large-scale clustering occurs in the plane perpendicular to rotation axis in the direction of the fluid density stratification. We apply the theory of the large-scale particle clustering for explanation of the formation of planetesimals (progenitors of planets) in accretion protoplanetary discs. We determine the radial profiles of the radial and azimuthal components of the effective pumping velocity of particles which have two maxima corresponding to different regimes of the particle--fluid interactions: at the small radius it is the Stokes regime, while at the larger radius it is the Epstein regime. With the decrease the particle radius, the distance between the maxima increases. This implies that smaller-size particles are concentrated nearby the central body of the accretion disk, while larger-size particles are accumulated far from the central body. The dynamic time of the particle clustering is about $\tau_{\rm dyn} \sim 10^5$--$10^6$ years, while the turbulent diffusion time is about $10^7$ years, that is much larger than the characteristic formation time of large-scale particle clusters ($\sim \tau_{\rm dyn}$).</description>

      <title>An a posteriori data-driven method for phase-averaged</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase-averaging is a fundamental approach for investigating periodic and non-stationary phenomena. In fluid dynamics, these can be generated by rotating blades such as propellers/turbines or by pulsed jets. Traditional phase-averaging approaches often rely on synchronized data acquisition systems, which might require high-speed cameras, light sources, and precise delay generators and encoders, making them expensive and sometimes unfeasible. This work proposes an a posteriori data-driven approach that reconstructs phase information from randomly acquired uncorrelated photographic frames (snapshots) using the ISOMAP algorithm. The technique enables accurate reordering of snapshots in the phase space and subsequent computation of the phase-averaged flow field without the need for synchronization. The framework was validated through numerical simulations and experimental fluid dynamics datasets from an optical setup featuring single- and multi-propeller configurations. The results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively captures the periodic flow characteristics while addressing the challenges related to synchronization and hardware limitations. Furthermore, the ability to apply this technique to archival datasets extends its applicability to a wide range of experimental fluid dynamics studies. This approach provides a scalable and cost-effective alternative to traditional methods for the analysis of periodic phenomena.</description>

      <title>Scientific Machine Learning of Flow Resistance Using Universal Shallow Water Equations with Differentiable Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shallow water equations (SWEs) are the backbone of most hydrodynamics models for flood prediction, river engineering, and many other water resources applications. The estimation of flow resistance, i.e., the Manning's roughness coefficient $n$, is crucial for ensuring model accuracy, and has been previously determined using empirical formulas or tables. To better account for temporal and spatial variability in channel roughness, inverse modeling of $n$ using observed flow data is more reliable and adaptable; however, it is challenging when using traditional SWE solvers. Based on the concept of universal differential equation (UDE), which combines physics-based differential equations with neural networks (NNs), we developed a universal SWEs (USWEs) solver, Hydrograd, for hybrid hydrodynamics modeling. It can do accurate forward simulations, support automatic differentiation (AD) for gradient-based sensitivity analysis and parameter inversion, and perform scientific machine learning for physics discovery. In this work, we first validated the accuracy of its forward modeling, then applied a real-world case to demonstrate the ability of USWEs to capture model sensitivity (gradients) and perform inverse modeling of Manning's $n$. Furthermore, we used a NN to learn a universal relationship between $n$, hydraulic parameters, and flow in a real river channel. Unlike inverse modeling using surrogate models, Hydrograd uses a two-dimensional SWEs solver as its physics backbone, which eliminates the need for data-intensive pretraining and resolves the generalization problem when applied to out-of-sample scenarios. This differentiable modeling approach, with seamless integration with NNs, provides a new pathway for solving complex inverse problems and discovering new physics in hydrodynamics.</description>

      <title>An unstructured block-based adaptive mesh refinement approach for explicit discontinuous Galerkin method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present paper, we present an adaptive mesh refinement(AMR) approach designed for the discontinuous Galerkin method for conservation laws. The block-based AMR is adopted to ensure the local data structure simplicity and the efficiency, while the unstructured topology of the initial blocks is supported by the forest concept such that the complex geometry of the computational domain can be easily treated. The inter-block communication through guardcells is introduced to avoid the direct treatment of flux computing between cells at different refinement levels. The sharp corners and creases generated during direct refinement can be avoided by projecting the boundary nodes to either the user-defined boundary surface function or the auto-generated NURBs. High-level MPI parallelization is implemented with dynamic load balancing through a space curve filling procedure. Some test cases are presented. As a result, ideal accuracy order and versatility in tracing and controlling the dynamic refinement are observed. Also, good parallelization efficiency is demonstrated.</description>

      <title>The evolution of nanoparticles due to Brownian coagulation in the temporal mixing layer with AK-iDNS over a long time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, the evolution of nanoparticles in a two-dimensional temporal mixing layer over a long time is investigated. the flow field is calculated with direct numerical simulation (DNS), while the particle field is simulated using the average kernel method coupled with iterative direct numerical simulation (AK-iDNS). Under moderate Reynolds number, the flow field undergoes processes of vortex emergence, entrainment, rolling and pairing, merging, and dissipation. Due to the small Stokes number of nanoparticles, and the particles moves closely following the flow field. Meanwhile, the particle undergoes coagulation under the influence of Brownian motion. This article discusses the evolution nanoparticle under the combined effect of advection, diffusion and coagulation. Under the influence of vortices or large-scale coherent structures, the spatial distribution of particle moments is similar to the structure of the flow field. And diffusion and coagulation have a significant impact on the amplitude of the distribution of particle moments. However, diffusion has little impact on the mean distribution, while coagulation has a much greater impact on the mean distribution. As the flow field evolves, the temporal mixing layer degenerates into Couette flow. The particles exhibit similar asymptotic behavior as that of 0-dimensional problem.</description>

      <title>A Numerical Investigation of Particle Deposition on a Substrate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The deposition of nanometer-scale particles is of significant interest in various industrial processes. While these particles offer several advantages, their deposition can have detrimental effects, such as reducing the heat transfer efficiency in nanofluid-based battery cooling systems. In this study, we investigated particle deposition around different square substrate configurations as well as experimentally obtained complex porous structure in a two-dimensional setup. The particles modeled as a concentration field using the lattice Boltzmann method, with a given external flow following a parabolic profile. Our results revealed that particle deposition around a substrate increases with higher fluid velocity, greater particle concentration, and higher deposition probability. Additionally, placing multiple number of substrates in the channel resulted in increased deposition on upstream substrates compared to downstream ones. As particle deposition around upstream substrates increases, it eventually obstructs the flow to downstream regions, thereby affecting the overall system performance. The insights gained from this simplified model of particle deposition will play a crucial role in advancing our understanding of deposition processes in complex systems.</description>

      <title>Finger properties in bounded double diffusive finger convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze experimental data on double diffusive convection in an electrochemical cell in the finger regime. All fingers in the experiments are bounded on at least one end by a solid wall. The properties of these fingers are compared with those of fingers in other experiments which are surrounded by fluid on all sides. The compositional boundary layers are found to be thinner than the finger width. The finger thickness agrees well with half the wavelength of the fastest growing mode obtained in linear stability analysis. The ion transport through the boundary layers is reduced by two orders of magnitude compared with unbounded fingers. The overturning layers in staircases contribute negligibly to salinity mixing because of efficient transport between finger layers and convection rolls.</description>

      <title>Fluid Motion Makes the Bottle-Flip Challenge Mechanically Unintuitive But Viable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The bottle-flip challenge -- the upright landing of a partially filled bottle after tossing and flipping it in the air -- unexpectedly became a viral mechanics exercise. Through high-speed visualization, we evidence that fluid content strongly affects the challenge mechanics at every stage. First, fluid motion hinders bottle rotation through water redistribution after release and, later, through jet impact during free flight. Water also attenuates the bounce at touchdown, which is crucial for challenge success. The fluid makes the mechanics unintuitive and yet builds up the challenge feasibility.</description>

      <title>Intermittency and Dissipation Regularity in Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We lay down a geometric-analytic framework to capture properties of energy dissipation within weak solutions to the incompressible Euler equations. For solutions with spatial Besov regularity, it is proved that the Duchon-Robert distribution has improved regularity in a negative Besov space and, in the case it is a Radon measure, it is absolutely continuous with respect to a suitable Hausdorff measure. This imposes quantitative constraints on the dimension of the, possibly fractal, dissipative set and the admissible structure functions exponents, relating to the phenomenon of "intermittency" in turbulence. As a by-product of the approach, we also recover many known "Onsager singularity" type results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper extends the theoretical Euler-Poincar\'e framework for modelling ocean mixed layer dynamics. Through a symmetry-broken Lie group invariant variational principle, we derive a generalised Green-Naghdi equation with time dependent bathymetry, a complete Coriolis force, and inhomogeneity of the thermal buoyancy. The nature of the model derived here lends it a potential future application to wave dynamics generated by changes to the bathymetry.</description>

      <title>Non-monotonic emergence of order from chaos in turbulent thermo-acoustic fluid systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.08101v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Self-sustained order can emerge in complex systems due to internal feedback between coupled subsystems. Here, we present our discovery of a non-monotonic emergence of order amidst chaos in a turbulent thermo-acoustic fluid system. Fluctuations play a vital role in determining the dynamical state and transitions in a system. In this work, we use complex networks to encode jumps in amplitude scales owing to fluctuations as links between nodes representing amplitude bins. The number of possible amplitude transitions at a fixed timescale reflects the complexity of dynamics at that timescale. The network entropy quantifies the number of and uncertainty associated with such transitions. Using network entropy, we show that the uncertainty in fluctuations first increases and then decreases as the system transitions from chaos via intermittency to order. The competition between turbulence and nonlinear interactions leads to such non-monotonic emergence of order amidst chaos in turbulent thermo-acoustic fluid systems.</description>

      <title>Evaporation limited spreading of ethanol on rectangular porous strips: an experimental and theoretical investigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20776v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wicking is a widely studied process in both natural and artificial systems. In many industrial applications, such as heat pipes, the wicking liquid evaporates to regulate temperature effectively. This study focuses on a simpler scenario where liquid ethanol climbs a vertically oriented filter paper FP under laboratory conditions, facilitating mass loss through evaporation and inducing cooling. Three filter papers with different permeability values were used, and three diagnostic methods optical imaging, thermal imaging, and precision weighing were employed to understand the dynamics of the process. The results showed a steady state height Lc significantly lower than Jurins limit in all cases, indicating that evaporative mass loss, and not gravity, limits the process. For instance, the filter paper 1005FP, with a capillary radius of 59microm and an average pore size of 2.50microm, would reach a Jurins height of 9.6cm with ethanol if evaporation were not allowed. However, when evaporation occurred, the height reduced to 1.2cm, an eightfold decrease, a similar reduction by a factor of 3 was observed for 1004FP. Further, thermal imaging revealed a non constant temperature distribution along the filter paper, with an unusual temperature inversion near the middle of the wicking liquid. This observation led to an improvement of the Constant Evaporation Model CEM by Fries et al 2008 by accounting for the nonlinear behavior of evaporation rates varying with vertical position. This new model termed the Non-Constant Evaporation Model NCEM, tested two power-law relations for evaporation rates , both of which successfully captured the key features of the process.</description>

      <title>Statistical Methods and Modal Decompositions for Gridded and Scattered Data: Meshless Statistics and Meshless Data Driven Modal Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04765v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Statistical tools are crucial for studying and modeling turbulent flows, where chaotic velocity fluctuations span a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. Advances in image velocimetry, especially in tracking-based methods, now allow for high-speed, high-density particle image processing, enabling the collection of detailed 3D flow fields. This lecture provides a set of tutorials on processing such datasets to extract essential quantities like averages, second-order moments (turbulent stresses) and coherent patterns using modal decompositions such as the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD). After a brief review of the fundamentals of statistical and modal analysis, the lecture delves into the challenges of processing scattered data from tracking velocimetry, comparing it to traditional gridded-data approaches. It also covers research topics, including physics-based Radial Basis Function (RBF) regression for meshless computation of turbulent statistics and the definition of an RBF inner product, which enables meshless computation of data-driven decompositions. These include traditional methods like Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) and Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD), as well as advanced variants such as Spectral POD (SPOD) and Multiscale POD (mPOD). We refer to this approach as the "Meshless Data-Driven Decomposition" framework. All codes are available at https://github.com/mendezVKI/PIV_LS_2024_Signal</description>

Abstract: Supersonic flow is a typical nonlinear, nonequilibrium, multiscale, and complex phenomenon. This paper applies discrete Boltzmann method/model (DBM) to simulate and analyze these characteristics. A Burnett-level DBM for supersonic flow is constructed based on the Shakhov-BGK model. Higher-order analytical expressions for thermodynamic nonequilibrium effects are derived, providing a constitutive basis for improving traditional macroscopic hydrodynamics modeling. Criteria for evaluating the validity of DBM are established by comparing numerical and analytical solutions of nonequilibrium measures. The multiscale DBM is used to investigate discrete/nonequilibrium characteristics and entropy production mechanisms in shock regular reflection. The findings include: (a) Compared to NS-level DBM, the Burnett-level DBM offers more accurate representations of viscous stress and heat flux, ensures non-negativity of entropy production in accordance with the second law of thermodynamics, and exhibits better numerical stability. (b) Near the interfaces of incident and reflected shock waves, strong nonequilibrium driving forces lead to prominent nonequilibrium effects. By monitoring the timing and location of peak nonequilibrium quantities, the evolution characteristics of incident and reflected shock waves can be accurately and dynamically tracked. (c) In the intermediate state, the bent reflected shock and incident shock interface are wider and exhibit lower nonequilibrium intensities compared to their final state. (d) The Mach number enhances various kinds of nonequilibrium intensities in a power-law manner $D_{mn} \sim \mathtt{Ma}^\alpha $. The power exponent $\alpha$ and kinetic modes of nonequilibrium effects $m$ follows a logarithmic relation $\alpha \sim \ln (m - m_0)$. This research provides new perspectives and kinetic insights into supersonic flow studies.</description>

Abstract: We construct 2D viscous flow sourced by a point vortex embedded in a thin tubular membrane, coupled to external embedding fluids. The cylinder topology enforces the creation of an additional saddle in the flow field, consistent with Poincar\'e Index Theorem. In this setup, the incompressibility of the membrane fluid can be utilized to cast the dynamics of a multi-vortex system in the form of a Hamiltonian on the cylinder, which depends on the fluid viscosities and vortex strengths. The cylinder geometry breaks the in-plane rotational symmetry of the membrane and leads to several interesting features in the multi-vortex dynamics, distinct from flat and spherical fluid membranes. For a two vortex system of same circulation, we observe closed orbits with the inter-vortex separation oscillating in time. The compact angular direction of the membrane tube also allows two distinct closed orbits instead of one, under suitable initial conditions. Vortex pairs (vortices with opposite circulation) move together along helical geodesics in accordance with a conjecture by Kimura, Proceedings of the Royal Society A, Vol 455 (1999). We also explore relative equilibria of multi-vortex systems in this setup and demonstrate vortex leapfrogging via numerical simulations. Our results will be interesting in the context of microfluidic flows arising in nature as well as experimental studies in membrane tubes similar to PNAS 108 (31) 12605-12610 (2011).</description>
