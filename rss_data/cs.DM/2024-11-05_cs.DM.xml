      <title>Approximating Diffusion on Finite Multi-Topology Systems Using Ultrametrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by multi-topology building and city model data, first a lossless representation of multiple $T_0$-topologies on a given finite set by a vertex-edge-weighted graph is given, and the subdominant ultrametric of the associated weighted graph distance matrix is proposed as an index structure for these data. This is applied in a heuristic parallel topological sort algorithm for edge-weighted directed acyclic graphs. Such structured data are of interest in simulation of processes like heat flows on building or city models on distributed processors. With this in view, the bulk of this article calculates the spectra of certain unbounded self-adjoint $p$-adic Laplacian operators on the $L^2$-spaces of a compact open subdomain of the $p$-adic number field associated with a finite graph $G$ with respect to the restricted Haar measure. as well as to a Radon measure coming from an ultrametric on the vertices of $G$ with the help of $p$-adic polynomial interpolation. In the end, error bounds are given for the solutions of the corresponding heat equations by finite approximations of such operators.</description>

      <title>A Bellman-Ford algorithm for the path-length-weighted distance in graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider a finite directed graph without cycles in which the arrows are weighted. We present an algorithm for the computation of a new distance, called path-length-weighted distance, which has proven useful for graph analysis in the context of fraud detection. The idea is that the new distance explicitly takes into account the size of the paths in the calculations. Thus, although our algorithm is based on arguments similar to those at work for the Bellman-Ford and Dijkstra methods, it is in fact essentially different. We lay out the appropriate framework for its computation, showing the constraints and requirements for its use, along with some illustrative examples.</description>

      <title>Cyclic ordering of split matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is a long list of open questions rooted in the same underlying problem: understanding the structure of bases or common bases of matroids. These conjectures suggest that matroids may possess much stronger structural properties than are currently known. One example is related to cyclic orderings of matroids. A rank-$r$ matroid is called cyclically orderable if its ground set admits a cyclic ordering such that any interval of $r$ consecutive elements forms a basis. In this paper, we show that if the ground set of a split matroid decomposes into pairwise disjoint bases, then it is cyclically orderable. This result answers a conjecture of Kajitani, Ueno, and Miyano in a special case, and also strengthens Gabow's conjecture for this class of matroids. Our proof is algorithmic, hence it provides a procedure for determining a cyclic ordering in question using a polynomial number of independence oracle calls.</description>

      <title>Filling some gaps on the edge coloring problem of split graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A split graph is a graph whose vertex set can be partitioned into a clique and an independent set. A connected graph $G$ is said to be $t$-admissible if admits a spanning tree in which the distance between any two adjacent vertices of $G$ is at most $t$. Given a graph $G$, determining the smallest $t$ for which $G$ is $t$-admissible, i.e., the stretch index of $G$ denoted by $\sigma(G)$, is the goal of the $t$-admissibility problem. Split graphs are $3$-admissible and can be partitioned into three subclasses: split graphs with $\sigma = 1$, $2$ or $3$. In this work we consider such a partition while dealing with the problem of coloring the edges of a split graph. Vizing proved that any graph can have its edges colored with $\Delta$ or $\Delta+1$ colors, and thus can be classified as Class $1$ or Class $2$, respectively. The edge coloring problem is open for split graphs in general. In previous results, we classified split graphs with $\sigma = 2$ and in this paper we classify and provide an algorithm to color the edges of a subclass of split graphs with $\sigma = 3$.</description>

      <title>Reducing Data Fragmentation in Data Deduplication Systems via Partial Repetition and Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data deduplication, one of the key features of modern Big Data storage devices, is the process of removing replicas of data chunks stored by different users. Despite the importance of deduplication, several drawbacks of the method, such as storage robustness and file fragmentation, have not been previously analyzed from a theoretical point of view. Storage robustness pertains to ensuring that deduplicated data can be used to reconstruct the original files without service disruptions and data loss. Fragmentation pertains to the problems of placing deduplicated data chunks of different user files in a proximity-preserving linear order, since neighboring chunks of the same file may be stored in sectors far apart on the server. This work proposes a new theoretical model for data fragmentation and introduces novel graph- and coding-theoretic approaches for reducing fragmentation via limited duplication (repetition coding) and coded deduplication (e.g., linear coding). In addition to alleviating issues with fragmentation, limited duplication and coded deduplication can also serve the dual purpose of increasing the robusteness of the system design. The contributions of our work are three-fold. First, we describe a new model for file structures in the form of self-avoiding (simple) paths in specialized graphs. Second, we introduce several new metrics for measuring the fragmentation level in deduplication systems on graph-structured files, including the stretch metric that captures the worst-case "spread" of adjacent data chunks within a file when deduplicated and placed on the server; and, the jump metric that captures the worst-case number of times during the reconstruction process of a file that one has to change the readout location on the server. For the stretch metric, we establish a connection between the level of fragmentation and the bandwidth of the file-graph. In particular, ...</description>

      <title>The Gap Between Greedy Algorithm and Minimum Multiplicative Spanner</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The greedy algorithm adapted from Kruskal's algorithm is an efficient and folklore way to produce a $k$-spanner with girth at least $k+2$. The greedy algorithm has shown to be `existentially optimal', while it's not `universally optimal' for any constant $k$. Here, `universal optimality' means an algorithm can produce the smallest $k$-spanner $H$ given any $n$-vertex input graph $G$.
  However, how well the greedy algorithm works compared to `universal optimality' is still unclear for superconstant $k:=k(n)$. In this paper, we aim to give a new and fine-grained analysis of this problem in undirected unweighted graph setting. Specifically, we show some bounds on this problem including the following two
  (1) On the negative side, when $k&lt;\frac{1}{3}n-O(1)$, the greedy algorithm is not `universally optimal'.
  (2) On the positive side, when $k&gt;\frac{2}{3}n+O(1)$, the greedy algorithm is `universally optimal'.
  We also introduce an appropriate notion for `approximately universal optimality'. An algorithm is $(\alpha,\beta)$-universally optimal iff given any $n$-vertex input graph $G$, it can produce a $k$-spanner $H$ of $G$ with size $|H|\leq n+\alpha(|H^*|-n)+\beta$, where $H^*$ is the smallest $k$-spanner of $G$. We show the following positive bounds.
  (1) When $k&gt;\frac{4}{7}n+O(1)$, the greedy algorithm is $(2,O(1))$-universally optimal.
  (2) When $k&gt;\frac{12}{23}n+O(1)$, the greedy algorithm is $(18,O(1))$-universally optimal.
  (3) When $k&gt;\frac{1}{2}n+O(1)$, the greedy algorithm is $(32,O(1))$-universally optimal.
  All our proofs are constructive building on new structural analysis on spanners. We give some ideas about how to break small cycles in a spanner to increase the girth. These ideas may help us to understand the relation between girth and spanners.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: N. G. de Bruijn (1958) studied the asymptotic expansion of iterates of sin$(x)$ with $0 &lt; x \leq \pi/2$. Bencherif &amp; Robin (1994) generalized this result to increasing analytic functions $f(x)$ with an attractive fixed point at 0 and $x &gt; 0$ suitably small. Mavecha &amp; Laohakosol (2013) formulated an algorithm for explicitly deriving required parameters. We review their method, testing it initally on the logistic function $\ell(x)$, a certain radical function $r(x)$, and later on several transcendental functions. Along the way, we show how $\ell(x)$ and $r(x)$ are kindred functions; the same is also true for sin$(x)$ and arcsinh$(x)$.</description>

      <title>Optimal Inapproximability of Promise Equations over Finite Groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A celebrated result of Hastad established that, for any constant $\varepsilon&gt;0$, it is NP-hard to find an assignment satisfying a $(1/|G|+\varepsilon)$-fraction of the constraints of a given 3-LIN instance over an Abelian group $G$ even if one is promised that an assignment satisfying a $(1-\varepsilon)$-fraction of the constraints exists. Engebretsen, Holmerin, and Russell showed the same result for 3-LIN instances over any finite (not necessarily Abelian) group. In other words, for almost-satisfiable instances of 3-LIN the random assignment achieves an optimal approximation guarantee. We prove that the random assignment algorithm is still best possible under a stronger promise that the 3-LIN instance is almost satisfiable over an arbitrarily more restrictive group.</description>

Abstract: A vertex coloring $\varphi$ of a graph $G$ is $p$-centered if for every connected subgraph $H$ of $G$, either $\varphi$ uses more than $p$ colors on $H$, or there is a color that appears exactly once on $H$. We prove that for every fixed positive integer $t$, every $K_t$-minor-free graph admits a $p$-centered coloring using $\mathcal{O}(p^{t-1})$ colors.</description>

      <title>Facet-Hamiltonicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider facet-Hamiltonian cycles of polytopes, defined as cycles in their skeleton such that every facet is visited exactly once. These cycles can be understood as optimal watchman routes that guard the facets of a polytope. We consider the existence of such cycles for a variety of polytopes, the facets of which have a natural combinatorial interpretation. In particular, we prove the following results:
  - Every permutahedron has a facet-Hamiltonian cycle. These cycles consist of circular sequences of permutations of $n$ elements, where two successive permutations differ by a single adjacent transposition, and such that every subset of $[n]$ appears as a prefix in a contiguous subsequence. With these cycles we associate what we call rhombic strips which encode interleaved Gray codes of the Boolean lattice, one Gray code for each rank. These rhombic strips correspond to simple Venn diagrams.
  - Every generalized associahedron has a facet-Hamiltonian cycle. This generalizes the so-called rainbow cycles of Felsner, Kleist, M\"utze, and Sering (SIDMA 2020) to associahedra of any finite type. We relate the constructions to the Conway-Coxeter friezes and the bipartite belts of finite type cluster algebras.
  - Graph associahedra of wheels, fans, and complete split graphs have facet-Hamiltonian cycles. For associahedra of complete bipartite graphs and caterpillars, we construct facet-Hamiltonian paths. The construction involves new insights on the combinatorics of graph tubings.
  We also consider the computational complexity of deciding whether a given polytope has a facet-Hamiltonian cycle and show that the problem is NP-complete, even when restricted to simple 3-dimensional polytopes.</description>

      <title>Matroid products via submodular coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of matroid products traces back to the 1970s, when Lov\'asz and Mason studied the existence of various types of matroid products with different strengths. Among these, the tensor product is arguably the most important, which can be considered as an extension of the tensor product from linear algebra. However, Las Vergnas showed that the tensor product of two matroids does not always exist. Over the following four decades, matroid products remained surprisingly underexplored, regaining attention only in recent years due to applications in tropical geometry and the limit theory of matroids.
  In this paper, inspired by the concept of coupling in probability theory, we introduce the notion of coupling for matroids -- or, more generally, for submodular set functions. This operation can be viewed as a relaxation of the tensor product. Unlike the tensor product, however, we prove that a coupling always exists for any two submodular functions and can be chosen to be increasing if the original functions are increasing. As a corollary, we show that two matroids always admit a matroid coupling, leading to a novel operation on matroids. Our construction is algorithmic, providing an oracle for the coupling matroid through a polynomial number of oracle calls to the original matroids.
  We apply this construction to derive new necessary conditions for matroid representability and establish connection between tensor products and Ingleton's inequality. Additionally, we verify the existence of set functions that are universal with respect to a given property, meaning any set function over a finite domain with that property can be obtained as a quotient.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we first study hypergraph rewriting in categorical terms in an attempt to define the notion of events and develop foundations of causality in graph rewriting. We introduce novel concepts within the framework of double-pushout rewriting in adhesive categories. Secondly, we will study the notion of events in $\lambda-$calculus, wherein we construct an algorithm to determine causal relations between events following the evaluation of a $\lambda-$expression satisfying certain conditions. Lastly, we attempt to extend this definition to arbitrary $\lambda-$expressions.</description>

Abstract: In 2009, Shur published the following conjecture: Let $L$ be a power-free language and let $e(L)\subseteq L$ be the set of words of $L$ that can be extended to a bi-infinite word respecting the given power-freeness. If $u, v \in e(L)$ then $uwv \in e(L)$ for some word $w$. Let $L_{k,\alpha}$ denote an $\alpha$-power free language over an alphabet with $k$ letters, where $\alpha$ is a positive rational number and $k$ is positive integer. We prove the conjecture for the languages $L_{k,\alpha}$, where $\alpha\geq 5$ and $k\geq 3$.</description>

Abstract: Prophet inequalities are a central object of study in optimal stopping theory. In the iid model, a gambler sees values in an online fashion, sampled independently from a given distribution. Upon observing each value, the gambler either accepts it as a reward or irrevocably rejects it and proceeds to observe the next value. The goal of the gambler, who cannot see the future, is maximising the expected value of the reward while competing against the expectation of a prophet (the offline maximum). In other words, one seeks to maximise the gambler-to-prophet ratio of the expectations.
  This model has been studied with infinite, finite and unknown number of values. When the gambler faces a random number of values, the model is said to have random horizon. We consider the model in which the gambler is given a priori knowledge of the horizon's distribution. Alijani et al. (2020) designed a single-threshold algorithms achieving a ratio of $1/2$ when the random horizon has an increasing hazard rate and is independent of the values. We prove that with a single-threshold, a ratio of $1/2$ is actually achievable for several larger classes of horizon distributions, with the largest being known as the $\mathcal{G}$ class in reliability theory. Moreover, we extend this result to its dual, the $\overline{\mathcal{G}}$ class (which includes the decreasing hazard rate class), and to low-variance horizons. Finally, we construct the first example of a family of horizons, for which multiple thresholds are necessary to achieve a nonzero ratio. We establish that the Secretary Problem optimal stopping rule provides one such algorithm, paving the way towards the study of the model beyond single-threshold algorithms.</description>

      <title>Palette Sparsification for Graphs with Sparse Neighborhoods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08256</link>

Abstract: A seminal palette sparsification result of Assadi, Chen, and Khanna states that in every $n$-vertex graph of maximum degree $\Delta$, sampling $\Theta(\log n)$ colors per vertex from $\{1, \ldots, \Delta+1\}$ almost certainly allows for a proper coloring from the sampled colors. Alon and Assadi extended this work proving a similar result for $O\left(\Delta/\log \Delta\right)$-coloring triangle-free graphs. Apart from being interesting results from a combinatorial standpoint, their results have various applications to the design of graph coloring algorithms in different models of computation. In this work, we focus on locally sparse graphs, i.e., graphs with sparse neighborhoods. We say a graph $G = (V, E)$ is $k$-locally-sparse if for each vertex $v \in V$, the subgraph $G[N(v)]$ contains at most $k$ edges. A celebrated result of Alon, Krivelevich, and Sudakov shows that such graphs are $O(\Delta/\log (\Delta/\sqrt{k}))$-colorable. For any $\alpha \in (0, 1)$ and $k \ll \Delta^{2\alpha}$, let $G$ be a $k$-locally-sparse graph. For $q = \Theta\left(\Delta/\log \left(\Delta^\alpha/\sqrt{k}\right)\right)$, we show that sampling $O\left(\Delta^\alpha + \sqrt{\log n}\right)$ colors per vertex is sufficient to obtain a proper $q$-coloring of $G$ from the sampled colors. Setting $k = 1$ recovers the aforementioned result of Alon and Assadi for triangle-free graphs. A key element in our proof is a proposition regarding correspondence coloring in the so-called color-degree setting, which improves upon recent work of Anderson, Kuchukova, and the author and is of independent interest.</description>
