      <title>Non-Abelian Fourier Transforms and Normalized Intertwining Operators for General Parabolics over Finite Fields, and the Kloosterman Fourier Transform for Quadric Cones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a (split) reductive group over $\mathbb{F}_q$, and let $M$ be a standard Levi subgroup of $G$. Consider $P$ and $P'$ parabolics in $G$, containing $M$, with Levi factor $M$. we let $U = R_u(P)$ (resp., $U' = R_u(P')$) denote the unipotent radical; and we denote by $\overline{G/U}$ (resp., $\overline{G/U'}$) the affinization of the corresponding homogeneous space. Extending the work of Braverman-Kazhdan ( arXiv:9809.112 , arXiv:0206.119 ) to general parabolic basic affine (or ``paraspherical") space, we propose a construction for certain intertwining operators $F_{P',P}: S(\overline{G/U}(\mathbb{F}_q), \mathbb{C}) \to S(\overline{G/U'}(\mathbb{F}_q), \mathbb{C})$ for a suitable function spaces $S$, defined via kernels analogous to those appearing (loc. cit.). We then study the extent to which these intertwiners are normalized. We show that, for opposite $(n-1)+1$ parabolics of $\textrm{SL}_n$, our transform reduces to the classical linear Fourier transform; and that, for opposite unipotents in $\textrm{SL}_3$ or opposite Siegel parabolics in $\textrm{Sp}_4$, our transforms are given by a Fourier transform on a quadric cone (with kernel coming from a Kloosterman sum). We prove Fourier inversion for this transform on (a natural subclass of) functions on the quadric cone, establishing a finite-field analogue of the quadric Fourier transform of Gurevich-Kazhdan arXiv:2304.13993 and Getz-Hsu-Leslie arXiv:2103.10261.</description>

      <title>$\tau$-tilting theory via the morphism category of projective modules I: ICE-closed subcategories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper endeavors to explore certain distinguished modules and subcategories within mod$\Lambda$. Let $\mathrm{proj}\mbox{-}\Lambda$ denote the category of all finitely generated projective $\Lambda$-modules and define $\mathcal{P}(\Lambda):=\mathrm{Mor}(\mathrm{proj}\mbox{-}\Lambda)$. Due to the favorable homological properties of $\mathcal{P}(\Lambda)$, we initially examine several noteworthy objects and subcategories of $\mathcal{P}(\Lambda)$, subsequently relating these findings to ${\rm mod}\Lambda$. We demonstrate the existence of a bijection between tilting objects of $\mathcal{P}(\Lambda)$ and support $\tau$-tilting $\Lambda$-modules. This bijection further suggests a correspondence between tilting objects of $\mathcal{P}(\Lambda)$ that possess a specific direct summand and $\tau$-tilting $\Lambda$-modules. We establish a bijection between two-term silting complexes within $\mathbb{K}^{b}({\rm proj}\mbox{-}\Lambda)$ and tilting objects of $\mathcal{P}(\Lambda)$. Following our examination of Image-Cokernel-Extension closed (hereafter referred to as ICE-closed) subcategories of $\mathcal{P}(\Lambda)$, we demonstrate a bijection between rigid objects in $\mathcal{P}(\Lambda)$ and ICE-closed subcategories of $\mathcal{P}(\Lambda)$ with enough Ext-projectives. Subsequently, we present bijections linking rigid objects in $\mathcal{P}(\Lambda)$ with a designated direct summand, $\tau$-rigid pairs within ${\rm mod}\Lambda$, and ICE-closed subcategories of $\mathcal{P}(\Lambda)$ that contain a special object and also have enough Ext-projectives. In order to translate the concept of ICE-closed subcategory from $\mathcal{P}(\Lambda)$ to ${\rm mod}\Lambda$, it is necessary to introduce the framework of ICE-closed subcategories of ${\rm mod}\Lambda$ relative to a projective module.</description>

      <title>A remark on s-torsion pairs and on the lattice of Dyck paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There are three classical lattices on the Catalan numbers: the Tamari lattice, the lattice of noncrossing partitions and the lattice of Dyck paths. The first is known to be isomorphic to the lattice of torsion classes of the path algebra of an equioriented quiver of type $A$ and the second is known to be isomorphic to its lattice of wide subcategories. Inspired by the notion of s-torsion classes of Adachi, Enomoto and Tsukamoto, in this short note we interpret the lattice of Dyck paths as a lattice of subcategories.</description>

      <title>Local transfer for quasi-split classical groups and congruences mod l</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.04532v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let G be the group of rational points of a quasi-split p-adic special orthogonal, symplectic or unitary group for some odd prime number p. FollowingArthur and Mok, there are a positive integer N, a p-adic field E and a local functorial transfer from isomorphism classes of irreducible smooth complex representations of G to those of GL(N,E). By fixing a prime number l different from p and an isomorphism between the field of complex numbers and an algebraic closure of the field of l-adic numbers, we obtain a transfer map between representations with l-adic coefficients. Now consider a cuspidal irreducible l-adic representation pi of G: we can define its reduction mod l, which is a semi-simple smooth representation of G of finite length, with coefficients in a field of characteristic l. Let pi' be a cuspidal irreducible l-adic representation of G whose reduction mod l is isomorphic to that of pi. We prove that the transfers of pi and pi' have reductions mod l which may not be isomorphic, but which have isomorphic supercuspidal supports. When G is not the split special orthogonal group SO(2), we further prove that the reductions mod l of the transfers of pi and pi' share a unique common generic component.</description>

      <title>Decomposition of higher Deligne-Lusztig representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06430v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Higher Deligne-Lusztig representations are virtual smooth representations of parahoric subgroups in a $p$-adic group. They are natural analogs of classical Deligne-Lusztig representations of reductive groups over finite fields. The most interesting higher Deligne-Lusztig representations are those attached to elliptic maximal tori, whose compact inductions are expected to realize supercuspidal representations of $p$-adic groups. Under a mild condition on $p$, in this paper we establish an explicit decomposition of these higher Deligne-Lusztig representations into irreducible summands. Surprisingly, all the irreducible summands are built in the same way as those in Yu's construction of irreducible supercuspidal representations, the only difference being that the Weil-Heisenberg representations in Yu's construction are replaced by their geometric analogs. As an application, we show that each irreducible supercuspidal representation of a $p$-adic group, attached to an unramified cuspidal datum, is a direct summand of the compact induction of a suitable higher Deligne-Lusztig representation, whenever the cardinality of the residue field of the $p$-adic field is not too small.</description>

      <title>$\mathscr{D}$-modules on the basic affine space and large $\mathfrak{g}$-modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07279v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we treat $\mathscr{D}$-modules on the basic affine space $G/U$ and their global sections for a semisimple complex algebraic group $G$. Our aim is to prepare basic results about large non-irreducible modules for the branching problem and harmonic analysis of reductive Lie groups. A main tool is a formula given by Bezrukavnikov--Braverman--Positselskii. The formula is about a product of functions and their Fourier transforms on $G/U$ like Capelli's identity. Using the formula, we give a generalization of the Beilinson--Bernstein correspondence.
  We show that the global sections of holonomic $\mathscr{D}$-modules are also holonomic using the formula. As a consequence, we give a large algebra action on the $\mathfrak{u}$-cohomologies $H^i(\mathfrak{u}; V)$ of a $\mathfrak{g}$-module $V$ when $V$ is realized as a holonomic $\mathscr{D}$-module. We consider affinity of the supports of the $\mathfrak{t}$-modules $H^i(\mathfrak{u}; V)$.</description>

      <title>Triangular Prism Equations and Categorification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.06522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.06522v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the triangular prism equations for fusion categories, demonstrating their equivalence to the pentagon equations in the spherical case, modulo a change of basis. These equations offer valuable insights for managing complexity through localization. Additionally, we establish an enhanced version of Z. Wang's conjecture regarding the second Frobenius-Schur indicator in pivotal fusion categories. As applications, we introduce new categorification criteria and complete the classification of unitary 1-Frobenius simple integral fusion categories up to rank 8 and up to FPdim 20000.</description>
