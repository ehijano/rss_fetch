      <title>News Media as Suppliers of Narratives (and Information)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a model of news media that shape consumer beliefs by providing information (signals about an exogenous state) and narratives (models of what determines outcomes). To amplify consumers' engagement, media maximize consumers' anticipatory utility. Focusing on a class of separable consumer preferences, we show that a monopolistic media platform facing homogenous consumers provides a false "empowering" narrative coupled with an optimistically biased signal. Consumer heterogeneity gives rise to a novel menu-design problem due to a "data externality" among consumers. The optimal menu features multiple narratives and creates polarized beliefs. These effects also arise in a competitive media market model.</description>

      <title>Artificial Bugs for Crowdsearch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bug bounty programs, where external agents are invited to search and report vulnerabilities (bugs) in exchange for rewards (bounty), have become a major tool for companies to improve their systems. We suggest augmenting such programs by inserting artificial bugs to increase the incentives to search for real (organic) bugs. Using a model of crowdsearch, we identify the efficiency gains by artificial bugs, and we show that for this, it is sufficient to insert only one artificial bug. Artificial bugs are particularly beneficial, for instance, if the designer places high valuations on finding organic bugs or if the budget for bounty is not sufficiently high. We discuss how to implement artificial bugs and outline their further benefits.</description>

      <title>Language-based game theory in the age of artificial intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding human behaviour in decision problems and strategic interactions has wide-ranging applications in economics, psychology, and artificial intelligence. Game theory offers a robust foundation for this understanding, based on the idea that individuals aim to maximize a utility function. However, the exact factors influencing strategy choices remain elusive. While traditional models try to explain human behaviour as a function of the outcomes of available actions, recent experimental research reveals that linguistic content significantly impacts decision-making, thus prompting a paradigm shift from outcome-based to language-based utility functions. This shift is more urgent than ever, given the advancement of generative AI, which has the potential to support humans in making critical decisions through language-based interactions. We propose sentiment analysis as a fundamental tool for this shift and take an initial step by analyzing 61 experimental instructions from the dictator game, an economic game capturing the balance between self-interest and the interest of others, which is at the core of many social interactions. Our meta-analysis shows that sentiment analysis can explain human behaviour beyond economic outcomes. We discuss future research directions. We hope this work sets the stage for a novel game theoretical approach that emphasizes the importance of language in human decisions.</description>

      <title>The method of Enestr\"om and Phragm\'en for parliamentary elections by means of approval voting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.10590</link>
      <description>arXiv:1907.10590v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a method for proportional representation that was proposed at the turn from the nineteenth to the twentieth century by Gustav Enestr\"om and Edvard Phragm\'en. Like Phragm\'en's better-known iterative minimax method, it is assumed that the voters express themselves by means of approval voting. In contrast to the iterative minimax method, however, here one starts by fixing a quota, i.e. the number of votes that give the right to a seat. As a matter of fact, the method of Enestr\"om and Phragm\'en can be seen as an extension of the method of largest remainders from closed lists to open lists, or also as an adaptation of the single transferable vote to approval rather than preferential voting. The properties of this method are studied and compared with those of other methods of the same kind.</description>

      <title>Comparative statics with adjustment costs and the le Chatelier principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.00347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.00347v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a theory of monotone comparative statics for models with adjustment costs. We show that comparative-statics conclusions may be drawn under the usual ordinal complementarity assumptions on the objective function, assuming very little about costs: only a mild monotonicity condition is required. We use this insight to prove a general le Chatelier principle: under the ordinal complementarity assumptions, if short-run adjustment is subject to a monotone cost, then the long-run response to a shock is greater than the short-run response. We extend these results to a fully dynamic model of adjustment over time: the le Chatelier principle remains valid, and under slightly stronger assumptions, optimal adjustment follows a monotone path. We apply our results to models of saving, production, pricing, labor supply and investment.</description>

      <title>Community Enforcement with Endogenous Records</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00839v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I study repeated games with anonymous random matching where players can erase signals from their records. When players are sufficiently long-lived and have strictly dominant actions, they will play their dominant actions with probability close to one in all equilibria. When players' expected lifespans are intermediate, there exist purifiable equilibria with a positive level of cooperation in the submodular prisoner's dilemma but not in the supermodular prisoner's dilemma. Therefore, the maximal level of cooperation a community can sustain is not monotone with respect to players' expected lifespans and the complementarity in players' actions can undermine their abilities to sustain cooperation.</description>

      <title>Temporary exclusion in repeated contests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06257v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider a population of agents who repeatedly compete for awards, as in the case of researchers annually applying for grants. Noise in the selection process may encourage entry of low quality proposals, forcing the principal to commit large resources to reviewing applications and further increasing award misallocation. A \emph{temporary exclusion} policy prohibits an agent from applying in the current period if they were rejected in the previous, encouraging self-selection. We compare the steady-state equilibria of the games with and without exclusion. Whenever the benefit from winning is large, exclusion leads to fewer low-quality applications and higher welfare for agents.</description>

      <title>Fuzzy Classification Aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17620v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem where a set of individuals has to classify $m$ objects into $p$ categories and does so by aggregating the individual classifications. We show that if $m\geq 3$, $m\geq p\geq 2$, and classifications are fuzzy, that is, objects belong to a category to a certain degree, then an independent aggregator rule that satisfies a weak unanimity condition belongs to the family of Weighted Arithmetic Means. We also obtain characterization results for $m= p= 2$.</description>
