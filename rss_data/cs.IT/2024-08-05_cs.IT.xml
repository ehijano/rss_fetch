      <title>Quantification and Validation for Degree of Understanding in M2M Semantic Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, network communications based on the Shannon-Nyquist theorem gradually reveal their limitations due to the neglect of semantic information in the transmitted content. Semantic communication (SemCom) provides a solution for extracting information meanings from the transmitted content. The semantic information can be successfully interpreted by a receiver with the help of a shared knowledge base (KB). This paper proposes a two-stage hierarchical qualification and validation model for natural language-based machine-to-machine (M2M) SemCom. The approach can be applied in various applications, such as autonomous driving and edge computing. In the proposed model, we quantitatively measure the degree of understanding (DoU) between two communication parties at the word and sentence levels. The DoU is validated and ensured at each level before moving to the next step. The model's effectiveness is verified through a series of experiments, and the results show that the quantification and validation method proposed in this paper can significantly improve the DoU of inter-machine SemCom.</description>

      <title>A Primer on Near-Field Communications for Next-Generation Multiple Access</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00952v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiple-antenna technologies are advancing toward the development of extremely large aperture arrays and the utilization of extremely high frequencies, driving the progress of next-generation multiple access (NGMA). This evolution is accompanied by the emergence of near-field communications (NFC), characterized by spherical-wave propagation, which introduces additional range dimensions to the channel and enhances system throughput. In this context, a tutorial-based primer on NFC is presented, emphasizing its applications in multiuser communications and multiple access (MA). The following areas are investigated: \romannumeral1) the commonly used near-field channel models are reviewed along with their simplifications under various near-field conditions. \romannumeral2) Building upon these models, the information-theoretic capacity limits of NFC-MA are analyzed, including the derivation of sum-rate capacity and capacity region, and their upper limits for both downlink and uplink scenarios. \romannumeral3) A detailed investigation of near-field multiuser beamforming design is presented, offering low-complexity and effective NFC-MA design methodologies in both the spatial and wavenumber (angular) domains. Throughout these investigations, near-field MA is compared with its far-field counterpart to highlight its superiority and flexibility in terms of interference management, thereby laying the groundwork for achieving NGMA.</description>

      <title>Modeling Interfering Sources in Shared Queues for Timely Computations in Edge Computing Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most existing stochastic models on age of information (AoI) focus on a single shared server serving status update packets from $N&gt;1$ sources where each packet update stream is Poisson, i.e., single-hop scenario. In the current work, we study a two-hop edge computing system for which status updates from the information sources are still Poisson but they are not immediately available at the shared edge server, but instead they need to first receive service from a transmission server dedicated to each source. For exponentially distributed and heterogeneous service times for both the dedicated servers and the edge server, and bufferless preemptive resource management, we develop an analytical model using absorbing Markov chains (AMC) for obtaining the distribution of AoI for any source in the system. Moreover, for a given tagged source, the traffic arriving at the shared server from the $N-1$ un-tagged sources, namely the interference traffic, is not Poisson any more, but is instead a Markov modulated Poisson process (MMPP) whose state space grows exponentially with $N$. Therefore, we propose to employ a model reduction technique that approximates the behavior of the MMPP interference traffic with two states only, making it possible to approximately obtain the AoI statistics even for a very large number of sources. Numerical examples are presented to validate the proposed exact and approximate models.</description>

      <title>Spike Talk: Genesis and Neural Coding Scheme Translations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although digitalization of future power grids offer several coordination incentives, the reliability and security of information and communication technologies (ICT) hinders its overall performance. In this paper, we introduce a novel architecture Spike Talk via a unified representation of power and information as a means of data normalization using spikes for coordinated control of microgrids. This grid-edge technology allows each distributed energy resource (DER) to execute decentralized secondary control philosophy independently by interacting among each other using power flow along the tie-lines. Inspired from the field of computational neuroscience, Spike Talk basically builds on a fine-grained parallelism on the information transfer theory in our brains, particularly when neurons (modeled as DERs) transmit information (inferred from power streams measurable at each DER) through synapses (modeled as tie-lines). Not only does Spike Talk simplify and address the current bottlenecks of the cyber-physical architectural operation by dismissing the ICT layer, it provides intrinsic operational and cost-effective opportunities in terms of infrastructure development, computations and modeling. Hence, this paper provides a pedagogic illustration of the key concepts and design theories. Since we focus on coordinated control of microgrids in this paper, the signaling accuracy and system performance is studied for several neural coding schemes responsible for converting the real-valued local measurements into spikes.</description>

      <title>Learning Structurally Stabilized Representations for Multi-modal Lossless DNA Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present Reed-Solomon coded single-stranded representation learning (RSRL), a novel end-to-end model for learning representations for multi-modal lossless DNA storage. In contrast to existing learning-based methods, the proposed RSRL is inspired by both error-correction codec and structural biology. Specifically, RSRL first learns the representations for the subsequent storage from the binary data transformed by the Reed-Solomon codec. Then, the representations are masked by an RS-code-informed mask to focus on correcting the burst errors occurring in the learning process. With the decoded representations with error corrections, a novel biologically stabilized loss is formulated to regularize the data representations to possess stable single-stranded structures. By incorporating these novel strategies, the proposed RSRL can learn highly durable, dense, and lossless representations for the subsequent storage tasks into DNA sequences. The proposed RSRL has been compared with a number of strong baselines in real-world tasks of multi-modal data storage. The experimental results obtained demonstrate that RSRL can store diverse types of data with much higher information density and durability but much lower error rates.</description>

      <title>IBB Traffic Graph Data: Benchmarking and Road Traffic Prediction Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Road traffic congestion prediction is a crucial component of intelligent transportation systems, since it enables proactive traffic management, enhances suburban experience, reduces environmental impact, and improves overall safety and efficiency. Although there are several public datasets, especially for metropolitan areas, these datasets may not be applicable to practical scenarios due to insufficiency in the scale of data (i.e. number of sensors and road links) and several external factors like different characteristics of the target area such as urban, highways and the data collection location. To address this, this paper introduces a novel IBB Traffic graph dataset as an alternative benchmark dataset to mitigate these limitations and enrich the literature with new geographical characteristics. IBB Traffic graph dataset covers the sensor data collected at 2451 distinct locations. Moreover, we propose a novel Road Traffic Prediction Model that strengthens temporal links through feature engineering, node embedding with GLEE to represent inter-related relationships within the traffic network, and traffic prediction with ExtraTrees. The results indicate that the proposed model consistently outperforms the baseline models, demonstrating an average accuracy improvement of 4%.</description>

      <title>Generalized Reduced-WMMSE Approach for Cell-Free Massive MIMO With Per-AP Power Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The optimization of cooperative beamforming vectors in cell-free massive MIMO (mMIMO) systems is presented where multi-antenna access points (APs) support downlink data transmission of multiple users. Albeit the successes of the weighted minimum mean squared error (WMMSE) algorithm and their variants, they lack careful investigations about computational complexity that scales with the number of antennas and APs. We propose a generalized and reduced WMMSE (G-R-WMMSE) approach whose complexity is significantly lower than conventional WMMSE. We partition the set of beamforming coefficients into subvectors, with each subvector corresponding to a specific AP. Such a partitioning approach decomposes the original WMMSE problem across individual APs. By leveraging the Lagrange duality analysis, a closed-form solution can be derived for each subproblem, which substantially reduces the computation burden. Additionally, we present a parallel execution of the proposed G-R-WMMSE with adaptive step sizes, aiming at further reducing the time complexity. Numerical results validate that the proposed G-R-WMMSE schemes achieve over 99% complexity savings compared to the conventional WMMSE scheme while maintaining almost the same performance.</description>

      <title>Robust Millimeter Beamforming via Self-Supervised Hybrid Deep Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.12653v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Beamforming with large-scale antenna arrays has been widely used in recent years, which is acknowledged as an important part in 5G and incoming 6G. Thus, various techniques are leveraged to improve its performance, e.g., deep learning, advanced optimization algorithms, etc. Although its performance in many previous research scenarios with deep learning is quite attractive, usually it drops rapidly when the environment or dataset is changed. Therefore, designing effective beamforming network with strong robustness is an open issue for the intelligent wireless communications. In this paper, we propose a robust beamforming self-supervised network, and verify it in two kinds of different datasets with various scenarios. Simulation results show that the proposed self-supervised network with hybrid learning performs well in both classic DeepMIMO and new WAIR-D dataset with the strong robustness under the various environments. Also, we present the principle to explain the rationality of this kind of hybrid learning, which is instructive to apply with more kinds of datasets.</description>

      <title>Approximate Message Passing with Rigorous Guarantees for Pooled Data and Quantitative Group Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15507v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the pooled data problem, the goal is to identify the categories associated with a large collection of items via a sequence of pooled tests. Each pooled test reveals the number of items of each category within the pool. We study an approximate message passing (AMP) algorithm for estimating the categories and rigorously characterize its performance, in both the noiseless and noisy settings. For the noiseless setting, we show that the AMP algorithm is equivalent to one recently proposed by El Alaoui et al. Our results provide a rigorous version of their performance guarantees, previously obtained via non-rigorous techniques. For the case of pooled data with two categories, known as quantitative group testing (QGT), we use the AMP guarantees to compute precise limiting values of the false positive rate and the false negative rate. Though the pooled data problem and QGT are both instances of estimation in a linear model, existing AMP theory cannot be directly applied since the design matrices are binary valued. The key technical ingredient in our analysis is a rigorous asymptotic characterization of AMP for generalized linear models defined via generalized white noise design matrices. This result, established using a recent universality result of Wang et al., is of independent interest. Our theoretical results are validated by numerical simulations. For comparison, we propose estimators based on convex relaxation and iterative thresholding, without providing theoretical guarantees. The simulations indicate that AMP outperforms the convex estimator for noiseless pooled data and QGT, but the convex estimator performs slightly better for noisy pooled data with three categories when the number of observations is small.</description>

      <title>Smooth Actual EIRP Control for EMF Compliance with Minimum Traffic Guarantees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06624v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To mitigate Electromagnetic Fields (EMF) human exposure from base stations, international standards bodies define EMF emission requirements that can be translated into limits on the "actual" Equivalent Isotropic Radiated Power (EIRP), i.e., averaged over a sliding time window. We aim to enable base stations to adhere to these constraints while mitigating any impact on user performance. Specifically, our objectives are to: i) ensure EMF exposure compliance using actual EIRP control when implementing the "actual maximum approach" described in IEC 62232:2022, ii) guarantee a minimum EIRP level, and iii) prevent resource shortages at all times. We first investigate exact and conservative algorithms, with linear and constant complexity, respectively, to compute the maximum allowed EIRP consumption under constraints i) and ii), denoted as EIRP "budget". Subsequently, we design a control method based on Drift-Plus-Penalty theory that preemptively curbs EIRP consumption only when needed to avoid future resource shortages.</description>

      <title>Geometric constellation shaping for wireless optical intensity channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01031v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A simple geometric shaping method is proposed for optical wireless communication systems based on intensity modulation and direct detection (IM/DD). Constellations consisting of equiprobable levels with exponential-like distribution are obtained. The method possesses asymptotic optimality in the sense that the high-SNR channel capacity can be approached by such constellations with increasing size. By an additional quantization step, all $2^b$ levels ($b \in \mathbb N$) of the obtained constellation can be represented by a basic level and $b+2$ bits, thereby reducing the required resolution of the digital-to-analog converter (DAC) without affecting the asymptotic optimality. Achievable information rate evaluations verify the asymptotic optimality of the proposed method. As an example, error performance results of a simple 16-level LDPC coded modulation scheme show that a shaping gain of 0.8 dB can be obtained by applying the proposed constellation design.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Orbital Angular Momentum Wireless Communications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21444v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Orbital angular momentum (OAM) mode multiplexing has the potential to achieve high spectrum-efficiency communications at the same time and frequency by using orthogonal mode resource. However, the vortex wave hollow divergence characteristic results in the requirement of the large-scale receive antenna, which makes users hardly receive the OAM signal by size-limited equipment. To promote the OAM application in the next 6G communications, this paper proposes the cooperative OAM wireless (COW) communication scheme, which can select the cooperative users (CUs) to form the aligned antennas by size-limited user equipment. First, we derive the feasible radial radius and selective waist radius to choose the CUs in the same circle with the origin at the base station. Then, based on the locations of CUs, the waist radius is adjusted to form the receive antennas and ensure the maximum intensity for the CUs. Finally, the cooperative formation probability is derived in the closed-form solution, which can depict the feasibility of the proposed COW communication scheme. Furthermore, OAM beam steering is used to expand the feasible CU region, thus achieving higher cooperative formation probability. Simulation results demonstrate that the derived cooperative formation probability in mathematical analysis is very close to the statistical probability of cooperative formation, and the proposed COW communication scheme can obtain higher spectrum efficiency than the traditional scheme due to the effective reception of the OAM signal.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21470v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the disaster and remote regions, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can assist the data acquisition for Internet of Things (IoT). How to cover massive IoT devices (IDs), which require diverse quality-of-service (QoS), is a crucial challenge. For UAV-assisted IoT, this paper studies the deployment scheme with QoS guarantee to place multiple UAVs for covering all ground IDs and maximizing the average data rate of UAVs. First, for the ground ID, we propose the QoS demand based power allocation (QDPA) algorithm to solve the diversity of QoS with respect to data rate demand. Then, the data rate maximization placement (DRMP) algorithm is proposed to optimize the placement of single UAV. Finally, based on QDPA and DRMP algorithms, we propose the joint power allocation and placement (JPAP) scheme with QoS guarantee, which can cover massive IDs, to deploy multiple UAVs for maximizing the average UAV data rate. Simulation experiments are conducted to verify the superiority of our proposed JPAP scheme, which can minimize the UAV number and maximize the average data rate of UAVs.</description>

      <title>Precoding Based Downlink OAM-MIMO Communications with Rate Splitting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21478v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Orbital angular momentum (OAM) and rate splitting (RS) are the potential key techniques for the future wireless communications. As a new orthogonal resource, OAM can achieve the multifold increase of spectrum efficiency to relieve the scarcity of the spectrum resource, but how to enhance the privacy performance imposes crucial challenge for OAM communications. RS technique divides the information into private and common parts, which can guarantee the privacies for all users. In this paper, we integrate the RS technique into downlink OAM-MIMO communications, and study the precoding optimization to maximize the sum capacity. First, the concentric uniform circular arrays (UCAs) are utilized to construct the downlink transmission framework of OAM-MIMO communications with RS. Particularly, users in the same user pair utilize RS technique to obtain the information and different user pairs use different OAM modes. Then, we derive the OAM-MIMO channel model, and formulate the sum capacity maximization problem. Finally, based on the fractional programming, the optimal precoding matrix is obtained to maximize the sum capacity by using quadratic transformation. Extensive simulation results show that by using the proposed precoding optimization algorithm, OAM-MIMO communications with RS can achieve higher sum capacity than the traditional communication schemes.</description>

      <title>Air-to-Ground Cooperative OAM Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21479v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For users in hotspot region, orbital angular momentum (OAM) can realize multifold increase of spectrum efficiency (SE), and the flying base station (FBS) can rapidly support the real-time communication demand. However, the hollow divergence and alignment requirement impose crucial challenges for users to achieve air-to-ground OAM communications, where there exists the line-of-sight path. Therefore, we propose the air-to-ground cooperative OAM communication (ACOC) scheme, which can realize OAM communications for users with size-limited devices. The waist radius is adjusted to guarantee the maximum intensity at the cooperative users (CUs). We derive the closed-form expression of the optimal FBS position, which satisfies the antenna alignment for two cooperative user groups (CUGs). Furthermore, the selection constraint is given to choose two CUGs composed of four CUs. Simulation results are provided to validate the optimal FBS position and the SE superiority of the proposed ACOC scheme.</description>

      <title>Weighed l1 on the simplex: Compressive sensing meets locality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.13894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.13894v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sparse manifold learning algorithms combine techniques in manifold learning and sparse optimization to learn features that could be utilized for downstream tasks. The standard setting of compressive sensing can not be immediately applied to this setup. Due to the intrinsic geometric structure of data, dictionary atoms might be redundant and do not satisfy the restricted isometry property or coherence condition. In addition, manifold learning emphasizes learning local geometry which is not reflected in a standard $\ell_1$ minimization problem. We propose weighted $\ell_0$ and weighted $\ell_1$ metrics that encourage representation via neighborhood atoms suited for dictionary based manifold learning. Assuming that the data is generated from Delaunay triangulation, we show the equivalence of weighted $\ell_0$ and weighted $\ell_1$. We discuss an optimization program that learns the dictionaries and sparse coefficients and demonstrate the utility of our regularization on synthetic and real datasets.</description>

      <title>Semidefinite programming bounds on the size of entanglement-assisted codeword stabilized quantum codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07111v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the application of semidefinite programming to the realm of quantum codes, specifically focusing on codeword stabilized (CWS) codes with entanglement assistance. Notably, we utilize the isotropic subgroup of the CWS group and the set of word operators of a CWS-type quantum code to derive an upper bound on the minimum distance. Furthermore, this characterization can be incorporated into the associated distance enumerators, enabling us to construct semidefinite constraints that lead to SDP bounds on the minimum distance or size of CWS-type quantum codes. We illustrate several instances where SDP bounds outperform LP bounds, and there are even cases where LP fails to yield meaningful results, while SDP consistently provides tighter and relevant bounds. Finally, we also provide interpretations of the Shor-Laflamme weight enumerators and shadow enumerators for codeword stabilized codes, enhancing our understanding of quantum codes.</description>
