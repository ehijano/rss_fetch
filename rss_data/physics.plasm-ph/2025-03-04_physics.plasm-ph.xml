      <title>Criteria for ion acceleration in laboratory magnetized quasi-perpendicular collisionless shocks: when are 2D simulations enough?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of collisionless shocks and their role in cosmic ray acceleration has gained importance through observations and simulations, driving interest in reproducing these conditions in laboratory experiments using high-power lasers. In this work, we examine the role of three-dimensional (3D) effects in ion acceleration in quasi-perpendicular shocks under laboratory-relevant conditions. Using hybrid particle-in-cell simulations (kinetic ions and fluid electrons), we explore how the Alfv\'enic and sonic Mach numbers, along with plasma beta, influence ion energization, unlocked only in 3D, and establish scaling criteria for when conducting 3D simulations is necessary. Our results show that efficient ion acceleration requires Alfv\'enic Mach numbers $\geq 25$ and sonic Mach numbers $\geq 13$, with plasma-$\beta \leq 5$. We theoretically found that, while 2D simulations suffice for current laboratory-accessible shock conditions, 3D effects become crucial for shock velocities exceeding 1000 km/s and experiments sustaining the shock for at least 10 ns. We surveyed previous laboratory experiments on collisionless shocks and found that 3D effects are unimportant under those conditions, implying that 1D and 2D simulations should be enough to model the accelerated ion spectra. However, we do find that the same experiments are realistically close to accessing the regime relevant to 3D effects, an exciting prospect for future laboratory efforts. We propose modifications to past experimental configurations to optimize and control 3D effects on ion acceleration. These proposed experiments could be used to benchmark plasma astrophysics kinetic codes and/or employed as controllable sources of energetic particles.</description>

      <title>Hot-spot model for inertial confinement fusion implosions with an applied magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Imposing a magnetic field on inertial confinement fusion (ICF) implosions magnetizes the electrons in the compressed fuel; this suppresses thermal losses which increases temperature and fusion yield. Indirect-drive experiments at the National Ignition Facility (NIF) with 12 T and 26 T applied magnetic fields demonstrate up to $40\%$ increase in temperature, 3x increase in fusion yield, and indicate that magnetization alters the radial temperature profile [J.D. Moody $\mathrm{\textit{et al.}}$, Phys. Rev. Lett. $\mathrm{\textbf{129}}$, 195002 (2022), B. Lahmann et al., APS DPP 2022]. In this work, we develop a semi-analytic hot-spot model which accounts for the 2D Braginskii anisotropic heat flow due to an applied axial magnetic field. Firstly, we show that hot-spot magnetization alters the radial temperature profile, increasing the central peakedness which is most pronounced for moderately magnetized implosions (with 8-14 T applied field), compared to both unmagnetized (with no applied field) and highly magnetized (with 26 T or higher applied field) implosions. This model explains the trend in the experimental data which finds a similarly altered temperature profile in the 12 T experiment. Next, we derive the hot-spot model for gas-filled (Symcap) implosions, accounting for the effects of magnetization on the thermal conduction and in changing the radial temperature (and density) profiles. Using this model, we compute predicted central temperature amplification and yield enhancement scaling with the applied magnetic field. The central temperature fits the experimental data accurately, and the discrepancy in the yield suggests a systematic (independent of applied field) degradation such as mix, and additional degradation in the reference unmagnetized shot such as reduced laser drive, increased implosion asymmetry, or the magnetic field suppressing ablator mixing into the hot-spot.</description>

      <title>Particle-based plasma simulation using a graph neural network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A surrogate model for particle-in-cell plasma simulations based on a graph neural network is presented. The graph is constructed in such a way as to enable the representation of electromagnetic fields on a fixed spatial grid. The model is applied to simulate beams of electrons in one dimension over a wide range of temperatures, drift momenta and densities, and is shown to reproduce two-stream instabilities - a common and fundamental plasma instability. Qualitatively, the characteristic phase-space mixing of counterpropagating electron beams is observed. Quantitatively, the model's performance is evaluated in terms of the accuracy of its predictions of number density distributions, the electric field, and their Fourier decompositions, particularly the growth rate of the fastest-growing unstable mode, as well as particle position, momentum distributions, energy conservation and run time. The model achieves high accuracy with a time step longer than conventional simulation by two orders of magnitude. This work demonstrates that complex plasma dynamics can be learned and shows promise for the development of fast differentiable simulators suitable for solving forward and inverse problems in plasma physics.</description>

      <title>Plasma Compressibility and the Generation of Electrostatic Electron Kelvin-Helmholtz Instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the generation of Electrostatic (ES) Electron Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (EKHI) in collisionless plasma with a step-function electron velocity shear akin to that developed in the electron diffusion region in magnetic reconnection. In incompressible plasma, ES EKHI doesn't arise in any velocity shear profile due to the decoupling of the electric potential from the electron momentum equation. Instead a fluid-like Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI) can arise. However, in compressible plasma, the compressibility couples the electric potential with the electron dynamics, leading to the emergence of a new ES mode EKHI on Debye length $\lambda_{De}$, accompanied by the co-generation of an electron acoustic-like wave. The minimum threshold of ES EKHI is $\Delta \mathbf{U}&gt; 2c_{se}$, i.e., the electron velocity shear larger than twice the electron acoustic speed $c_{se}$. The corresponding growth rate is $Im(\omega) = ((\Delta \mathbf{U}/c_{se})^2 - 4)^{1/2} \omega_{pe}$, where $\omega_{pe}$ is the electron plasma frequency.</description>

      <title>Characterization of electron density and ionization of a uranium laser produced plasma using laser absorption spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-resolution tunable laser spectroscopy is used to measure time-resolved absorption spectra for ten neutral uranium transitions and six singly-ionized transitions in a laser produced plasma. Spectral lineshapes are analyzed to determine temporal variations in ion and neutral total column densities, excitation temperatures, kinetic temperatures, and collisional broadening effects as the plasma cools. Comparison of ion to neutral column densities shows a ratio greater than 10 at times $&lt;$ 15 $\mu$s after plasma onset, with the ratio not reaching unity until $\sim$50 $\mu$s. Spectral lineshapes are analyzed to separate Stark and van der Waals contributions to collisional broadening, from which electron densities are determined and found to decrease from $\sim$10$^{15}$-10$^{13} $cm$^{-3}$ over times from 4-25 $\mu$s. Using absorption spectroscopy to determine charge properties and electron density over these time scales and at low magnitudes provides valuable insight into plasma properties not obtainable using conventional emission spectroscopy. Comparisons between ion and neutral densities, excitation temperatures, kinetic temperatures, and electron densities could indicate potential deviations from local thermodynamic equilibrium and Saha ionization predictions.</description>

      <title>Longitudinal shaping of plasma waveguides using diffractive axicons for laser wakefield acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: New techniques for the optical generation of plasma waveguides -- optical fibres for ultra-intense light pulses -- have become vital to the advancement of multi-GeV laser wakefield acceleration. Here, we demonstrate the fabrication and characterization of a transmissive eight-level logarithmic diffractive axicon (LDA) for the generation of meter-scale plasma waveguides. These LDAs enable the formation of a Bessel-like beam with controllable start and end locations of the focal line and near-constant intensity on axis. We present measurements of the Bessel-like focal profile produced by the LDA, and of the leading end of the plasma column generated by it. One important feature is the formation of a funnel-mouthed plasma channel entrance that can act as waveguide coupler. We also compare the diffraction efficiency of our 8-level LDA to 4-level and binary versions, with measurements comparing well to theory.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Scaling in Pair Production for Scalar QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the dynamical scaling of momentum spectra for particle-antiparticle pairs at finite times within the framework of scalar Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). The analysis focuses on the momentum spectra in two different choices of adiabatic mode functions, which are related by a Wronskian normalization condition. Oscillations in the momentum spectra are attributed to quantum interference effects in the adiabatic number basis. A novel dynamical scaling behavior emerges when examining the oscillatory momentum spectra of pairs created by a Sauter pulsed field at intermediate times. While the oscillatory spectra are observed at distinct times in the two different choices, they overlap when time is rescaled by the point marking the initiation of the first occurrence of the Residual ParticleAntiparticle Plasma (RPAP) stage (or end of the transient stage) for the central momentum case. This scaling identifies the approximate time at which real particle-antiparticle pair formation becomes possible, shifting the focus from asymptotic times to finite-time dynamics. Additionally, in the multi-photon regime, we find that the momentum spectra exhibit a multi-modal profile structure at finite times, consistent across both choices and also follow the dynamical scaling in this case as well.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic Electron Kelvin-Helmholtz Instability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On electron kinetic scales, ions and electrons decouple, and electron velocity shear on electron inertial length $\sim d_e$ can trigger electromagnetic (EM) electron Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (EKHI). In this paper, we present an analytic study of EM EKHI in an inviscid collisionless plasma with a step-function electron shear flow. We show that in incompressible collisionless plasma the ideal electron frozen-in condition $\mathbf{E} + \mathbf{v}_e \times \mathbf{B}/c = 0$ must be broken for the EM EKHI to occur. In a step-function electron shear flow, the ideal electron frozen-in condition is replaced by magnetic flux conservation, i.e., $\nabla \times (\mathbf{E} + \mathbf{v}_e\times \mathbf{B}/c) = 0$, resulting in a dispersion relation similar to that of the standard ideal and incompressible magnetohydrodynamics KHI. The magnetic field parallel to the electron streaming suppresses the EM EKHI due to magnetic tension. The threshold for the EM mode of the EKHI is $(\mathbf{k}\cdot\Delta\mathbf{U}_e)^2&gt;\frac{n_{e1}+n_{e2}}{n_{e1} n_{e2}}[n_{e1}(\mathbf{v}_{Ae1}\cdot\mathbf{k})^2+n_{e2}(\mathbf{v}_{Ae2}\cdot\mathbf{k})^2]$, where $\mathbf{v}_{Ae} =\mathbf{B}/(4\pi m_e n_e)^{1/2}$, $\Delta\mathbf{U}_e$ and $n_e$ are the electron streaming velocity shear and densities, respectively. The growth rate of the EM mode is $\gamma_{em} \sim \Omega_{ce}$, the electron gyro-frequency.</description>

      <title>First direct observation of a wakefield generated with structured light</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The use of structured light to control the phase velocity of the wake in laser-wakefield accelerators has generated significant interest for its ability to mitigate electron dephasing. Combining the diffraction-free properties of Bessel beams with spatio-temporal shaping of the pulse promises to enable acceleration with an unprecedented combination of long acceleration lengths and high gradients. This would facilitate the acceleration of electrons to energies above 100 GeV in existing laser facilities. In-depth understanding of the physical mechanisms involved is critical to achieving dephasing-free electron acceleration. Here we present the first experimental observation of wakefields generated by beams that were spatio-temporally sculpted and then focused with a long-focal-depth mirror, known as an axiparabola, which generates a quasi-Bessel beam. The resulting wakefield was imaged using femtosecond relativistic electron microscopy. Novel insights into this minimally explored regime include mapping the wakefield development over the focal depth and studying the effects of spatio-temporal manipulations of the beam on the structure and phase velocity of the wakefield. Such insights pave the way towards realizing the potential of structured-light based solutions to dephasing in laser-wakefield acceleration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.03073v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, the development of two-dimensional current sheets with respect to tearing-modes, in collisionless plasmas with a strong guide field, is analysed. During their non-linear evolution, these thin current sheets can become unstable to the formation of plasmoids, which allows the magnetic reconnection process to reach high reconnection rates. We carry out a detailed study of the impact of a finite $\beta_e$, which also implies finite electron Larmor radius effects, on the collisionless plasmoid instability. This study is conducted through a comparison of gyrofluid and gyrokinetic simulations. The comparison shows in general a good capability of the gyrofluid models in predicting the plasmoid instability observed with gyrokinetic simulations. We show that the effects of $\beta_e$ promotes the plasmoid growth. The impact of the closure applied during the derivation of the gyrofluid model is also studied through the comparison of the energy variation.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Collisional Losses from a Magnetic Mirror Using the Lenard-Bernstein Collision Operator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14294v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Collisions are crucial in governing particle and energy transport in plasmas confined in a magnetic mirror trap. Modern gyrokinetic codes model transport in magnetic mirrors, but some utilize approximate model collision operators. This study focuses on a Pastukhov-style method of images calculation of particle and energy confinement times using a Lenard-Bernstein model collision operator. Prior work on parallel particle and energy balances used a different Fokker-Planck plasma collision operator. The method must be extended in non-trivial ways to study the Lenard-Bernstein operator. To assess the effectiveness of our approach, we compare our results with a modern finite element solver. Our findings reveal that the particle confinement time scales like $a \exp(a^2)$ using the Lenard-Bernstein operator, in contrast to the more accurate scaling that the Coulomb collision operator would yield $a^2 \exp(a^2)$, where $a^2$ is approximately proportional to the ambipolar potential. We propose that codes solving for collisional losses in magnetic mirrors utilizing the Lenard-Bernstein or Dougherty collision operator scale their collision frequency of any electrostatically confined species. This study illuminates the collision operator's intricate role in the Pastukhov-style method of images calculation of collisional confinement.</description>

Abstract: The conefield variant of a Converse KAM method for 3D vector fields, identifying regions through which no invariant 2-tori pass transverse to a specified direction field, is tested on some helical perturbations of an axisymmetric magnetic field in toroidal geometry. This implementation computes bounds on the slopes of invariant tori of a given class and allows to apply a subsidiary criterion to extend the non-existence region, saving significant computation time. The method finds regions corresponding to magnetic islands and chaos for the fieldline flow.</description>

      <title>Multiscale autonomous forecasting of plasma systems' dynamics using neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11203v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Plasma systems exhibit complex multiscale dynamics, resolving which poses significant challenges for conventional numerical simulations. Machine learning (ML) offers an alternative by learning data-driven representations of these dynamics. Yet existing ML time-stepping models suffer from error accumulation, instability, and limited long-term forecasting horizons. This paper demonstrates the application of a hierarchical multiscale neural network architecture for autonomous plasma forecasting. The framework integrates multiple neural networks trained across different temporal scales to capture both fine-scale and large-scale behaviors while mitigating compounding error in recursive evaluation. Fine-scale networks accurately resolve fast-evolving features, while coarse-scale networks provide broader temporal context, reducing the frequency of recursive updates and limiting the accumulation of small prediction errors over time. We first evaluate the method using canonical nonlinear dynamical systems and compare its performance against classical single-scale neural networks. The results demonstrate that single-scale neural networks experience rapid divergence due to recursive error accumulation, whereas the multiscale approach improves stability and extends prediction horizons. Next, our ML model is applied to two plasma configurations of high scientific and applied significance, demonstrating its ability to preserve spatial structures and capture multiscale plasma dynamics. By leveraging multiple time-stepping resolutions, the applied framework is shown to outperform conventional single-scale networks for the studied plasma test cases. The results of this work position the hierarchical multiscale neural network as a promising tool for efficient plasma forecasting and digital twin applications.</description>
