      <title>Quantum annealing-based structural optimization with a multiplicative design update</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a new structural design framework, developed based on iterative optimization via quantum annealing (QA). The novelty lies in its successful design update using an unknown design multiplier obtained by iteratively solving the optimization problems with QA. In addition, to align with density-based approaches in structural optimization, multipliers are multiplicative to represent design material and serve as design variables. In particular, structural analysis is performed on a classical computer using the finite element method, and QA is utilized for topology updating. The primary objective of the framework is to minimize compliance under an inequality volume constraint, while an encoding process for the design variable is adopted, enabling smooth iterative updates to the optimized design. The proposed framework incorporates both penalty methods and slack variables to transform the inequality constraint into an equality constraint and is implemented in a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) model through QA. To demonstrate its performance, design optimization is performed for both truss and continuum structures. Promising results from these applications indicate that the proposed framework is capable of creating an optimal shape and topology similar to those benchmarked by the optimality criteria (OC) method on a classical computer.</description>

      <title>AFBench: A Large-scale Benchmark for Airfoil Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data-driven generative models have emerged as promising approaches towards achieving efficient mechanical inverse design. However, due to prohibitively high cost in time and money, there is still lack of open-source and large-scale benchmarks in this field. It is mainly the case for airfoil inverse design, which requires to generate and edit diverse geometric-qualified and aerodynamic-qualified airfoils following the multimodal instructions, \emph{i.e.,} dragging points and physical parameters. This paper presents the open-source endeavors in airfoil inverse design, \emph{AFBench}, including a large-scale dataset with 200 thousand airfoils and high-quality aerodynamic and geometric labels, two novel and practical airfoil inverse design tasks, \emph{i.e.,} conditional generation on multimodal physical parameters, controllable editing, and comprehensive metrics to evaluate various existing airfoil inverse design methods. Our aim is to establish \emph{AFBench} as an ecosystem for training and evaluating airfoil inverse design methods, with a specific focus on data-driven controllable inverse design models by multimodal instructions capable of bridging the gap between ideas and execution, the academic research and industrial applications. We have provided baseline models, comprehensive experimental observations, and analysis to accelerate future research. Our baseline model is trained on an RTX 3090 GPU within 16 hours. The codebase, datasets and benchmarks will be available at \url{https://hitcslj.github.io/afbench/}.</description>

      <title>Isogeometric Shape Optimization of Multi-Tapered Coaxial Baluns Simulated by an Integral Equation Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the advantages of a spline-based freeform shape optimization approach using the example of a multi-tapered coaxial balun connected to a spiral antenna. The underlying simulation model is given in terms of a recently proposed isogeometric integral equation formulation, which can be interpreted as a high-order generalization of the partial element equivalent circuit method. We demonstrate a significant improvement in the optimized design, i.e., a reduction in the magnitude of the scattering parameter over a wide frequency range.</description>

      <title>Commodification of Compute</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancements in artificial intelligence, big data analytics, and cloud computing have precipitated an unprecedented demand for computational resources. However, the current landscape of computational resource allocation is characterized by significant inefficiencies, including underutilization and price volatility. This paper addresses these challenges by introducing a novel global platform for the commodification of compute hours, termed the Global Compute Exchange (GCX) (Patent Pending). The GCX leverages blockchain technology and smart contracts to create a secure, transparent, and efficient marketplace for buying and selling computational power. The GCX is built in a layered fashion, comprising Market, App, Clearing, Risk Management, Exchange (Offchain), and Blockchain (Onchain) layers, each ensuring a robust and efficient operation. This platform aims to revolutionize the computational resource market by fostering a decentralized, efficient, and transparent ecosystem that ensures equitable access to computing power, stimulates innovation, and supports diverse user needs on a global scale. By transforming compute hours into a tradable commodity, the GCX seeks to optimize resource utilization, stabilize pricing, and democratize access to computational resources. This paper explores the technological infrastructure, market potential, and societal impact of the GCX, positioning it as a pioneering solution poised to drive the next wave of innovation in commodities and compute.</description>

      <title>SimLOB: Learning Representations of Limited Order Book for Financial Market Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Financial market simulation (FMS) serves as a promising tool for understanding market anomalies and the underlying trading behaviors. To ensure high-fidelity simulations, it is crucial to calibrate the FMS model for generating data closely resembling the observed market data. Previous efforts primarily focused on calibrating the mid-price data, leading to essential information loss of the market activities and thus biasing the calibrated model. The Limit Order Book (LOB) data is the fundamental data fully capturing the market micro-structure and is adopted by worldwide exchanges. However, LOB is not applicable to existing calibration objective functions due to its tabular structure not suitable for the vectorized input requirement. This paper proposes to explicitly learn the vectorized representations of LOB with a Transformer-based autoencoder. Then the latent vector, which captures the major information of LOB, can be applied for calibration. Extensive experiments show that the learned latent representation not only preserves the non-linear auto-correlation in the temporal axis, but the precedence between successive price levels of LOB. Besides, it is verified that the performance of the representation learning stage is consistent with the downstream calibration tasks. Thus, this work also progresses the FMS on LOB data, for the first time.</description>

      <title>FFN: a Fine-grained Chinese-English Financial Domain Parallel Corpus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have stunningly advanced the field of machine translation, though their effectiveness within the financial domain remains largely underexplored. To probe this issue, we constructed a fine-grained Chinese-English parallel corpus of financial news called FFN. We acquired financial news articles spanning between January 1st, 2014, to December 31, 2023, from mainstream media websites such as CNN, FOX, and China Daily. The dataset consists of 1,013 main text and 809 titles, all of which have been manually corrected. We measured the translation quality of two LLMs -- ChatGPT and ERNIE-bot, utilizing BLEU, TER and chrF scores as the evaluation metrics. For comparison, we also trained an OpenNMT model based on our dataset. We detail problems of LLMs and provide in-depth analysis, intending to stimulate further research and solutions in this largely uncharted territory. Our research underlines the need to optimize LLMs within the specific field of financial translation to ensure accuracy and quality.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Machine-Learning-Based Optimization Using Input Convex LSTM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07202v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural network-based optimization and control have gradually supplanted first-principles model-based approaches in energy and manufacturing systems due to their efficient, data-driven process modeling that requires fewer resources. However, their non-convex nature significantly slows down the optimization and control processes, limiting their application in real-time decision-making processes. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Input Convex Long Short-Term Memory (ICLSTM) network to enhance the computational efficiency of neural network-based optimization. Through two case studies employing real-time neural network-based optimization for optimizing energy and chemical systems, we demonstrate the superior performance of ICLSTM-based optimization in terms of runtime. Specifically, in a real-time optimization problem of a real-world solar photovoltaic (PV) energy system at LHT Holdings in Singapore, ICLSTM-based optimization achieved an 8-fold speedup compared to conventional LSTM-based optimization. These results highlight the potential of ICLSTM networks to significantly enhance the efficiency of neural network-based optimization and control in practical applications.

      <title>Latent diffusion models for parameterization and data assimilation of facies-based geomodels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14815v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Geological parameterization entails the representation of a geomodel using a small set of latent variables and a mapping from these variables to grid-block properties such as porosity and permeability. Parameterization is useful for data assimilation (history matching), as it maintains geological realism while reducing the number of variables to be determined. Diffusion models are a new class of generative deep-learning procedures that have been shown to outperform previous methods, such as generative adversarial networks, for image generation tasks. Diffusion models are trained to "denoise", which enables them to generate new geological realizations from input fields characterized by random noise. Latent diffusion models, which are the specific variant considered in this study, provide dimension reduction through use of a low-dimensional latent variable. The model developed in this work includes a variational autoencoder for dimension reduction and a U-net for the denoising process. Our application involves conditional 2D three-facies (channel-levee-mud) systems. The latent diffusion model is shown to provide realizations that are visually consistent with samples from geomodeling software. Quantitative metrics involving spatial and flow-response statistics are evaluated, and general agreement between the diffusion-generated models and reference realizations is observed. Stability tests are performed to assess the smoothness of the parameterization method. The latent diffusion model is then used for ensemble-based data assimilation. Two synthetic "true" models are considered. Significant uncertainty reduction, posterior P$_{10}$-P$_{90}$ forecasts that generally bracket observed data, and consistent posterior geomodels, are achieved in both cases.</description>
