      <title>Group Ligands Docking to Protein Pockets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular docking is a key task in computational biology that has attracted increasing interest from the machine learning community. While existing methods have achieved success, they generally treat each protein-ligand pair in isolation. Inspired by the biochemical observation that ligands binding to the same target protein tend to adopt similar poses, we propose \textsc{GroupBind}, a novel molecular docking framework that simultaneously considers multiple ligands docking to a protein. This is achieved by introducing an interaction layer for the group of ligands and a triangle attention module for embedding protein-ligand and group-ligand pairs. By integrating our approach with diffusion-based docking model, we set a new S performance on the PDBBind blind docking benchmark, demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed molecular docking paradigm.</description>

      <title>BoKDiff: Best-of-K Diffusion Alignment for Target-Specific 3D Molecule Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structure-based drug design (SBDD) leverages the 3D structure of biomolecular targets to guide the creation of new therapeutic agents. Recent advances in generative models, including diffusion models and geometric deep learning, have demonstrated promise in optimizing ligand generation. However, the scarcity of high-quality protein-ligand complex data and the inherent challenges in aligning generated ligands with target proteins limit the effectiveness of these methods. We propose BoKDiff, a novel framework that enhances ligand generation by combining multi-objective optimization and Best-of-K alignment methodologies. Built upon the DecompDiff model, BoKDiff generates diverse candidates and ranks them using a weighted evaluation of molecular properties such as QED, SA, and docking scores. To address alignment challenges, we introduce a method that relocates the center of mass of generated ligands to their docking poses, enabling accurate sub-component extraction. Additionally, we integrate a Best-of-N (BoN) sampling approach, which selects the optimal ligand from multiple generated candidates without requiring fine-tuning. BoN achieves exceptional results, with QED values exceeding 0.6, SA scores above 0.75, and a success rate surpassing 35%, demonstrating its efficiency and practicality. BoKDiff achieves state-of-the-art results on the CrossDocked2020 dataset, including a -8.58 average Vina docking score and a 26% success rate in molecule generation. This study is the first to apply Best-of-K alignment and Best-of-N sampling to SBDD, highlighting their potential to bridge generative modeling with practical drug discovery requirements.

      <title>Can Molecular Evolution Mechanism Enhance Molecular Representation?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular evolution is the process of simulating the natural evolution of molecules in chemical space to explore potential molecular structures and properties. The relationships between similar molecules are often described through transformations such as adding, deleting, and modifying atoms and chemical bonds, reflecting specific evolutionary paths. Existing molecular representation methods mainly focus on mining data, such as atomic-level structures and chemical bonds directly from the molecules, often overlooking their evolutionary history. Consequently, we aim to explore the possibility of enhancing molecular representations by simulating the evolutionary process. We extract and analyze the changes in the evolutionary pathway and explore combining it with existing molecular representations. Therefore, this paper proposes the molecular evolutionary network (MEvoN) for molecular representations. First, we construct the MEvoN using molecules with a small number of atoms and generate evolutionary paths utilizing similarity calculations. Then, by modeling the atomic-level changes, MEvoN reveals their impact on molecular properties. Experimental results show that the MEvoN-based molecular property prediction method significantly improves the performance of traditional end-to-end algorithms on several molecular datasets. The code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/MEvoN-7416/.</description>

      <title>Pharmacophore-guided de novo drug design with diffusion bridge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19812v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: De novo design of bioactive drug molecules with potential to treat desired biological targets is a profound task in the drug discovery process. Existing approaches tend to leverage the pocket structure of the target protein to condition the molecule generation. However, even the pocket area of the target protein may contain redundant information since not all atoms in the pocket is responsible for the interaction with the ligand. In this work, we propose PharmacoBridge, a phamacophore-guided de novo design approach to generate drug candidates inducing desired bioactivity via diffusion bridge. Our method adapts the diffusion bridge to effectively convert pharmacophore arrangements in the spatial space into molecular structures under the manner of SE(3)-equivariant transformation, providing sophisticated control over optimal biochemical feature arrangements on the generated molecules. PharmacoBridge is demonstrated to generate hit candidates that exhibit high binding affinity with potential protein targets.</description>

      <title>Computational Protein Science in the Era of Large Language Models (LLMs)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10282v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Considering the significance of proteins, computational protein science has always been a critical scientific field, dedicated to revealing knowledge and developing applications within the protein sequence-structure-function paradigm. In the last few decades, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has made significant impacts in computational protein science, leading to notable successes in specific protein modeling tasks. However, those previous AI models still meet limitations, such as the difficulty in comprehending the semantics of protein sequences, and the inability to generalize across a wide range of protein modeling tasks. Recently, LLMs have emerged as a milestone in AI due to their unprecedented language processing &amp; generalization capability. They can promote comprehensive progress in fields rather than solving individual tasks. As a result, researchers have actively introduced LLM techniques in computational protein science, developing protein Language Models (pLMs) that skillfully grasp the foundational knowledge of proteins and can be effectively generalized to solve a diversity of sequence-structure-function reasoning problems. While witnessing prosperous developments, it's necessary to present a systematic overview of computational protein science empowered by LLM techniques. First, we summarize existing pLMs into categories based on their mastered protein knowledge, i.e., underlying sequence patterns, explicit structural and functional information, and external scientific languages. Second, we introduce the utilization and adaptation of pLMs, highlighting their remarkable achievements in promoting protein structure prediction, protein function prediction, and protein design studies. Then, we describe the practical application of pLMs in antibody design, enzyme design, and drug discovery. Finally, we specifically discuss the promising future directions in this fast-growing field.</description>
