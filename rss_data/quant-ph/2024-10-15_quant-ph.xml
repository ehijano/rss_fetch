      <title>A Comparative Study on the Convergence Rate of Two Online Quantum State Reconstruction Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the convergence rates of two algorithms for the online quantum states reconstruction with Gaussian measurement noise in continuous weak measurement are studied, one is the online proximal gradient-based alternating direction method of multipliers (OPG-ADMM) algorithm, and another is Kalman fitering-based quantum state estimation (KF-QSE) algorithm. For the OPG-ADMM algorithm, by defining the loss function of the optimization function and the constraint condition in the times T tracking process, the convergence rate theorem of the two loss functions is obtained and proved. Then, the convergence order of the normalized distance of the density matrix under the OPG-ADMM algorithm is derived from the conclusion of the theorem. For the KF-QSE algorithm, after defining the loss function of the optimization function, the theorem of the convergence order of the loss function is investigated. Then, the convergence order of the normalized distance of the KF-QSE algorithm is deduced from the conclusion of the theorem. Finally, in the numerical simulation experiments, we use the normalized distance of density matrix as the indicator and use two algorithms for online reconstruction of the 4-bit quantum system. The derived performance of algorithm convergence rates are verified by the comparison and analysis of the results.</description>

      <title>Comparing Quantum Encoding Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As quantum computers continue to become more capable, the possibilities of their applications increase. For example, quantum techniques are being integrated with classical neural networks to perform machine learning. In order to be used in this way, or for any other widespread use like quantum chemistry simulations or cryptographic applications, classical data must be converted into quantum states through quantum encoding. There are three fundamental encoding methods: basis, amplitude, and rotation, as well as several proposed combinations. This study explores the encoding methods, specifically in the context of hybrid quantum-classical machine learning. Using the QuClassi quantum neural network architecture to perform binary classification of the `3' and `6' digits from the MNIST datasets, this study obtains several metrics such as accuracy, entropy, loss, and resistance to noise, while considering resource usage and computational complexity to compare the three main encoding methods.</description>

      <title>Conditional Motional Squeezing of an Optomechanical Oscillator Approaching the Quantum Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Squeezed mechanical states are a valuable tool for quantum sensing and error correction in quantum computing, and a pivotal platform for tests of fundamental physics. Recently, solid state mechanical oscillators have been prepared in squeezed states using parametric interactions in both the microwave and optical regimes. It has long been predicted that a fast measurement rate comparable to the mechanical resonance frequency can prepare the oscillator under measurement into a quantum squeezed state. Despite decades of effort, this straightforward protocol is yet to be demonstrated in the quantum regime. Here, we use post-processing techniques to demonstrate preparation of a 50 ng GaAs cantilever in a conditional classical squeezed state with a minimum uncertainty (0.28 plus/minus 0.18) dB above (1.07 plus/minus 0.04 times) the zero point fluctuations, 3 orders of magnitude closer to the quantum regime in variance than the previous record. This paves the way to real-time measurement-based preparation of macroscopic oscillators in quantum squeezed states, and can be adapted to mechanical systems as large as the kg-scale test masses of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO).</description>

      <title>Accurate quantum-centric simulations of supramolecular interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first quantum-centric simulations of noncovalent interactions using a supramolecular approach. We simulate the potential energy surfaces (PES) of the water and methane dimers, featuring hydrophilic and hydrophobic interactions, respectively, with a sample-based quantum diagonalization (SQD) approach. Our simulations on quantum processors, using 27- and 36-qubit circuits, are in remarkable agreement with classical methods, deviating from complete active space configuration interaction (CASCI) and coupled-cluster singles, doubles, and perturbative triples (CCSD(T)) within 1 kcal/mol in the equilibrium regions of the PES. Finally, we test the capacity limits of the quantum methods for capturing hydrophobic interactions with an experiment on 54 qubits. These results mark significant progress in the application of quantum computing to chemical problems, paving the way for more accurate modeling of noncovalent interactions in complex systems critical to the biological, chemical and pharmaceutical sciences.</description>

      <title>Simulability of non-classical continuous-variable quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In continuous-variable quantum computation, identifying key elements that enable a quantum computational advantage is a long-standing issue. Starting from the standard results on the necessity of Wigner negativity, we develop a comprehensive and versatile framework that not only enables the identification of a potential quantum computational advantage, but also allows to pinpoint the contribution of each quantum gate in achieving this objective. As such, it can be straightforwardly applied to current continuous-variables quantum circuits, while also constraining the tolerable amount of losses above which any potential quantum advantage can be ruled out. We use $(s)$-ordered quasiprobability distributions on phase-space to capture the non-classical features in the protocol, and focus our model entirely on the ordering parameter $s$. This allows us to highlight the resourcefulness and robustness to loss of a universal set of unitary gates comprising three distinct Gaussian gates, and a fourth one, the cubic gate, providing important insight on the role of non-Gaussianity.</description>

      <title>QOPS: A Compiler Framework for Quantum Circuit Simulation Acceleration with Profile Guided Optimizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum circuit simulation is important in the evolution of quantum software and hardware. Novel algorithms can be developed and evaluated by performing quantum circuit simulations on classical computers before physical quantum computers are available. Unfortunately, compared with a physical quantum computer, a prolonged simulation time hampers the rapid development of quantum algorithms. Inspired by the feedback-directed optimization scheme used by classical compilers to improve the generated code, this work proposes a quantum compiler framework QOPS to enable profile-guided optimization (PGO) for quantum circuit simulation acceleration. The QOPS compiler instruments a quantum simulator to collect performance data during the circuit simulation and it then generates the optimized version of the quantum circuit based on the collected data. Experimental results show the PGO can effectively shorten the simulation time on our tested benchmark programs. Especially, the simulator-specific PGO (virtual swap) can be applied to the benchmarks to accelerate the simulation speed by a factor of 1.19. As for the hardware-independent PGO, compared with the brute force mechanism (turning on all available compilation flags), which achieves 21% performance improvement against the non-optimized version, the PGO can achieve 16% speedup with a factor of 63 less compilation time than the brute force approach.</description>

      <title>Diagnosing Strong-to-Weak Symmetry Breaking via Wightman Correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetry plays a fundamental role in quantum many-body physics, and a central concept is spontaneous symmetry breaking, which imposes crucial constraints on the possible quantum phases and their transitions. Recent developments have extended the discussion of symmetry and its breaking to mixed states, enhancing our understanding of novel quantum phases that have no counterpart in pure states. Specific attention has been paid to scenarios where a strongly symmetric density matrix exhibits spontaneous symmetry breaking to weak symmetry, characterized by the fidelity correlator. In this work, we propose the Wightman correlator as an alternative diagnostic tool. This construction relies on the introduction of the thermofield double state for a generic density matrix, which maps the strong symmetry of the density matrix to the doubled symmetry of the pure state, allowing the Wightman correlator to emerge naturally as a standard probe of symmetry breaking. We prove the equivalence between the Wightman function and the fidelity correlator in defining strong-to-weak symmetry breaking, and examine explicit examples involving spin glasses, thermal density matrices, and the decohered Ising model. Additionally, we discuss a susceptibility interpretation of the Wightman correlator.</description>

      <title>Minutes-scale Schr{\"o}dinger-cat state of spin-5/2 atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum metrology with nonclassical states offers a promising route to improved precision in physical measurements. The quantum effects of Schr{\"o}dinger-cat superpositions or entanglements allow measurement uncertainties to reach below the standard quantum limit. However, the challenge in keeping a long coherence time for such nonclassical states often prevents full exploitation of the quantum advantage in metrology. Here we demonstrate a long-lived Schr{\"o}dinger-cat state of optically trapped $^{173}$Yb (\textit{I}\ =\ 5/2) atoms. The cat state, a superposition of two oppositely-directed and furthest-apart spin states, is generated by a non-linear spin rotation. Protected in a decoherence-free subspace against inhomogeneous light shifts of an optical lattice, the cat state achieves a coherence time of $1.4(1)\times 10^3$ s. A magnetic field is measured with Ramsey interferometry, demonstrating a scheme of Heisenberg-limited metrology for atomic magnetometry, quantum information processing, and searching for new physics beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Observable Measurement-Induced Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the main postulates of quantum mechanics is that measurements destroy quantum coherence (wave function collapse). Recently it was discovered that in a many-body system dilute local measurements still preserve some coherence across the entire system. As the measurement density is increased, a phase transition occurs that is characterized by the disentanglement of different parts of the system. Unfortunately, this transition is impossible to observe experimentally for macroscopic systems because it requires an exponentially costly full tomography of the many-body wave function or a comparison with the simulation on an oracle classical computer. In this work we report the discovery of another measurement-induced phase transition that can be observed experimentally if quantum dynamics can be reversed. On one side of this phase transition the quantum information encoded in some part of the Hilbert space is fully recovered after the time inversion. On the other side, all quantum information is corrupted. This transition also manifests itself as the change in the behavior of the probability to observe the same measurement outcome in the process that consists of identical blocks repeated many times. In each block the unitary evolution is followed by the measurement. On one side of the transition the probability decreases exponentially with the number of repetitions, on the other it tends to a constant as the number of repetitions is increased. We confirm the existence of the proposed phase transition through numerical simulations of realistic quantum circuits and analytical calculations using an effective random-matrix theory model.</description>

      <title>Wide range quantum enhanced rotation sensing with 1+2 dimensional dynamical decoupling techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a motional dynamical decoupling technique by utilizing a sequence of $\pi$-phase shifts, instead of the conventional $\pi$-pulses for spin flipping, to implement the quantum enhanced rotation sensing with a 1+2 dimensional hybrid atomic Sagnic interferometor. By fully disentangling the spin from the two-dimensional vibrational modes of the particle under rotation, the spin coherence time and thus the phase accumulation can be significantly increased. Consequently, both the achievable sensitivity and dynamic range of the rotation sensing can be significantly enhanced and extended simultaneously, compared to the previous schemes where the spin and motions of the particle were not completely decoupled. The experimental feasibility for the unambiguous estimation of the rotation parameters is also discussed. Hopefully, this technique holds promise for overcoming certain challenges existing in the usual matter-wave Sagnac interferometers with trapped particles, particularly for the practical inertial navigation that demands both high sensitivity and large dynamic range.</description>

      <title>Coherent Control of Photon Correlations in Trapped Ion Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the spontaneous emission from independent emitters provides spatially uncorrelated photons - a typical manifestation of quantum randomness, the interference of the coherent scattering leads to a well-defined intensity pattern - a feature described by linear optics. We here demonstrate experimentally how the interplay between the two mechanisms in large systems of quantum emitters leads to spatial variations of photon correlations. The implementation with trapped ion crystals in free space allows us to observe the anti-correlation between photon rates and variance of the photon number distributions in chains of up to 18 ions. For smaller crystals of four ions, the transition from a sub-Poissonian to a super-Poissonian variance of the photon number in the scattered light is reported. For higher numbers of scatterers, the photon statistics still display a strong deviation from the fully incoherent scattering case. Our results illustrate how the interference of coherent scattering, combined with spontaneous emission, provides a control mechanism for the light statistics.</description>

      <title>Exploring Channel Distinguishability in Local Neighborhoods of the Model Space in Quantum Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the increasing interest in Quantum Machine Learning, Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) have emerged and gained significant attention. These models have, however, been shown to be notoriously difficult to train, which we hypothesize is partially due to the architectures, called ansatzes, that are hardly studied at this point. Therefore, in this paper, we take a step back and analyze ansatzes. We initially consider their expressivity, i.e., the space of operations they are able to express, and show that the closeness to being a 2-design, the primarily used measure, fails at capturing this property. Hence, we look for alternative ways to characterize ansatzes by considering the local neighborhood of the model space, in particular, analyzing model distinguishability upon small perturbation of parameters. We derive an upper bound on their distinguishability, showcasing that QNNs with few parameters are hardly discriminable upon update. Our numerical experiments support our bounds and further indicate that there is a significant degree of variability, which stresses the need for warm-starting or clever initialization. Altogether, our work provides an ansatz-centric perspective on training dynamics and difficulties in QNNs, ultimately suggesting that iterative training of small quantum models may not be effective, which contrasts their initial motivation.</description>

      <title>Tensorial Quantum Mechanics: Back to Heisenberg and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we discuss the establishment of Standard Quantum Mechanics (SQM) developed through Schr\"odinger's and Dirac's wave-vectorial reformulations of Heisenberg's original matrix mechanics. We will argue that while Heisenberg's approach was consistently developed -- taking as a standpoint the intensive patterns that were observed in the lab -- as an invariant-operational formalism, Dirac's axiomatic re-formulation was, instead, developed -- taking as a standpoint Schr\"odinger's wave mechanics and the methodological guide of Bohr and logical positivists -- as an essentially inconsistent "recipe" intended (but unable) to predict (binary) measurement outcomes. Leaving SQM behind and attempting to restore the consistent and coherent account of a real state of affairs, we will present a new tensorial proposal which -- taking as a standpoint Heisenberg's original approach -- will prove capable not only to extend the matrix formalism to a tensorial representation but also to account for new experimental phenomena.</description>

      <title>Gaussian approximation and its corrections for driven dissipative Kerr model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a general technique to obtain Gaussian approximation and perturbative corrections for bosonic nonlinear models. We apply our technique to the Kerr model in the external classical field with dissipation. Without the external field, it can be solved in the space of density matrices supported at the lowest Fock states. We show that although these solutions are highly non-Gaussian, the moments of the creation and annihilation operators are still described by our approach with high accuracy. In the general case with an external field, we discuss the contribution of our technique to the Gaussian approximation without corrections.</description>

      <title>Transfer of quantum game strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a method for the transfer of perfect strategies between various classes of two-player, one round cooperative non-local games with quantum inputs and outputs using the simulation paradigm in quantum information theory. We show that such a transfer is possible when canonically associated operator spaces for each game are quantum homomorphic or isomorphic, as defined in the joint work of H. and Todorov (2024). We examine a new class of QNS correlations, needed for the transfer of strategies between games, and characterize them in terms of states on tensor products of canonical operator systems. We define jointly tracial correlations and show they correspond to traces acting on tensor products of canonical ${\rm C}^{*}$-algebras associated with individual game parties. We then make an inquiry into the initial application of such results to the study of concurrent quantum games.</description>

      <title>Bounding the Wigner Deformation Parameter in Harmonically Trapped Bose Gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By examining the internal energy and heat capacity of a harmonically trapped ideal Bose gas within the Dunkl formalism, we show that the Wigner parameter determines the slopes of these thermodynamic functions in the critical region but does not affect the order of the transition or the critical exponents. Most importantly, upon analyzing the classical behavior, we demonstrate the existence of two distinct classical limits, which allow us to establish upper and lower bounds for this parameter.</description>

      <title>General theory of constructing potential with bound states in the continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09647v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a general theory of potentials that support bound states at positive energies (bound states in the continuum). On the theoretical side, we prove that, for systems described by nonlocal potentials of the form $V(r,r')$, bound states at positive energies are as common as those at negative energies. At the same time, we show that a local potential of the form $V(r)$ rarely supports a positive energy bound state. On the practical side, we show how to construct a (naturally nonlocal) potential which supports an arbitrary normalizable state at an arbitrary positive energy. We demonstrate our theory with numerical examples both in momentum and coordinate spaces with emphasis on the important role played by nonlocal potentials. Finally, we discuss how to observe bound states at positive energies, and where to search for nonlocal potentials which may support them.</description>

      <title>Quantum many-body simulations with PauliStrings.jl</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the Julia module PauliStrings.jl for quantum many-body simulations, which performs fast operations on the Pauli group by encoding Pauli strings in binary. All of the Pauli string algebra is encoded into low-level logic operations on integers, and is made efficient by various truncation methods which allow for systematic extrapolation of the results. We illustrate the effectiveness of our module by (i) performing Heisenberg time evolution through direct numerical integration and (ii) by constructing a Liouvillian Krylov space. We benchmark the results against tensor network methods, and we find our module performs favorably. In addition, we show that this representation allows for easy encoding of any geometry. We present results for chaotic and integrable spin systems in 1D as well as some examples in 2D. Currently, the main limitations are the inefficiency of representing non-trivial pure states (or other low-rank operators), as well as the need to introduce dissipation to probe long-time dynamics.</description>

      <title>Universal scaling laws in quantum-probabilistic machine learning by tensor network towards interpreting representation and generalization powers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interpreting the representation and generalization powers has been a long-standing issue in the field of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence. This work contributes to uncovering the emergence of universal scaling laws in quantum-probabilistic ML. We take the generative tensor network (GTN) in the form of a matrix product state as an example and show that with an untrained GTN (such as a random TN state), the negative logarithmic likelihood (NLL) $L$ generally increases linearly with the number of features $M$, i.e., $L \simeq k M + const$. This is a consequence of the so-called ``catastrophe of orthogonality,'' which states that quantum many-body states tend to become exponentially orthogonal to each other as $M$ increases. We reveal that while gaining information through training, the linear scaling law is suppressed by a negative quadratic correction, leading to $L \simeq \beta M - \alpha M^2 + const$. The scaling coefficients exhibit logarithmic relationships with the number of training samples and the number of quantum channels $\chi$. The emergence of the quadratic correction term in NLL for the testing (training) set can be regarded as evidence of the generalization (representation) power of GTN. Over-parameterization can be identified by the deviation in the values of $\alpha$ between training and testing sets while increasing $\chi$. We further investigate how orthogonality in the quantum feature map relates to the satisfaction of quantum probabilistic interpretation, as well as to the representation and generalization powers of GTN. The unveiling of universal scaling laws in quantum-probabilistic ML would be a valuable step toward establishing a white-box ML scheme interpreted within the quantum probabilistic framework.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Classical Correspondence in a Quartic Oscillator -- Corrections to Frequency and Bounds for Periodic Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We take a qualitative comparative look at quantum and classical quartic anharmonic oscillators. It has been shown that the behavior of the quantum anharmonic oscillator mimics that of the classical anharmonic oscillators with the structurally same Hamiltonian in the coherent state basis of the harmonic oscillators. The associated equation of motion allows us to use Lindstet-Poincare perturbation method to compute the classical frequency of the oscillation order by order, by taking care of its dependence on amplitude and the quantum corrections. We also derive a bound for periodicity of such oscillations in both the classical and quantum cases.</description>

      <title>Simulation of fidelity in entanglement-based networks with repeater chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We implement a simulation environment on top of NetSquid that is specifically designed for estimating the end-to-end fidelity across a path of quantum repeaters or quantum switches. The switch model includes several generalizations which are not currently available in other tools, and are useful for gaining insight into practical and realistic quantum network engineering problems: an arbitrary number of memory registers at the switches, simplicity in including entanglement distillation mechanisms, arbitrary switching topologies, and more accurate models for the depolarization noise. An illustrative case study is presented, namely a comparison in terms of performance between a repeater chain where repeaters can only swap sequentially, and a single switch equipped with multiple memory registers, able to handle multiple swapping requests.</description>

      <title>A Quantum Circuit-Based Compression Perspective for Parameter-Efficient Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum-centric supercomputing presents a compelling framework for large-scale hybrid quantum-classical tasks. Although quantum machine learning (QML) offers theoretical benefits in various applications, challenges such as large-size data encoding in the input stage and the reliance on quantum resources in the inference stage limit its practicality for tasks like fine-tuning large language models (LLMs). Quantum parameter generation, a novel approach of QML, addresses these limitations by using quantum neural networks (QNNs) to generate classical model weights (parameters) exclusively during training, thereby decoupling inference from quantum hardware. In this work, we introduce Quantum Parameter Adaptation (QPA) in the framework of quantum parameter generation, which integrates QNNs with a classical multi-layer perceptron mapping model to generate parameters for fine-tuning methods. Using Gemma-2 and GPT-2 as case studies, QPA demonstrates significant parameter reduction for parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), while maintaining comparable or improved performance in text generation tasks. Specifically, QPA reduces the number of parameters to $52.06\%$ of the original LoRA for GPT-2 with a slight performance gain of $0.75\%$, and to $16.84\%$ for Gemma-2, with a marginal performance improvement of $0.07\%$. These results highlight QPA's ability to achieve efficient parameter reduction without sacrificing performance in the quantum parameter generation framework. This work showcases the potential of quantum-enhanced parameter reduction, offering a scalable quantum-classical solution for fine-tuning LLMs while preserving the feasibility of inference on classical hardware.</description>

      <title>Quantum correlations enhanced in hybrid optomechanical system via phase tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a theoretical framework for enhancing quantum correlations in a hybrid double-cavity optomechanical system that hosts an atomic ensemble. We investigate the role of the coupling phase $\phi$ between cavity 1 and the atomic ensemble in optimizing quantum correlations, i.e., bipartite/tripartite quantum entanglement and quantum discord. By employing metrics such as logarithmic negativity for bipartite entanglement and minimum residual contangle for genuine tripartite entanglement, we demonstrate that tuning the phase $\phi$ is essential for maximizing photon-phonon entanglement. Specifically, we find that optimal entanglement occurs at $\phi=n\pi$, with distinct conditions for odd and even integers $n$. Our results also indicate that the quantum entanglement achieved in this system is robust against thermal fluctuations, making it a promising candidate for applications in quantum information processing and quantum computing. Furthermore, this research highlights the significance of phase tuning in controlling quantum correlations, paving the way for advancements in quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Bounds on Multipartite Nonlocality via Reduction to Biased Nonlocality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multipartite information principles are needed to understand nonlocal quantum correlations. Towards that end, we provide optimal bounds on genuine multipartite nonlocality for classes of THRESHOLD games using the LOCCG (Local Operations with Grouping) model. Our proof develops a reduction between multipartite nonlocal and biased bipartite nonlocal games. Generalizing this reduction to a larger class of games may build a bridge from multipartite to bipartite principles.</description>

      <title>Quantum Linear Time-Translation-Invariant Systems: Conjugate Symplectic Structure, Uncertainty Bounds, and Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09976v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linear time-translation-invariant (LTI) models offer simple, yet powerful, abstractions of complex classical dynamical systems. Quantum versions of such models have so far relied on assumptions of Markovianity or an internal state-space description. We develop a general quantization scheme for multimode classical LTI systems that reveals their fundamental quantum noise, is applicable to non-Markovian scenarios, and does not require knowledge of an internal description. The resulting model is that of an open quantum LTI system whose dilation to a closed system is characterized by elements of the conjugate symplectic group. Using Lie group techniques, we show that such systems can be synthesized using frequency-dependent interferometers and squeezers. We derive tighter Heisenberg uncertainty bounds, which constrain the ultimate performance of any LTI system, and obtain an invariant representation of their output noise covariance matrix that reveals the ubiquity of "complex squeezing" in lossy systems. This frequency-dependent quantum resource can be hidden to homodyne and heterodyne detection and can only be revealed with more general "symplectodyne" detection. These results establish a complete and systematic framework for the analysis, synthesis, and measurement of arbitrary quantum LTI systems.</description>

Abstract: This study presents a numerical simulation of a quantum electron confined in a 10 nm potential well, using the Crank-Nicolson numerical technique to solve the time-dependent Schrodinger equation. The results capture the evolution of the electron's wave function at the 2000th time step, illustrating distinct standing wave patterns and probability densities that align with quantum mechanical predictions. Additionally, both 2D and 3D simulations across multiple time steps reveal the dynamic nature of quantum superposition and interference within the well. These findings highlight the method's stability and accuracy, offering a valuable tool for exploring quantum phenomena in constrained quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Extending Simulability of Cliffords and Matchgates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Though Cliffords and matchgates are both examples of classically simulable circuits, they are considered simulable for different reasons. While the simulability of Clifford conjugated matchgate circuits for single qubit outputs has been briefly considered, the simulability of Clifford and matchgate hybrid circuits has not been generalized up to this point. In this paper we resolve this, studying simulability of marginals as well as Pauli expectation values of Clifford and matchgate hybrid circuits. We describe a hierarchy of Clifford circuits, and find that as we consider more general Cliffords, we lose some amount of simulability of bitstring outputs. Most importantly, we show that the known simulability of Pauli expectation values of Clifford circuits acting on product states can be generalized to Clifford circuits acting after any matchgate circuit. We conclude with some general discussion about the relationship between Cliffords and matchgates, and argue that we can understand stabilizer states as the vacuum states of particular fermion-to-qubit encodings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existence of pseudorandom unitaries (PRUs) -- efficient quantum circuits that are computationally indistinguishable from Haar-random unitaries -- has been a central open question, with significant implications for cryptography, complexity theory, and fundamental physics. In this work, we close this question by proving that PRUs exist, assuming that any quantum-secure one-way function exists. We establish this result for both (1) the standard notion of PRUs, which are secure against any efficient adversary that makes queries to the unitary $U$, and (2) a stronger notion of PRUs, which are secure even against adversaries that can query both the unitary $U$ and its inverse $U^\dagger$. In the process, we prove that any algorithm that makes queries to a Haar-random unitary can be efficiently simulated on a quantum computer, up to inverse-exponential trace distance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a theory of random non-Hermitian action that, after quantization, describes the stochastic nonlinear dynamics of quantum states in Hilbert space. Focusing on fermionic fields, we propose both canonical quantization and path integral quantization, demonstrating that these two approaches are equivalent. Using this formalism, we investigate the evolution of a single-particle Gaussian wave packet under the influence of non-Hermiticity and randomness. Our results show that specific types of non-Hermiticity lead to wave packet localization, while randomness affects the central position of the wave packet, causing the variance of its distribution to increase with the strength of the randomness.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multipartite entanglement plays a critical role in various applications of quantum internet. In these applications, the entanglement is usually shared by the distant parties. Experimentally, the distributed entanglement should be estimated by only local measurements. Furthermore, for network experiments, it is desirable to employ measurement techniques that are straightforward to implement. In this paper, we propose a method to measure arbitrary multipartite single photon path entangled states by only local measurements. By considering practically reasonable assumptions, our method is relatively easy to implement. We experimentally demonstrate the utility of this method by reconstructing the density matrix of a 3-qubit W-state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum information is fragile and must be protected by a quantum error-correcting code for large-scale practical applications. Recently, highly efficient quantum codes have been discovered which require a high degree of spatial connectivity. This raises the question of how to realize these codes with minimal overhead under physical hardware connectivity constraints. Here, we introduce a general recipe to transform any quantum stabilizer code into a subsystem code with related code parameters that has weight and degree three, and local interactions on a given graph. We call the subsystem codes produced by our recipe "wire codes". These codes can be adapted to have a local implementation on any graph that supports a low-density embedding of an input tanner graph, with an overhead that depends on the embedding. Applying our results to hypercubic lattices leads to a construction of local subsystem codes with optimal scaling code parameters in any fixed spatial dimension. Similarly, applying our results to families of expanding graphs leads to local codes on these graphs with code parameters that depend on the degree of expansion. Our results constitute a general method to construct low-overhead subsystem codes on general graphs, which can be applied to adapt highly efficient quantum error correction procedures to hardware with restricted connectivity.</description>

      <title>Floquet Engineering of Anisotropic Transverse Interactions in Superconducting Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting transmon qubits have established as a leading candidate for quantum computation, as well as a flexible platform for exploring exotic quantum phases and dynamics. However, physical coupling naturally yields isotropic transverse interactions between qubits, restricting their access to diverse quantum phases that require spatially dependent interactions. Here, we demonstrate the simultaneous realization of both pairing (XX-YY) and hopping (XX+YY) interactions between transmon qubits by Floquet engineering. The coherent superposition of these interactions enables independent control over the XX and YY terms, yielding anisotropic transverse interactions. By aligning the transverse interactions along a 1D chain of six qubits, as calibrated via Aharonov-Bohm interference in synthetic space, we synthesize a transverse field Ising chain model and explore its dynamical phase transition under varying external field. The scalable synthesis of anisotropic transverse interactions paves the way for the implementation of more complex physical systems requiring spatially dependent interactions, enriching the toolbox for engineering quantum phases with superconducting qubits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the evolving landscape of quantum technology, the increasing prominence of quantum computing poses a significant threat to the security of conventional public key infrastructure. Quantum key distribution (QKD), an established quantum technology at a high readiness level, emerges as a viable solution with commercial adoption potential. QKD facilitates the establishment of secure symmetric random bit strings between two geographically separated, trustworthy entities, safeguarding communications from potential eavesdropping. In particular, data centre interconnects can leverage the potential of QKD devices to ensure the secure transmission of critical and sensitive information in preserving the confidentiality, security, and integrity of their stored data. In this article, we present the successful implementation of a QKD field trial within a commercial data centre environment that utilises the existing fibre network infrastructure. The achieved average secret key rate of 2.392 kbps and an average quantum bit error rate of less than 2% demonstrate the commercial feasibility of QKD in real-world scenarios. As a use case study, we demonstrate the secure transfer of files between two data centres through the Quantum-Secured Virtual Private Network, utilising secret keys generated by the QKD devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum acoustics is an emerging platform for hybrid quantum technologies enabling quantum coherent control of mechanical vibrations. High-overtone bulk acoustic resonators (HBARs) represent an attractive mechanical implementation of quantum acoustics due to their potential for exceptionally high mechanical coherence. Here, we demonstrate an implementation of high-coherence HBAR quantum acoustics integrated with a planar superconducting qubit architecture, demonstrating an acoustically-induced-transparency regime of high cooperativity and weak coupling, analogous to the electrically-induced transparency in atomic physics. Demonstrating high-coherence quantum acoustics with planar superconducting devices enables new applications for acoustic resonators in quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Application of zero-noise extrapolation-based quantum error mitigation to a silicon spin qubit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As quantum computing advances towards practical applications, reducing errors remains a crucial frontier for developing near-term devices. Errors in the quantum gates and quantum state readout could result in noisy circuits, which would prevent the acquisition of the exact expectation values of the observables. Although ultimate robustness to errors is known to be achievable by quantum error correction-based fault-tolerant quantum computing, its successful implementation demands large-scale quantum processors with low average error rates that are not yet widely available. In contrast, quantum error mitigation (QEM) offers more immediate and practical techniques, which do not require extensive resources and can be readily applied to existing quantum devices to improve the accuracy of the expectation values. Here, we report the implementation of a zero-noise extrapolation-based error mitigation technique on a silicon spin qubit platform. This technique has recently been successfully demonstrated for other platforms such as superconducting qubits, trapped-ion qubits, and photonic processors. We first explore three methods for amplifying noise on a silicon spin qubit: global folding, local folding, and pulse stretching, using a standard randomized benchmarking protocol. We then apply global folding-based zero-noise extrapolation to the state tomography and achieve a state fidelity of 99.96% (98.52%), compared to the unmitigated fidelity of 75.82% (82.16%) for different preparation states. The results show that the zero-noise extrapolation technique is a versatile approach that is generally adaptable to quantum computing platforms with different noise characteristics through appropriate noise amplification methods.</description>

      <title>Scaled quantum theory. The bouncing ball problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the so-called scaled quantum theory, the standard bouncing ball problem is analyzed under the presence of a gravitational field and harmonic potential. In this framework, the quantum-classical transition of the density matrix is described by the linear scaled von Neumann equation for mixed states and after it has been particularized to the case of pure states. The main purpose of this work is to show how this theory works for conservative systems and the quantum-classical transition is carried out in a continuous and smooth way, being equivalent to a nonlinear differential wave equation which contains a transition parameter ranging continuously from one to zero and covering all dynamical regimes in-between the two extreme quantum and classical regimes. This parameter can be seen as a degree of quantumness where all intermediate dynamical regimes show quantum features but are fading gradually when approaching to the classical value.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We realize a single-Josephson-junction transmon qubit shunted by a simple geometric inductor. We couple it capacitively to a conventional transmon and show that the ZZ interaction between the two qubits is completely suppressed when they are flux-biased to have opposite-sign anharmonicities. Away from the flux sweet spot of the inductively-shunted transmon, we demonstrate fast two-qubit interactions using first-order sideband transitions. The simplicity of this two-qubit-species circuit makes it promising for building large lattices of superconducting qubits with low coherent error and a rich gate set.</description>

      <title>Individual solid-state nuclear spin qubits with coherence exceeding seconds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to coherently control and read out qubits with long coherence times in a scalable system is a crucial requirement for any quantum processor. Nuclear spins in the solid state have shown great promise as long-lived qubits. Control and readout of individual nuclear spin qubit registers has made major progress in the recent years using individual electron spin ancilla addressed either electrically or optically. Here, we present a new platform for quantum information processing, consisting of $^{183}$W nuclear spin qubits adjacent to an Er$^{3+}$ impurity in a CaWO$_4$ crystal, interfaced via a superconducting resonator and detected using a microwave photon counter at 10mK. We study two nuclear spin qubits with $T_2^*$ of $0.8(2)~$s and $1.2(3)~$s, $T_2$ of $3.4(4)~$s and $4.4(6)~$ s, respectively. We demonstrate single-shot quantum non-demolition readout of each nuclear spin qubit using the Er$^{3+}$ spin as an ancilla. We introduce a new scheme for all-microwave single- and two-qubit gates, based on stimulated Raman driving of the coupled electron-nuclear spin system. We realize single- and two-qubit gates on a timescale of a few milliseconds, and prepare a decoherence-protected Bell state with 88% fidelity and $T_2^*$ of $1.7(2)~$s. Our results are a proof-of-principle demonstrating the potential of solid-state nuclear spin qubits as a promising platform for quantum information processing. With the potential to scale to tens or hundreds of qubits, this platform has prospects for the development of scalable quantum processors with long-lived qubits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a systematic perturbative framework to engineer an arbitrary target Hamiltonian in the Floquet phase space of a periodically driven oscillator based on Floquet-Magnus expansion. The high-order errors in the engineered Floquet Hamiltonian are mitigated by adding high-order driving potentials perturbatively. Especially, we introduce a bracket transformation that makes the calculation of high-order correction drives feasible. We apply our method to engineering a target Hamiltonian with discrete rotational and chiral symmetries in phase space that are important for fault-tolerant hardware-efficiency bosonic quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Commuting Local Hamiltonians Beyond 2D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10495v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Commuting local Hamiltonians provide a testing ground for studying many of the most interesting open questions in quantum information theory, including the quantum PCP conjecture and the existence of area laws. Although they are a simplified model of quantum computation, the status of the commuting local Hamiltonian problem remains largely unknown. A number of works have shown that increasingly expressive families of commuting local Hamiltonians admit completely classical verifiers. Despite intense work, the largest class of commuting local Hamiltonians we can place in NP are those on a square lattice, where each lattice site is a qutrit. Even worse, many of the techniques used to analyze these problems rely heavily on the geometry of the square lattice and the properties of the numbers 2 and 3 as local dimensions. In this work, we present a new technique to analyze the complexity of various families of commuting local Hamiltonians: guided reductions. Intuitively, these are a generalization of typical reduction where the prover provides a guide so that the verifier can construct a simpler Hamiltonian. The core of our reduction is a new rounding technique based on a combination of Jordan's Lemma and the Structure Lemma. Our rounding technique is much more flexible than previous work, and allows us to show that a larger family of commuting local Hamiltonians is in NP, albiet with the restriction that all terms are rank-1. Specifically, we prove the following two results:
  1. Commuting local Hamiltonians in 2D that are rank-1 are contained in NP, independent of the qudit dimension. Note that this family of commuting local Hamiltonians has no restriction on the local dimension or the locality.
  2. We prove that rank-1, 3D commuting Hamiltonians with qudits on edges are in NP. To our knowledge this is the first time a family of 3D commuting local Hamiltonians has been contained in NP.</description>

      <title>Quantum Internet: Resource Estimation for Entanglement Routing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating the physical resources required for routing entanglement along an arbitrary path in a quantum bipartite entanglement network based on first-generation quantum repeaters. This resource consumption is intimately linked with the purification protocol and the errors that it introduces due to experimental imperfections. We propose a novel way of accounting for experimental errors in the purification process, which offers the flexibility of accounting for a non uniform probability distribution over different kinds of errors. Moreover, we introduce a novel approach for computing a non-recursive estimation of the resource consumption and illustrate it specifically for our error treatment on a nested repeater protocol. This allows for a reduction in the time complexity of the computation required for the resource estimation, from linear in the required number of purification steps, to constant. Given the fragility and ultra-short lifespans of quantum information, this is especially crucial for an effective operation of a quantum network. The results demonstrate that the approximation works reasonably well over a wide-range of errors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How can we perform a metrological task if only limited control over a quantum system is given? Here, we present systematic methods for conducting nonlinear quantum metrology in scenarios lacking a common reference frame. Our approach involves preparing multiple copies of quantum systems and then performing local measurements with randomized observables. First, we derive the metrological precision using an error propagation formula based solely on local unitary invariants, which are independent of the chosen basis. Next, we provide analytical expressions for the precision scaling in various examples of nonlinear metrology involving two-body interactions, like the one-axis twisting Hamiltonian. Finally, we analyze our results in the context of local decoherence and discuss its influences on the observed scaling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed analysis of the propagation of experimentally relevant two-particle correlations for one-dimensional interacting bosons, and give evidence that many-body chaos induces the emergence of an effective diffusive regime for the fully coherent correlation dynamics, characterized by an interaction dependent diffusion coefficient, which we estimate. This result supports very recent experimental observations, and paves the way towards an efficient description of the dynamical behaviour of non-integrable complex many-body systems. Furthermore, we show that the dynamical features within experimentally accessible time scales of a conveniently defined two-particle correlation transport distance provide a direct and unambiguous characterization of many-body quantum chaos.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Boson sampling is the task of producing samples from the number-basis distribution of many bosons traveling through a passive linear optical network. It is believed to be extremely difficult to accomplish classically, and has been the motivation for many "quantum advantage" demonstrations. Here we discuss the characterization tools that were developed to interpret the results of a boson sampling experiment performed at JILA, using atoms instead of photons.
  We measured the indistinguishability of the atoms using a Hong-Ou-Mandel style measurement, and found that it was $99.5^{+0.5}_{-1.6}\%$. We then showed that the indistinguishability of the atoms was a good predictor of the multiparticle bunching features, which in turn was a measure of multiparticle indistinguishability itself. To make this latter connection explicit, we introduce the weak generalized bunching conjecture and show it is equivalent to an existing mathematical conjecture.
  For the purpose of characterizing the dynamics that were present in the experiment, we discuss how to optimize the experimental design for inferring the single-particle unitary from Fock basis measurements. We showed that having very cold atoms was necessary to perform the inference of the dynamics in a reasonable amount of time. We then partially characterized the single particle unitary via direct measurements using one and two atoms, and compared our measurements to a separate characterization using a new statistic that describes the deviation between the two characterization methods while being insensitive to uninferable parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bayesian methods promise enhanced device performance and accelerated data collection. We demonstrate an adaptive Bayesian measurement strategy for atom number estimation in a quantum technology experiment, utilising a symmetry-informed loss function. Compared to a standard unoptimised strategy, our method yields a five-fold reduction in the fractional variance of the atom number estimate. Equivalently, it achieves the target precision with 40% fewer data points. We provide general expressions for the optimal estimator and error for any quantity amenable to symmetry-informed strategies, facilitating the application of these strategies in quantum computing, communication, metrology, and the wider quantum technology sector.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The digital version of adiabatic quantum computing enhanced by counterdiabatic driving, known as digitized counterdiabatic quantum computing, has emerged as a paradigm that opens the door to fast and low-depth algorithms. In this work, we explore the extension of this paradigm to high-dimensional systems. Specifically, we consider qutrits in the context of quadratic problems, obtaining the qutrit Hamiltonian codifications and the counterdiabatic drivings. Our findings show that the use of qutrits can improve the quality of the solution up to 90 times compared to qubits counterpart. We test our proposal on 1000 random instances of the multi-way number partitioning, max 3-cut, and portfolio optimization problems, demonstrating that, in general, without prior knowledge, it is always better to use high-dimensional systems instead of qubits. Finally, considering the state-of-the-art in quantum platforms, we show the experimental feasibility of our high-dimensional counterdiabatic quantum algorithms at least in a full digital form. This work paves the way for the efficient codification of optimization problems in high-dimensional spaces and their efficient implementation using counterdiabatic quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Single-shot Distinguishability and Anti-distinguishability of Quantum Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Among the surprising features of quantum measurements, the problem of distinguishing and anti-distinguishing general quantum measurements is fundamentally appealing. Quantum theory offers four distinct scenarios for distinguishing (and anti-distinguishing) quantum measurements - (i) probing single systems and without access to the post-measurement states, (ii) probing entangled systems and without access to the post-measurement states, (iii) probing single systems with access to the post-measurement states, and (iv) probing entangled systems with access to the post-measurement states. In these scenarios, we consider the probability of distinguishing (and anti-distinguishing) quantum measurements sampled from a given set in the single-shot regime. For some scenarios, we derive analytical expressions for the distinguishability (and anti-distinguishability) of qubit projective measurements. Notably, we demonstrate that in scenario (iii), the distinguishability of any pair of qubit projective measurements is always higher than in scenario (ii). Interestingly, for some qubit non-projective measurements, the highest distinguishability in scenario (ii) is achieved using a non-maximally entangled state. It turns out that, for any set of measurements, the distinguishability (and anti-distinguishability) in scenario (i) is always less than or equal to that in any other scenario, while it reaches its highest possible value in scenario (iv). We establish that these relations form a strict hierarchy, and there is no hierarchical relation between scenarios (ii) and (iii). Specifically, we construct pairs (and triples) of qubit measurements that are perfectly distinguishable (and anti-distinguishable) in scenario (ii) but not in scenario (iii), and vice versa. Furthermore, we identify qubit measurements that achieve perfect distinguishability (and anti-distinguishability) only in scenario (iv).</description>

      <title>Nonlocality under Jaynes-Cummings evolution: beyond pseudospin operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We re-visit the generation and evolution of (Bell) nonlocality in hybrid scenarios whose dynamics is determined by the Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian, a relevant example of which is the atom-cavity system. Previous approaches evaluate the nonlocality through the well-known qubit-qubit CHSH formulae, using combinations of pseudospin operators for the electromagnetic (EM) field observables. While such approach is sensible, it is far from optimal. In the present work we have used recent results on the optimal Bell violation in qubit-qudit systems, showing that the nonlocality is much greater than previously estimated, both with and without noise. We perform also an optimal treatment of the noise, so our results are optimal in this sense as well. We illustrate the results using different initial states for the EM field, including squeezed and coherent states. In addition, we study the asymptotic behavior of the entanglement. Remarkably, starting with a generic separable (pure) coherent state, the asymptotic (mixed) state is entangled, though does not violate Bell inequalities.</description>

      <title>Energetic Analysis of Emerging Quantum Communication Protocols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid development and early industrialization of quantum technologies, it is of great interest to analyze their overall energy consumption before planning for their wide-scale deployments. The evaluation of the total energy requirements of quantum networks is a challenging task: different networks require very disparate techniques to create, distribute, manipulate, detect, and process quantum signals. This paper aims to lay the foundations of a framework to model the energy requirements of different quantum technologies and protocols applied to near-term quantum networks. Different figures of merit are discussed and a benchmark on the energy consumption of bipartite and multipartite network protocols is presented. An open-source software to estimate the energy consumption of photonic setups is also provided.</description>

      <title>Tunable Einstein-Bohr recoiling-slit gedankenexperiment at the quantum limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1927, during the fifth Solvay Conference, Einstein and Bohr described a double-slit interferometer with a "movable slit" that can detect the momentum recoil of one photon. Here, we report a faithful realization of the Einstein-Bohr interferometer using a single atom in an optical tweezer, cooled to the motional ground state in three dimensions. The single atom has an intrinsic momentum uncertainty comparable to a single photon, which serves as a movable slit obeying the minimum Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The atom's momentum wavefunction is dynamically tunable by the tweezer laser power, which enables observation of an interferometric visibility reduction at a shallower trap, demonstrating the quantum nature of this interferometer. We further identify classical noise due to atom heating and precession, illustrating a quantum-to-classical transition.</description>

      <title>High sensitivity pressure and temperature quantum sensing in organic crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inherent sensitivity of quantum sensors to their physical environment can make them good reporters of parameters such as temperature, pressure, strain, and electric fields. Here, we present a molecular platform for pressure (P) and temperature (T) sensing using para-terphenyl crystals doped with pentacene. We leverage the optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) of the photoexcited triplet electron in the pentacene molecule, that serves as a sensitive probe for lattice changes in the host para-terphenyl due to pressure or temperature variations. We observe maximal ODMR frequency variations of df/dP=1.8 MHz/bar and df/dT=247 kHz/K, which are over 1,200 times and three times greater, respectively, than those seen in nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond. This results in a &gt;85-fold improvement in pressure sensitivity over best previously reported. The larger variation reflects the weaker nature of the para-terphenyl lattice, with first-principles DFT calculations indicating that even picometer-level shifts in the molecular orbitals due to P, T changes are measurable. The platform offers additional advantages including high levels of sensor doping, narrow ODMR linewidths and high contrasts, and ease of deployment, leveraging the ability for large single crystals at low cost. Overall, this work paves the way for low-cost, optically-interrogated pressure and temperature sensors and lays the foundation for even more versatile sensors enabled by synthetic tunability in designer molecular systems.</description>

      <title>Neural Projected Quantum Dynamics: a systematic study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the challenge of simulating unitary quantum dynamics in large systems using Neural Quantum States, focusing on overcoming the computational instabilities and high cost of existing methods. This work offers a comprehensive formalization of the projected time-dependent Variational Monte Carlo (p-tVMC) method by thoroughly analyzing its two essential components: stochastic infidelity minimization and discretization of the unitary evolution. We investigate neural infidelity minimization using natural gradient descent strategies, identifying the most stable stochastic estimators and introducing adaptive regularization strategies that eliminate the need for manual adjustment of the hyperparameter along the dynamics. We formalize the specific requirements that p-tVMC imposes on discretization schemes for them to be efficient, and introduce four high-order integration schemes combining Taylor expansions, Pad\'e approximants, and Trotter splitting to enhance accuracy and scalability. We benchmark our adaptive methods against a 2D Ising quench, matching state of the art techniques without manual tuning of hyperparameters. This work establishes p-tVMC as a highly promising framework for addressing complex quantum dynamics, offering a compelling alternative for researchers looking to push the boundaries of quantum simulations.</description>

      <title>Wave packet dynamics in parabolic optical lattices: From Bloch oscillations to long-range dynamical tunneling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of wave packets in a parabolic optical lattice formed by combining an optical lattice with a global parabolic trap. Our study examines the phase space representation of the systems eigenstates by comparing them to the classical phase space of a pendulum, to which the system effectively maps. The analysis reveals that quantum states can exhibit mixed dynamics by straddling the separatrix. A key finding is that the dynamics around the separatrix enables the controlled creation of highly non-classical states, distinguishing them from the classical oscillatory or rotational dynamics of the pendulum. By considering a finite momentum of the initial wave packet, we demonstrate various dynamical regimes. Furthermore, a slight energy mismatch between nearly-degenerate states results in controlled long-range dynamical tunneling. These results can be interpreted as quantum beating between a clockwise rotating and a counterclockwise rotating pendulum.</description>

      <title>Quantum emitter interacting with a dispersive dielectric object: a model based on the modified Langevin noise formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we model the interaction of a quantum emitter with a finite-size dispersive dielectric object in an unbounded space within the framework of macroscopic quantum electrodynamics, using the modified Langevin noise formalism. The quantized electromagnetic field consists of two contributions: the medium-assisted field, which accounts for the electromagnetic field generated by the noise polarization currents of the dielectric, and the scattering-assisted field, which takes into account the electromagnetic field incoming from infinity and scattered by the dielectric. We show that the emitter couples to two distinct bosonic baths: a medium-assisted bath and a scattering-assisted bath, each characterized by its own spectral density. We identify the conditions under which the electromagnetic environment composed of these two baths can be effectively replaced by a single bosonic bath, ensuring that the reduced dynamics of the quantum emitter remain unchanged. In particular, when the initial states of the medium- and scattering-assisted baths are thermal states with the same temperature, we find that a single bosonic bath with a spectral density equal to the sum of the medium-assisted and scattering-assisted spectral densities is equivalent to the original electromagnetic environment.</description>

      <title>Efficient Simulation of Open Quantum Systems on NISQ Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulating open quantum systems, which interact with external environments, presents significant challenges on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices due to limited qubit resources and noise. In this paper, we propose an efficient framework for simulating open quantum systems on NISQ hardware by leveraging a time-perturbative Kraus operator representation of the system's dynamics. Our approach avoids the computationally expensive Trotterization method and exploits the Lindblad master equation to represent time evolution in a compact form, particularly for systems satisfying specific commutation relations. We demonstrate the efficiency of our method by simulating quantum channels, such as the continuous-time Pauli channel and damped harmonic oscillators, on NISQ devices, including IonQ Harmony and Quantinuum H1-1. Additionally, we introduce hardware-agnostic error mitigation techniques, including Pauli channel fitting and quantum depolarizing channel inversion, to enhance the fidelity of quantum simulations. Our results show strong agreement between the simulations on real quantum hardware and exact solutions, highlighting the potential of Kraus-based methods for scalable and accurate simulation of open quantum systems on NISQ devices. This framework opens pathways for simulating more complex systems under realistic conditions in the near term.</description>

      <title>Quantum enhanced electric field mapping within semiconductor devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semiconductor components based on silicon carbide (SiC) are a key component for high-power electronics. Their behavior is determined by the interplay of charges and electric fields, which is typically described by modeling and simulations that are calibrated by nonlocal electric properties. So far, there are no experimental methods that allow for the 3D mapping of both the electric field and the concentrations of free charge carriers inside an electronic device. To fulfill this information gap, we propose an operando method that utilizes single silicon vacancy (VSi) centers in 4H-SiC. The VSi centers are at various positions in the intrinsic region of a pin-diode. To monitor the local static electric field, we perform Stark shift measurements based on photoluminescence excitation (PLE), which allows us to infer the expansion of the depletion zone and therefore to determine the local concentration of dopants. Besides this, we show that our measurements allow us to additionally obtain the local concentration of free charge carriers. The method presented here therefore paves the way for a new quantum-enhanced electronic device technology, capable of mapping the interplay of mobile charges and electric fields in a working semiconductor device with nanometer precision.</description>

      <title>Exponents for classical-quantum channel simulation in purified distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determine the exact error and strong converse exponent for entanglement-assisted classical-quantum channel simulation in worst case input purified distance. The error exponent is expressed as a single-letter formula optimized over sandwiched R\'enyi divergences of order $\alpha \in [1, \infty)$, notably without the need for a critical rate--a sharp contrast to the error exponent for classical-quantum channel coding. The strong converse exponent is expressed as a single-letter formula optimized over sandwiched R\'enyi divergences of order $\alpha\in [\frac{1}{2},1]$. As in the classical work [Oufkir et al., arXiv:2410.07051], we start with the goal of asymptotically expanding the meta-converse for channel simulation in the relevant regimes. However, to deal with non-commutativity issues arising from classical-quantum channels and entanglement-assistance, we critically use various properties of the quantum fidelity, additional auxiliary channel techniques, approximations via Chebyshev inequalities, and entropic continuity bounds.</description>

      <title>Error-Detected Quantum Operations with Neutral Atoms Mediated by an Optical Cavity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutral atom quantum processors are a promising platform for large-scale quantum computing. Integrating them with an optical cavity enables fast nondestructive qubit readout and access to fast remote entanglement generation for quantum networking. Here, we introduce a platform for coupling single atoms in optical tweezers to a Fabry-Perot Fiber Cavity. Leveraging the strong atom-cavity coupling, we demonstrate fast qubit state readout with 99.960$^{+14}_{-24}\%$ fidelity and two methods for cavity-mediated entanglement generation with integrated error detection. First, we use cavity-carving to generate a Bell state with 91(4)$\%$ fidelity and a 32(1)$\%$ success rate. Second, we perform a cavity-mediated gate with a deterministic entanglement fidelity of 52.5(18)$\%$, increased to 76(2)$\%$ with error detection. The new capabilities enabled by this platform pave the way towards modular quantum computing and networking.</description>

      <title>Robustness of near-thermal dynamics on digital quantum computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the impact of gate errors on quantum circuits is crucial to determining the potential applications of quantum computers, especially in the absence of large-scale error-corrected hardware. We put forward analytical arguments, corroborated by extensive numerical and experimental evidence, that Trotterized quantum circuits simulating the time-evolution of systems near thermal equilibrium are substantially more robust to both quantum gate errors and Trotter (discretization) errors than is widely assumed. In Quantinuum's trapped-ion computers, the weakly entangling gates that appear in Trotterized circuits can be implemented natively, and their error rate is smaller when they generate less entanglement; from benchmarking, we know that the error for a gate $\exp[-i (Z\otimes Z) \tau]$ decreases roughly linearly with $\tau$, up to a small offset at $\tau = 0$. We provide extensive evidence that this scaling, together with the robustness of near-thermal dynamics to both gate and discretization errors, facilitates substantial improvements in the achievable accuracy of Trotterized dynamics on near-term quantum computers. We make heavy use of a new theoretical tool -- a statistical ensemble of random product states that approximates a thermal state, which can be efficiently prepared with low noise on quantum computers. We outline how the random product state ensemble can be used to predict, optimize, and design Hamiltonian simulation experiments on near-thermal quantum systems.</description>

Abstract: In this note, we establish some connections between standard (data-driven) neural network-based solvers for PDE and eigenvalue problems developed on one side in the applied mathematics and engineering communities (e.g. Deep-Ritz and Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINN)), and on the other side in quantum chemistry (e.g. Variational Monte Carlo algorithms, {\tt Ferminet} or {\tt Paulinet}). In particular, we re-formulate a PINN algorithm as a {\it fitting} problem with data corresponding to the solution to a standard Diffusion Monte Carlo algorithm initialized thanks to a neural network-based Variational Monte Carlo (e.g. {\tt Ferminet}). Connections at the level of the optimization algorithms are also established.</description>

      <title>Attosecond pulses from a solid driven by a synthesized two-color field at megahertz repetition rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Probing coherent quantum dynamics in light-matter interactions at the microscopic level requires high-repetition-rate isolated attosecond pulses (IAPs) in pump-probe experiments. To date, the generation of IAPs has been mainly limited to the kilohertz regime. In this work, we experimentally achieve attosecond control of extreme-ultraviolet (XUV) high harmonics in the wide-bandgap dielectric MgO, driven by a synthesized field of two femtosecond pulses at 800nm and 2000nm with relative phase stability. The resulting quasi-continuous harmonic plateau with ~ 9 eV spectral width centered around 16.5 eV photon energy can be tuned by the two-color phase and supports the generation of an IAP (~ 730 attoseconds), confirmed by numerical simulation based on three-band semiconductor Bloch equations. Leveraging the high-repetition-rate driver laser and the moderate intensity requirements of solid-state high-harmonic generation, we achieve IAP production at an unprecedented megahertz repetition rate, paving the way for all-solid compact XUV sources for IAP generation.</description>

      <title>Diffraction and pseudospectra in non-Hermitian quasiperiodic lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wave dynamics in disordered open media is an intriguing topic, and has lately attracted a lot of attention in non-Hermitian physics, especially in photonics. In fact, spatial distributions of gain and loss elements are physically possible in the context of integrated photonic waveguide arrays. In particular, in these type of lattices, counter-intuitive quantized jumps along the propagation direction appear in the strong disorder limit (where all eigenstates are localized) and they have also been recently experimentally observed. We systematically study the non-Hermitian quasiperiodic Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper model with on-site gain and loss distribution (NHAAH), with an emphasis on the spectral sensitivity based on pseudospectra analysis. Moreover, diffraction dynamics and the quantized jumps, as well as, the effect of saturable nonlinearity, are investigated in detail. Our study reveals the intricate relation between the nonlinearity and non-Hermiticity.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Trained Convolutional Neural Network for Deepfake Audio Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rise of deepfake technologies has posed significant challenges to privacy, security, and information integrity, particularly in audio and multimedia content. This paper introduces a Quantum-Trained Convolutional Neural Network (QT-CNN) framework designed to enhance the detection of deepfake audio, leveraging the computational power of quantum machine learning (QML). The QT-CNN employs a hybrid quantum-classical approach, integrating Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) with classical neural architectures to optimize training efficiency while reducing the number of trainable parameters. Our method incorporates a novel quantum-to-classical parameter mapping that effectively utilizes quantum states to enhance the expressive power of the model, achieving up to 70% parameter reduction compared to classical models without compromising accuracy. Data pre-processing involved extracting essential audio features, label encoding, feature scaling, and constructing sequential datasets for robust model evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that the QT-CNN achieves comparable performance to traditional CNNs, maintaining high accuracy during training and testing phases across varying configurations of QNN blocks. The QT framework's ability to reduce computational overhead while maintaining performance underscores its potential for real-world applications in deepfake detection and other resource-constrained scenarios. This work highlights the practical benefits of integrating quantum computing into artificial intelligence, offering a scalable and efficient approach to advancing deepfake detection technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic resonance image reconstruction starting from undersampled k-space data requires the recovery of many potential nonlinear features, which is very difficult for algorithms to recover these features. In recent years, the development of quantum computing has discovered that quantum convolution can improve network accuracy, possibly due to potential quantum advantages. This article proposes a hybrid neural network containing quantum and classical networks for fast magnetic resonance imaging, and conducts experiments on a quantum computer simulation system. The experimental results indicate that the hybrid network has achieved excellent reconstruction results, and also confirm the feasibility of applying hybrid quantum-classical neural networks into the image reconstruction of rapid magnetic resonance imaging.</description>

      <title>Impurities and polarons in bosonic quantum gases: a review on recent progress</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This review describes the field of Bose polarons, arising when mobile impurities are immersed into a bosonic quantum gas. The latter can be realized by a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) of ultracold atoms, or of exciton polaritons in a semiconductor, which has led to a series of experimental observations of Bose polarons near inter-species Feshbach resonances that we survey. Following an introduction to the topic, with references to its historic roots and a presentation of the Bose polaron Hamiltonian, we summarize state-of-the-art experiments. Next we provide a detailed discussion of polaron models, starting from the ubiquitous Fr\"ohlich Hamiltonian that applies at weak couplings. We proceed by a survey of concurrent theoretical methods used for solving strongly interacting Bose polaron problems. The subsequent sections are devoted to the large bodies of work investigating strong coupling Bose polarons, including detailed comparisons with radio-frequency (RF) spectra obtained in ultracold atom experiments; to investigations of universal few-body and Efimov states associated with a Feshbach resonance in atomic mixtures; to studies of quantum dynamics and polarons out of equilibrium; Bose polarons in low-dimensional; induced interactions among polarons and bipolaron formation; and to Bose polarons at non-zero temperatures. We end our review by detailed discussions of closely related experimental setups and systems, including ionic impurities, systems with strong light-matter interactions, and variations and extensions of the Bose polaron concepts e.g. to baths with topological order or strong interactions relevant for correlated electrons. Finally, an outlook is presented, highlighting possible future research directions and open questions in the field as a whole.</description>

      <title>Exact WKB in all sectors I: Potentials with degenerate saddles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the exact-WKB (EWKB) method through the analysis of Airy and Weber types, with an emphasis on the exact quantization of locally harmonic potentials in multiple sectors. The core innovation of our work lies in introducing a novel complexification approach to the energy parameter $u$, distinct from the common complexification of the (semi-classical) expansion parameter used in Borel summability. This new technique allows for continuous analytical continuation across different sectors of a potential while maintaining the exact quantization condition, even before median summation. By redefining the $A$-cycle above the potential barrier top, we ensure the quantization condition remains real and, by use of the Stokes automorphism and the median resummation, show that the resurgence structure is preserved across transitions between sectors. Furthermore, we extend the Weber-type exact-WKB method, offering exact estimates for quantum actions around all types of saddle points, generalizing previous results. Through the analysis of these quantum actions, we reveal the presence of $S$-duality, facilitating the exchange between perturbative and non-perturbative behaviors, and we conjecture the mapping of the P-NP relations between dual theories. Our study encompasses periodic and symmetric double-well potentials, demonstrating that the exact-WKB method captures intricate structures in quantum systems in all sectors, including multi-instanton contributions and the resurgence of quantum actions.</description>

      <title>Tackling Coherent Noise in Quantum Computing via Cross-Layer Compiler Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing hardware is affected by quantum noise that undermine the quality of results of an executed quantum program. Amongst other quantum noises, coherent error that caused by parameter drifting and miscalibration, remains critical. While coherent error mitigation has been studied before, studies focused either on gate-level or pulse-level -- missing cross-level optimization opportunities; And most of them only target single-qubit gates -- while multi-qubit gates are also used in practice.
  To address above limitations, this work proposes a cross-layer approach for coherent error mitigation that considers program-level, gate-level, and pulse-level compiler optimizations, by leveraging the hidden inverse theory, and exploiting the structure inside different quantum programs, while also considering multi-qubit gates. We implemented our approach as compiler optimization passes, and integrated into IBM Qiskit framework. We tested our technique on real quantum computer (IBM-Brisbane), and demonstrated up to 92% fidelity improvements (45% on average), on several benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Autoionization-enhanced Rydberg dressing by fast contaminant removal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rydberg dressing is a powerful tool for entanglement generation in long-lived atomic states. While already employed effectively in several demonstrations, a key challenge for this technique is the collective loss triggered by blackbody-radiation-driven transitions to contaminant Rydberg states of opposite parity. We demonstrate the rapid removal of such contaminants using autoionization (AI) transitions found in alkaline-earth-like atoms. The AI is shown to be compatible with coherent operation of an array of optical clock qubits. By incorporating AI pulses into a stroboscopic Rydberg dressing (SRD) sequence, we enhance lifetimes by an order of magnitude for system sizes of up to 144 atoms, while maintaining an order of magnitude larger duty cycle than previously achieved. To highlight the utility of our approach, we use the AI-enhanced SRD protocol to improve the degree of spin-squeezing achieved during early-time dressing dynamics. These results bring Rydberg dressing lifetimes closer to fundamental limits, opening the door to previously infeasible dressing proposals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The form of the entanglement Hamiltonian varies with the parameters of the original system. Whether there is a singularity is the key problem for demonstrating/negating the universality of the relation between the entanglement spectrum and edge energy spectrum. We carefully study the phase diagram of a 1D Ising entanglement Hamiltonian as an example to clarify the long-standing controversy of the general relation between the entanglement Hamiltonian and original Hamiltonian. Interestingly, even if the singularities indeed exist, the Li-Haldane-Poilblanc conjecture, i.e., the general relation between the entanglement spectrum and edge energy spectrum, seemingly still holds.</description>

Abstract: We propose a general approach for deriving transparent boundary conditions for the stationary Schroedinger equation with arbitrary potential. It is proven that the transparent boundary conditions can be written in terms of the Weyl-Titchmarsh coefficients. As examples for the application of the proposed approach, two special cases for the stationary Schroedinger equation with the harmonic potential and the Poeschl-Teller potential are considered.</description>

      <title>Probing the Meissner effect in pressurized bilayer nickelate superconductors using diamond quantum sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent reports on the signatures of high-temperature superconductivity with a critical temperature Tc close to 80 K have triggered great research interest and extensive follow-up studies. Although zero-resistance state has been successfully achieved under improved hydrostatic pressure conditions, there is no clear evidence of superconducting diamagnetism in pressurized $\mathrm{La_{3}Ni_{2}O_{7-\delta}}$ due to the low superconducting volume fraction and limited magnetic measurement techniques under high pressure conditions. Here, using shallow nitrogen-vacancy centers implanted on the culet of diamond anvils as in-situ quantum sensors, we observe convincing evidence for the Meissner effect in polycrystalline samples $\mathrm{La_{3}Ni_{2}O_{7-\delta}}$ and $\mathrm{La_{2}PrNi_{2}O_{7}}$: the magnetic field expulsion during both field cooling and field warming processes. The correlated measurements of Raman spectra and NV-based magnetic imaging indicate an incomplete structural transformation related to the displacement of oxygen ions emerging in the non-superconducting region. Furthermore, comparative experiments on different pressure transmitting media (silicone oil and KBr) and nickelates ($\mathrm{La_{3}Ni_{2}O_{7-\delta}}$ and $\mathrm{La_{2}PrNi_{2}O_{7}}$) reveal that an improved hydrostatic pressure conditions and the substitution of La by Pr in $\mathrm{La_{3}Ni_{2}O_{7-\delta}}$ can dramatically increase the superconductivity. Our work clarifies the controversy about the Meissner effect of bilayer nickelate and contributes to a deeper understanding of the mechanism of nickelate high-temperature superconductors.</description>

      <title>Dual-Mode Calorimetric Superconducting Nanowire Single Photon Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A dual-operation mode SNSPD is demonstrated. In the conventional Geiger SNSPD mode the sensor operates at temperatures well below the critical temperature, Tc, working as an event counter without sensitivity to the number of photons impinging the sensor. In the calorimetric mode, the detector is operated at temperatures just below Tc and displays photon-number sensitivity for wavelengths in the optical spectrum. In this energy sensitive mode, photon absorption causes Joule heating of the SNSPD that becomes partially resistive without the presence of latching. Depending on the application, by tuning the sample temperature and bias current using the same readout system, the SNSPD can readily switch between the two modes. In the calorimetric mode, SNSPD recovery times shorter than the ones in the Geiger mode are observed, reaching values as low as 580ps. Dual-mode SNSPD's may provide significant advancements in spectroscopy and calorimetry, where precise timing, photon counting and energy resolution are required.</description>

      <title>Statistics of systemwide correlations in the random-field XXZ chain: Importance of rare events in the many-body localized phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent debates around the many-body localization (MBL) problem, and in particular its stability against systemwide resonances, we investigate long-distance spin-spin correlations across the phase diagram of the random-field XXZ model, with a particular focus on the strong disorder regime. Building on state-of-the-art shift-invert diagonalization techniques, we study the high-energy behavior of transverse and longitudinal correlation functions, computed at the largest possible distance, for a broad range of disorder and interaction strengths. Our results show that while transverse correlations display a fairly stable exponential decay over the entire XXZ phase diagram, longitudinal correlations exhibit markedly different behavior, revealing distinct physical regimes. More precisely, we identify an intermediate disorder region where standard observables show well-converged MBL behavior [J. Colbois et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 116502 (2024)] while the distributions of longitudinal correlations reveal unexpected fat-tails towards large values. These rare events strongly influence the average decay of longitudinal correlations, which we find to be algebraic in a broad region inside the supposed MBL phase, whereas the typical decay remains mostly exponential. At stronger disorder and weaker interactions, this intermediate regime is replaced by a more conventional exponential decay with short correlation lengths for both typical and average correlators, as expected for standard localization. Our findings shed light on the systemwide instabilities and raise important questions about the impact of such rare but large long-range correlations on the stability of the MBL phase. Finally, we discuss the possible fate of the intermediate region in the context of recent perspectives in the field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics and decay of quantum phase coherence for Bose-Einstein condensates in tunnel-coupled quantum wires. The two elongated Bose-Einstein condensates exhibit a wide variety of dynamic phenomena where quantum fluctuations can lead to a rapid loss of phase coherence. We investigate the phenomenon of self-trapping in the relative population imbalance of the two condensates, particularly $\pi$-trapped oscillations that occur when also the relative phase is trapped. Though this state appears stable in mean-field descriptions, the $\pi$-trapped state becomes dynamically unstable due to quantum fluctuations. Nonequilibrium instabilities result in the generation of pairs excited from the condensate to higher momentum modes. We identify tachyonic instabilities, which are associated with imaginary parts of the dispersion relation, and parametric resonance instabilities that are triggered by oscillations of the relative phase and populations. At early times, we compute the instability chart of the characteristic modes through a linearized analysis and identify the underlying physical process. At later times, the primary instabilities trigger secondary instabilities due to the build-up of non-linearities. We perform numerical simulations in the Truncated Wigner approximation in order to observe the dynamics also in this non-linear regime. Furthermore, we discuss realistic parameters for experimental realizations of the $\pi$-mode in ultracold atom setups.</description>

Abstract: Coherence properties are central to quantum systems and are at the heart of phenomena such as superconductivity. Here we study coherence properties of an ultracold Bose gas in a two-dimensional optical lattice across the thermal phase transition. To infer the phase coherence and phase fluctuation profile, we use direct matter-wave imaging of higher Talbot revivals as well as a new phase microscope based on a site-resolved mapping of phase fluctuations to density fluctuations during matter-wave imaging. We observe the algebraic decay of the phase correlations in the superfluid phase and a linear temperature increase of the exponent. These techniques will also allow studying coherence properties in strongly-correlated quantum systems with full spatial resolution.</description>

      <title>How to realize compact and Anderson-like localized states in disorder-free hypercube bosonic networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a method to engineer various zero-energy localized states on disorder-free hypercube graphs. Previous works have already indicated that disorder is not essential for observing localization phenomena in noninteracting systems, with some prominent examples including the 1D Aubry-Andr\'e model, characterized solely by incommensurate potentials, or 2D incommensurate Moir\'e lattices, which exhibit localization due to the flat band spectrum. Moreover, flat band systems with translational invariance can also possess so-called compact localized states, characterized by exactly zero amplitude outside a finite region of the lattice. Here we show that both compact and non-compact (i.e., Anderson-like) localized states can be observed on disorder-free hypercubes that can be constructed in a standard iterative manner via Cartan products. This construction also makes these localized states robust against perturbations. We illustrate and visualize our results on the example of an $8$D hypercube projected on its Petrie polygon. Our findings can be readily tested on existing photonic experimental setups, where hypercube graphs studied can be emulated by bosonic networks of coupled optical cavities and/or waveguides, thus offering potential advancements in the development of various information and wave manipulation protocols.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the precision of currents in a generic multi-terminal quantum-transport setting. Employing scattering theory, we show that the precision of the currents is limited by a function of the particle-current noise that can be interpreted as the activity in the classical limit. We thereby establish a kinetic uncertainty relation for quantum transport. In the full quantum limit, we find precision bounds in which we modify the activity constraints depending on whether the system is fermionic or bosonic. We expect these bounds to be guidelines for any transport process aiming at high precision.</description>

      <title>Response theory for locally gapped systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a notion of a \emph{local gap} for interacting many-body quantum lattice systems and prove the validity of response theory and Kubo's formula for localized perturbations in such settings.
  On a high level, our result shows that the usual spectral gap condition, concerning the system as a whole, is not a necessary condition for understanding local properties of the system.
  More precisely, we say that an equilibrium state $\rho_0$ of a Hamiltonian $H_0$ is locally gapped in $\Lambda^{\mathrm{gap}} \subset \Lambda$, whenever the Liouvillian $- \mathrm{i} \, [H_0, \, \cdot \, ]$ is almost invertible on local observables supported in $\Lambda^{\mathrm{gap}}$ when tested in $\rho_0$.
  To put this into context, we provide other alternative notions of a local gap and discuss their relations.
  The validity of response theory is based on the construction of \emph{non-equilibrium almost stationary states} (NEASSs).
  By controlling locality properties of the NEASS construction, we show that response theory holds to any order, whenever the perturbation \(\epsilon V\) acts in a region which is further than $|\log \epsilon|$ away from the non-gapped region $\Lambda \setminus \Lambda^{\mathrm{gap}}$.</description>

Abstract: We study the question of what is computable by Turing machines equipped with time travel into the past; i.e., with Deutschian closed timelike curves (CTCs) having no bound on their width or length. An alternative viewpoint is that we study the complexity of finding approximate fixed points of computable Markov chains and quantum channels of countably infinite dimension.
  Our main result is that the complexity of these problems is precisely $\Delta_2$, the class of languages Turing-reducible to the Halting problem. Establishing this as an upper bound for qubit-carrying CTCs requires recently developed results in the theory of quantum Markov maps.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2007.10177v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical quantum memories, which store and preserve the quantum state of photons, rely on a coherent mapping of the photonic state onto matter states that are optically accessible. Here we outline and characterize schemes to map the state of photons onto long-lived but optically-inaccessible collective states of noble-gas spins. The mapping employs coherent spin-exchange interaction arising from random collisions with alkali vapor. We propose efficient storage strategies in two operating regimes and analyze their performance for several proposed experimental configurations.</description>

Abstract: We consider the lattice analog of a recently proposed continuum model for the propagation of one- and two-photon states in a random medium. We find that there is localization of single photons in an energy band centered at the resonant energy of the atoms. Moreover, there is also localization of photons at arbitrarily large energies. For the case of two photons, there is localization in an energy band centered at twice the resonant frequency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2110.10587v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The formalism of quantum theory over discrete systems is extended in two significant ways. First, quantum evolutions are generalized to act over entire network configurations, so that nodes may find themselves in a quantum superposition of being connected or not, and be allowed to merge, split and reconnect coherently in a superposition. Second, tensors and traceouts are generalized, so that systems can be partitioned according to almost arbitrary logical predicates in a robust manner. The hereby presented mathematical framework is anchored on solid grounds through numerous lemmas. Indeed, one might have feared that the familiar interrelations between the notions of unitarity, complete positivity, trace-preservation, non-signalling causality, locality and localizability that are standard in quantum theory be jeopardized as the neighbourhood and partitioning between systems become both quantum, dynamical, and logical. Such interrelations in fact carry through, albeit two new notions become instrumental: consistency and comprehension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.04300v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The max-relative entropy and the conditional min-entropy it induces have become central to one-shot information theory. Both may be expressed in terms of a conic program over the positive semidefinite cone. Recently, it was shown that the same conic program altered to be over the separable cone admits an operational interpretation in terms of communicating classical information over a quantum channel. In this work, we generalize this framework of replacing the cone to determine which results in quantum information theory rely upon the positive semidefinite cone and which can be generalized. We show the fully quantum Stein's lemma and asymptotic equipartition property break down if the cone exponentially increases in resourcefulness but never approximates the positive semidefinite cone. However, we show for CQ states, the separable cone is sufficient to recover the asymptotic theory, thereby drawing a strong distinction between the fully and partial quantum settings. We present parallel results for the extended conditional min-entropy. In doing so, we extend the notion of k-superpositive channels to superchannels. We also present operational uses of this framework. We first show the cone restricted min-entropy of a Choi operator captures a measure of entanglement-assisted noiseless classical communication using restricted measurements. We show that quantum majorization results naturally generalize to other cones. As a novel example, we introduce a new min-entropy-like quantity that captures the quantum majorization of quantum channels in terms of bistochastic pre-processing. Lastly, we relate this framework to general conic norms and their non-additivity. Throughout this work we emphasize the introduced measures' relationship to general convex resource theories. In particular, we look at both resource theories that capture locality and resource theories of coherence/Abelian symmetries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.13502v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a quantum topological frequency converter, realized by coupling a qubit to two slow harmonic modes. The dynamics of such a system is the quantum analog of topological pumping. Our quantum mechanical description shows that an initial state generically evolves into a superposition of two adiabatic states. The topological nature of the coupling between the qubit and the modes splits these two components apart in energy: for each component, an energy transfer at a quantized rate occurs between the two quantum modes, in opposite directions for the two components, reminiscent of the topological pumping. We denote such a superposition of two quantum adiabatic states distinguishable through measures of the modes' energy an adiabatic cat state. We show that the topological coupling enhances the entanglement between the qubit and the modes, and we unveil the role of the quantum or Fubini-Study metric in the characterization of this entanglement.</description>

Abstract: It is known that general convertibility of bipartite entangled states is not possible to arbitrary error without some classical communication. While some trade-offs between communication cost and conversion error have been proven, these bounds can be very loose. In particular, there are many cases in which tolerable error might be achievable using zero-communication protocols. In this work we address these cases by deriving the optimal fidelity of pure state conversions under local unitaries as well as local operations and shared randomness (LOSR). We also uses these results to explore catalytic conversions between pure states using zero communication.</description>

Abstract: We explore topology-localization phase diagram by simulating one-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model with quasiperiodic disorder using a programmable superconducting simulator. We experimentally map out and identify various trivial and topological phases with extended, critical, and localized bulk states. We find that with increasing disorder strength, some extended states can be first replaced by localized states and then by critical states before the system finally becomes fully localized. The critical states exhibit typical features such as multifractality and self-similarity, which lead to surprisingly rich phases with different types of mobility edges and scaling behaviors on the phase boundaries. Our results shed new light on the investigation of the topological and localization phenomena in condensed-matter physics.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate an approach to computing the vibrational energy levels of molecules that combines the discrete variable representation (DVR) of molecular Hamiltonians with variational quantum eigensolvers (VQE) and a greedy search of optimal quantum gate sequences. We show that the structure of the DVR Hamiltonians reduces the quantum measurement complexity scaling from exponential to polynomial, allowing for efficient VQE without second quantization. We then demonstrate that DVR Hamiltonians also lead to very efficient quantum ansatze for representing ro-vibrational states of molecules by states of a quantum computer. To obtain these compact representations, we demonstrate the quantum ansatz search by computing the vibrational energy levels of Cr$_2$ in seven electronic states as well as of van der Waals complexes Ar-HCl and Mg-NH. Our numerical results show that accuracy of 1~cm$^{-1}$ can be achieved by very shallow circuits with 2 to 9 entangling gates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.06373v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to study the delay-dependent coherent feedback dynamics by focusing on one typical realization, i.e., a two-atom quantum network whose feedback loop is closed by a semi-infinite waveguide. In this set-up, an initially excited two-level atom can emit a photon into the waveguide, where the propagating photon can be reflected by the terminal mirror of the waveguide or absorbed by the other atom, thus constructing various coherent feedback loops. We show that there can be two-photon, one-photon or zero-photon states in the waveguide, which can be controlled by the feedback loop length and the coupling strengths between the atoms and waveguide. The photonic states in the waveguide are analyzed in both the frequency domain and the spatial domain, and the transient process of photon emissions is better understood based on a comprehensive analysis using both domains. Interestingly, we clarify that this quantum coherent feedback network can be mathematically modeled as a linear control system with multiple delays, which are determined by the distances between atoms and the terminal mirror of the semi-infinite waveguide. Therefore, based on time-delayed linear control system theory, the influence of delays on the stability of the quantum state evolution and the steady-state atomic and photonic states is investigated, for both small and large delays.</description>

Abstract: Quantum Random Access Memory (QRAM) is a critical component for enabling data queries in superposition, which is the cornerstone of quantum algorithms. Among various QRAM architectures, the bucket-brigade model stands out due to its noise resilience. This paper presents a hardware-efficient native gate set {iSCZ, C-iSCZ} for implementing bucket-brigade QRAM on superconducting platforms. The experimental feasibility of the proposed gate set is demonstrated, showing high fidelity and reduced complexity. By leveraging the complementary control property in QRAM, our approach directly substitutes the conventional {SWAP, CSWAP} gates with the new gate set, eliminating decomposition overhead and significantly reducing circuit depth and gate count.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.09593v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the limitations of quantum computers for solving nonlinear dynamical systems. In particular, we tighten the worst-case bounds of the quantum Carleman linearisation (QCL) algorithm [Liu et al., PNAS 118, 2021] answering one of their open questions. We provide a further significant limitation for any quantum algorithm that aims to output a quantum state that approximates the normalized solution vector. Given a natural choice of coordinates for a dynamical system with one or more positive Lyapunov exponents and solutions that grow sub-exponentially, we prove that any such algorithm has complexity scaling at least exponentially in the integration time. As such, an efficient quantum algorithm for simulating chaotic systems or regimes is likely not possible.</description>

Abstract: The detection of microwave fields at single-photon power levels is a much sought-after technology, with practical applications in nanoelectronics and quantum information science. Here we demonstrate a simple yet powerful criticality-enhanced method of microwave photon detection by operating a magnetic-field tunable Kerr Josephson parametric amplifier near a first-order quantum phase transition. We obtain a 73% efficiency and a dark-count rate of 167 kHz, corresponding to a responsivity of $1.3 \times 10^{17}~\mathrm{W}^{-1}$ and noise-equivalent power of 3.28 zW/$\sqrt{\rm Hz}$. We verify the single-photon operation by extracting the Poissonian statistics of a coherent probe signal.</description>

      <title>Long-range-enhanced surface codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.11719v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The surface code is a quantum error-correcting code for one logical qubit, protected by spatially localized parity checks in two dimensions. Due to fundamental constraints from spatial locality, storing more logical qubits requires either sacrificing the robustness of the surface code against errors or increasing the number of physical qubits. We bound the minimal number of spatially nonlocal parity checks necessary to add logical qubits to a surface code while maintaining, or improving, robustness to errors. We saturate the lower limit of this bound, when the number of added logical qubits is a constant, using a family of hypergraph product codes, interpolating between the surface code and constant-rate low-density parity-check codes. Fault-tolerant protocols for logical gates in the quantum code can be inherited from its classical parent codes. We provide near-term practical implementations of this code for hardware based on trapped ions or neutral atoms in mobile optical tweezers. Long-range-enhanced surface codes outperform conventional surface codes using hundreds of physical qubits, and represent a practical strategy to enhance the robustness of logical qubits to errors in near-term devices.</description>

      <title>Preparing a commercial quantum key distribution system for certification against implementation loopholes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.20107v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A commercial quantum key distribution (QKD) system needs to be formally certified to enable its wide deployment. The certification should include the system's robustness against known implementation loopholes and attacks that exploit them. Here we ready a fiber-optic QKD system for this procedure. The system has a prepare-and-measure scheme with decoy-state BB84 protocol, polarisation encoding, qubit source rate of 312.5 MHz, and is manufactured by QRate. We detail its hardware and post-processing. We analyse the hardware for known implementation loopholes, search for possible new loopholes, and discuss countermeasures. We then amend the system design to address the highest-risk loopholes identified. We also work out technical requirements on the certification lab and outline its possible structure.</description>

      <title>Simulating Heavy-Hex Transverse Field Ising Model Magnetization Dynamics Using Programmable Quantum Annealers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01657v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, a Hamiltonian dynamics simulation was performed on a kicked ferromagnetic 2D transverse field Ising model with a connectivity graph native to the 127 qubit heavy-hex IBM Quantum architecture using ZNE quantum error mitigation. We demonstrate that one of the observables in this Trotterized Hamiltonian dynamics simulation, namely magnetization, can be efficiently simulated on current superconducting qubit-based programmable quantum annealing computers. We show this using two distinct methods: reverse quantum annealing and h-gain state encoding. This simulation is possible because the 127 qubit heavy-hex connectivity graph can be natively embedded onto the D-Wave Pegasus quantum annealer hardware graph and because there exists a direct equivalence between the energy scales of the two types of quantum computers. We derive equivalent anneal pauses in order to simulate the Trotterized quantum circuit dynamics for varying Rx rotations $\theta_h \in (0, \frac{\pi}{2}]$, using quantum annealing processors. Multiple disjoint instances of the Ising model of interest can be embedded onto the D-Wave Pegasus hardware graph, allowing for parallel quantum annealing. We report equivalent magnetization dynamics using quantum annealing for time steps of 20, 50 up to 10,000, which we find are consistent with exact classical 27 qubit heavy-hex Trotterized circuit magnetization dynamics, and we observe reasonable, albeit noisy, agreement with the existing simulations for single site magnetization at 20 Trotter steps. The quantum annealers are able to simulate equivalent magnetization dynamics for thousands of time steps, significantly out of the computational reach of the digital quantum computers on which the original Hamiltonian dynamics simulations were performed.</description>

      <title>Online Learning Quantum States with the Logarithmic Loss via VB-FTRL</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.04237v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Online learning of quantum states with the logarithmic loss (LL-OLQS) is a quantum generalization of online portfolio selection (OPS), a classic open problem in online learning for over three decades. This problem also emerges in designing stochastic optimization algorithms for maximum-likelihood quantum state tomography. Recently, Jezequel et al. (arXiv:2209.13932) proposed the VB-FTRL algorithm, the first regret-optimal algorithm for OPS with moderate computational complexity. In this paper, we generalize VB-FTRL for LL-OLQS. Let $d$ denote the dimension and $T$ the number of rounds. The generalized algorithm achieves a regret rate of $O ( d^2 \log ( d + T ) )$ for LL-OLQS. Each iteration of the algorithm consists of solving a semidefinite program that can be implemented in polynomial time by, for example, cutting-plane methods. For comparison, the best-known regret rate for LL-OLQS is currently $O ( d^2 \log T )$, achieved by an exponential weight method. However, no explicit implementation is available for the exponential weight method for LL-OLQS. To facilitate the generalization, we introduce the notion of VB-convexity. VB-convexity is a sufficient condition for the volumetric barrier associated with any function to be convex and is of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Multidimensional Electrical Networks and their Application to Exponential Speedups for Graph Problems</title>

Abstract: Recently, Apers and Piddock [TQC '23] strengthened the connection between quantum walks and electrical networks via Kirchhoff's Law and Ohm's Law. In this work, we develop a new multidimensional electrical network by defining Alternative Kirchhoff's Law and Alternative Ohm's Law based on the multidimensional quantum walk framework by Jeffery and Zur [STOC '23]. In analogy to the connection between the incidence matrix of a graph and Kirchhoff's Law and Ohm's Law in an electrical network, we rebuild the connection between the alternative incidence matrix and Alternative Kirchhoff's Law and Alternative Ohm's Law. This new framework enables generating an alternative electrical flow over the edges on graphs, which has the potential to be applied to a broader range of graph problems, benefiting both quantum and classical algorithm design.
  We first use this framework to generate quantum alternative electrical flow states and use it to find a marked vertex in one-dimensional random hierarchical graphs as defined by Balasubramanian, Li, and Harrow [arXiv '23]. In this work, they generalised the exponential quantum-classical separation of the welded tree graph by Childs, Cleve, Deotto, Farhi, Gutmann, and Spielman [STOC '03] to random hierarchical graphs. Our result partially recovers their results with an arguably simpler analysis.
  Furthermore, this framework also allows us to demonstrate an exponential quantum speedup for the pathfinding problem in a type of regular graph, which we name the welded tree circuit graph. The exponential quantum advantage is obtained by efficiently generating quantum alternative electrical flow states and then sampling from them to find an s-t path in the welded tree circuit graph. By comparison, Li [arXiv '23] constructed a non-regular graph based on welded trees and used the degree information to achieve a similar speedup.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09218v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The traditional view from particle physics is that quantum gravity effects should only become detectable at extremely high energies and small length scales. Due to the significant technological challenges involved, there has been limited progress in identifying experimentally detectable effects that can be accessed in the foreseeable future. However, in recent decades, the size and mass of quantum systems that can be controlled in the laboratory have reached unprecedented scales, enabled by advances in ground-state cooling and quantum-control techniques. Preparations of massive systems in quantum states pave the way for the explorations of a low-energy regime in which gravity can be both sourced and probed by quantum systems. Such approaches constitute an increasingly viable alternative to accelerator-based, laser-interferometric, torsion-balance, and cosmological tests of gravity. In this review, we provide an overview of proposals where massive quantum systems act as interfaces between quantum mechanics and gravity. We discuss conceptual difficulties in the theoretical description of quantum systems in the presence of gravity, review tools for modeling massive quantum systems in the laboratory, and provide an overview of the current state-of-the-art experimental landscape. Proposals covered in this review include, among others, precision tests of gravity, tests of gravitationally-induced wavefunction collapse and decoherence, as well as gravitymediated entanglement. We conclude the review with an outlook and summary of the key questions raised.</description>

      <title>Efficient quantum algorithm to simulate open systems through a single environmental qubit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.10009v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an efficient algorithm for simulating open quantum systems dynamics described by the Lindblad master equation on quantum computers, addressing key challenges in the field. In contrast to existing approaches, our method achieves two significant advancements. First, we employ a repetition of unitary gates on a set of $n$ system qubits and, remarkably, only a single ancillary bath qubit representing the environment. It follows that, for the typical case of $m$-locality of the Lindblad operators, we reach an exponential improvement of the number of ancilla in terms of $m$ and up to a polynomial improvement in ancilla overhead for large $n$ with respect to other approaches. Although stochasticity is introduced, requiring multiple circuit realizations, the sampling overhead is independent of the system size. Secondly, we show that, under fixed accuracy conditions, our algorithm enables a reduction in the number of trotter steps compared to other approaches, substantially decreasing circuit depth. These advancements hold particular significance for near-term quantum computers, where minimizing both width and depth is critical due to inherent noise in their dynamics.</description>

      <title>Creating and controlling global Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger entanglement on quantum processors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08284v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states, also known as two-component Schr\"{o}dinger cats, play vital roles in the foundation of quantum physics and, more attractively, in future quantum technologies such as fault-tolerant quantum computation. Enlargement in size and coherent control of GHZ states are both crucial for harnessing entanglement in advanced computational tasks with practical advantages, which unfortunately pose tremendous challenges as GHZ states are vulnerable to noise. Here we propose a general strategy for creating, preserving, and manipulating large-scale GHZ entanglement, and demonstrate a series of experiments underlined by high-fidelity digital quantum circuits. For initialization, we employ a scalable protocol to create genuinely entangled GHZ states with up to 60 qubits, almost doubling the previous size record. For protection, we take a new perspective on discrete time crystals (DTCs), originally for exploring exotic nonequilibrium quantum matters, and embed a GHZ state into the eigenstates of a tailor-made cat scar DTC to extend its lifetime. For manipulation, we switch the DTC eigenstates with in-situ quantum gates to modify the effectiveness of the GHZ protection. Our findings establish a viable path towards coherent operations on large-scale entanglement, and further highlight superconducting processors as a promising platform to explore nonequilibrium quantum matters and emerging applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11350v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Relaxing the postulates of an axiomatic theory is a natural way to find more general theories, and historically, the discovery of non-Euclidean geometry is a famous example of this procedure. Here, we use this way to extend quantum mechanics by ignoring the heart of Heisenberg's quantum mechanics -- We do not assume the existence of a position operator that satisfies the Heisenberg commutation relation, $[\hat x,\hat p]=i\hbar$. The remaining axioms of quantum theory, besides Galilean symmetry, lead to a more general quantum theory with a free parameter $l_0$ of length dimension, such that as $l_0 \to 0$ the theory reduces to standard quantum theory. Perhaps surprisingly, this non-Heisenberg quantum theory, without a priori assumption of the non-commutation relation, leads to a modified Heisenberg uncertainty relation, $\Delta x \Delta p\geq \sqrt{\hbar^2/4+l_0^2(\Delta p)^2}$, which ensures the existence of a minimal position uncertainty, $l_0$, as expected from various quantum gravity studies. By comparing the results of this framework with some observed data, which includes the first longitudinal normal modes of the bar gravitational wave detector AURIGA and the $1S-2S$ transition in the hydrogen atom, we obtain upper bounds on the $l_0$.</description>

Abstract: We consider a thermodynamic framework to quantify instrument incompatibility via a resource theory subject to thermodynamic constraints. We use the minimal thermalisation time needed to erase incompatibility's signature to measure incompatibility. Unexpectedly, this time value is equivalent to incompatibility advantage in a work extraction task. Hence, both thermalisation time and extractable work can directly quantify instrument incompatibility. Finally, we show that incompatibility signatures must vanish in non-Markovian thermalisation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16289v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many-particle entanglement is a key resource for achieving the fundamental precision limits of a quantum sensor. Optical atomic clocks, the current state-of-the-art in frequency precision, are a rapidly emerging area of focus for entanglement-enhanced metrology. Augmenting tweezer-based clocks featuring microscopic control and detection with the high-fidelity entangling gates developed for atom-array information processing offers a promising route towards leveraging highly entangled quantum states for improved optical clocks. Here we develop and employ a family of multi-qubit Rydberg gates to generate Schr\"odinger cat states of the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) type with up to 9 optical clock qubits in a programmable atom array. In an atom-laser comparison at sufficiently short dark times, we demonstrate a fractional frequency instability below the standard quantum limit using GHZ states of up to 4 qubits. However, due to their reduced dynamic range, GHZ states of a single size fail to improve the achievable clock precision at the optimal dark time compared to unentangled atoms. Towards overcoming this hurdle, we simultaneously prepare a cascade of varying-size GHZ states to perform unambiguous phase estimation over an extended interval. These results demonstrate key building blocks for approaching Heisenberg-limited scaling of optical atomic clock precision.</description>

Abstract: Unitary operators are employed to investigate the violation of the Bell-CHSH inequality. The ensuing modifications affecting both classical and quantum bounds are elucidated. The relevance of a particular class of unitary operators whose expectation values are real is pointed out. For these operators, the classical and quantum bounds remain unaltered, being given, respectively, by $2$ and $2\sqrt{2}$. As an example, the Weyl unitary operators for a real scalar field in relativistic Quantum Field Theory are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07115v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose efficient algorithms for classically simulating Gaussian unitaries and measurements applied to non-Gaussian initial states. The constructions are based on decomposing the non-Gaussian states into linear combinations of Gaussian states. We use an extension of the covariance matrix formalism to efficiently track relative phases in the superpositions of Gaussian states. We get an exact simulation algorithm which cost scales quadratically with the number of Gaussian states required to represent the initial state and an approximate simulation algorithm which cost scales linearly with the $l_1$ norm of the coefficients associated with the superposition. We define measures of non-Gaussianty quantifying this simulation cost, which we call the Gaussian rank and the Gaussian extent. From the perspective of quantum resource theories, we investigate the properties of this type of non-Gaussianity measure and compute optimal decomposition for states relevant to continuous-variable quantum computing.</description>

Abstract: Dynamical quantum phase transitions, encompassing phenomena like many-body localization transitions and measurement-induced phase transitions, are often characterized and identified through the analysis of quantum entanglement. Here, we highlight that the dynamical phases defined by entanglement are further enriched by complexity. We investigate both the entanglement and Krylov complexity for fermions on regular graphs, which can be implemented by systems like $^6$Li atoms confined by optical tweezers. Our investigations unveil that while entanglement follows volume laws on both types of regular graphs with degree $d = 2$ and $d = 3$, the Krylov complexity exhibits distinctive behaviors. We analyze both free fermions and interacting fermions models. In the absence of interaction, both numerical results and theoretical analysis confirm that the dimension of the Krylov space scales as $D\sim N$ for regular graphs of degree $d = 2$ with $N$ sites, and we have $D\sim N^2$ for $d = 3$. The qualitative distinction also persists in interacting fermions on regular graphs. For interacting fermions, our theoretical analyses find the dimension scales as $D\sim 4^{N^\alpha}$ for regular graphs of $d = 2$ with $0.38\leq\alpha\leq0.59$, whereas it scales as $D\sim 4^N$ for $d = 3$. The distinction in the complexity of quantum dynamics for fermions on graphs with different connectivity can be probed in experiments by measuring the out-of-time-order correlators.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic measurements and models of energy deposition in the substrate of quantum circuits by natural ionizing radiation</title>

Abstract: Naturally occurring background radiation is a source of correlated decoherence events in superconducting qubits that will challenge error-correction schemes. To characterize the radiation environment in an unshielded laboratory, we performed broadband, spectroscopic measurements of background events in silicon substrates located inside a millikelvin refrigerator, an environment representative of superconducting qubit systems. We measured the background spectra in silicon substrates of two thicknesses, 0.5 mm and 1.5 mm, and obtained the average event rate and the integrated power deposition. In a 25 mm^2 area and the thinner substrate, these values are 0.023 events per second and 4.9 keV/s, counting events that deposit at least 40 keV. We find the background spectrum to be nearly featureless. Its intensity decreases by a factor of 40,000 between 100 keV and 3 MeV for silicon substrates 0.5 mm thick. We find the cryogenic measurements to be in good agreement with predictions based on measurements of the terrestrial gamma-ray flux, published models of cosmic-ray fluxes, a crude model of the cryostat, and radiation-transport simulations. No free parameters are required to predict the background spectra in the silicon substrates. The good agreement between measurements and predictions allow assessment of the relative contributions of terrestrial and cosmic background sources and their dependence on substrate thickness. Our spectroscopic measurements are performed with superconducting microresonators that transduce deposited energy to a readily detectable electrical signal. We find that gamma-ray emissions from radioisotopes are responsible for the majority of events depositing E&lt;1.5 MeV, while nucleons among the cosmic-ray secondary particles cause most events that deposit more energy. These results suggest several paths to reducing the impact of background radiation on quantum circuits.</description>

      <title>Discrete-Time Open Quantum Walks for Vertex Ranking in Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14770v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article presents a new quantum PageRank algorithm on graphs using discrete-time open quantum walks. Google's PageRank is an essential algorithm for arranging the web pages on the World Wide Web in classical computation. From a broader perspective, it is also a fundamental measure for quantifying the importance of vertices in a network. Similarly, the new quantum PageRank also serves to quantify the significance of a network's vertices. In this work, we extend the concept of discrete-time open quantum walk on arbitrary directed and undirected graphs by utilizing the Weyl operators as Kraus operators. This new model of quantum walk is useful for building up the quantum PageRank algorithm, discussed in this article. We compare the classical PageRank and the newly defined quantum PageRank for different types of complex networks, such as the scale-free network, Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random network, Watts-Strogatz network, spatial network, Zachary Karate club network, GNC, GN, GNR networks, Barab\'asi and Albert network, etc. In addition, we study the convergence of the quantum PageRank process and its dependency on the damping factor $\alpha$. We observe that this quantum pagerank procedure is faster than many other proposals reported in the literature.</description>

      <title>Efficient Quantum Simulation Algorithms in the Path Integral Formulation</title>

Abstract: We provide a new paradigm for quantum simulation that is based on path integration that allows quantum speedups to be observed for problems that are more naturally expressed using the path integral formalism rather than the conventional sparse Hamiltonian formalism. We provide two novel quantum algorithms based on Hamiltonian versions of the path integral formulation and another for Lagrangians of the form $\frac{m}{2}\dot{x}^2 - V(x)$. This Lagrangian path integral algorithm is based on a new rigorous derivation of a discrete version of the Lagrangian path integral. Our first Hamiltonian path integral method breaks up the paths into short timesteps. It is efficient under appropriate sparsity assumptions and requires a number of queries to oracles that give the eigenvalues and overlaps between the eigenvectors of the Hamiltonian terms that scales as $t^{o(1)}/\epsilon^{o(1)}$ for simulation time $t$ and error $\epsilon$. The second approach uses long-time path integrals for near-adiabatic systems and has query complexity that scales as $O(1/\sqrt{\epsilon})$ if the energy eigenvalue gaps and simulation time is sufficiently long. Finally, we show that our Lagrangian simulation algorithm requires a number of queries to an oracle that computes the discrete Lagrangian that scales for a system with $\eta$ particles in $D+1$ dimensions, in the continuum limit, as $\widetilde{O}(\eta D t^2/\epsilon)$ if $V(x)$ is bounded and finite and the wave function obeys appropriate position and momentum cutoffs. This shows that Lagrangian dynamics can be efficiently simulated on quantum computers and opens up the possibility for quantum field theories for which the Hamiltonian is unknown to be efficiently simulated on quantum computers.</description>

Abstract: Atomic interferometers measure phase differences along paths with exceptional precision. Tweezer interferometry represents a novel approach for this measurement by guiding particles along predefined trajectories. This study explores the feasibility of using condensed bosons in tweezer interferometry. Unlike the factor $\sqrt{N}$ enhancement expected with classical ensembles, using NOON state interferometry can yield an enhancement by a factor of $N$. We consider a protocol for a tweezer-based NOON state interferometer that includes adiabatic splitting and merging of condensed bosons, followed by adiabatic branching for phase encoding. Our theoretical analysis focuses on the conditions necessary to achieve adiabaticity and avoid spontaneous symmetry breaking. Additionally, we demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed scheme and estimate the time required to perform these sweep processes.</description>

Abstract: We consider multipartite quantum state discrimination and provide a specific relation between the properties of entanglement witness and quantum nonlocality inherent in the confidence of measurements. We first provide the definition of the confidence of measurements as well as its useful properties for various types of multipartite measurements. We show that globally maximum confidence that cannot be achieved by local operations and classical communication strongly depends on the existence of entanglement witness. We also provide conditions for an upper bound on maximum of locally-achievable confidences. Finally, we establish a method in terms of entanglement witness to construct quantum state ensemble with nonlocal maximum confidences.</description>

      <title>Generating multipartite nonlocality to benchmark quantum computers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07659v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that quantum computers can be used for producing large $n$-partite nonlocality, thereby providing a method to benchmark them. The main challenges to overcome are: (i) The interaction topology might not allow arbitrary two-qubit gates. (ii) Noise limits the Bell violation. (iii) The number of combinations of local measurements grows exponentially with $n$. To overcome (i), we point out that graph states that are compatible with the two-qubit connectivity of the computer can be efficiently prepared. To mitigate (ii), we note that, for specific graph states, there are $n$-partite Bell inequalities whose resistance to white noise increases exponentially with $n$. To address (iii) for any $n$ and any connectivity, we introduce an estimator that relies on random sampling. As a result, we propose a method for producing $n$-partite Bell nonlocality with unprecedented large $n$. This allows in return to benchmark nonclassical correlations regardless of the number of qubits or the connectivity. We test our approach by using a simulation for a noisy IBM quantum computer, which predicts $n$-partite Bell nonlocality for at least $n=24$ qubits.</description>

      <title>Global calibration of large-scale photonic integrated circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02207v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The advancing maturity of photonic integrated circuit (PIC) fabrication technology enables the high integration of an increasing number of optical components onto a single chip. With the incremental circuit complexity, the calibration of active phase shifters in a large-scale PIC becomes a crucially important issue. The traditional one-by-one calibration techniques encounter significant hurdles with the propagation of calibration errors, and achieving the decoupling of all phase shifters for independent calibration is not straightforward. To address this issue, we propose a global calibration approach for large-scale PIC. Our method utilizes a custom network to simultaneously learn the nonlinear phase-current relations for all thermo-optic phase shifters on the PIC by minimizing the negative likelihood of the measurement datasets. Moreover, the reflectivities of all static beamsplitter components can also be synchronizedly extracted using this calibration method. As an example, a quantum walk PIC with a circuit depth of 12 is calibrated, and a programmable discrete-time quantum walk is experimentally demonstrated. These results will greatly benefit the applications of large-scale PICs in photonic quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Superselection rules and bosonic quantum computational resources</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03138v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a method to systematically identify and classify quantum optical non-classical states as classical/non-classical based on the resources they create on a bosonic quantum computer. This is achieved by converting arbitrary bosonic states into multiple modes, each occupied by a single photon, thereby defining qubits of a bosonic quantum computer. Starting from a bosonic classical-like state in a representation that explicitly respects particle number super-selection rules, we apply universal gates to create arbitrary superpositions of states with the same total particle number. The non-classicality of the corresponding states can then be associated to the operations they induce in the quantum computer. We also provide a correspondence between the adopted representation and the more conventional one in quantum optics, where superpositions of Fock states describe quantum optical states, and we identify how multi-mode states can lead to quantum advantage. Our work contributes to establish a seamless transition from continuous to discrete properties of quantum optics while laying the grounds for a description of non-classicality and quantum computational advantage that is applicable to spin systems as well.</description>

      <title>A polynomial-time classical algorithm for noisy quantum circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12768v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a polynomial-time classical algorithm for noisy quantum circuits. The algorithm computes the expectation value of any observable for any circuit, with a small average error over input states drawn from an ensemble (e.g. the computational basis). Our approach is based upon the intuition that noise exponentially damps non-local correlations relative to local correlations. This enables one to classically simulate a noisy quantum circuit by only keeping track of the dynamics of local quantum information. Our algorithm also enables sampling from the output distribution of a circuit in quasi-polynomial time, so long as the distribution anti-concentrates. A number of practical implications are discussed, including a fundamental limit on the efficacy of noise mitigation strategies: for constant noise rates, any quantum circuit for which error mitigation is efficient on most input states, is also classically simulable on most input states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20396v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we derive a number of chain rules for mutual information quantities, suitable for analyzing quantum cryptography with imperfect devices that leak additional information to an adversary. First, we derive a chain rule between smooth min-entropy and smooth max-information, which improves over previous chain rules for characterizing one-shot information leakage caused by an additional conditioning register. Second, we derive an ''information bounding theorem'' that bounds the R\'enyi mutual information of a state produced by a sequence of channels, in terms of the R\'enyi mutual information of the individual channel outputs, similar to entropy accumulation theorems. In particular, this yields simple bounds on the smooth max-information in the preceding chain rule. Third, we derive chain rules between R\'enyi entropies and R\'enyi mutual information, which can be used to modify the entropy accumulation theorem to accommodate leakage registers sent to the adversary in each round of a protocol. We show that these results can be used to handle some device imperfections in a variety of device-dependent and device-independent protocols, such as randomness generation and quantum key distribution.</description>

      <title>Petz map recovery for long-range entangled quantum many-body states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00857v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a tripartite quantum state on $A,B,C$ and the erasure channel on $C$, the rotated Petz map is a recovery channel that acts on $B$ to recover the erased quantum information. The infidelity of the best recovery is upper-bounded by the conditional mutual information (CMI). In this work, we study the infidelity of the rotated Petz map on several physically-relevant long-range entangled quantum states. Specifically, we study three classes of quantum phases: (i) steady states of measurement-induced phase transitions, (ii) critical ground state under local measurements, and (iii) chiral states under local measurements. We find that the averaged infidelity of the Petz map recovery sharply distinguishes the three classes: (i) and (ii) are distinguished by the scaling of the infidelity with CMI and (iii) is characterized by an asymmetry of the infidelity with the rotation parameter. We also study Petz map recovery for topological order and find an operational interpretation of the topological entanglement entropy. Our result indicates that recovery fidelity of the Petz map is a useful diagnostic of quantum phases of matter.</description>

      <title>Robustness and classical proxy of entanglement in variants of quantum walk</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05597v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum walk (QW) utilizes its internal quantum states to decide the displacement, thereby introducing single-particle entanglement between the internal and positional degrees of freedom. By simulating three variants of QW with the conventional, symmetric, and split-step translation operators with or without classical randomness in the coin operator, we show the entanglement is robust against both time- and spatially- dependent randomness, which can cause localization transitions of QW. We propose a classical quantity call overlap, which literally measures the overlap between the probability distributions of the internal states, as a proxy of entanglement. The overlap is associated with the off-diagonal terms of the reduced density matrix in the internal space, which then reflects its purity. Therefore, the overlap captures the inverse behavior of the entanglement entropy in most cases. We test the limitation of the classical proxy by constructing a special case with high population imbalance between the internal states to blind the overlap. Possible implications and experimental measurements are also discussed.</description>

      <title>A Quantum Approximate Optimization Method For Finding Hadamard Matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07964v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Finding a Hadamard matrix of a specific order using a quantum computer can lead to a demonstration of practical quantum advantage. Earlier efforts using a quantum annealer were impeded by the limitations of the present quantum resource and its capability to implement high order interaction terms, which for an $M$-order matrix will grow by $O(M^2)$. In this paper, we propose a novel qubit-efficient method by implementing the Hadamard matrix searching algorithm on a gate-based quantum computer. We achieve this by employing the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). Since high order interaction terms that are implemented on a gate-based quantum computer do not need ancillary qubits, the proposed method reduces the required number of qubits into $O(M)$. We present the formulation of the method, construction of corresponding quantum circuits, and experiment results in both a quantum simulator and a real gate-based quantum computer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07997v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum Energy Teleportation (QET) is a novel method that leverages quantum entanglement to transfer energy between two distant locations without any physical movement of the energy. The first realization of QET on superconducting hardware, utilizing a 2-qubit system, demonstrated an average energy retrieval efficiency of 35.4% (observing only V ) by the receiver, Bob. In this paper, we present a new approach using a 3-qubit system to enhance the energy efficiency of QET. We have incorporated a novel 3-qubit ground state Hamiltonian H to achieve this, which conforms to the constraints of Zero mean energy and anti-commutative properties of the operations on the observable of the senders and receiver. Our experimental results show a significant improvement in terms of energy retrieval. Though the Multiple-Input Single-Output (MISO) model demonstrates a similar result achieving an average efficiency of 32.5% (observing only V ), the Single-Input Multiple-Output (SIMO) model shows a significantly higher result than that of the 2-qubit system considering practical usage, which is 58.2%</description>

      <title>Good binary quantum codes with transversal CCZ gate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10140v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give an asymptotically good family of quantum CSS codes on qubits with a transversal CCZ gate, meaning that the parallel logical CCZ on all logical qubits is performed by parallel physical CCZs on (a subset of) physical qubits. The construction is based on the observation that any classical code satisfying a multiplication property can be used to construct a quantum CSS code with transversal (qudit) CCZ. To obtain a constant-rate and linear-distance family, we then instantiate this construction with a classical good family of algebraic-geometry codes on a non-binary, but constant-sized, alphabet. Finally, we use a technique from the arithmetic secret sharing literature to reduce the alphabet to binary. As a corollary, the constructed code family provides a magic state distillation scheme with constant space overhead.</description>

      <title>On estimates of trace-norm distance between quantum Gaussian states</title>

Abstract: In the paper of F.A. Mele, A.A. Mele, L. Bittel, J. Eisert, V. Giovannetti, L. Lami, L. Leone, S.F.E. Oliviero, ArXiv:2405.01431, estimates for the trace-norm distance between two quantum Gaussian states in terms of the mean vectors and covariance matrices were derived and used to evaluate the number of elements in the $\varepsilon -$net in the set of energy-constrained Gaussian states. In the present paper we obtain different estimates; our proof is based on a fidelity-like quantity which we call states overlap, and is more straightforward leading to estimates which are sometimes even more stringent, especially in the cases of pure or gauge-invariant states. They do not depend on number of modes and hence can be extended to the case of bosonic field with infinite number of modes. These derivations are not aimed to replace the useful inequalities from ArXiv:2405.01431; they just show an alternative approach to the problem leading to different results. In the Appendix we briefly recall our results concerning estimates of the overlap for general fermionic Gaussian states of CAR. The problem studied in this paper can be considered as a noncommutative analog of estimation of the total variance distance between Gaussian probability distributions in the classical probability theory.</description>

      <title>Review: Quantum Metrology and Sensing with Many-Body Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15323v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The main power of quantum sensors is achieved when the probe is composed of several particles. In this situation, quantum features such as entanglement contribute in enhancing the precision of quantum sensors beyond the capacity of classical sensors. Originally, quantum sensing was formulated for non-interacting particles which are prepared in a special form of maximally entangled states. These probes are extremely sensitive to decoherence and any interaction between particles is detrimental to their performance. An alternative framework for quantum sensing has been developed exploiting quantum many-body systems, where the interaction between particles plays a crucial role. In this review, we investigate different aspects of the latter approach for quantum metrology and sensing. Many-body probes have been used in both equilibrium and non-equilibrium scenarios. Quantum criticality has been identified as a resource for achieving quantum enhanced sensitivity in both scenarios. In equilibrium, various types of criticalities, such as first order, second order, topological, and localization phase transitions have been exploited for sensing purposes. In non-equilibrium scenarios, quantum enhanced sensitivity has been discovered for Floquet, dissipative, and time crystal phase transitions. While each type of these criticalities has its own characteristics, the presence of one feature is crucial for achieving quantum enhanced sensitivity: the energy/quasi-energy gap closing. In non-equilibrium quantum sensing, time is another parameter which can affect the sensitivity of the probe. Typically, the sensitivity enhances as the probe evolves in time. In general, a more complete understanding of resources for non-equilibrium quantum sensors is now rapidly evolving. In this review, we provide an overview of recent progress in quantum metrology and sensing using many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Phase error rate estimation in QKD with imperfect detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17349v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a finite-size security proof of the decoy-state BB84 QKD protocol against coherent attacks, using entropic uncertainty relations, for imperfect detectors. We apply this result to the case of detectors with imperfectly characterized basis-efficiency mismatch. Our proof works by obtaining a suitable bound on the phase error rate, without requiring any new modifications to the protocol steps or hardware. It is applicable to imperfectly characterized detectors, and only requires the maximum relative difference in detection efficiencies and dark count rates of the detectors to be characterized. Moreover, our proof allows Eve to choose detector efficiencies and dark count rates in their allowed ranges in each round, thereby addressing an important problem of detector side channels. We prove security in the variable-length framework, where users are allowed to adaptively determine the length of key to be produced, and number of bits to be used for error-correction, based on observations made during the protocol. We quantitatively demonstrate the effect of basis-efficiency mismatch by applying our results to the decoy-state BB84 protocol.</description>

Abstract: These Lecture Notes discuss the recent theoretical advances in the understanding of open quantum many-body physics in platforms where both dissipative and coherent processes can be tuned and controlled to a high degree. We start by reviewing the theoretical frameworks and methods used to describe and tackle open quantum many-body systems. We then discuss the use of dissipative processes to engineer many-body stationary states with desired properties and the emergence of dissipative phase transitions arising out of the competition between coherent evolution and dissipation. We review the dynamics of open quantum many body systems in the presence of correlated many-body dissipative processes, such as heating and many-body losses. Finally we provide a different perspective on open quantum many-body systems by looking at stochastic quantum trajectories, relevant for the case in which the environment represents a monitoring device, and the associated measurement-induced phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Several families of entanglement criteria for multipartite quantum systems based on generalized Wigner-Yanase skew information and variance</title>

Abstract: Quantum entanglement plays a critical role in many quantum applications, but detecting entanglement, especially in multipartite or high-dimensional quantum systems, remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose several families of entanglement criteria for detecting entanglement in multipartite or high-dimensional quantum states by the generalized Wigner-Yanase skew information $I^s(\rho,X)$ for $-1\leq s\leq0$ and variance. We also reveal a complementary character between the criteria based on the generalized Wigner-Yanase skew information and an alternative one based on variance through specific examples. We illustrate the merits of these criteria and show that the combination of the entanglement criteria has a stronger detection capability, as it is capable of detecting entangled states that remain unrecognized by other criteria.</description>

      <title>Federated Learning with Quantum Computing and Fully Homomorphic Encryption: A Novel Computing Paradigm Shift in Privacy-Preserving ML</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11430v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The widespread deployment of products powered by machine learning models is raising concerns around data privacy and information security worldwide. To address this issue, Federated Learning was first proposed as a privacy-preserving alternative to conventional methods that allow multiple learning clients to share model knowledge without disclosing private data. A complementary approach known as Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) is a quantum-safe cryptographic system that enables operations to be performed on encrypted weights. However, implementing mechanisms such as these in practice often comes with significant computational overhead and can expose potential security threats. Novel computing paradigms, such as analog, quantum, and specialized digital hardware, present opportunities for implementing privacy-preserving machine learning systems while enhancing security and mitigating performance loss. This work instantiates these ideas by applying the FHE scheme to a Federated Learning Neural Network architecture that integrates both classical and quantum layers.</description>

      <title>Large-scale quantum annealing simulation with tensor networks and belief propagation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12240v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum annealing and quantum approximate optimization algorithms hold a great potential to speed-up optimization problems. This could be game-changing for a plethora of applications. Yet, in order to hope to beat classical solvers, quantum circuits must scale up to sizes and performances much beyond current hardware. In that quest, intense experimental effort has been recently devoted to optimizations on 3-regular graphs, which are computationally hard but experimentally relatively amenable. However, even there, the amount and quality of quantum resources required for quantum solvers to outperform classical ones is unclear. Here, we show that quantum annealing for 3-regular graphs can be classically simulated even at scales of 1000 qubits and 5000000 two-qubit gates with all-to-all connectivity. To this end, we develop a graph tensor-network quantum annealer (GTQA) able of high-precision simulations of Trotterized circuits of near-adiabatic evolutions. Based on a recently proposed belief-propagation technique for tensor canonicalization, GTQA is equipped with re-gauging and truncation primitives that keep approximation errors small in spite of the circuits generating significant amounts of entanglement. As a result, even with a maximal bond dimension as low as 4, GTQA produces solutions competitive with those of state-of-the-art classical solvers. For non-degenerate instances, the unique solution can be read out from the final reduced single-qubit states. In contrast, for degenerate problems, such as MaxCut, we introduce an approximate measurement simulation algorithm for graph tensor-network states. On one hand, our findings showcase the potential of GTQA as a powerful quantum-inspired optimizer. On the other hand, they considerably raise the bar required for experimental demonstrations of quantum speed-ups in combinatorial optimizations.</description>

      <title>Resource Management and Circuit Scheduling for Distributed Quantum Computing Interconnect Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12675v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Distributed quantum computing (DQC) has emerged as a promising approach to overcome the scalability limitations of monolithic quantum processors in terms of computing capability. However, realising the full potential of DQC requires effective resource allocation. This involves efficiently distributing quantum circuits across the network by assigning each circuit to an optimal subset of quantum processing units (QPUs), based on factors such as their computational power and connectivity. In heterogeneous DQC networks with arbitrary topologies and non-identical QPUs, resource allocation becomes a complex challenge. This paper addresses the problem of resource allocation in such networks, focusing on computing resource management in a quantum farm setting. We propose a multi-objective optimisation algorithm for optimal QPU allocation that aims to minimise the degradation caused by inter-QPU communication latencies due to qubit decoherence, while maximising the number of concurrently assignable quantum circuits. The algorithm takes into account several key factors, including the network topology, QPU characteristics, and quantum circuit structure, to make efficient allocation decisions. We employ mixed integer linear programming to solve this optimisation problem. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in minimising communication costs and improving resource utilisation compared to a benchmark greedy allocation approach. Notably, assuming a single circuit partition per QPU, the success rate of quantum circuit assignments improves by 5.25%-13.75%. To complement our proposed QPU allocation method, we also present a compatible quantum circuit scheduling model. Our work provides valuable insights into resource allocation strategies for DQC systems and contributes to the development of efficient execution management frameworks for quantum computing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20300v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum emitters trapped near photonic crystal waveguides have recently emerged as an exciting platform for realizing novel quantum matter-light interfaces. Here we study tunable photon scattering in a photonic crystal waveguide coupled to an atom dimer with an arbitrary spatial separation. In the weak-excitation regime, we give the energy levels and their decay rates into the waveguide modes in the dressed basis, which both depend on the distance between the two atoms. We focus on the Bragg case and anti-Bragg case, where subradiant and superradiant states are produced and perfect transmission with a $\pi$ phase shift may occur on resonance. We observe quantum beats in the photon-photon correlation function of the reflected field in the anti-Bragg case. Moreover, the frequencies of quantum beats can be controlled due to the tunability of the bound states via the dispersion engineering of the structure. We also quantify the effects of the system imperfections, including the deviation in the distance between the two atoms and the asymmetry in the atomic decay rates into the waveguide modes. With recent experimental advances in the superconducting microwave transmission lines, our results should soon be realizable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00319v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bayes' rule, which is routinely used to update beliefs based on new evidence, arises from a principle of minimal change. This principle states that updated beliefs must be consistent with new data, while deviating minimally from the prior belief. Here, we introduce a quantum analog of the minimal change principle and use it to derive a quantum Bayes' rule by minimizing the change between two quantum input-output processes, not just their marginals. This is analogous to the classical case where Bayes' rule is obtained by minimizing the change between the joint input-output distributions. When the change is quantified by the fidelity, the quantum minimal change principle has a unique solution, and the resulting quantum Bayes' rule recovers the Petz transpose map.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03345v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entanglement among a large number of qubits is a crucial resource for many quantum algorithms. Such many-body states have been efficiently generated by entangling a chain of itinerant photonic qubits in the optical or microwave domain. However, it has remained challenging to fully characterize the generated many-body states by experimentally reconstructing their exponentially large density matrices. Here, we develop an efficient tomography method based on the matrix-product-operator formalism and demonstrate it on a cluster state of up to 35 microwave photonic qubits by reconstructing its $2^{35} \times 2^{35}$ density matrix. The full characterization enables us to detect the performance degradation of our photon source which occurs only when generating a large cluster state. This tomography method is generally applicable to various physical realizations of entangled qubits and provides an efficient benchmarking method for guiding the development of high-fidelity sources of entangled photons.</description>

      <title>A New World in the Depths of Microcrypt: Separating OWSGs and Quantum Money from QEFID</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03453v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While in classical cryptography, one-way functions (OWFs) are widely regarded as the "minimal assumption," the situation in quantum cryptography is less clear. Recent works have put forward two concurrent candidates for the minimal assumption in quantum cryptography: One-way state generators (OWSGs), postulating the existence of a hard search problem with an efficient verification algorithm, and EFI pairs, postulating the existence of a hard distinguishing problem. Two recent papers [Khurana and Tomer STOC'24; Batra and Jain FOCS'24] showed that OWSGs imply EFI pairs, but the reverse direction remained open. In this work, we give strong evidence that the opposite direction does not hold: We show that there is a quantum unitary oracle relative to which EFI pairs exist, but OWSGs do not. In fact, we show a slightly stronger statement that holds also for EFI pairs that output classical bits (QEFID). As a consequence, we separate, via our oracle, QEFID, and one-way puzzles from OWSGs and several other Microcrypt primitives, including efficiently verifiable one-way puzzles and unclonable state generators. In particular, this solves a problem left open in [Chung, Goldin, and Gray Crypto'24]. Using similar techniques, we also establish a fully black-box separation (which is slightly weaker than an oracle separation) between private-key quantum money schemes and QEFID pairs. One conceptual implication of our work is that the existence of an efficient verification algorithm may lead to qualitatively stronger primitives in quantum cryptography.</description>

      <title>Entanglement-assisted Quantum Error Correcting Code Saturating The Classical Singleton Bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04130v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a construction for entanglement-assisted quantum error-correcting codes (EAQECCs) that saturates the classical Singleton bound with less shared entanglement than any known method for code rates below $ \frac{k}{n} = \frac{1}{3} $. For higher rates, our EAQECC also meets the Singleton bound, although with increased entanglement requirements. Additionally, we demonstrate that any classical $[n,k,d]_q$ code can be transformed into an EAQECC with parameters $[[n,k,d;2k]]_q$ using $2k$ pre-shared maximally entangled pairs. The complexity of our encoding protocol for $k$-qudits with $q$ levels is $\mathcal{O}(k \log_{\frac{q}{q-1}}(k))$, excluding the complexity of encoding and decoding the classical MDS code. While this complexity remains linear in $k$ for systems of reasonable size, it increases significantly for larger-levelled systems, highlighting the need for further research into complexity reduction.</description>

      <title>Mpemba Meets Quantum Chaos: Anomalous Relaxation and Mpemba Crossings in Dissipative Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06669v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Mpemba effect (MPE), named after a student who first observed the phenomenon, has intrigued scientists for decades by showing that hot liquid can freeze faster than cold under certain conditions. Recently, analogous effects have been identified in integrable quantum systems. However, a key distinction between the classical MPE and its quantum analog is that the latter relies predominantly on the of the properties of the initial states rather than the cooling rate. In this paper, we explore the quench dynamics of Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) systems coupled to thermal baths. We investigate three scenarios--SYK systems coupled to SYK thermal baths, SYK systems coupled to two thermal baths at different temperatures, and dissipative SYKs modeled by the Lindblad equation. In the regimes where the system and the baths are strongly coupled, we observe effective temperature oscillations and Mpemba crossings (MPCs)--the effect of temperature crossings which are absent in quasi-equilibrium thermodynamic analysis--when the system is strongly coupled to SYK thermal baths. These effects are not observed in the Liouvillian formalism. The emergence of MPCs in quantum chaotic systems exhibits strong parallels with the classical MPE.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06750v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Intrinsic decoherence models (IDMs) have been proposed in order to solve the measurement problem in quantum mechanics. In this work, we assess the status of two of these models as physical theories by establishing the ultimate bounds on the estimability of their parameters. Our results show that dephasing and dissipative IDMs are amenable to falsification and should be considered physical theories worth of experimental study.</description>

      <title>A Quantum ISA for High-Level Programming, Enabling Sequential Execution and Conditional Branching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06779v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel quantum instruction set architecture that abstracts quantum circuits to support high-level programming paradigms, including sequential execution and branching. By separating concerns between hardware and software, the proposed architecture simplifies quantum algorithm development, allowing programmers to work with classical structures while still being able to exploit quantum-specific behavior . This abstraction enables developers to focus on algorithm design without being burdened by low-level circuit construction, thus facilitating both hardware optimization and software innovation. The proposed architecture represents a step forward in bridging the gap between classical and quantum programming.</description>

      <title>Efficient Quantum Pseudorandomness from Hamiltonian Phase States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08073v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum pseudorandomness has found applications in many areas of quantum information, ranging from entanglement theory, to models of scrambling phenomena in chaotic quantum systems, and, more recently, in the foundations of quantum cryptography. Kretschmer (TQC '21) showed that both pseudorandom states and pseudorandom unitaries exist even in a world without classical one-way functions. To this day, however, all known constructions require classical cryptographic building blocks which are themselves synonymous with the existence of one-way functions, and which are also challenging to realize on realistic quantum hardware.
  In this work, we seek to make progress on both of these fronts simultaneously -- by decoupling quantum pseudorandomness from classical cryptography altogether. We introduce a quantum hardness assumption called the Hamiltonian Phase State (HPS) problem, which is the task of decoding output states of a random instantaneous quantum polynomial-time (IQP) circuit. Hamiltonian phase states can be generated very efficiently using only Hadamard gates, single-qubit Z-rotations and CNOT circuits. We show that the hardness of our problem reduces to a worst-case version of the problem, and we provide evidence that our assumption is plausibly fully quantum; meaning, it cannot be used to construct one-way functions. We also show information-theoretic hardness when only few copies of HPS are available by proving an approximate $t$-design property of our ensemble. Finally, we show that our HPS assumption and its variants allow us to efficiently construct many pseudorandom quantum primitives, ranging from pseudorandom states, to quantum pseudoentanglement, to pseudorandom unitaries, and even primitives such as public-key encryption with quantum keys.</description>

      <title>Proposal for simulating quantum spin models with the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction using Rydberg atoms and the construction of asymptotic quantum many-body scar states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.05591v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have developed a method to simulate quantum spin models with the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) using Rydberg atom quantum simulators. Our approach involves a two-photon Raman transition and a transformation to the spin-rotating frame, both of which are feasible with current experimental techniques. As a model that can be simulated in our setup but not in solid-state systems, we consider an $S=\frac{1}{2}$ spin chain with a Hamiltonian consisting of the DMI and Zeeman energy. We study the magnetization curve in the ground state of this model and quench dynamics. Further, we show the existence of quantum many-body scar states and asymptotic quantum many-body scar states. The observed nonergodicity in this model demonstrates the importance of the highly tunable DMI that can be realized by the proposed quantum simulator.</description>

      <title>Braids and Higher-order Exceptional Points from the Interplay Between Lossy Defects and Topological Boundary States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03054v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the perturbation of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain by a localized lossy defect leads to higher-order exceptional points (HOEP). Depending on the location of the defect, third- and fourth- order exceptional points (EP3 \&amp; EP4) appear in the space of Hamiltonian parameters. On the one hand, they arise due to the non-Abelian braiding properties of exceptional lines (EL) in parameter space. Namely, the HOEPs lie at intersections of mutually non-commuting ELs. On the other hand, we show that such special intersections happen due to the fact that the delocalization of edge states, induced by the non-Hermitian defect, hybridizes them with defect states. These can then coalesce together into an EP3. When the defect lies at the midpoint of the chain, a special symmetry of the full spectrum can lead to an EP4. In this way, our model illustrates the emergence of interesting non-Abelian topological properties in the multiband structure of non-Hermitian perturbations of topological phases.</description>

Abstract: The Large Hadron Collider's high luminosity era presents major computational challenges in the analysis of collision events. Large amounts of Monte Carlo (MC) simulation will be required to constrain the statistical uncertainties of the simulated datasets below these of the experimental data. Modelling of high-energy particles propagating through the calorimeter section of the detector is the most computationally intensive MC simulation task. We introduce a technique combining recent advancements in generative models and quantum annealing for fast and efficient simulation of high-energy particle-calorimeter interactions.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Holographic Entropy Cone via Cycle Flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10137v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by bit threads, we introduce a new prescription for computing entropy vectors outside the holographic entropy cone. By utilizing cycle flows on directed graphs, we show that the maximum cycle flow associated to any subset of vertices, which corresponds to a subsystem, manifestly obeys purification symmetry. Furthermore, by restricting ourselves to a subclass of directed graphs, we prove that the maximum cycle flow obeys both subadditivity and strong subadditivity, thereby establishing it as a viable candidate for the entropy associated to the subsystem. Finally, we demonstrate how our model generalizes the entropy vectors obtainable via conventional flows in undirected graphs, as well as conjecture that our model similarly generalizes the entropy vectors arising from hypergraphs.</description>

      <title>Convergence of Iterative Quadratic Programming for Robust Fixed-Endpoint Transfer of Bilinear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18131v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a computational method for open-loop minimum-norm control synthesis for fixed-endpoint transfer of bilinear ensemble systems that are indexed by two continuously varying parameters. We suppose that one ensemble parameter scales the homogeneous, linear part of the dynamics, and the second parameter scales the effect of the applied control inputs on the inhomogeneous, bilinear dynamics. This class of dynamical systems is motivated by robust quantum control pulse synthesis, where the ensemble parameters correspond to uncertainty in the free Hamiltonian and inhomogeneity in the control Hamiltonian, respectively. Our computational method is based on polynomial approximation of the ensemble state in parameter space and discretization of the evolution equations in the time domain using a product of matrix exponentials corresponding to zero-order hold controls over the time intervals. The dynamics are successively linearized about control and trajectory iterates to formulate a sequence of quadratic programs for computing perturbations to the control that successively improve the objective until the iteration converges. We use a two-stage computation to first ensure transfer to the desired terminal state, and then minimize the norm of the control function. The method is demonstrated for the canonical uniform transfer problem for the Bloch system that appears in nuclear magnetic resonance, as well as the matter-wave splitting problem for the Raman-Nath system that appears in ultra-cold atom interferometry.</description>

      <title>Femtosecond laser written waveguides in sapphire for visible light delivery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08840v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A promising solution for scalable integrated optics of trapped-ion quantum processors are curved waveguides guiding visible light within sapphire bulk material. To the best of our knowledge, no curved waveguides were investigated in sapphire so far, and no measurements of waveguides with visible light in undoped planar sapphire substrates were reported. Here, we demonstrate femtosecond laser writing of depressed cladding waveguides in sapphire. Laser parameters, such as pulse energy, pulse duration, and repetition rate, as well as waveguide geometry parameters, were optimized to guide 728 nm light. This resulted in single-mode waveguides with a propagation loss of 1.9(3) dB/cm. The investigation of curved waveguides showed a sharp increase in total loss for curvature radii below 15 mm. Our results demonstrate the potential of femtosecond laser writing as a powerful technique for creating integrated optical waveguides in the volume of sapphire substrates. Such waveguides could be a building block for integrated optics in trapped-ion quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Universal Early-Time Growth in Quantum Circuit Complexity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12990v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that quantum circuit complexity for the unitary time evolution operator of any time-independent Hamiltonian is bounded by linear growth at early times, independent of any choices of the fundamental gates or cost metric. Deviations from linear early-time growth arise from the commutation algebra of the gates and are manifestly negative for any circuit, decreasing the linear growth rate and leading to a bound on the growth rate of complexity of a circuit at early times. We illustrate this general result by applying it to qubit and harmonic oscillator systems, including the coupled and anharmonic oscillator. By discretizing free and interacting scalar field theories on a lattice, we are also able to extract the early-time behavior and dependence on the lattice spacing of complexity of these field theories in the continuum limit, demonstrating how this approach applies to systems that have been previously difficult to study using existing techniques for quantum circuit complexity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17171v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discover a family of local deformations that leave part of the spectrum intact for strongly interacting and exactly solvable quantum many-body systems. Since the deformation preserves the Bethe Ansatz equations (BAE), it is dubbed the iso-BAE flow. Although all theories on the flow share the same BAE, the spectra are different. Part of the spectrum remains intact along the whole flow. Such states are protected by an emergent symmetry. The remaining parts of the spectrum change continuously along the flow and are doubly degenerate for even length spin chains. For odd length chains, the deformed spectrum also comprises doubly degenerate pairs apart from the sector with magnon number $(L+1)/2$, where $L$ is the length of the spin chain. We discuss the iso-BAE flow for the ${\rm XXX}_{1/2}$ model in detail and show that the iso-BAE flows exist for more general models including $q$-deformed XXZ as well as higher spin ${\rm XXX}_{s}$ spin chains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02890v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a dissipative phase transition in a head-to-tail Bose Josephson junction. The quantum phase transition has the same origin as the one in a resistively shunted Josephson junction, but the intrinsic momentum coupling between the Josephson mode and the bath modes enables us to observe the dissipative phase transition without any synthetic dissipation. We show that the interatomic interaction strength plays the role of the damping parameter. Consequently, in contrast to a resistively shunted Josephson circuit, the Bose Josephson junction can exhibit an insulating phase in a wider parameter region by increasing the repulsive interaction strength, which is robust against nonperturbative effects. We argue that tight transverse confinement of the quasi-one-dimensional atomic gas allows us to reach the insulating phase.</description>

Abstract: Novel interactions beyond the four known fundamental forces in nature (electromagnetic, gravitational, strong and weak interactions), may arise due to "new physics" beyond the standard model, manifesting as a "fifth force". This review is focused on spin-dependent fifth forces mediated by exotic bosons such as spin-0 axions and axionlike particles and spin-1 Z' bosons, dark photons, or paraphotons. Many of these exotic bosons are candidates to explain the nature of dark matter and dark energy, and their interactions may violate fundamental symmetries. Spin-dependent interactions between fermions mediated by the exchange of exotic bosons have been investigated in a variety of experiments, particularly at the low-energy frontier. Experimental methods and tools used to search for exotic spin-dependent interactions, such as atomic comagnetometers, torsion balances, nitrogen-vacancy spin sensors, and precision atomic and molecular spectroscopy, are described. A complete set of interaction potentials, derived based on quantum field theory with minimal assumptions and characterized in terms of reduced coupling constants, are presented. A comprehensive summary of existing experimental and observational constraints on exotic spin-dependent interactions is given, illustrating the current research landscape and promising directions of further research.</description>

      <title>A unifying polarization formalism for electric- and magnetic-multipole interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01197v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the spherical tensorial formalism for polarization to the treatment of electric- and magnetic-multipole transitions of any order. We rely on the spherical-wave expansion to derive the tensor form of the operator describing the interaction of the atomic system with a polarized radiation field, which naturally leads to the introduction of spherical tensors describing the polarization properties of the interacting field. As a direct application, the formalism is used to model the radiation anisotropy affecting the scattering of radiation in an electric-quadrupole transition, and the associated Hanle effect in the presence of a magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Measuring Coherent Radio and Microwave Photons from the Solar Corona</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20459v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rates of production of radio/microwave N-identical photons states |N&gt; from stimulated emission in the solar atmosphere are estimated. Effects of various decohering factors are shown to be small. Ground based measurements of these quantum states via the inverse HOM effect are proposed. We argue that a signal is detectable and far above the noise in several cases.</description>

      <title>The exact quantum chromatic number of Hadamard graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00042v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the exact value of the quantum chromatic numbers of Hadamard graphs of order $n=2^N$ for $N$ a multiple of $4$ using the upper bound derived by Avis, Hasegawa, Kikuchi, and Sasaki, as well as an application of the Hoffman-like lower bound of Elphick and Wocjan that was generalized by Ganesan for quantum graphs. As opposed to prior computations for the lower bound, our approach uses Ito's results on conjugacy class graphs allowing us to also find bounds on the quantum chromatic numbers of products of Hadamard graphs. In particular, we also compute the exact quantum chromatic number of the categorical product of Hadamard graphs.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian ultra-strong bosonic condensation through interaction-induced caging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01258v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We uncover a new mechanism whereby the triple interplay of non-Hermitian pumping, bosonic interactions and nontrivial band topology leads to ultra-strong bosonic condensation. The extent of condensation goes beyond what is naively expected from the interaction-induced trapping of non-Hermitian pumped states, and is based on an emergent caging mechanism that can be further enhanced by topological boundary modes. Beyond our minimal model with 2 bosons, this caging remains applicable for generic many-boson systems subject to a broad range of density interactions and non-Hermitian hopping asymmetry. Our novel new mechanism for particle localization and condensation would inspire fundamental shifts in our comprehension of many-body non-Hermitian dynamics and opens new avenues for controlling and manipulating bosons.</description>

      <title>The (1+3)-dimensional 'quantum principle of relativity' is Einstein's principle of relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07017v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the $(1+3)$-dimensional `superboost' operators, proposed in Dragan and Ekert's most recent work on superluminal reference frames \cite{Dragan:2022txt}, are simply the canonical Lorentz boosts, expressed in nonstandard notation. Their $(1+3)$-dimensional `superflip', which is claimed to interchange time and space dimensions for a superluminal observer, travelling with infinite speed, is equivalent to applying the identity operator together with an arbitrary relabeling. Physically, it corresponds to staying put within the canonical rest frame, then renaming space as `time' and time as `space'. We conclude that their extension of the `quantum principle of relativity', proposed in earlier work on $(1+1)$-dimensional spacetimes \cite{Dragan:2019grn}, to ordinary Minkowski space \cite{Dragan:2022txt}, is simply Einstein's principle of relativity, proposed in 1905.</description>
