      <title>Multiple Majorana bound states and their resilience against disorder in planar Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planar Josephson junctions are theoretically predicted to harbor zero-energy Majorana bound states (MBS) in a tunable two-dimensional geometry, at the two ends of the middle metallic channel. Here we show that three distinct topological superconducting regimes, governing the localization of the near-zero-energy MBS, appear in these planar Josephson junctions. The topologically-protected MBS appear near the narrow edges of the junction -- not only in the middle metallic channel but also in the superconducting leads which have widths similar to the values used in recent experiments. We incorporate random fluctuation in the chemical potential to investigate the influence of non-magnetic disorder on the localization of the MBS in different topological regimes and find that the MBS are quite robust against disorder because of the two-dimensional geometry. Interestingly, moderate amount of disorder reduces the splitting between the MBS pairs, possibly by minimizing the wave function overlap of the MBS. We also discuss the changes in the topological superconducting phases when the superconducting lead width is varied. Our results reveal a rich structure of the localization of topologically protected multiple MBS in experimentally-accessible planar Josephson junctions, and call for their experimental confirmation.</description>

      <title>Hidden Bose-Einstein Singularities in Correlated Electron Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hidden singularities in correlated electron systems, which are caused by pair fluctuations of electron-electron or electron-hole bubbles obeying Bose-Einstein statistics, are unveiled theoretically. The correlation function of each pair fluctuation is shown to have a bound in the zero Matsubara frequency branch, similarly as the chemical potential of ideal Bose gases. Once the bound is reached, the self-energy starts to acquire a component proportional to Green's function itself, i.e., the structure called one-particle reducible, to keep the correlation function within the bound. The singularities are closely related with, but distinct from, phase transitions with broken symmetries. Passing down through them necessarily accompanies a change in the single-particle density of states around the excitation threshold, such as the pseudo-gap behavior found here for the negative-$U$ Hubbard model above the superconducting transition temperature.</description>

      <title>Magnetic edge fields in UTe$_2$ near zero background fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral superconductors are theorized to exhibit spontaneous edge currents. Here, we found magnetic fields at the edges of UTe$_2$, a candidate odd-parity chiral superconductor, that seem to agree with predictions for a chiral order parameter. However, we did not detect the chiral domains that would be expected, and recent polar Kerr and muon spin relaxation data in nominally clean samples argue against chiral superconductivity. Our results show that hidden sources of magnetism must be carefully ruled out when using spontaneous edge currents to identify chiral superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Chirality Detection through Vortex Bound States in ($d+id'$)-Wave Superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method for detecting the chirality $\chi$ of a ($d_{zx}+i \chi d_{yz}$)-wave superconductor through the analysis of the local density of states (LDOS) at the vortex core. Employing the quasiclassical Eilenberger theory, we examine the LDOS in a semi-infinite superconductor with a quantum vortex penetrating the surface perpendicularly. We show that $\mathrm{sgn}[\chi]$ changes completely the LDOS at the core-surface intersection. Remarkably, the difference between LDOS for the $\chi = 1$ and $\chi = -1$ states becomes more prominent when the surface is dirtier, meaning that one does not need to pay close attention to the surface quality of the sample. The difference between these two states arises from the symmetry of the subdominant Cooper pairs induced at the core-surface intersection: whether the subdominant $s$-wave Cooper pairs are present or not. Due to the unique nature of this phenomenon in the ($d_{zx}+i \chi d_{yz}$)-wave superconductor, one can potentially demonstrate the realization of the ($d_{zx}+i \chi d_{yz}$)-wave superconductivity and determine its chirality by, for instance, through scanning tunnel spectroscopy experiments.</description>

      <title>A deep learning approach to search for superconductors from electronic bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energy band theory is a foundational framework in condensed matter physics. In this work, we employ a deep learning method, BNAS, to find a direct correlation between electronic band structure and superconducting transition temperature. Our findings suggest that electronic band structures can act as primary indicators of superconductivity. To avoid overfitting, we utilize a relatively simple deep learning neural network model, which, despite its simplicity, demonstrates predictive capabilities for superconducting properties. By leveraging the attention mechanism within deep learning, we are able to identify specific regions of the electronic band structure most correlated with superconductivity. This novel approach provides new insights into the mechanisms driving superconductivity from an alternative perspective. Moreover, we predict several potential superconductors that may serve as candidates for future experimental synthesis.</description>

      <title>AI-accelerated discovery of high critical temperature superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of new superconducting materials, particularly those exhibiting high critical temperature ($T_c$), has been a vibrant area of study within the field of condensed matter physics. Conventional approaches primarily rely on physical intuition to search for potential superconductors within the existing databases. However, the known materials only scratch the surface of the extensive array of possibilities within the realm of materials. Here, we develop an AI search engine that integrates deep model pre-training and fine-tuning techniques, diffusion models, and physics-based approaches (e.g., first-principles electronic structure calculation) for discovery of high-$T_c$ superconductors. Utilizing this AI search engine, we have obtained 74 dynamically stable materials with critical temperatures predicted by the AI model to be $T_c \geq$ 15 K based on a very small set of samples. Notably, these materials are not contained in any existing dataset. Furthermore, we analyze trends in our dataset and individual materials including B$_4$CN$_3$ and B$_5$CN$_2$ whose $T_c$s are 24.08 K and 15.93 K, respectively. We demonstrate that AI technique can discover a set of new high-$T_c$ superconductors, outline its potential for accelerating discovery of the materials with targeted properties.</description>

      <title>In-situ tunable interaction with an invertible sign between a fluxonium and a post cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computation with bosonic modes presents a powerful paradigm for harnessing the principles of quantum mechanics to perform complex information processing tasks. In constructing a bosonic qubit with superconducting circuits, nonlinearity is typically introduced to a cavity mode through an ancillary two-level qubit. However, the ancilla's spurious heating has impeded progress towards fully fault-tolerant bosonic qubits. The ability to in-situ decouple the ancilla when not in use would be beneficial but has not been realized yet. This work presents a novel architecture for quantum information processing, comprising a 3D post cavity coupled to a fluxonium ancilla via a readout resonator. This system's intricate energy level structure results in a complex landscape of interactions whose sign can be tuned in situ by the magnetic field threading the fluxonium loop. Our results could significantly advance the lifetime and controllability of bosonic qubits.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the 5$f$ electron hybridization process in UPd$_2$Al$_3$ via ARPES and Time-resolved PES</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the 5$f$-electron-conduction electron hybridization process in the heavy fermion superconductor UPd$_2$Al$_3$ using a combination of angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and time-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (tr-PES). ARPES measurements reveal the formation of a hybridization gap at a temperature of approximately 75 K, which becomes more pronounced as the temperature decreases. Notably, the persistence of a flat U 5$f$ band at temperatures well above the hybridization onset challenges conventional understanding. Our findings demonstrate a non-monotonic temperature dependence of the quasiparticle relaxation time, with an anomalous decrease at 20 K, suggesting complex electronic and magnetic interactions. These findings provide detailed insights into the 5$f$-electron hybridization process in UPd$_2$Al$_3$, with significant implications for the understanding of heavy fermion superconductivity and the role of 5$f$-electron hybridization in uranium-based materials.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing between topological Majorana and trivial zero modes via transport and shot noise study in an altermagnet heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the transport and shot noise properties of a one-dimensional semiconducting nanowire with Rashba spin-orbit coupling~(SOC) placed in closed proximity to a bulk $s$-wave superconductor and an altermagnet with $d$-wave symmetry. Such heterostructure with vanishing net magnetization manifests itself as an alternative route to anchor Majorana zero modes~(MZMs) characterized by appropriate topological index~(winding number $W$). Interestingly, this system also hosts accidental zero modes~(AZMs) emerged with vanishing topological index indicating their non-topological nature. Furthermore, by incorporating three terminal setup, we explore the transport and shot noise signatures of these zero modes. At zero temperature, we obtain zero bias peak (ZBP) in differential conductance to be quantized with value $|W|\times 2 e^{2}/h$ for MZMs. On the other hand, AZMs exhibit non-quantized value at zero bias. Moreover, zero temperature shot noise manifests negative~(positive) value for MZMs~(AZMs) within the bulk gap. At finite temperature, shot noise exhibits negative value~(negative to positive transition) concerning MZMs~(AZMs). Thus, the obtained signatures clearly distinguish between the MZMs and non-topological AZMs. We extend our analysis by switching on the next to nearest neighbour hopping amplitude and SOC. Our conclusion remains unaffected for this case as well. Hence, our work paves the way to differentiate between emergent MZMs and AZMs in a semiconductor/ superconductor/ altermagnet heterostructure.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal Photon Blockade for Nonreciprocal Quantum Absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controlling the flow of photons is crucial for advancing quantum technologies. We introduce the concept of spatiotemporal photon blockade for nonreciprocal quantum absorption, utilizing space-time-periodic metasurfaces. Our study presents a methodology for experimentally realizing this effect, where photon frequency coherence with the metasurface's space-time modulation enables one-way quantum absorption. In this system, forward-traveling photons are energetically modulated and absorbed within the slab, while backward-traveling photons are transmitted without interaction. Our analysis includes band structure, isofrequency diagrams, and nonreciprocal absorption results. These findings lay the groundwork for developing nonreciprocal quantum devices and enhancing photon management in milli-Kelvin temperature quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Light Induced Orbital Magnetism in Metals via Inverse Faraday Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.01699v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a microscopic calculation of the inverse Faraday effect in metals. We derive a static local magnetic moment induced on the application of high-frequency light, using the Eilenberger formulation of quasiclassical theory. We include the effect of disorder and formulate a theory applicable across the entire temperature range, in the absence of external applied fields. For light-induced electric fields of amplitude $\sim 100 kV/cm$, the induced fields are large, $\sim 0.1 T$ for metallic Nb! The predictions of our theory agree with recent experimental and theoretical results [1]. An extension of this approach to superconductors would open a new route of inducing orbital magnetic field and potentially vortices in superconductors.</description>
