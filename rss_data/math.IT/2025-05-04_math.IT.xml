      <title>Deep Autoencoder-Based Constellation Design in Multiple Access Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In multiple access channels (MAC), multiple users share a transmission medium to communicate with a common receiver. Traditional constellations like quadrature amplitude modulation are optimized for point-to-point systems and lack mechanisms to mitigate inter-user interference, leading to suboptimal performance in MAC environments. To address this, we propose a novel framework for constellation design in MAC that employs deep autoencoder (DAE)-based communication systems. This approach intelligently creates flexible constellations aware of inter-user interference, reducing symbol error rate and enhancing the constellation-constrained sum capacity of the channel. Comparisons against analytically derived constellations demonstrate that DAE-designed constellations consistently perform best or equal to the best across various system parameters. Furthermore, we apply the DAE to scenarios where no analytical solutions have been developed, such as with more than two users, demonstrating the adaptability of the model.</description>

      <title>A Single-Bit Redundancy Framework for Multi-Dimensional Parametric Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constrained coding plays a key role in optimizing performance and mitigating errors in applications such as storage and communication, where specific constraints on codewords are required. While non-parametric constraints have been well-studied, parametric constraints, which depend on sequence length, have traditionally been tackled with ad hoc solutions. Recent advances have introduced unified methods for parametric constrained coding. This paper extends these approaches to multidimensional settings, generalizing an iterative framework to efficiently encode arrays subject to parametric constraints. We demonstrate the application of the method to existing and new constraints, highlighting its versatility and potential for advanced storage systems.</description>

      <title>SemSpaceFL: A Collaborative Hierarchical Federated Learning Framework for Semantic Communication in 6G LEO Satellites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of the sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks, enhanced by artificial intelligence, promises ubiquitous connectivity through Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites. These satellites are capable of collecting vast amounts of geographically diverse and real-time data, which can be immensely valuable for training intelligent models. However, limited inter-satellite communication and data privacy constraints hinder data collection on a single server for training. Therefore, we propose SemSpaceFL, a novel hierarchical federated learning (HFL) framework for LEO satellite networks, with integrated semantic communication capabilities. Our framework introduces a two-tier aggregation architecture where satellite models are first aggregated at regional gateways before final consolidation at a cloud server, which explicitly accounts for satellite mobility patterns and energy constraints. The key innovation lies in our novel aggregation approach, which dynamically adjusts the contribution of each satellite based on its trajectory and association with different gateways, which ensures stable model convergence despite the highly dynamic nature of LEO constellations. To further enhance communication efficiency, we incorporate semantic encoding-decoding techniques trained through the proposed HFL framework, which enables intelligent data compression while maintaining signal integrity. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed aggregation strategy achieves superior performance and faster convergence compared to existing benchmarks, while effectively managing the challenges of satellite mobility and energy limitations in dynamic LEO networks.</description>

      <title>On the Worst-Case Complexity of Gibbs Decoding for Reed--Muller Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reed--Muller (RM) codes are known to achieve capacity on binary symmetric channels (BSC) under the Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) decoder. However, it remains an open problem to design a capacity achieving polynomial-time RM decoder. Due to a lemma by Liu, Cuff, and Verd\'u, it can be shown that decoding by sampling from the posterior distribution is also capacity-achieving for RM codes over BSC. The Gibbs decoder is one such Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) based method, which samples from the posterior distribution by flipping message bits according to the posterior, and can be modified to give other MCMC decoding methods. In this paper, we analyze the mixing time of the Gibbs decoder for RM codes. Our analysis reveals that the Gibbs decoder can exhibit slow mixing for certain carefully constructed sequences. This slow mixing implies that, in the worst-case scenario, the decoder requires super-polynomial time to converge to the desired posterior distribution.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Static IRS: 3D Shaped Beamforming for Area Coverage Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is a promising paradigm to reconfigure the wireless environment for enhanced communication coverage and quality. However, to compensate for the double pathloss effect, massive IRS elements are required, raising concerns on the scalability of cost and complexity. This paper introduces a new architecture of quasi-static IRS (QS-IRS), which tunes element phases via mechanical adjustment or manually re-arranging the array topology. QS-IRS relies on massive production/assembly of purely passive elements only, and thus is suitable for ultra low-cost and large-scale deployment to enhance long-term coverage. To achieve this end, an IRS-aided area coverage problem is formulated, which explicitly considers the element radiation pattern (ERP), with the newly introduced shape masks for the mainlobe, and the sidelobe constraints to reduce energy leakage. An alternating optimization (AO) algorithm based on the difference-of-convex (DC) and successive convex approximation (SCA) procedure is proposed, which achieves shaped beamforming with power gains close to that of the joint optimization algorithm, but with significantly reduced computational complexity.</description>

      <title>Polarization Decomposition and Its Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The polarization decomposition for arbitrary binary-input memoryless channels (BMCs) is investigated. By defining the polarization factor (PF) based on the conditional entropy of channel output under various input combinations, it is shown that the symmetric capacities of polarized subchannels can be expressed by the PF in the general form. We derive the explicit form of PF with respect to block length and subchannel index. Meanwhile, we propose an efficient calculation algorithm for the PF. Particularly, we demonstrate that any PF can correspond to a $n$-ary tree. Based on this structure, we design the calculation approach of the conditional entropy under different input relations. The proposed polarization algorithm provides both new theoretical insights and practical values such as visualization of polarization and polar code construction. Moreover, our approach first makes it possible to efficiently calculate the symmetric capacities of all subchannels for any BMCs.</description>

      <title>Realizing Fully-Connected Layers Over the Air via Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By leveraging the waveform superposition property of the multiple access channel, over-the-air computation (AirComp) enables the execution of digital computations through analog means in the wireless domain, leading to faster processing and reduced latency. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to implement a neural network (NN) consisting of digital fully connected (FC) layers using physically reconfigurable hardware. Specifically, we investigate reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs)-assisted multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems to emulate the functionality of a NN for over-the-air inference. In this setup, both the RIS and the transceiver are jointly configured to manipulate the ambient wireless propagation environment, effectively reproducing the adjustable weights of a digital FC layer. We refer to this new computational paradigm as \textit{AirFC}. We formulate an imitation error minimization problem between the effective channel created by RIS and a target FC layer by jointly optimizing over-the-air parameters. To solve this non-convex optimization problem, an extremely low-complexity alternating optimization algorithm is proposed, where semi-closed-form/closed-form solutions for all optimization variables are derived. Simulation results show that the RIS-assisted MIMO-based AirFC can achieve competitive classification accuracy. Furthermore, it is also shown that a multi-RIS configuration significantly outperforms a single-RIS setup, particularly in line-of-sight (LoS)-dominated channels.</description>

      <title>Spectral Efficiency Analysis of Near-Field Holographic MIMO over Ricean Fading Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the denser distribution of antenna elements, stronger mutual coupling effects would kick in among antenna elements, which would eventually affect the communication performance. Meanwhile, as the holographic array usually has large physical size, the possibility of near-field communication increases. This paper investigates a near-field multi-user downlink HMIMO system and characterizes the spectral efficiency (SE) under the mutual coupling effect over Ricean fading channels. Both perfect and imperfect channel state information (CSI) scenarios are considered. (i) For the perfect CSI case, the mutual coupling and radiation efficiency model are first established. Then, the closed-form SE is derived under maximum ratio transmission (MRT). By comparing the SE between the cases with and without mutual coupling, it is unveiled that the system SE with mutual coupling might outperform that without mutual coupling in the low transmit power regime for a given aperture size. Moreover, it is also unveiled that the inter-user interference cannot be eliminated unless the physical size of the array increases to infinity. Fortunately, the additional distance term in the near-field channel can be exploited for the inter-user interference mitigation, especially for the worst case, where the users' angular positions overlap to a great extent. (ii) For the imperfect CSI case, the channel estimation error is considered for the derivation of the closed-form SE under MRT. It shows that in the low transmit power regime, the system SE can be enhanced by increasing the pilot power and the antenna element density, the latter of which will lead to severe mutual coupling. In the high transmit power regime, increasing the pilot power has a limited effect on improving the system SE. However, increasing the antenna element density remains highly beneficial for enhancing the system SE.</description>

      <title>Continuous Aperture Array (CAPA)-Based Multi-Group Multicast Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A continuous aperture array (CAPA)-based multi-group multicast communication system is investigated. An integral-based CAPA multi-group multicast beamforming design is formulated for the maximization of the system energy efficiency (EE), subject to a minimum multicast SE constraint of each user group and a total transmit power constraint. To address this non-econvex fractional programming problem, the Dinkelbach's method is employed. Within the Dinkelbach's framework, the non-convex group-wise multicast spectral efficiency (SE) constraint is first equivalently transformed into a tractable form with auxiliary variables. Then, an efficient block coordinate descent (BCD)-based algorithm is developed to solve the reformulated problem. The CAPA beamforming design subproblem can be optimally solved via the Lagrangian dual method and the calculus of variations (CoV) theory. It reveals that the optimal CAPA beamformer should be a combination of all the groups' user channels. To further reduce the computational complexity, a low-complexity zero-forcing (ZF)-based approach is proposed. The closed-form ZF CAPA beamformer is derived using each group's most representative user channel to mitigate the inter-group interference while ensuring the intra-group multicast performance. Then, the beamforming design subproblem in the BCD-based algorithm becomes a convex power allocation subproblem, which can be efficiently solved. Numerical results demonstrate that 1) the CAPA can significantly improve the EE compared to conventional spatially discrete arrays (SPDAs); 2) due to the enhanced spatial resolutions, increasing the aperture size of CAPA is not always beneficial for EE enhancement in multicast scenarios; and 3) wider user distributions of each group cause a significant EE degradation of CAPA compared to SPDA.</description>

      <title>Enabling Training-Free Semantic Communication Systems with Generative Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic communication (SemCom) has recently emerged as a promising paradigm for next-generation wireless systems. Empowered by advanced artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, SemCom has achieved significant improvements in transmission quality and efficiency. However, existing SemCom systems either rely on training over large datasets and specific channel conditions or suffer from performance degradation under channel noise when operating in a training-free manner. To address these issues, we explore the use of generative diffusion models (GDMs) as training-free SemCom systems. Specifically, we design a semantic encoding and decoding method based on the inversion and sampling process of the denoising diffusion implicit model (DDIM), which introduces a two-stage forward diffusion process, split between the transmitter and receiver to enhance robustness against channel noise. Moreover, we optimize sampling steps to compensate for the increased noise level caused by channel noise. We also conduct a brief analysis to provide insights about this design. Simulations on the Kodak dataset validate that the proposed system outperforms the existing baseline SemCom systems across various metrics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning (DL) has emerged as a transformative technology with immense potential to reshape the sixth-generation (6G) wireless communication network. By utilizing advanced algorithms for feature extraction and pattern recognition, DL provides unprecedented capabilities in optimizing the network efficiency and performance, particularly in physical layer communications. Although DL technologies present the great potential, they also face significant challenges related to the robustness, which are expected to intensify in the complex and demanding 6G environment. Specifically, current DL models typically exhibit substantial performance degradation in dynamic environments with time-varying channels, interference of noise and different scenarios, which affect their effectiveness in diverse real-world applications. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of strategies and approaches for robust DL-based methods in physical layer communications. First we introduce the key challenges that current DL models face. Then we delve into a detailed examination of DL approaches specifically tailored to enhance robustness in 6G, which are classified into data-driven and model-driven strategies. Finally, we verify the effectiveness of these methods by case studies and outline future research directions.</description>

      <title>Semantic Communication: From Philosophical Conceptions Towards a Mathematical Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic communication has emerged as a promising paradigm to address the challenges of next-generation communication networks. While some progress has been made in its conceptualization, fundamental questions remain unresolved. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic model for semantic communication that, unlike prior works primarily rooted in intuitions from human language, is grounded in a rigorous philosophical conception of information and its relationship with data as Constraining Affordances, mediated by Levels of Abstraction (LoA). This foundation not only enables the modeling of linguistic semantic communication but also provides a domain-independent definition of semantic content, extending its applicability beyond linguistic contexts. As the semantic communication problem involves a complex interplay of various factors, making it difficult to tackle in its entirety, we propose to orthogonalize it by classifying it into simpler sub-problems and approach the general problem step by step. Notably, we show that Shannon's framework constitutes a special case of semantic communication, in which each message conveys a single, unambiguous meaning. Consequently, the capacity in Shannon's model-defined as the maximum rate of reliably transmissible messages-coincides with the semantic capacity under this constrained scenario. In this paper, we specifically focus on the sub-problem where semantic ambiguity arises solely from physical channel noise and derive a lower bound for its semantic capacity, which reduces to Shannon's capacity in the corresponding special case. We also demonstrate that the achievable rate of all transmissible messages for reliable semantic communication, exceeds Shannon's capacity by the added term H(X|S).</description>

      <title>Timely Tracking of a Wiener Process With Single Bit Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of timely tracking of a Wiener process via an energy-conserving sensor by utilizing a single bit quantization strategy under periodic sampling. Contrary to conventional single bit quantizers which only utilize the transmitted bit to convey information, in our codebook, we use an additional `$\emptyset$' symbol to encode the event of \emph{not transmitting}. Thus, our quantization functions are composed of three decision regions as opposed to the conventional two regions. First, we propose an optimum quantization method in which the optimum quantization functions are obtained by tracking the distributions of the quantization error. However, this method requires a high computational cost and might not be applicable for energy-conserving sensors. Thus, we propose two additional low complexity methods. In the last-bit aware method, three predefined quantization functions are available to both devices, and they switch the quantization function based on the last transmitted bit. With the Gaussian approximation method, we calculate a single quantization function by assuming that the quantization error can be approximated as Gaussian. While previous methods require a constant delay assumption, this method also works for random delay. We observe that all three methods perform similarly in terms of mean-squared error and transmission cost.</description>

      <title>Improved Approximation of Sensor Network Performance for Seabed Acoustic Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sensor locations to detect Poisson-distributed targets, such as seabed sensors that detect shipping traffic, can be selected to maximize the so-called void probability, which is the probability of detecting all targets. Because evaluation of void probability is computationally expensive, we propose a new approximation of void probability that can greatly reduce the computational cost of selecting locations for a network of sensors. We build upon prior work that approximates void probability using Jensen's inequality. Our new approach better accommodates uncertainty in the (Poisson) target model and yields a sharper error bound. The proposed method is evaluated using historical ship traffic data from the Hampton Roads Channel, Virginia, demonstrating a reduction in the approximation error compared to the previous approach. The results validate the effectiveness of the improved approximation for maritime surveillance applications.</description>

Abstract: We describe an advanced version of the AFW-technique proposed in [Lett. Math. Phys., 113, 121 (2023)],[Lobachevskii J. Math., 44(6), 2169 (2023)] which allows us to obtain lower semicontinuity bounds, continuity bounds and local lower bounds for characteristics of quantum systems and discrete random variables.
  We consider applications of the new version of the AFW-technique to several basic characteristics of quantum systems (the von Neumann entropy, the energy-type functionals, the quantum relative entropy, the conditional entropy and the entanglement of formation).</description>

      <title>Non-Adaptive Cryptanalytic Time-Space Lower Bounds via a Shearer-like Inequality for Permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The power of adaptivity in algorithms has been intensively studied in diverse areas of theoretical computer science. In this paper, we obtain a number of sharp lower bound results which show that adaptivity provides a significant extra power in cryptanalytic time-space tradeoffs with (possibly unlimited) preprocessing time.
  Most notably, we consider the discrete logarithm (DLOG) problem in a generic group of $N$ elements. The classical `baby-step giant-step' algorithm for the problem has time complexity $T=O(\sqrt{N})$, uses $O(\sqrt{N})$ bits of space (up to logarithmic factors in $N$) and achieves constant success probability.
  We examine a generalized setting where an algorithm obtains an advice string of $S$ bits and is allowed to make $T$ arbitrary non-adaptive queries that depend on the advice string (but not on the challenge group element).
  We show that in this setting, the $T=O(\sqrt{N})$ online time complexity of the baby-step giant-step algorithm cannot be improved, unless the advice string is more than $\Omega(\sqrt{N})$ bits long. This lies in stark contrast with the classical adaptive Pollard's rho algorithm for DLOG, which can exploit preprocessing to obtain the tradeoff curve $ST^2=O(N)$. We obtain similar sharp lower bounds for several other cryptanalytic problems.
  To obtain our results, we present a new model that allows analyzing non-adaptive preprocessing algorithms for a wide array of search and decision problems in a unified way. Since previous proof techniques inherently cannot distinguish between adaptive and non-adaptive algorithms for the problems in our model, they cannot be used to obtain our results. Consequently, our proof uses a variant of Shearer's lemma for this setting, due to Barthe, Cordero-Erausquin, Ledoux, and Maurey (2011). This seems to be the first time a variant of Shearer's lemma for permutations is used in an algorithmic context.</description>

      <title>Shuffling Cards When You Are of Very Little Brain: Low Memory Generation of Permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How can we generate a permutation of the numbers $1$ through $n$ so that it is hard to guess the next element given the history so far? The twist is that the generator of the permutation (the ``Dealer") has limited memory, while the ``Guesser" has unlimited memory. With unbounded memory (actually $n$ bits suffice), the Dealer can generate a truly random permutation where~$\ln n$ is the expected number of correct guesses.
  Our main results are tight bounds for the relationship between the guessing probability and the memory required to generate the permutation. We suggest a method for the Dealer that requires~$m$ bits of storage, constant time for each turn and makes any Guesser pick correctly only $O(n/m+\log m)$ cards in expectation. The method does not require any secrecy from the dealer, i.e. it is ``open book" or ``whitebox". On the other hand, we show that this bound is the best possible, even for Dealers with secret memory: For any $m$-bit Dealer there is a (computationally powerful) guesser that makes $\Omega(n/m+\log m)$ correct guesses in expectation.
  We also give an $O(n)$ bit memory Dealer that generates perfectly random permutations and operates in constant time per turn.</description>

      <title>The First and Second-Order Asymptotics of Covert Communication over AWGN Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.17924v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the asymptotics of the maximal throughput of communication over AWGN channels by $n$ channel uses under a covert constraint in terms of an upper bound $\delta$ of Kullback-Leibler divergence (KL divergence). It is shown that the first and second order asymptotics of the maximal throughput are $\sqrt{n\delta \log e}$ and $(2)^{1/2}(n\delta)^{1/4}(\log e)^{3/4}\cdot Q^{-1}(\epsilon)$, respectively. The technique we use in the achievability is quasi-$\varepsilon$-neighborhood notion from information geometry. For finite blocklength $n$, the generating distributions are chosen to be a family of truncated Gaussian distributions with decreasing variances. The law of decreasing is carefully designed so that it maximizes the throughput at the main channel in the asymptotic sense under the condition that the output distributions satisfy the covert constraint. For the converse, the optimality of Gaussian distribution for minimizing KL divergence under the second order moment constraint is extended from dimension $1$ to dimension $n$. Based on that, we establish an upper bound on the average power of the code to satisfy the covert constraint, which further leads to the direct converse bound in terms of covert metric.</description>

      <title>Stacked Intelligent Metasurfaces for Multiuser Downlink Beamforming in the Wave Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.02687v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Intelligent metasurface has recently emerged as a promising technology that enables the customization of wireless environments by harnessing large numbers of low-cost reconfigurable scattering elements. However, prior studies have predominantly focused on single-layer metasurfaces, which have limitations in terms of wave-domain processing capabilities due to practical hardware limitations. In contrast, this paper introduces a novel stacked intelligent metasurface (SIM) design. Specifically, we investigate the integration of SIM into the downlink of a multiuser multiple-input single-output (MISO) communication system, where an SIM, consisting of a multilayer metasurface structure, is deployed at the base station (BS) to facilitate transmit beamforming in the electromagnetic wave domain. This eliminates the need for conventional digital beamforming and high-resolution digital-to-analog converters at the BS. To this end, an optimization problem is formulated to maximize the sum rate of all user equipments by jointly optimizing the transmit power allocation at the BS and the wave-based beamforming at the SIM, subject to constraints on the transmit power budget and discrete phase shifts. Furthermore, we propose a computationally efficient algorithm for solving the formulated joint optimization problem and elaborate on the potential benefits of employing SIM in wireless networks. Numerical results are illustrated to corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed SIM-enabled wave-based beamforming design and to evaluate the performance improvement achieved by the proposed algorithm compared to various benchmark schemes. It is demonstrated that considering the same number of transmit antennas, the proposed SIM-based system achieves about 200\% improvement in terms of sum rate compared to conventional MISO systems.

      <title>Timely and Painless Breakups: Off-the-grid Blind Message Recovery and Users' Demixing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17393v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the near future, the Internet of Things will interconnect billions of devices, forming a vast network where users sporadically transmit short messages through multi-path wireless channels. These channels are characterized by the superposition of a small number of scaled and delayed copies of Dirac spikes. At the receiver, the observed signal is a sum of these convolved signals, and the task is to find the amplitudes, continuous-indexed delays, and transmitted messages from a single signal. This task is inherently ill-posed without additional assumptions on the channel or messages. In this work, we assume the channel exhibits sparsity in the delay domain and that i.i.d. random linear encoding is applied to the messages at the devices. Leveraging these assumptions, we propose a semidefinite programming optimization capable of simultaneously recovering both messages and the delay parameters of the channels from only a single received signal. Our theoretical analysis establishes that the required number of samples at the receiver scales proportionally to the sum-product of sparsity and message length of all users, aligning with the degrees of freedom in the proposed convex optimization framework. Numerical experiments confirm the efficacy of the proposed method in accurately estimating closely-spaced delay parameters and recovering messages.</description>

Abstract: The rapid growth of wireless communications has created a significant demand for high throughput, seamless connectivity, and extremely low latency. To meet these goals, a novel technology -- stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIMs) -- has been developed to perform signal processing by directly utilizing electromagnetic waves, thus achieving incredibly fast computing speed while reducing hardware requirements. In this article, we provide an overview of SIM technology, including its underlying hardware, benefits, and exciting applications in wireless communications. Specifically, we examine the utilization of SIMs in realizing transmit beamforming and semantic encoding in the wave domain. Additionally, channel estimation in SIM-aided communication systems is discussed. Finally, we highlight potential research opportunities and identify key challenges for deploying SIMs in wireless networks to motivate future research.</description>

      <title>Beamforming Design for Joint Target Sensing and Proactive Eavesdropping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06521v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work studies the beamforming design in the joint target sensing and proactive eavesdropping (JTSAPE) system. The JTSAPE base station (BS) receives the information transmitted by the illegal transmitter and transmits the waveform for target sensing. The shared waveform also serves as artificial noise to interfere with the illegal receiver, thereby achieving proactive eavesdropping. We firstly optimize the transmitting beam of the BS to maximize the eavesdropping signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio or minimize the target estimation parameter Cram{\'{e}}r-Rao bound, respectively. Then, the joint optimization of proactive eavesdropping and target sensing is investigated, and the normalized weighted optimization problem is formulated. To address the complexity of the original problem, the formulated problem is decomposed into two subproblems: proactive eavesdropping and target sensing, which are solved by the semi-definite relaxation technique. Furthermore, the scenario in which the quality of the eavesdropping channel is stronger than that of the illegal channel is considered. We utilize the sequential rank-one constraint relaxation method and iteration technique to obtain the high-quality suboptimal solution of the beam transmit covariance matrix. Numerical simulation shows the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Generative Semantic Communication via Textual Prompts: Latency Performance Tradeoffs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09715v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper develops an edge-device collaborative Generative Semantic Communications (Gen SemCom) framework leveraging pre-trained Multi-modal/Vision Language Models (M/VLMs) for ultra-low-rate semantic communication via textual prompts. The proposed framework optimizes the use of M/VLMs on the wireless edge/device to generate high-fidelity textual prompts through visual captioning/question answering, which are then transmitted over a wireless channel for SemCom. Specifically, we develop a multi-user Gen SemCom framework using pre-trained M/VLMs, and formulate a joint optimization problem of prompt generation offloading, communication and computation resource allocation to minimize the latency and maximize the resulting semantic quality. Due to the nonconvex nature of the problem with highly coupled discrete and continuous variables, we decompose it as a two-level problem and propose a low-complexity swap/leaving/joining (SLJ)-based matching algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate significant performance improvements over the conventional semanticunaware/non-collaborative offloading benchmarks.</description>

Abstract: This paper introduces an information-theoretic framework for text summarization. We define the summarizer rate-distortion function and show that it provides a fundamental lower bound on summarizer performance. We describe an iterative procedure, similar to Blahut-Arimoto algorithm, for computing this function. To handle real-world text datasets, we also propose a practical method that can calculate the summarizer rate-distortion function with limited data. Finally, we empirically confirm our theoretical results by comparing the summarizer rate-distortion function with the performances of different summarizers used in practice.</description>

      <title>Collaborative Coded Caching for Partially Connected Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13298v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coded caching leverages the differences in user cache memories to achieve gains that scale with the total cache size, alleviating network congestion due to high-quality content requests. Additionally, distributing transmitters over a wide area can mitigate the adverse effects of path loss. In this work, we consider a partially connected network where the channel between distributed transmitters (helpers) and users is modeled as a distributed multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) Gaussian broadcast channel. We propose a novel delivery scheme consisting of two phases: partitioning and transmission. In the partitioning phase, users with identical cache profiles are partitioned into the minimum number of sets, such that users within each set can successfully decode their desired message from a joint transmission enabled by MIMO precoding. To optimally partition the users, we employ the branch and bound method. In the transmission phase, each partition is treated as a single entity, and codewords are multicast to partitions with distinct cache profiles. The proposed delivery scheme is applicable to any partially connected network, and while the partitioning is optimal, the overall delivery scheme, including transmission, is heuristic. Interestingly, simulation results show that its performance closely approximates that of the fully connected optimal solution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20961v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop upper bounds on code size for independent and identically distributed deletion (insertion) channel for given code length and target frame error probability. The bounds are obtained as a variation of a general converse bound, which, though available for any channel, is inefficient and not easily computable without a good reference distribution over the output alphabet. We obtain a reference output distribution for a general finite-input finite-output channel and provide a simple formula for the converse bound on the capacity employing this distribution. We then evaluate the bound for the deletion channel with a finite block length and show that the resulting upper bound on the code side is tighter than that for a binary erasure channel, which is the only alternative converse bound for this finite-length setting. Also, we provide the similar results for the insertion channel.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21632v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To efficiently compress the sign information of images, we address a sign retrieval problem for the block-wise discrete cosine transformation (DCT): reconstruction of the signs of DCT coefficients from their amplitudes. To this end, we propose a fast sign retrieval method on the basis of binary classification machine learning. We first introduce 3D representations of the amplitudes and signs, where we pack amplitudes/signs belonging to the same frequency band into a 2D slice, referred to as the sub-band block. We then retrieve the signs from the 3D amplitudes via binary classification, where each sign is regarded as a binary label. We implement a binary classification algorithm using convolutional neural networks, which are advantageous for efficiently extracting features in the 3D amplitudes. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves accurate sign retrieval with an overwhelmingly low computation cost.</description>

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) has shown great potential for enhancing channel state information (CSI) feedback in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication systems, a subject currently under study by the 3GPP standards body. Digital twins (DTs) have emerged as an effective means to generate site-specific datasets for training DL-based CSI feedback models. However, most existing studies rely solely on simulations, leaving the effectiveness of DTs in reducing DL training costs yet to be validated through realistic experimental setups. This paper addresses this gap by establishing a real-world (RW) environment and corresponding virtual channels using ray tracing with replicated 3D models and accurate antenna properties. We evaluate whether models trained in DT environments can effectively operate in RW scenarios and quantify the benefits of online learning (OL) for performance enhancement. Results show that a dedicated DT remains essential even with OL to achieve satisfactory performance in RW scenarios.</description>

      <title>The syzygy distinguisher</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15740v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new distinguisher for alternant and Goppa codes, whose complexity is subexponential in the error-correcting capability, hence better than that of generic decoding algorithms. Moreover it does not suffer from the strong regime limitations of the previous distinguishers or structure recovery algorithms: in particular, it applies to the codes used in the Classic McEliece candidate for postquantum cryptography standardization. The invariants that allow us to distinguish are graded Betti numbers of the homogeneous coordinate ring of a shortening of the dual code.
  Since its introduction in 1978, this is the first time an analysis of the McEliece cryptosystem breaks the exponential barrier.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Combinatorial Semi-bandits with Graph Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18826v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In combinatorial semi-bandits, a learner repeatedly selects from a combinatorial decision set of arms, receives the realized sum of rewards, and observes the rewards of the individual selected arms as feedback. In this paper, we extend this framework to include \emph{graph feedback}, where the learner observes the rewards of all neighboring arms of the selected arms in a feedback graph $G$. We establish that the optimal regret over a time horizon $T$ scales as $\widetilde{\Theta}(S\sqrt{T}+\sqrt{\alpha ST})$, where $S$ is the size of the combinatorial decisions and $\alpha$ is the independence number of $G$. This result interpolates between the known regrets $\widetilde\Theta(S\sqrt{T})$ under full information (i.e., $G$ is complete) and $\widetilde\Theta(\sqrt{KST})$ under the semi-bandit feedback (i.e., $G$ has only self-loops), where $K$ is the total number of arms. A key technical ingredient is to realize a convexified action using a random decision vector with negative correlations. We also show that online stochastic mirror descent (OSMD) that only realizes convexified actions in expectation is suboptimal.</description>

      <title>Q Cells in Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00138v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a given set of transmitters such as cellular base stations or WiFi access points, is it possible to analytically characterize the set of locations that are "covered" in the sense that users at these locations experience a certain minimum quality of service? In this paper, we affirmatively answer this question, by providing explicit simple outer bounds and estimates for the coverage manifold. The key geometric elements of our analytical method are the Q cells, defined as the intersections of a small number of disks. The Q cell of a transmitter is an outer bound to the service region of the transmitter, and, in turn, the union of Q cells is an outer bound to the coverage manifold. In infinite networks, connections to the meta distribution of the signal-to-interference ratio allow for a scaling of the Q cells to obtain accurate estimates of the coverage manifold.</description>
