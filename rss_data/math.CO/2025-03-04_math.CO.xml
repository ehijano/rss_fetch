      <title>Rational parking functions and $(m, n)$-invariant sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An $(m, n)$-parking function can be characterized as function $f:[n] \to [m]$ such that the partition obtained by reordering the values of $f$ fits inside a right triangle with legs of length $m$ and $n$. Recent work by McCammond, Thomas, and Williams define an action of words in $[m]^n$ on $\mathbb{R}^n$. They show that rational parking functions are exactly the words that admit fixed points under that action. An $(m, n)$-invariant set is a set $\Delta \subset \mathbb{Z}$ such that $\Delta + m \subset \Delta$ and $\Delta + n \subset \Delta$. In this work we define an action of words in $[m]^n $ on $(m, n)$-invariant sets by removing the $j$th $m$-generator from $\Delta$. We show this action also characterizes $(m, n)$-parking functions. Further we show that each $(m, n)$-invariant set is fixed by a unique monotone parking function. By relating the actions on $\mathbb{R}^m$ and on $(m, n)$-invariant sets we prove that the set of all the points in $\mathbb{R}^m$ that can be fixed by a parking function is a union of points fixed by monotone parking functions. In the case when $\gcd(m, n) =1$ we characterize the set of periodic points of the action defined on $\mathbb{R}^m$ and show that the algorithm reversing the Pak-Stanley map proposed by Gorsky, Mazin, and Vazirani converges in a finite amount of steps.</description>

      <title>Coloring one-headed directed hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A directed hypergraph is a hypergraph in which the vertex set of each hyperedge is partitioned into two disjoint parts, a head and a tail. Keszegh and P\'alv\"olgyi posed the following conjecture. Let $H$ be a directed hypergraph such that in every hyperedge the number of head-vertices is less than the number of tail-vertices and assume that for every pair of hyperedges $e_{1},e_{2}\in E(H)$ with $|e_{1}\cap e_{2}|=1$, the common vertex is a head-vertex in at least one of the hyperedges. Then $H$ admits a proper 2-coloring. Keszegh showed that the conjecture is also true in the special case of 3-uniform hypergraphs. A directed hypergraph is called one-headed if every hyperedge has exactly one head-vertex. The main result of this paper is that the conjecture is true for one-headed directed hypergraphs with all hyperedges having size at least three.
  Directed 3-uniform hypergraphs such that in every hyperedge the number of head-vertices is one and the number of tail-vertices is two are called $2\rightarrow 1$ hypergraphs. In this paper we consider sufficient conditions for $2\rightarrow 1$ hypergraphs to be proper $k$-colorable for some small $k$.</description>

      <title>Connected equitably $\Delta$-colorable realizations with $k$-factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph $G$ is said to be equitably $c$-colorable if its vertices can be partitioned into $c$ independent sets that pairwise differ in size by at most one. Chen, Lih, and Wu conjectured that every connected graph $G$ with maximum degree $\Delta(G)\geq 2$ has an equitable coloring with $\Delta(G)$ colors, except when $G$ is complete, an odd cycle, or a balanced bipartite graph with odd sized partitions. Suppose $G$ is a connected graph with a $k$-factor (a regular spanning subgraph) $F$ such that $G$ is not complete, a $1$-factor, nor an odd cycle. When $k\geq 1$ we demonstrate that there is a connected $(k-1)$ edge-connected equitably $\Delta(G)$-colorable graph $H$ with a $k$-factor $F'$ such that $G-E(F)=H-E(F')$. If we drop the requirement that $G-E(F)=H-E(F')$, then we can say more. Considering the non-increasing degree sequence $\pi=(d_{1},\ldots, d_{n})$ of $G$ where $d_{i}=deg_{G}(v_{i})$ for all vertices $\{v_{1},\ldots,v_{n}\}$ of $G$, we call $m(\pi)=\max\{i|d_{i}\geq i\}$ the strong index of $\pi$. For $k\geq 0$, we can show that for every $$c\geq \max_{l\leq m(\pi)}\bigg\{\bigg\lfloor\frac{d_{l}+l}{2}\bigg\rfloor\bigg\}+1$$ we can find a connected $(k-1)$ edge-connected equitably $c$-colorable realization $H$ of $\pi$ that has a $k$-factor. In a third theorem we show that if $d_{d_{1}-d_{n}+1}\geq d_{1}-d_{n}+k-1$, then some realization of $\pi$ has a $k$-factor. Together, these three theorems allow us to prove that for all $k$, there is a connected equitably $\Delta(G)$-colorable realization $H$ of $\pi$ with a $k$-factor. Thus, giving support to the validity of the Chen-Lih-Wu Conjecture.</description>

      <title>On the lattice formulation of the union-closed sets conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The union-closed sets conjecture, also known as Frankl's conjecture, is a well-studied problem with various formulations. In terms of lattices, the conjecture states that every finite lattice $L$ with more than one element contains a join-irreducible element that is less than or equal to at most half of the elements in $L$. In this work, we obtain several necessary conditions for any counterexample $\tilde{L}$ of minimum size.</description>

      <title>Chromatic numbers with closed local modular constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalizing the notion of odd-sum colorings, a $\mathbb{Z}$-labeling of a graph $G$ is called a closed coloring with remainder $k\mod n$ if the closed neighborhood label sum of each vertex is congruent to $k\mod n$. If such colorings exist, we write $\chi_{n,k}(G)$ for the minimum number of colors used for a closed coloring with remainder $k\mod n$ such that no neighboring vertices have the same color. General estimates for $\chi_{n,k}(G)$ are given along with evaluations of $\chi_{n,k}(G)$ for some finite and infinite order graphs.</description>

      <title>Independent domination bondage number in graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A non-empty set $S\subseteq V (G)$ of the simple graph $G=(V(G),E(G))$ is an independent dominating set of $G$ if every vertex not in $S$ is adjacent with some vertex in $S$ and the vertices of $S$ are pairwise non-adjacent. The independent domination number of $G$, denoted by $\gamma_i(G)$, is the minimum size of all independent dominating sets of $G$. The independent domination bondage number of $G$ is the minimum number of edges whose removal changes the independent domination number of $G$. In this paper, we investigate properties of independent domination bondage number in graphs. In particular, we obtain several bounds and obtain the independent domination bondage number of some operations of two graphs.</description>

      <title>Invitation to the subpath number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we count all the subpaths of a given graph G; including the subpaths of length zero, and we call this quantity the subpath number of G. The subpath number is related to the extensively studied number of subtrees, as it can be considered as counting subtrees with the additional requirement of maximum degree being two. We first give the explicit formula for the subpath number of trees and unicyclic graphs. We show that among connected graphs on the same number of vertices, the minimum of the subpath number is attained for any tree and the maximum for the complete graph. Further, we show that the complete bipartite graph with partite sets of almost equal size maximizes the subpath number among all bipartite graphs. The explicit formula for cycle chains, i.e. graphs in which two consecutive cycles share a single edge, is also given. This family of graphs includes the unbranched catacondensed benzenoids which implies a possible application of the result in chemistry. The paper is concluded with several directions for possible further research where several conjectures are provided.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an essentially tight bound for the Ramsey-Tur\'an problem for 4-cliques without using the Regularity lemma. This enables us to substantially extend the range in which one has the tight bound for the number of edges in $K_4$-free graphs as a function of the independence number, apart from lower order terms.</description>

      <title>Bijections for faces of braid-type arrangements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a general bijective framework for encoding faces of some classical hyperplane arrangements.
  Precisely, we consider hyperplane arrangements in $\mathbb{R}^n$ whose hyperplanes are all of the form $\{x_i-x_j=s\}$ for some $i,j\in[n]$ and $s\in \mathbb{Z}$. Such an arrangement $A$ is \emph{strongly transitive} if it satisfies the following condition: if $\{x_i-x_j=s\}\notin A$ and $\{x_j-x_k=t\}\notin A$ for some $i,j,k\in [n]$ and $s,t\geq 0$, then $\{x_i-x_k=s+t\}\notin A$.
  For any strongly transitive arrangement $A$, we establish a bijection between the faces of $A$ and some set of decorated plane trees.</description>

      <title>Endomorphism and Automorphism Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a group. The directed endomorphism graph, \dend of $G$ is a directed graph with vertex set $G$ and there is a directed edge from the vertex `$a$' to the vertex `$\, b$' $(a \neq b) $ if and only if there exists an endomorphism on $G$ mapping $a$ to $b$. The endomorphism graph, \uend $\,$ of $G$ is the corresponding undirected simple graph. The automorphism graph, ${Auto}(G)$ of $G$ is an undirected graph with vertex set $G$ and there is an edge from the vertex `$a$' to the vertex `$\,b$' $(a \neq b) $ if and only if there exists an automorphism on $G$ mapping $a$ to $b$. We have explored graph theoretic properties like size, planarity, girth etc. and tried finding out for which types of groups these graphs are complete, diconnected, trees, bipartite and so on.</description>

Abstract: We study $q$-deformation of the probability measure on partitions, i.e., $q$-deformed random partitions. We in particular consider the $q$-Plancherel measure and show a determinantal formula for the correlation function using a $q$-deformation of the discrete Bessel kernel. We also investigate Riemann-Hilbert problems associated with the corresponding orthogonal polynomials and obtain $q$-Painlev{\'e} equations from the $q$-difference Lax formalism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph $H$ is an induced minor of a graph $G$ if $H$ can be obtained from $G$ by a sequence of edge contractions and vertex deletions. Otherwise, $G$ is $H$-induced minor-free. In this paper, we prove that $K_{2,3}$-induced minor-free graphs admit a quasi-isometry with additive distortion to graphs with tree-width at most two. Our result implies that a recent conjecture of Nguyen et al. [Coarse tree-width (2025)] holds for $K_{2,3}$-induced minor-free graphs.</description>

      <title>On CI-property of normal Cayley digraphs over abelian groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Cayley digraph $\Gamma$ over a finite group $G$ is said to be CI if for every Cayley digraph $\Gamma^\prime$ over $G$ isomorphic to $\Gamma$, there is an isomorphism from $\Gamma$ to $\Gamma^\prime$ which is at the same time an automorphism of $G$. In the present paper, we study a CI-property of normal Cayley digraphs over abelian groups, i.e. such Cayley digraphs $\Gamma$ that the group $G_r$ of all right translations of $G$ is normal in $Aut(\Gamma)$. At first, we reduce the case of an arbitrary abelian group to the case of an abelian $p$-group. Further, we obtain several results on CI-property of normal Cayley digraphs over abelian $p$-groups. In particular, we prove that every normal Cayley digraph over an abelian $p$-group of order at most $p^5$, where $p$ is an odd prime, is CI.</description>

      <title>A Self-Conjugate Partition Analog of $(t,t+1)$-Core Partitions with Distinct Parts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simultaneous core partitions have been widely studied in the past 20 years. In 2013, Amdeberhan gave several conjectures on the number, the average size, and the largest size of $(t,t+1)$-core partitions with distinct parts, which was proved and generalized by Straub, Xiong, Nath-Sellers, Zaleski-Zeilberger, Paramonov, and many other mathematicians. In this paper, we introduce a proper self-conjugate partition analog of $(t,t+1)$-core partitions with distinct parts, and derive the number, the average size, and the largest size for such core partitions.</description>

      <title>Soft Barycentric Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The soft Barycentric refinement preserves manifolds with or without boundary. In every dimension larger than one, there is a universal spectral central limiting measure that has affinities with the Barycentric limiting measure one dimension lower. Ricci type quantities like the length of the dual sphere of co-dimension-2 simplex stay invariant under soft refinements. We prove that the dual graphs of any manifold can be colored with 3 colors, which is in the 2-dimensional case a special case of the Groetzsch theorem. It follows that the vertices of a soft Barycentric refined q-manifold G' can be colored by q+1 or q+2 colors.</description>

Abstract: We consider the $2$-neighbor bootstrap percolation process on the $n$-dimensional $q$-ary hypercube with vertex set $V=\{0,1,\dots,q-1\}^n$ and edges connecting the pairs at Hamming distance $1$. We extend the main theorem of Przykucki(2012) about the maximum percolation time with threshold $r=2$ on the binary hypercube to the $q$-ary case, finding the exact value of this time for all $q \geq 3$.</description>

      <title>Optimal Trickle-Down Theorems for Path Complexes via $\mathcal{C}$-Lorentzian Polynomials with Applications to Sampling and Log-Concave Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a $d$-partite $d$-dimensional simplicial complex with parts $T_1,\dots,T_d$ and let $\mu$ be a distribution on the facets of $X$. We say $(X,\mu)$ is a path complex if for any $i&lt;j&lt;k$ and $F \in T_i,G \in T_j, K\in T_k$, we have $\mathbb{P}_\mu[F,K | G]=\mathbb{P}_\mu[F|G]\cdot\mathbb{P}_\mu[K|G].$ We develop a new machinery with $\mathcal{C}$-Lorentzian polynomials to show that if all links of $X$ of co-dimension 2 have spectral expansion at most $1/2$, then $X$ is a $\alpha$-local spectral expander for some $\alpha\leq \pi/2-1$. We then prove that one can derive fast-mixing results and log-concavity statements for top link spectral expanders.
  We use our machinery to prove fast mixing results for sampling maximal flags of flats of distributive lattices (a.k.a. linear extensions of posets) subject to external fields, and to sample maximal flags of flats of "typical" modular lattices. We also use it to re-prove the Heron-Rota-Welsh conjecture and to prove a conjecture of Chan and Pak which gives a generalization of Stanley's log-concavity theorem. Lastly, we use it to prove near optimal trickle-down theorems for Ramanujan path complexes such as constructions by Lubotzky-Samuels-Vishen, Kaufman-Oppenheim, and O'Donnell-Pratt.</description>

      <title>Factorization length distribution for affine semigroups V: explicit asymptotic behavior of weighted factorization lengths on numerical semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe the asymptotic behavior of weighted factorization lengths on numerical semigroups. Our approach is geometric as opposed to analytic, explains the presence of Curry-Schoenberg B-splines as limiting distributions, and provides explicit error bounds (no implied constants left unspecified). Along the way, we explicitly bound the difference between the vector partition function and the number of integer points in the variable polytope for a $2 \times k$ matrix.</description>

      <title>On a problem of Caro on $\mathbb{Z}_3$-Ramsey number of forests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $k$ be a positive integer and let $G$ be a graph. The zero-sum Ramsey number $R(G,\mathbb{Z}_k)$ is the least integer $N$ (if it exists) such that for every edge-coloring $\chi : E(K_N) \to \mathbb{Z}_k$ one can find a copy of $G$ in $K_N$ such that $\sum_{e \in E(G)} \chi(e) = 0$. In 2019, Caro made a conjecture about the $\mathbb{Z}_3$-Ramsey number of trees. In this paper, we settle this conjecture, fixing a few incorrect cases, and extend the result to forests. Namely, we show that \begin{equation*} R(F,\mathbb{Z}_3) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} n+2, &amp; \text{if $F$ is $1 (\mathrm{mod}\, 3)$ regular or a star;}\\ n+1, &amp; \text{if $3 \nmid d(v)$ for every $v \in V(F)$ or $F$ has exactly one} \\ \phantom{placeholder} &amp; \text{vertex of degree $0 (\mathrm{mod}\, 3)$ and all others are $1 (\mathrm{mod}\, 3)$,} \\ \phantom{placeholder} &amp; \text{and $F$ is not $1 (\mathrm{mod}\, 3)$ regular or a star;}\\ n, &amp; \text{otherwise.} \end{array} \right. \end{equation*} where $F$ is any forest on $n$ vertices with $3\mid e(F)$ and no isolated vertices.</description>

      <title>Extremal graphs with maximum complementary second Zagreb index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, a couple of degree-based topological indices, defined using a geometrical point of view of a graph edge, have attracted significant attention and being extensively investigated. Furtula and Oz [Complementary Topological Indices, \textit{MATCH Commun. Math. Comput. Chem.\/} \textbf{93} (2025) 247--263] introduced a novel approach for devising ``geometrical'' topological indices and focused special attention on the complementary second Zagreb index as a representation of the introduced approach. In the same paper, they also conjectured the maximal graphs of order $n$ with the maximum complementary second Zagreb index. In this paper, we confirm their conjecture.</description>

      <title>Group distance magic cubic graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A $\Gamma$\emph{-distance magic labeling} of a graph $G = (V, E)$ with $|V| = n$ is a bijection $\ell$ from $V$ to an Abelian group $\Gamma$ of order $n$, for which there exists $\mu \in \Gamma$, such that the weight $w(x) =\sum_{y\in N(x)}\ell(y)$ of every vertex $x \in V$ is equal to $\mu$. In this case, the element $\mu$ is called the \emph{magic constant of} $G$. A graph $G$ is called a \emph{group distance magic} if there exists a $\Gamma$-distance magic labeling of $G$ for every Abelian group $\Gamma$ of order $n$.
  In this paper, we focused on cubic $\Gamma$-distance magic graphs as well as some properties of such graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let ind-match$(G)$, min-match$(G)$ and match$(G)$ denote the induced matching number, minimum matching number and matching number of a graph $G$, respectively. It is known that ind-match$(G) \leq $ min-match$(G) \leq {\rm match}(G) \leq$ 2min-match$(G)$ holds. In the present paper, we investigate the minimum number of vertices and edges of connencted simple graphs $G$ with ind-match$(G) = p$, min-match$(G) = q$ and ${\rm match}(G) = r$ for pair of integers $p, q, r$ such that $1 \leq p \leq q \leq r \leq 2q$.</description>

      <title>Volume Rigidity of Simplicial Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical results of Cauchy and Dehn imply that the 1-skeleton of a convex polyhedron $P$ is rigid i.e. every continuous motion of the vertices of $P$ in $\mathbb R^3$ which preserves its edge lengths results in a polyhedron which is congruent to $P$. This result was extended to convex poytopes in $\mathbb R^d$ for all $d\geq 3$ by Whiteley, and to generic realisations of 1-skeletons of simplicial $(d-1)$-manifolds in $\mathbb R^{d}$ by Kalai for $d\geq 4$ and Fogelsanger for $d\geq 3$. We will generalise Kalai's result by showing that, for all $d\geq 4$ and any fixed $1\leq k\leq d-3$, every generic realisation of the $k$-skeleton of a simplicial $(d-1)$-manifold in $\mathbb R^{d}$ is volume rigid, i.e. every continuous motion of its vertices in $\mathbb R^d$ which preserves the volumes of its $k$-faces results in a congruent realisation. In addition, we conjecture that our result remains true for $k=d-2$ and verify this conjecture when $d=4,5,6$.</description>

      <title>On the $k$-volume rigidity of a simplicial complex in $\mathbb{R}^d$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define a generic rigidity matroid for $k$-volumes of a simplicial complex in $\mathbb{R}^d$, and prove that for $2\leq k \leq d-1$ it has the same rank as the classical generic $d$-rigidity matroid on the same vertex set (namely, the case $k=1$). This is in contrast with the $k=d$ case, previously studied by Lubetzky and Peled, which presents a different behavior. We conjecture a characterization for the bases of this matroid in terms of $d$-rigidity of the $1$-skeleton of the complex and a combinatorial Hall condition on incidences of edges in $k$-faces.</description>

      <title>Towards Graham's rearrangement conjecture via rainbow paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study an old question in combinatorial group theory which can be traced back to a conjecture of Graham from 1971. Given a group $\Gamma$, and some subset $S\subseteq \Gamma$, is it possible to permute $S$ as $s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_d$ so that the partial products $\prod_{1 \leq i \leq t} s_i$, $t\in [d]$ are all distinct? Most of the progress towards this problem has been in the case when $\Gamma$ is a cyclic group. We show that for any group $\Gamma$ and any $S \subseteq \Gamma$, there is a permutation of $S$ where all but a vanishing proportion of the partial products are distinct, thereby establishing the first asymptotic version of Graham's conjecture under no restrictions on $\Gamma$ or $S$.
  To do so, we explore a natural connection between Graham's problem and the following very natural question attributed to Schrijver. Given a $d$-regular graph $G$ properly edge-coloured with $d$ colours, is it always possible to find a rainbow path with $d-1$ edges? We settle this question asymptotically by showing one can find a rainbow path of length $d - o(d)$. While this has immediate applications to Graham's question for example when $\Gamma = \mathbb{F}_2^k$, our general result above requires a more involved result we obtain for the natural directed analogue of Schrijver's question.</description>

      <title>Cyclic subsets in regular Dirac graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1996, in his last paper, Erd\H{o}s asked the following question that he formulated together with Faudree: is there a positive $c$ such that any $(n+1)$-regular graph $G$ on $2n$ vertices contains at least $c 2^{2n}$ distinct vertex-subsets $S$ that are cyclic, meaning that there is a cycle in $G$ using precisely the vertices in $S$. We answer this question in the affirmative in a strong form by proving the following exact result: if $n$ is sufficiently large and $G$ minimises the number of cyclic subsets then $G$ is obtained from the complete bipartite graph $K_{n-1,n+1}$ by adding a $2$-factor (a spanning collection of vertex-disjoint cycles) within the part of size $n+1$. In particular, for $n$ large, this implies that the optimal $c$ in the problem is precisely $1/2$.</description>

      <title>On the time complexity of finding a well-spread perfect matching in bridgeless cubic graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an algorithm for finding a perfect matching in a $3$-edge-connected cubic graph that intersects every $3$-edge cut in exactly one edge. Specifically, we propose an algorithm with a time complexity of $O(n \log^4 n)$, which significantly improves upon the previously known $O(n^3)$-time algorithms for the same problem. The technique we use for the improvement is efficient use of cactus model of 3-edge cuts. As an application, we use our algorithm to compute embeddings of $3$-edge-connected cubic graphs with limited number of singular edges (i.e., edges that are twice in the boundary of one face) in $O(n \log^4 n)$ time; this application contributes to the study of the well-known Cycle Double Cover conjecture.</description>

      <title>Interval H-graphs : Recognition and forbidden obstructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the class of interval $H$-graphs, which is the generalization of interval graphs, particularly interval bigraphs. For a fixed graph $H$ with vertices $a_1,a_2,\dots,a_k$, we say that an input graph $G$ with given partition $V_1,\dots,V_k$ of its vertices is an interval $H$-graph if each vertex $v \in G$ can be represented by an interval $I_v$ from a real line so that $u \in V_i$ and $v \in V_j$ are adjacent if and only if $a_ia_j$ is an edge of $H$ and intervals $I_u$ and $I_v$ intersect. $G$ is called interval $k$-graph if $H$ is a complete graph on $k$ vertices. and interval bigraph when $k=2$. We study the ordering characterization and forbidden obstructions of interval $k$-graphs and present a polynomial-time recognition algorithm for them. Additionally, we discuss how this algorithm can be extended to recognize general interval $H$-graphs. Special cases of interval $k$-graphs, particularly comparability interval $k$-graphs, were previously studied in [2], where the complexity interval $k$-graph recognition was posed as an open problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the recently introduced inhomogeneous $n$-species $t$-PushTASEP, a long-range stochastic process on a periodic lattice. A Baxter-type formula is established, expressing the Markov matrix as an alternating sum of commuting transfer matrices over all the fundamental representations of $U_t(\widehat{sl}_{n+1})$. This superposition acts as an inclusion-exclusion principle, selectively extracting the sequential particle transitions characteristic of the PushTASEP, while canceling forbidden channels. The homogeneous specialization connects the PushTASEP to ASEP, showing that the two models share eigenstates and a common integrability structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We characterize the words that can be mapped to arbitrarily high powers by injective morphisms. For all other words, we prove a linear upper bound for the highest power that they can be mapped to, and this bound is optimal up to a constant factor if there is no restriction on the size of the alphabet. We also prove that, for any integer $n \geq 2$, deciding whether a given word can be mapped to an $n$th power by a nonperiodic morphism is NP-hard and in PSPACE, and so is deciding whether a given word can be mapped to a nonprimitive word by a nonperiodic morphism.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the radius of gyration of a Gaussian topological polymer $G$ formed by subdividing a graph $G'$ of arbitrary topology (for instance, branched or multicyclic). We give a new exact formula for the expected radius of gyration and contraction factor of $G$ in terms of the number of subdivisions of each edge of $G'$ and a new weighted Kirchhoff index for $G'$. The formula explains and extends previous results for the contraction factor and Kirchhoff index of subdivided graphs.</description>

      <title>On the module of derivations of a line arrangement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To each multiple point $p$ in a line arrangement $\mathcal A$ in the complex projective plane we associate a derivation $\tilde D_p \in D_0( \mathcal A)$. We show first that these derivations span a large subspace of $D_0(\mathcal A)$. To each such derivation $\tilde D_p \in D_0(\mathcal A)$ we associate a polynomial $g_p$ which seems to play a key role in the characterization of the freeness of $\mathcal A$, as well as in the study of the position of the multiple points of $\mathcal A$ with respect to unions of lines.</description>

      <title>Positive Polytopes with Few Facets in the Grassmannian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we study adjoint hypersurfaces of geometric objects obtained by intersecting simple polytopes with few facets in $\mathbb{P}^5$ with the Grassmannian $\mathrm{Gr}(2,4)$. These generalize the positive Grassmannian, which is the intersection of $\mathrm{Gr}(2,4)$ with the simplex. We show that if the resulting object has five facets, it is a positive geometry and the adjoint hypersurface is unique. For the case of six facets we show that the adjoint hypersurface is not necessarily unique and give an upper bound on the dimension of the family of adjoints. We illustrate our results with a range of examples. In particular, we show that even if the adjoint is not unique, a positive hexahedron can still be a positive geometry.</description>

Abstract: Let $q$ be a non-degenerate quadratic form defined on an $F$ vector space $V$ and $a \in F$. We consider the Cayley graph on $V$ with generating set $\{x \in V \mid q(x) = a\}$ and study its diameter and girth. In particular, if $F$ is a finite field, we calculate these invariants and the number of cycles of minimal length in these graphs.</description>

Abstract: We give the generating function for the index of integer lattice points, relative to a finite order ideal. The index is an important concept in the theory of border bases, an alternative to Gr\"obner bases.
  Equivalently, we explicitly solve a class of difference equations where the right-hand side is the minimum of a number of affine forms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1703.02147v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We solve a problem in enumerative combinatorics which is equivalent to counting topological types of certain group actions on compact Riemann surfaces. Let $V_2(F_p)$ be the two-dimensional vector space over $F_p$, the field with $p$ elements, $p$ an odd prime. We count orbits of the general linear group $GL_2(F_p)$ on certain multisets consisting of $R \geq 3$ non-zero columns from $V_2(F_p)$. The $R$-multisets are `zero-sum,' that is, the sum (mod $p$) over the columns in the multiset is $[\begin{smallmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \end{smallmatrix}]$. The orbit count yields the number of topological types of fully ramified actions of the elementary abelian $p$-group of rank $2$ on compact Riemann surfaces of genus $1+ Rp(p-1)/2-p^2.$</description>

Abstract: The notion of forcing sets for perfect matchings was introduced by Harary, Klein, and \v{Z}ivkovi\'{c}. The application of this problem in chemistry, as well as its interesting theoretical aspects, made this subject very active. In this work, we introduce the notion of forcing function of fractional perfect matchings, which is continuous analogous to forcing sets defined over the perfect matching polytope of graphs. We show that this object is a continuous and concave function extension of the integral forcing set. Then, we use our results in the continuous world to conclude new bounds and results in the discrete case of forcing sets, for the family of regular edge-transitive graphs. In particular, we derive new upper bounds for the maximum forcing number of hypercube graphs.</description>

      <title>Moments of Colored Permutation Statistics on Conjugacy Classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.11800v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the moments of statistics on conjugacy classes of the colored permutation groups $\mathfrak{S}_{n,r}=\mathbb{Z}_r\wr \mathfrak{S}_n$. We first show that any fixed moment coincides on all conjugacy classes where all cycles have sufficiently long length. Additionally, for permutation statistics that can be realized via a process we call symmetric extensions, these moments are polynomials in $n$. Finally, for the descent statistic on the hyperoctahedral group $B_n\cong \mathfrak{S}_{n,2}$, we show that its distribution on conjugacy classes without short cycles satisfies a central limit theorem. Our results build on and generalize previous work of Fulman (\textit{J. Comb. Theory Ser. A.}, 1998), Hamaker and Rhoades (arXiv, 2022), and Campion Loth, Levet, Liu, Stucky, Sundaram, and Yin (arXiv, 2023). In particular, our techniques utilize the combinatorial framework introduced by Campion Loth, Levet, Liu, Stucky, Sundaram, and Yin.</description>

      <title>Combinatorics on words and generating Dirichlet series of automatic sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13524v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generating series are crucial in enumerative combinatorics, analytic combinatorics, and combinatorics on words. Though it might seem at first view that generating Dirichlet series are less used in these fields than ordinary and exponential generating series, there are many notable papers where they play a fundamental role, as can be seen in particular in the work of Flajolet and several of his co-authors. In this paper, we study Dirichlet series of integers with missing digits or blocks of digits in some integer base $b$; i.e., where the summation ranges over the integers whose expansions form some language strictly included in the set of all words over the alphabet $\{0, 1, \dots, b-1\}$ that do not begin with a $0$. We show how to unify and extend results proved by Nathanson in 2021 and by K\"ohler and Spilker in 2009. En route, we encounter several sequences from Sloane's On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences, as well as some famous $b$-automatic sequences or $b$-regular sequences. We also consider a specific sequence that is not $b$-regular.</description>

Abstract: We give elementary and non-inductive proofs of three fundamental theorems about Chow rings of matroids: the standard monomial basis, Poincare duality, and the dragon-Hall-Rado formula. Our approach, which also works for augmented Chow rings of matroids, is based on a straightening law. This approach also gives a decomposition of the Chow ring of a matroid into pieces indexed by flats.</description>

      <title>A census of graph-drawing algorithms based on generalized transversal structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18980v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present two graph drawing algorithms based on the recently defined "grand-Schnyder woods", which are a far-reaching generalization of the classical Schnyder woods. The first is a straight-line drawing algorithm for plane graphs with faces of degree 3 and 4 with no separating 3-cycle, while the second is a rectangular drawing algorithm for the dual of such plane graphs.
  In our algorithms, the coordinates of the vertices are defined in a global manner, based on the underlying grand-Schnyder woods. The grand-Schnyder woods and drawings are computed in linear time.
  When specializing our algorithms to special classes of plane graphs, we recover the following known algorithms: (1) He's algorithm for rectangular drawing of 3-valent plane graphs, based on transversal structures, (2) Fusy's algorithm for the straight-line drawing of triangulations of the square, based on transversal structures, (3) Bernardi and Fusy's algorithm for the orthogonal drawing of 4-valent plane graphs, based on 2-orientations, (4) Barriere and Huemer's algorithm for the straight-line drawing of quadrangulations, based on separating decompositions.
  Our contributions therefore provide a unifying perspective on a large family of graph drawing algorithms that were originally defined on different classes of plane graphs and were based on seemingly different combinatorial structures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00511v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the multivariate independence polynomials of graphs and the log-concavity of the coefficients of their univariate restrictions. Let $R_{W_4}$ be the operator defined on simple and undirected graphs which replaces each edge with a caterpillar of size $4$. We prove that all graphs in the image of $R_{W_4}$ are what we call pre-Lorentzian, that is, their multivariate independence polynomial becomes Lorentzian after appropriate manipulations. In particular, as pre-Lorentzian graphs have log-concave (and therefore unimodal) independence sequences, our result makes progress on a conjecture of Alavi, Malde, Schwenk and Erd\H{o}s which asks if the independence sequence of trees or forests is unimodal.</description>

Useful property of distance-equalizer set of arbitrary graph $G$ has been established. For Johnson graphs $J_{n,2}$ and Kneser graphs $K_{n,2}$ exact values for $eqdim(J_{n,2})$ and $eqdim(K_{n,2})$ have been derived, while for Johnson graphs $J_{n,3}$ it is proved that $eqdim(J_{n,3}) \le n-2$. Finally, exact value of $eqdim(J_{2k,k})$ for odd $k$ has been presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12323v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An edge-colored multigraph $G$ is rainbow connected if every pair of vertices is joined by at least one rainbow path, i.e., a path where no two edges are of the same color.
  In the context of multilayered networks we introduce the notion of multilayered random geometric graphs, from $h\ge 2$ independent random geometric graphs $G(n,r)$ on the unit square. We define an edge-coloring by coloring the edges according to the copy of $G(n,r)$ they belong to and study the rainbow connectivity of the resulting edge-colored multigraph. We show that $r(n)=\left(\frac{\log n}{n}\right)^{\frac{h-1}{2h}}$ is a threshold of the radius for the property of being rainbow connected. This complements the known analogous results for the multilayerd graphs defined on the Erd\H{o}s-R\' enyi random model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01395v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The chromatic symmetric $X_G$ function is a symmetric function generalization of the chromatic polynomial of a graph, introduced by Stanley (1995). Stanley gave an expansion formula for $X_G$ in terms of the power sum symmetric functions $p_\lambda$ using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, and in arXiv:1904.01262, Bernardi and Nadeau gave an alternate $p$-expansion for $X_G$ in terms of acyclic orientations. In arXiv:2301.02177, Crew, Pechenik, and Spirkl defined the Kromatic symmetric function $\overline{X}_G$ as a $K$-theoretic analogue of $X_G$, constructed in the same way except that each vertex is assigned a nonempty set of colors such that adjacent vertices have nonoverlapping color sets. They defined a $K$-analogue $\overline{p}_\lambda$ of the power sum basis and computed the first few coefficients of the $\overline{p}$-expansion of $\overline{X}_G$ for some small graphs $G$. They conjectured that the $\overline{p}$-expansion always has integer coefficients and asked whether there is an explicit formula for these coefficients. In this note, we give a formula for the $\overline{p}$-expansion of $\overline{X}_G$, show two ways to compute the coefficients recursively (along with examples), and prove that the coefficients are indeed always integers. In a more recent paper arXiv:2502.21285, we use our formula from this note to give a combinatorial description of the $\overline{p}$-coefficients $[\overline{p}_\lambda]\overline{X}_G$ and a simple characterization of their signs in the case of unweighted graphs.</description>

Abstract: A graph $G$ is cordial if there exists a function $f$ from the vertices of $G$ to $\{0,1\}$ such that the number of vertices labelled $0$ and the number of vertices labelled $1$ differ by at most $1$, and if we assign to each edge $xy$ the label $|f(x)-f(y)|$, the number of edges labelled $0$ and the number of edges labelled $1$ also differ at most by $1$. We introduce two measures of how close a graph is to being cordial, and compute these measures for a variety of classes of graphs.</description>

      <title>Phase transition of degenerate Tur\'{a}n problems in $p$-norms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15579v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a positive real number $p$, the $p$-norm $\left\lVert G \right\rVert_p$ of a graph $G$ is the sum of the $p$-th powers of all vertex degrees. We study the maximum $p$-norm $\mathrm{ex}_{p}(n,F)$ of $F$-free graphs on $n$ vertices. F\"{u}redi and K\"{u}ndgen \cite{FK06} show that for every bipartite graph $F$, there exists a threshold $p_F$ such that for $p&lt; p_{F}$, the order of $\mathrm{ex}_{p}(n,F)$ is governed by pseudorandom constructions, while for $p &gt; p_{F}$, it is governed by star-like constructions, assuming a mild assumption on the growth rate of $\mathrm{ex}(n,F)$. The main contribution of our paper is extending this result to hypergraph. Moreover, in the case of graph, our proof differs from that in \cite{FK06}, offering the advantage of producing the correct constant factor when $p &gt; p_{F}$.
  When $p = p_F$, F\"{u}redi and K\"{u}ndgen proved a general upper bound on $\mathrm{ex}_{p}(n,F)$, tight up to a $\log n$ factor, and conjectured that this factor is unnecessary. We confirm this conjecture for several well-studied bipartite graphs, including one-side degree-bounded graphs and families of short even cycles.</description>

      <title>Spectral Radius of Graphs with Size Constraints: Resolving a Conjecture of Guiduli</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06375v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We resolve a problem posed by Guiduli (1996) on the spectral radius of graphs satisfying the Hereditarily Bounded Property $P_{t,r}$, which requires that every subgraph $H$ with $|V(H)| \geq t$ satisfies $|E(H)| \leq t|V(H)| + r$. For an $n$-vertex graph $G$ satisfying $P_{t,r}$, where $t &gt; 0$ and $r \geq -\binom{\lfloor t+1 \rfloor}{2}$, we prove that the spectral radius $\rho(G)$ is bounded above by $\rho(G) \leq c(s,t) + \sqrt{\lfloor t \rfloor n}$, where $s = \binom{\lfloor t \rfloor + 1}{2} + r$, thus affirmatively answering Guiduli's conjecture.
  Furthermore, we present a complete characterization of the extremal graphs that achieve this bound. These graphs are constructed as the join graph $K_{\lfloor t \rfloor} \nabla F$, where $F$ is either $K_3 \cup (n - \lfloor t \rfloor - 3)K_1$ or a forest consisting solely of star structures. The specific structure of such forests is meticulously characterized.
  Central to our analysis is the introduction of a novel potential function $\eta(F) = e(F) + (\lfloor t \rfloor - t)|V(F)|$, which quantifies the structural "positivity" of subgraphs. By combining edge-shifting operations with spectral radius maximization principles, we establish sharp bounds on $\eta^+(G)$, the cumulative positivity of $G$. Our results contribute to the understanding of spectral extremal problems under edge-density constraints and provide a framework for analyzing similar hereditary properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06524v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the hypersimplex under the action of the symmetric group $S_n$ by coordinate permutation. We prove that the evaluation of its equivariant $H^*$-polynomial at $1$ is the permutation character of decorated ordered set partitions under the natural action of $S_n$. This verifies a conjecture of Stapledon for the hypersimplex. To prove this result, we give a formula for the coefficients of the $H^*$-polynomial. Additionally, for the $(2,n)$-hypersimplex, we use this formula to show that trivial character need not appear as a direct summand of a coefficient of the $H^*$-polynomial, which gives a family of counterexamples to a different conjecture of Stapledon.</description>

      <title>Transposes in the $q$-deformed modular group and their applications to $q$-deformed rational numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02974v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The (right) \textit{q}-deformed rational numbers was originally introduced by Morier-Genoud and Ovsienko, and its left variant by Bapat, Becker and Licata. These notions are based on continued fractions and the \textit{q}-deformed modular group actions. For any matrix in this group, Leclere and Morier-Genoud showed that its trace is a palindromic polynomial whose coefficients are all non-negative (up to $\pm q^{N}$ times ). In this paper, we define the \textit{$q$-transpose} for matrices in this group. Using this, we give new proofs of the above result and some others. We also give arithmetic properties on the left \textit{q}-rational numbers. Finally, we show that the conjecture of Kantarc{\i} O\u{g}uz on circular fence posets implies a conjecture on the normalized Jones polynomials of rational links.</description>

      <title>Factorization norms and Zarankiewicz problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18429v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $\gamma_2$-norm of Boolean matrices plays an important role in communication complexity and discrepancy theory. In this paper, we study combinatorial properties of this norm, and provide new applications, involving Zarankiewicz type problems. We show that if $M$ is an $m\times n$ Boolean matrix such that $\gamma_2(M)&lt;\gamma$ and $M$ contains no $t\times t$ all-ones submatrix, then $M$ contains $O_{\gamma,t}(m+n)$ one entries. In other words, graphs of bounded $\gamma_2$-norm are degree bounded. This addresses a conjecture of Hambardzumyan, Hatami, and Hatami for locally sparse matrices. We prove that if $G$ is a $K_{t,t}$-free incidence graph of $n$ points and $n$ homothets of a polytope $P$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$, then the average degree of $G$ is $O_{d,P}(t(\log n)^{O(d)})$. This is sharp up the $O(.)$ notations. In particular, we prove a more general result on semilinear graphs, which greatly strengthens the work of Basit, Chernikov, Starchenko, Tao, and Tran.</description>

      <title>An analogue of Kida's formula in graph theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.04890v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\ell$ be a rational prime and let $p:Y\rightarrow X$ be a Galois cover of finite graphs whose Galois group is a finite $\ell$-group. Consider a $\mathbb{Z}_{\ell}$-tower above $X$ and its pullback along $p$. Assuming that all the graphs in the pullback are connected, one obtains a $\mathbb{Z}_{\ell}$-tower above $Y$. Under the assumption that the Iwasawa $\mu$-invariant of the tower above $X$ vanishes, we prove a formula relating the Iwasawa $\lambda$-invariant of the $\mathbb{Z}_{\ell}$-tower above $X$ to the Iwasawa $\lambda$-invariant of the pullback. This formula is analogous to Kida's formula in classical Iwasawa theory. We present an application to the study of structural properties of certain noncommutative pro-$\ell$ towers of graphs, based on an analogy with classical results of Cuoco on the growth of Iwasawa invariants in $\mathbb{Z}_\ell^2$-extensions of number fields. Our investigations are illustrated by explicit examples.</description>

Abstract: We present an explicit construction of a sequence of rate $1/2$ Wozencraft ensemble codes (over any fixed finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$) that achieve minimum distance $\Omega(\sqrt{k})$ where $k$ is the message length. The coefficients of the Wozencraft ensemble codes are constructed using Sidon Sets and the cyclic structure of $\mathbb{F}_{q^{k}}$ where $k+1$ is prime with $q$ a primitive root modulo $k+1$. Assuming Artin's conjecture, there are infinitely many such $k$ for any prime power $q$.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Softassign via Hadamard-Equipped Sinkhorn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13855v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Softassign is a pivotal method in graph matching and other learning tasks. Many softassign-based algorithms exhibit performance sensitivity to a parameter in the softassign. However, tuning the parameter is challenging and almost done empirically. This paper proposes an adaptive softassign method for graph matching by analyzing the relationship between the objective score and the parameter. This method can automatically tune the parameter based on a given error bound to guarantee accuracy. The Hadamard-Equipped Sinkhorn formulas introduced in this study significantly enhance the efficiency and stability of the adaptive softassign. Moreover, these formulas can also be used in optimal transport problems. The resulting adaptive softassign graph matching algorithm enjoys significantly higher accuracy than previous state-of-the-art large graph matching algorithms while maintaining comparable efficiency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.01786v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the output-sensitive complexity for linear multi-objective integer minimum cost flow (MOIMCF) problems and provides insights about the time complexity for enumerating all supported nondominated vectors. The paper shows that there can not exist an output-polynomial time algorithm for the enumeration of all supported nondominated vectors that determine the vectors in an ordered way in the outcome space unless NP = P. Moreover, novel methods for identifying supported nondominated vectors in bi-objective minimum cost flow (BOIMCF) problems are proposed, accompanied by a numerical comparison between decision- and objective-space methods. A novel, equivalent and more compact formulation of the minimum cost flow ILP formulation used in the e-constrained-scalarization approach is introduced, demonstrating enhanced efficiency in the numerical tests</description>

      <title>The Symplectic Schur Process</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02415v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define a measure on tuples of partitions, called the symplectic Schur process, that should be regarded as the right analogue of the Schur process of Okounkov-Reshetikhin for the Cartan type C. The weights of our measure include factors that are universal symplectic characters, as well as a novel family of "Down-Up Schur functions" that we define and for which we prove new identities of Cauchy-Littlewood-type. Our main structural result is that the point process corresponding to the symplectic Schur process is determinantal and we find an explicit correlation kernel. We also present dynamics that preserve the family of symplectic Schur processes and explore an alternative sampling scheme, based on the Berele insertion algorithm, in a special case. Finally, we study the asymptotics of the Berele insertion process and find explicit formulas for the limit shape and fluctuations near the bulk and the edge. One of the limit regimes leads to a new kernel that resembles the symmetric Pearcey kernel.</description>

Abstract: The combinatorics of dimer models on brane tilings describe a large class of four-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=1$ gauge theories that afford quiver descriptions and have toric moduli spaces. We introduce a combinatorial optimization method leveraging simulated annealing to explicitly construct geometrically consistent brane tilings, providing a proof of concept for efficient generation of gauge theories using metaheuristic techniques. The implementation of this idea recovers known examples and allows us to derive a new brane tiling with $26$ quantum fields, illustrating the potential of metaheuristic techniques as a valuable addition to the toolbox for constructing and analyzing gauge theories from brane tilings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11819v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have previously proposed a study of arrangements of small circles which also surround regions in the plane realized as the images of natural real algebraic maps yielding Morse-Bott functions by projections. Among studies of arrangements, families of smooth regular submanifolds in smooth manifolds, this study is fundamental, explicit, and new, surprisingly.
  We have obtained a complete list of local changes of the graphs the regions naturally collapse to in adding a (generic) small circle to an existing arrangement of the proposed class. Here, we propose a similar and essentially different class of arrangements of circles. The present study also yields real algebraic maps and nice real algebraic functions similarly and we present a similar study.
  We are interested in topological properties and combinatorics among such arrangements and regions and applications to constructing such real algebraic maps and manifolds explicitly and understanding their global structures.</description>

      <title>Realizations of planar graphs as Poincar'e-Reeb graphs of refined algebraic domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17425v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Algebraic domains are regions in the plane surrounded by mutually disjoint non-singular real algebraic curves. Poincar'e-Reeb Graphs of them are graphs they naturally collapse: such graphs are formally formulated by Sorea, for example, around 2020. Their studies found that nicely embedded planar graphs are Poincar'e-Reeb graphs of some algebraic domains. These graphs are generic with respect to the projection to the horizontal axis. Problems, methods and results are elementary and natural and they apply natural approximations nicely for example.
  We present our new approach to extension of the result to a non-generic case and an answer. We first formulate generalized algebraic domains, surrounded by non-singular real algebraic curves which may intersect with normal crossings. Such domains and certain classes of them appear in related studies of graphs and regions surrounded by algebraic curves explicitly.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Algorithms for the Representation of integers by Binary Quadratic forms: Reduction to Subset Sum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11402v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present efficient algorithms for solving the Diophantine equation $f(x, y) = m$ for an arbitrary definite binary quadratic form $f$, given the factorization of $m$. While Cornacchia's algorithm to solve $x^2 + dy^2 = m$ is efficient in many cases, its runtime becomes exponentially large when $m$ is highly composite and encounters subtleties when generalized to arbitrary forms $f$. To address these issues, we give a reduction from our problem to an instance of the Subset sum, a weakly NP complete problem, allowing for more efficient solutions. Leveraging this approach, we develop deterministic algorithms that adapt to different cases based on $\mathrm{disc}(f)$ and $ m $. In particular, when $|\mathrm{disc}(f)| = \mathrm{polylog}(m) $, we provide a polynomial time solution that remains efficient regardless of the structure of $ m $. For more general cases, we present an algorithm that improves upon Cornacchia's method, achieving a quadratic speedup. Recently, the problem of representing integers by a form $ f $ found important applications in elliptic curves and isogeny based cryptography, where these algorithms are central to solving norm form equations.</description>

      <title>Arrangements of circles, the regions surrounded by them and labeled Poincar\'e-Reeb graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15195v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We are interested in arrangements of circles and the regions surrounded by them. {\it Poincar\'e-Reeb graphs} have been fundamental and strong tools in studying shapes of regions surrounded by real algebraic curves, since around 2020. They are natural graphs the regions naturally collapse to and were first formulated by Sorea with several researchers. Studying shapes of such regions is one of fundamental studies in real algebraic geometry and combinatorics for example. This is surprisingly new and recently developing.
  Our study introduces labels on vertices and edges of such graphs encoding information of the circles where we concentrate on regions surrounded by circles. The author studied local changes of Poincar\'e-Reeb graphs by addition of circles under certain rules before and we discuss changes of new types. The author has started related studies motivated by singularity theory of real algebraic maps and found first that our regions are the images of natural real algebraic maps, generalizing natural projections of spheres.</description>

      <title>Frobenius subalgebra lattices in tensor categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19876v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper examines Frobenius subalgebra posets in abelian monoidal categories and shows that they form lattices under certain conditions, including all fusion categories. It then extends Watatani's theorem on the finiteness of intermediate subfactors, proving that these lattices are finite under specific positivity constraints, encompassing all pseudo-unitary fusion categories. The primary tools employed in this study are semisimplification and a concept of formal angle. Additionally, we have broadened several intermediate results, such as the exchange relation theorem and Landau's theorem, to apply to abelian monoidal categories.
  Key applications of our findings include a stronger version of the Ino-Watatani result: we show that the finiteness of intermediate C*-algebras holds in a finite-index unital irreducible inclusion of C*-algebras without requiring the simple assumption. Moreover, for a finite-dimensional semisimple Hopf algebra H, we demonstrate that H* contains a finite number of Frobenius subalgebra objects in Rep(H). Finally, we explore a range of applications, including abstract spin chains, vertex operator algebras, and speculations on quantum arithmetic involving the generalization of Ore's theorem, Euler's totient and sigma functions, and RH.</description>
