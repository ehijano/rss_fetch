      <title>Estimating Heterogeneous Effects: Applications to Labor Economics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A growing number of applications involve settings where, in order to infer heterogeneous effects, a researcher compares various units. Examples of research designs include children moving between different neighborhoods, workers moving between firms, patients migrating from one city to another, and banks offering loans to different firms. We present a unified framework for these settings, based on a linear model with normal random coefficients and normal errors. Using the model, we discuss how to recover the mean and dispersion of effects, other features of their distribution, and to construct predictors of the effects. We provide moment conditions on the model's parameters, and outline various estimation strategies. A main objective of the paper is to clarify some of the underlying assumptions by highlighting their economic content, and to discuss and inform some of the key practical choices.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous Treatment Effects and Causal Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The credibility revolution advances the use of research designs that permit identification and estimation of causal effects. However, understanding which mechanisms produce measured causal effects remains a challenge. A dominant current approach to the quantitative evaluation of mechanisms relies on the detection of heterogeneous treatment effects with respect to pre-treatment covariates. This paper develops a framework to understand when the existence of such heterogeneous treatment effects can support inferences about the activation of a mechanism. We show first that this design cannot provide evidence of mechanism activation without additional, generally implicit, assumptions. Further, even when these assumptions are satisfied, if a measured outcome is produced by a non-linear transformation of a directly-affected outcome of theoretical interest, heterogeneous treatment effects are not informative of mechanism activation. We provide novel guidance for interpretation and research design in light of these findings.</description>

      <title>The impact of geopolitical risk on the international agricultural market: Empirical analysis based on the GJR-GARCH-MIDAS model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The current international landscape is turbulent and unstable, with frequent outbreaks of geopolitical conflicts worldwide. Geopolitical risk has emerged as a significant threat to regional and global peace, stability, and economic prosperity, causing serious disruptions to the global food system and food security. Focusing on the international food market, this paper builds different dimensions of geopolitical risk measures based on the random matrix theory and constructs single- and two-factor GJR-GARCH-MIDAS models with fixed time span and rolling window, respectively, to investigate the impact of geopolitical risk on food market volatility. The findings indicate that modeling based on rolling window performs better in describing the overall volatility of the wheat, maize, soybean, and rice markets, and the two-factor models generally exhibit stronger explanatory power in most cases. In terms of short-term fluctuations, all four staple food markets demonstrate obvious volatility clustering and high volatility persistence, without significant asymmetry. Regarding long-term volatility, the realized volatility of wheat, maize, and soybean significantly exacerbates their long-run market volatility. Additionally, geopolitical risks of different dimensions show varying directions and degrees of effects in explaining the long-term market volatility of the four staple food commodities. This study contributes to the understanding of the macro-drivers of food market fluctuations, provides useful information for investment using agricultural futures, and offers valuable insights into maintaining the stable operation of food markets and safeguarding global food security.</description>

      <title>Robustly estimating heterogeneity in factorial data using Rashomon Partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many statistical analyses, in both observational data and randomized control trials, ask: how does the outcome of interest vary with combinations of observable covariates? How do various drug combinations affect health outcomes, or how does technology adoption depend on incentives and demographics? Our goal is to partition this factorial space into ``pools'' of covariate combinations where the outcome differs across the pools (but not within a pool). Existing approaches (i) search for a single ``optimal'' partition under assumptions about the association between covariates or (ii) sample from the entire set of possible partitions. Both these approaches ignore the reality that, especially with correlation structure in covariates, many ways to partition the covariate space may be statistically indistinguishable, despite very different implications for policy or science. We develop an alternative perspective, called Rashomon Partition Sets (RPSs). Each item in the RPS partitions the space of covariates using a tree-like geometry. RPSs incorporate all partitions that have posterior values near the maximum a posteriori partition, even if they offer substantively different explanations, and do so using a prior that makes no assumptions about associations between covariates. This prior is the $\ell_0$ prior, which we show is minimax optimal. Given the RPS we calculate the posterior of any measurable function of the feature effects vector on outcomes, conditional on being in the RPS. We also characterize approximation error relative to the entire posterior and provide bounds on the size of the RPS. Simulations demonstrate this framework allows for robust conclusions relative to conventional regularization techniques. We apply our method to three empirical settings: price effects on charitable giving, chromosomal structure (telomere length), and the introduction of microfinance.</description>

      <title>Estimation and Inference for a Class of Generalized Hierarchical Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02789v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider estimation and inference for the unknown parameters and function involved in a class of generalized hierarchical models. Such models are of great interest in the literature of neural networks (such as Bauer and Kohler, 2019). We propose a rectified linear unit (ReLU) based deep neural network (DNN) approach, and contribute to the design of DNN by i) providing more transparency for practical implementation, ii) defining different types of sparsity, iii) showing the differentiability, iv) pointing out the set of effective parameters, and v) offering a new variant of rectified linear activation function (ReLU), etc. Asymptotic properties are established accordingly, and a feasible procedure for the purpose of inference is also proposed. We conduct extensive numerical studies to examine the finite-sample performance of the estimation methods, and we also evaluate the empirical relevance and applicability of the proposed models and estimation methods to real data.</description>

      <title>Breaking the HISCO Barrier: Automatic Occupational Standardization with OccCANINE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13604v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new tool, OccCANINE, to automatically transform occupational descriptions into the HISCO classification system. The manual work involved in processing and classifying occupational descriptions is error-prone, tedious, and time-consuming. We finetune a preexisting language model (CANINE) to do this automatically, thereby performing in seconds and minutes what previously took days and weeks. The model is trained on 14 million pairs of occupational descriptions and HISCO codes in 13 different languages contributed by 22 different sources. Our approach is shown to have accuracy, recall, and precision above 90 percent. Our tool breaks the metaphorical HISCO barrier and makes this data readily available for analysis of occupational structures with broad applicability in economics, economic history, and various related disciplines.</description>
