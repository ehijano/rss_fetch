      <title>Generalization on the higher moments of the Fourier coefficients of symmetric power $L$-functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For an even integer $k\geq 2$, let $f$ be a primitive holomorphic cusp form of weight $k$ for the full modular group $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ and let $\lambda_{{\rm{sym}}^jf}(n)$ denote the $n^\text{th}$ normalized Fourier coefficient of the $j^{\text{th}}$ symmetric power $L$-function $L(s,{\rm{sym}}^j f)$. It has been an interesting problem to study the average behaviour of $\lambda_{{\rm{sym}}^jf}(n)$ and their higher powers, and many researchers in the literature have studied the sum \begin{equation*}
  \sum_{n\leq x} \lambda_{{\rm{sym}}^j}^l(n), \end{equation*} for various values of $l$ and $j$. In this paper, we improve and generalize previously known results concerning the sum above for positive integers $l$ and $j$ such that $lj\geq 4$.</description>

      <title>The Mellin's transforms of $\dfrac{1}{\operatorname{arctanh} x}$ and $\dfrac{1}{\sqrt{1-x^2}\,\operatorname{arctanh} x}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the Mellin transforms of \(1/\operatorname{arctanh} x\) and \(1/(\sqrt{1-x^{2}}\,\operatorname{arctanh} x)\), viewed as compactly supported functions on \((0,1)\). These transforms are closely connected with conjectures on the arithmetic nature of the ratios \(\zeta(2n+1)/\pi^{2n+1}\) and \(\beta(2n)/\pi^{2n}\). While their values at odd integers were previously studied, the evaluation at even integers leads to classes of improper integrals that cannot be handled by parity arguments. Using contour integration techniques, we derive explicit closed-form expressions involving derivatives of the Riemann zeta and Dirichlet beta functions, thereby extending earlier results and providing new analytic tools for the study of related hyperbolic integrals.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic Density of Rank $\geq 1$ and Rank $\geq 2$ Genus-2 Jacobians and Applications to Hyperelliptic Curve Cryptography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we study quantitative existence results for genus-$2$ curves over $\mathbb{Q}$ whose Jacobians have Mordell-Weil rank at least $1$ or $2$, ordering the curves by the naive height of their integral Weierstrass models. We use geometric techniques to show that asymptotically the Jacobians of almost all integral models with two rational points at infinity have rank $r \geq 1$. Since there are $\asymp X^{\frac{13}{2}}$ such models among the $X^7$ curves $y^2=f(x)$ of height $\leq X$, this yields a lower bound of logarithmic density $13/14$ for the subset of rank $r \geq 1$. We further present a large explicit subfamily where Jacobians have ranks $r \geq 2$, yielding an unconditional logarithmic density of at least $5/7$. Independently, we give a construction of genus-$2$ curves with split Jacobian and rank $2$, producing a subfamily of logarithmic density at least $ 2/21$. Finally, we analyze quadratic and biquadratic twist families in the split-Jacobian setting, obtaining a positive proportion of rank-$2$ twists. These results have implications for Regev's quantum algorithm in hyperelliptic curve cryptography.</description>

      <title>Arithmetic Information of Rational Elliptic Surfaces, and Shioda's Rank 68 Elliptic Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The field of definition of the Mordell-Weil group of an elliptic surface $E/\mathbb{Q}$ is the smallest number field $k$ such that all of its $\mathbb{Q}(t)$-rational points are defined over $k(t)$. In this paper, we present an algorithm, implemented in Magma, which can determine the arithmetic information, including the field of definition, associated to any rational elliptic surface. As an application of this, we also demonstrate that the field of definition of Shioda's rank $68$ elliptic surface given by $y^2 = x^3 + t^{360} + 1$ is a number field of degree $829,440$.</description>

      <title>Rational points on modular curves via maps to elliptic curves with rank zero</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fundamental problem in arithmetic geometry is to determine the image of the mod $N$ Galois representation for all elliptic curves over $\mathbb{Q}$ and integers $N \geq 1$. For a given subgroup $G \le \mathrm{GL}_2(\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z})$, there is a modular curve $X_G$ whose rational points parametrize elliptic curves for which the image of the mod $N$ Galois representation is contained in $G$. If $X_G$ admits a map to an elliptic curve $E / \mathbb{Q}$ of rank $0$, then its rational points can be effectively determined, provided such a map $X_G \to E$ is known. In this article, we give a method for constructing a map $X_G \to E$ and use it to determine $X_G(\mathbb{Q})$ for more than $99\%$ of modular curves of level at most $70$.</description>

      <title>An Infinite Family of Primitive Heron Triangles with Two Sides as Perfect Squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A primitive Heron triangle is a triangle with integral sides and integral area where the greatest common divisor of the lengths of its sides is $1$. By utilizing the theory of elliptic curves, we prove that there exist infinitely many primitive Heron triangles with two sides being perfect squares. In this process, we nest one elliptic curve into another and find a surprising rational point. All the Heron triangles corresponding to this rational point are primitive. This result would imply the possible existence of infinitely many primitive Heron triangles with all three sides being perfect squares.</description>

      <title>Geometric construction of modular polynomials with level structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical modular polynomial for $j$-invariants describes the relation between two elliptic curves connected by isogenies. This polynomial has been applied to various algorithms in computational number theory, such as point counting on elliptic curves. In addition, computing the modular polynomial itself is also an important problem, and various algorithms to compute it have been proposed. On the other hand, modular polynomials for other invariants of higher level structures have also been studied. For example, the modular polynomials for the Legendre $\lambda$-invariant and the Weber functions are well-known. In this paper, we give another approach to construct modular polynomials of higher level purely algebraically. In particular, we show the existence of modular polynomials for invariants directly related to models of elliptic curves, such as the coefficients of Montgomery and Hessian curves. We also show that these modular polynomials have integer coefficients and are symmetric and irreducible in certain cases, and give an algorithm to compute them, which is based on the deformation method by Kunzweiler and Robert.</description>

      <title>Hecke operators, Hecke Eigensystems, and Formal Modular Forms over Number Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop an explicit theory of formal modular forms over arbitrary number fields $K$, as functions of modular points. We define modular points for $\Gamma_0({\mathfrak n})$ and $\Gamma_1({\mathfrak n})$, where the level ${\mathfrak n}$ is an integral ideal of $K$; Hecke operators and generalized Atkin-Lehner operators as functions of modular points; and associated Hecke eigensystems. We show how complete eigensystems may be recovered, uniquely up to unramified quadratic twist, from their restrictions to principal Hecke operators, and we give explicit formulas for principal operators suitable for machine computation. These have been implemented by the author in the case of imaginary quadratic fields, and used in his systematic computation of Bianchi cusp forms, which are available in the L-functions and modular forms database (LMFDB). While our description incorporates the classical theory for $K={\mathbb Q}$, and also extends work of the author and his students for imaginary quadratic fields, it applies to arbitrary number fields, and may be useful in the computation of spaces of automorphic forms for GL$(2,K)$ over number fields, whether via modular symbols or other methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.17539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study the local behaviour of the multiple polylogarithm functions at integer points, in the $s$-aspect. This is done by writing a Laurent type expansion at integer points, involving certain power series and rational functions. The coefficients of these power series are the regularised values of the multiple polylogarithm functions at certain related integer points.</description>

      <title>Local Transitivity and Entanglement Obstructions for Primitive Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Primitive points on the tower of modular curves $X_1(n)$ provide a finite "certificate set" for detecting isolated points above a fixed $j$-invariant: for a non-CM elliptic curve $E/\mathbb{Q}$, $j(E)$ arises from an isolated point on some $X_1(N)$ if and only if one of the associated primitive point is isolated. We bound the number $\lvert \mathcal{P}(E)\rvert$ of primitive points in terms of the adelic index $I(E)$ and give criteria as well as an algorithm for uniqueness of primitive point. As an application, every Serre curve has $\lvert \mathcal{P}(E)\rvert =1$; hence Serre curves do not contribute isolated $j$-invariants.</description>

Abstract: The L-function $ L(\rho_\lambda, s) $ of an almost everywhere unramified $ \lambda $-adic representation $ \rho_\lambda $ of a global function field $ \mathbb{F}_q(C) $ is known to be a rational function in $ q^{-s} $ satisfying a functional equation up to some complex sign $ \epsilon(\rho_\lambda) $. This paper presents a systematic framework to compute the coefficients of $ L(\rho_\lambda, s) $ and its sign $ \epsilon(\rho_\lambda) $ with some explicit examples.</description>

Abstract: We propose an efficient computational method for finding all solutions $n\leq U$ to the Diophantine equation $a\sigma(n) = bn + c$, where integer coefficient $a,b,c$ and an upper bound $U$ are given. Our method is implemented in SageMath computer algebra system within the framework of recursively enumerated sets and natively benefits from MapReduce parallelization. We used it to discover new solutions to many published equations and close gaps in between the known large solutions, including but not limited to hyperperfect and $f$-perfect numbers, as well as to significantly lift the existence bounds in open questions about quasiperfect and almost-perfect numbers.</description>

      <title>Pollard's theorem in general abelian groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We make further progress towards a Kneser-type generalization of Pollard's Theorem to general abelian groups. For two sets $A$ and $B$ in an abelian group $G$, the \emph{$t$-popular sumset} of $A$ and $B$, denoted by $A+_t B$, is the set of elements in $G$ each with at least $t$ representations of the form $a+b$, where $a\in A$ and $b\in B$. For $|A|,\, |B|\ge t\geq 2$, we prove that if \begin{align*} \sum_{i=1}^t |A+_i B|&lt; t|A|+t|B|-\frac{4}{3}t^2+\frac{2}{3}t, \end{align*} then there exist $A'\subseteq A$ and $B'\subseteq B$ with $|A\setminus A'|+|B\setminus B'|\le t-1$, $A'+_t B'=A'+B'=A+_t B$, and $ \sum_{i=1}^t |A+_i B|\ge t|A|+t|B|-t|H|,$ where $H$ is the stabilizer of $A'+B'=A+_t B$. Our result improves the main quadratic term in the previous best bound from $-2t^2$ to $-\frac{4}{3}t^2$.</description>

      <title>Monogenic even sextic trinomials and their Galois groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $f(x)=x^6+Ax^{2k}+B\in {\mathbb Z}[x]$, with $A\ne 0$ and $k\in \{1,2\}$. We say that $f(x)$ is monogenic if $f(x)$ is irreducible over ${\mathbb Q}$ and
  $\{1,\theta,\theta^2,\theta^3,\theta^4,\theta^{5}\}$
  is a basis for the ring of integers of ${\mathbb Q}(\theta)$, where $f(\theta)=0$.
  For each value of $k$ and each possible Galois group $G$ of $f(x)$ over ${\mathbb Q}$, we use a theorem of Jakhar, Khanduja and Sangwan to give explicit descriptions of all monogenic trinomials $f(x)$ having Galois group $G$. We also determine when these descriptions provide infinitely many such trinomials, and we investigate when these trinomials generate distinct sextic fields.</description>

      <title>Generalisations of the Landau--Gonek Theorem and applications to mean values of zeta</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Landau--Gonek Theorem evaluates $X^\rho$ summed over the non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function. Their result shows great sensitivity to the arithmetic nature of $X$. We prove a related result concerning the sum of $\chi(\rho) X^\rho$ over the zeros of zeta, where $\chi(s)$ is the term arising in the functional equation for the zeta function. Again, this result depends deeply on whether $X$ is an integer or not. We show the result splits into three cases, depending on whether $X$ is smaller than $T$, about the same size as $T$, or bigger than $T$. The reason this result is useful is that it easily permits the calculation of discrete moments of the Riemann zeta function via the approximate functional equation. As an application of this result, we provide an alternative proof of Shanks' conjecture.</description>

      <title>Repellent properties of perfect powers on partition functions: a heuristic approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2013, Sun conjectured that the partition function $p(n)$ is never a perfect power for $n \geq 2$. Building on this, Merca, Ono, and Tsai recently observed that for any fixed integers $d \geq 0$ and $k \geq 2$, there appear to be only finitely many integers $n$ such that $p(n)$ differs from a perfect $k$th power by at most $d$. Denoting by $M_k(d)$ the largest such $n$, they conjectured that $M_k(d) = o(d^\epsilon)$ for every $\epsilon &gt; 0$.
  In this paper, we investigate the asymptotic growth of analogs of $M_k(d)$ for a wide class of partition functions. We establish sharp lower bounds and provide heuristics which suggest that $M_k(d)$ in fact grows polylogarithmically in $d$, i.e. of order $\log^2(d)$. More generally, we prove that if $f(n)$ is a suitably random chosen function with asymptotic growth rate similar to that of $p(n)$, then the set of integers $n$ for which $f(n)$ is a perfect power is finite with probability 1.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $K$ be a finite extension of $\mathbb{Q}_p$, and let $\mathfrak{m}_K$ be its maximal ideal. The image of the group of principal units $1+\mathfrak{m}_K$ under $p$-adic logarithm plays important role in several areas of number theory. In general, when the ramification index of $K/\mathbb{Q}_p$ is greater or equal to $p-1$, the precise description of this image is not known. For the cyclotomic extension $K=\mathbb{Q}_p(\zeta_p)$ of degree $p-1$, it was previously proved in \cite{MAS} that the image of the annulus region $(1+\mathfrak{m}_K) \setminus (1+\mathfrak{m}_K^2)$ by $p$-adic logarithm is exactly $\mathfrak{m}_K^2$. In this paper, we give a self-contained analytic proof of this result based on explicit $p$-adic logarithmic expansions.</description>

      <title>Brauer-Siegel theorem for families of number fields over almost Sn fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical Brauer-Siegel conjecture describes the asymptotic behaviour of the product of the class number and the regulator in families of number fields. All known cases of the conjecture rely on reducing the problem, via group theoretic methods, to Siegel's theorem for quadratic fields over Q or over a fixed base field. In this paper, we establish a new form of descent for the Brauer-Siegel conjecture. We show that if the conjecture holds for a family of almost Sn-fields, it necessarily holds for all quadratic extensions over that family, under mild conditions. This result may be viewed as an analogue of Siegel's theorem in which the base field is allowed to vary. In addition, we also establish the generalized Brauer-Siegel conjecture as formulated by Tsfasman-Vladut for asymptotically good towers of number fields over a family of almost Sn-fields.</description>

      <title>"Infinitely Often" Transcendence of Gamma-Function Derivatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relatively little is known about the arithmetic properties of Gamma-function derivatives evaluated at arbitrary points $q\in\mathbb{Q}\setminus\mathbb{Z}_{\leq0}$. In recent work, we showed that elements of the sequence $\left\{ \Gamma^{\left(n\right)}\left(1\right)\right\} _{n\geq1}$ are transcendental infinitely often. This result is now generalized to all sequences $\left\{ \Gamma^{\left(n\right)}\left(q\right)\right\} _{n\geq1}$ for $q\in\tfrac{1}{2}\mathbb{Z}\setminus\mathbb{Z}_{\leq0}$. Furthermore, for $q\in\mathbb{Q}\setminus\tfrac{1}{2}\mathbb{Z}$ we show that at least one of the sequences $\left\{ \Gamma^{\left(n\right)}\left(q\right)\right\} _{n\geq1}$, $\left\{ \Gamma^{\left(n\right)}\left(1-q\right)\right\} _{n\geq1}$ contains infinitely many transcendental elements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define and study "tautological classes" in the cohomology of moduli stacks of shtukas, pursuing two directions of applications. First, we prove a formula relating the "arithmetic volume" of tautological classes to higher derivatives of Artin $L$-functions, which can be viewed as an arithmetic analog of Hirzebruch's Proportionality principle. Second, we define and analyze the structure of the "phantom tautological ring", using a general relation between Hecke correspondences and Vinberg's degeneration, and give applications to a function field analog of Colmez's Conjecture.</description>

      <title>The Hasse principle for diagonal forms restricted to a hypersurface of adjacent degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the Hasse principle for Diophantine systems consisting of one diagonal form of degree $k$ and one general form of degree $k-1$. By refining the method of Brandes and Parsell (arXiv:2003.04350) in this specific setting, we improve the bound $n &gt; 2^k k$ to $n &gt; 2^{k-1}(2k-1)$; in particular, the requirement $n &gt; 24$ in the case of degrees three and two is relaxed to $n &gt; 20$.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of the d'Arcais Numbers at Small $k$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The d'Arcais numbers are the triangular array $\{A(2,n,k)\, :\, n=0,1,\dots,\, k=0,\dots,n\}$, such that $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \sum_{k=0}^{n} A(2,n,k) x^k z^n/n! = ((z;z)_{\infty})^{-x}$. The infinite $q$-Pochhammer symbol is $(q;q)_{\infty} = \prod_{n=1}^{\infty} (1-q^n)$. Holding $k$ fixed and considering large $n$, we note that the ratio $k! A(2,n,k)/n!$ is asymptotic to $C(k) \sigma_{2k-1}(n)/n^k$ where the divisor sum function is $\sigma_p(n) = \sum_{d|n} d^p$ and $C(k) = (\zeta(2))^k/(\Gamma(k) \zeta(2k))$. This is a slightly generalized version of one of Ramanujan's formulas from his paper, ``On Certain Arithmetical Functions," and it is an immediate consequence of the more recent article of Oliver, Shreshta and Thorne. Heim and Neuhauser made a conjecture, that $A(2,n,k)/A(2,n,k-1)$ is greater than or equal to $A(2,n,k+1)/A(2,n,k)$, for $k=2,3,\dots$ and all $n$. The conjecture is false for $k=2$, and it is true for $k=3,4,\dots$ when $n$ is sufficiently large. We consider the Hardy-Ramanujan circle method as a heuristic step.</description>

      <title>Fractal functions defined in terms of number representations in systems with a redundant alphabet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For fixed natural numbers $r$ and $s$, where $2\leq s \leq r$, we consider a representation of numbers from the interval $[0;\frac{r}{s-1}]$ obtained by encoding numbers by means of the alphabet $A=\{0,1,...,r\}$ via the expansion $x=\sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty}s^{-n}\alpha_n=\Delta^{r_s}_{\alpha_1\alpha_2...\alpha_n...}.$ The algorithm for expanding a number into such a series is justified in the paper. The geometry of this representation is studied, including the geometric meaning of digits, properties of cylinder sets -- particularly the specificity of their overlaps -- and metric relations, as well as the connection between the representation and partial sums of the corresponding series.
  The paper also presents results on the study of a function $f$ defined by $f(x=\sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{\alpha_n}{(r+1)^n})=\Delta^{r_s}_{\alpha_1\alpha_2...\alpha_n...}, \alpha_n\in A.$ It is proved that the function $f$ is continuous at every point that has a unique representation in the classical numeration system with base $r+1$, and discontinuous at points having two representations. The function has unbounded variation and a self-affine graph. For $r&lt;2s-1$, the function possesses singleton, finite, countable, and continuum level sets, including fractal ones; for $r&gt;2s-2$, every level set is a continuum, and moreover it is fractal or anomalously fractal.</description>

      <title>On series identities involving $\binom{4k}k$ and harmonic numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The harmonic numbers are those $H_n=\sum_{0&lt;k\le n}\frac1k\ (n=0,1,2,\ldots)$. In this paper we confirm over ten conjectural series identities with summands involving the binomial coefficient $\binom{4k}k$ and harmonic numbers. For example, we prove the identities $$\sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{\binom{4k}{k}}{16^k}\left((22k^2-92k+11)H_{4k}-\frac{449k-275}{2}-\frac{85}{12k}\right)=-151-\frac{80}{3}\log{2}$$ and $$ \sum_{k=0}^\infty\frac{\binom{4k}{k}((11k^2+8k+1)(10H_{4k}-17H_{2k})+2k+18)}{(3k+1)(3k+2)16^k}=8\log2,$$ which were previously conjectured by Z.-W. Sun.</description>

      <title>An Explicit Entire Function of Order One with All Zeros on a Line and Bounded in a Half-Plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a single explicit entire function $\Xi_c(s)$ of order 1, with all zeros provably on $Re(s) = 1/2$, satisfying a functional equation $\Xi_c(s) = \Xi_c(1-s)$, whose normalized form $Z_c(s) = \Xi_c(s)/[\tfrac{1}{2}s(s-1)\pi^{-s/2}\Gamma(s/2)]$ is uniformly bounded for $Re(s) &gt; 1 + \delta$ yet satisfies $\sup_t|Z_c(1+it)| = +\infty$. The function thus satisfies an analogue of the Riemann Hypothesis together with the sharp bounded/unbounded transition at $\sigma = 1$ characteristic of $\zeta$. The construction uses Hadamard products with controlled zero perturbations; the transition is proved unconditionally via a dyadic large-sieve argument and a Phragm\'en-Lindel\"of transfer.</description>

      <title>On the Distance Distribution of Reed-Muller Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we give error bounds for the distance distribution of Reed-Muller codes, extending prior work on the distance distribution of Reed-Solomon codes. This is equivalent to the problem of counting multivariate polynomials over a finite field with prescribed degree, coefficients, and number of zeroes. We provide a solution to this problem using the character sum method, which offers a new unified framework applicable to a broad class of polynomial enumeration problems over finite fields that involve prescribed evaluation vectors.
  This work effectively makes the first systematic attempt to study the coset weight distribution problem for Reed-Muller codes of fixed degree over large finite fields, which was proposed in MacWilliams and Sloane's 1977 textbook \emph{The Theory of Error Correcting Codes}.</description>

Abstract: This paper details a generalization of the formalism presented in the author's 2024 paper, "The Collatz Conjecture and Non-Archimedean Spectral Theory - Part I - Arithmetic Dynamical Systems and Non-Archimedean Value Distribution Theory", to the case of Hydra maps on the ring of integers $\mathcal{O}_{K}$ of a global field $K$. In addition to recounting these definitions, background material is presented for the necessary standard material in algebraic number theory and integration and Fourier analysis with respect to the $p$-adic Haar measure. This paper is meant to serve as a technical manual for use of Hydra maps and numens in future research.</description>

Abstract: We study fragments of the existential theory of henselian valued fields with parameters. This includes the $\exists_n$-fragment in the equicharacteristic or unramified mixed characteristic case, the $\exists_n\exists_1$-fragment in the equicharacteristic case, and the $\exists_n$-fragment in the residue characteristic zero case. For example, we obtain an unconditional axiomatization (and thereby decidability) of the $\exists_3$-theory of $\mathbb{F}_{q}(\!(t)\!)$ in the language of valued fields with a parameter for $t$.</description>

Abstract: We study the combinatorial properties of final types, which are certain non-decreasing sequences of integers, together with the partitions naturally associated with them. As a consequence, we obtain an identity expressing the $n$-nacci numbers as sums of products of binomial coefficients over these partitions, generalizing the classical identity for $n = 2$ that expresses Fibonacci numbers in this way. We also examine how the partial order on the set of all partitions of a fixed integer induced by the ordering of final types compares with two natural partial orders on the same set.</description>

      <title>A relative Langlands dual realization of $T^*(G/K)$ and derived Satake</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the cotangent bundle $T^*(G/K)$ of a quasi-split symmetric space $G/K$ is isomorphic to the dual variety of the loop symmetric space for the Langlands dual group, providing instances of the relative Langlands duality for non-split groups. Then we establish a Langlands dual description of equivariant coherent sheaves on $T^*(G/K)$ in terms of constructible sheaves on the loop symmetric spaces, generalizing the derived Satake equivalence for reductive groups to quasi-split symmetric spaces. To this end, we prove the derived Satake equivalence for the twisted affine Grassmannians, study ring objects arising from loop symmetric spaces, and explore the formality and fully-faithfulness properties of $!$-pure objects. We deduce a version of Bezrukavnikov equivalence for quasi-split symmetric spaces and make connections to the geometric Langlands on the twistor $\mathbb P^1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study BPS $q$-series associated to 3-manifolds decorated by a line defect along an embedded link. We prove that these $q$-series depend only on the class of the link in the skein module, thereby defining a homomorphism from the skein module to the space of $q$-series. The image of this homomorphism is conjectured to be holomorphically quantum modular, which suggests a new approach to Langlands duality for skein modules through $q$-series.</description>

Abstract: We show reductions and equivalences between various problems related to the computation of the endomorphism ring of principally polarised superspecial abelian surfaces. Problems considered are the computation of the Ibukiyama-Katsura-Oort matrix and computation of unpolarised isomoprhisms between superspecial abelian surfaces.</description>

      <title>On Partition Classes Arising from Parity, Differences, and Repeated Smallest Parts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study various classes of partition functions such as those related to the parity of the number of parts, to differences of partition numbers, and to partitions with a repeated smallest part. We establish identities connecting these various classes of partitions. Moreover, our identities help us to extend the Euler's partition theorem. An analogue of Legendre's theorem of the partition-theoretic interpretation of Euler's pentagonal number theorem is also derived. Both combinatorial and $q$-series proofs are given for our results.</description>

      <title>Roth-type theorems in $K_{s,t}$-free sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that for all integers $2\le s\le t$, any $K_{s,t}$-free subset of $[N]$ with size $\Omega(n^{1-1/s})$ must contain a nontrivial solution to every fixed translation-invariant linear equation in at least five variables. This extends earlier results for Sidon sets due to Conlon-Fox-Sudakov-Zhao and Prendiville to the full family of $K_{s,t}$-free sets.
  We also study the corresponding problem in vector spaces over finite fields. In $\mathbb F_q^n$ we obtain stronger quantitative bounds, including polylogarithmic savings, by combining Fourier-analytic transference with polynomial-method input from the arithmetic cycle-removal lemma of Fox-Lov\'asz-Sauermann.</description>

      <title>A uniform quantitative Manin-Mumford theorem for curves over function fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.11593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2101.11593v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that any smooth projective geometrically connected non-isotrivial curve of genus $g\ge 2$ over a one-dimensional function field of any characteristic has at most $16g^2+32g+124$ torsion points for any Abel-Jacobi embedding of the curve into its Jacobian. The proof uses Zhang's admissible pairing on curves, the arithmetic Hodge index theorem over function fields, and the metrized graph analogue of Elkies' lower bound for the Green function. More generally, we prove an explicit Bogomolov-type result bounding the number of geometric points of small N\'eron-Tate height on the curve embedded into its Jacobian.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2102.08999v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a $p$-divisible group over a complete discrete valuation ring $R$ of characteristic $p$. The generic fiber of $G$ determines a Galois representation $\rho$. The image of $\rho$ admits a ramification filtration and a Lie filtration. We relate these filtrations in the case $G$ is one dimensional, giving an equicharacteristic version of Sen's theorem in this setting. This result generalizes a result of Gross. Additionally, we prove that the representation associated to the \'etale part of $G$ is irreducible, generalizing a result of Chai.</description>

      <title>Phase Transitions for Sparse Random Sets Under Linear Forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.01801v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $A \subseteq \{0,1,\dots,N\}$ be a random set in which each element is included independently with probability $p=p(N)$. Fix an integer $h \geq 2$ and a linear form $$L(x_1,\dots,x_h) := u_1x_1 + \cdots + u_hx_h.$$ We study the random image set \begin{align*}
  L(A) = \left\{ L(a_1,\dots,a_h) : a_i \in A \right\}, \end{align*} inside the feasible interval of values of $L$ on $\{0,1,\dots,N\}^h$, as well as the associated representation counts. Our results exhibit two distinct threshold scales. First, there is a \emph{global} transition at $p(N) \asymp N^{-(h-1)/h}$ governing the size of $L(A)$: below this scale collisions are rare and $L(A)$ is sparse, while above it $L(A)$ contains nearly all feasible values. We give sharp asymptotics for the size of $L(A)$ in all regimes, including inside the critical window. Second, there is a \emph{local} transition at $p(N)\asymp N^{-(h-2)/(h-1)}$ governing multiplicities: for typical values in the bulk, the number of essentially distinct representations is asymptotically Poisson below this scale, and Poisson behavior fails above it. For $h \geq 3$ these scales are separated, yielding a regime in which $L(A)$ is already globally close to full while local multiplicities remain approximately Poisson. Our framework subsumes the classical sumset and difference-set models, as well as generalized sumsets of the form $sA-dA$, as special cases. Notably, after correcting its formulation, our global theorem settles the 2009 threshold conjecture of Hegarty-Miller on the behavior of these random images.</description>

      <title>p-Adically convergent loci in varieties arising from periodic continued fractions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00739v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by several alternative definitions of continued fraction expansions for elements in $\mathbb Q_p$, we study $p$-adically convergent periodic continued fractions with partial quotients in $\mathbb Z[1/p]$. To this end, following a previous work by Brock, Elkies, and Jordan, we consider certain algebraic varieties whose points represent formal periodic continued fractions with period and preperiod of fixed lengths, satisfying a given quadratic equation. We then focus on the $p$-adically convergent loci of these varieties, characterizing the zero and one-dimensional cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03033v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a given number field $K$, we give a $\forall\exists\forall$-first order description of affine Darmon points over $\mathbb{P}^1_K$, and show that this can be improved to a $\forall\exists$-definition in a remarkable particular case. Darmon points, which are a geometric generalization of perfect powers, constitute a non-linear set-theoretical filtration between $K$ and its ring of $S$-integers, the latter of which can be defined with universal formulas, as has been progressively proven by Koenigsmann, Park, and Eisentr\"ager &amp; Morrison. We also show that our formulas are uniform with respect to all possible $S$, with a parameter-free uniformity, and we compute the number of quantifiers and a bound for the degree of the defining polynomial.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05672v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop generalized Petersson/Bruggeman-Kuznetsov (PBK) formulas for specified local components at non-archimedean places. In fact, we introduce two hypotheses on non-archimedean test function pairs $f \leftrightarrow \pi(f)$, called geometric and spectral hypotheses, under which one obtains `nice' PBK formulas by the adelic relative trace function approach. Then, given a supercuspidal representation $\sigma$ of ${\rm PGL}_2(\mathbb{Q}_p)$, we study extensively the case that $\pi(f)$ is a projection onto the line of the newform if $\pi$ is isomorphc to $\sigma$ or its unramified quadratic twist, and $\pi(f) = 0$ otherwise. As a first application, we prove an optimal large sieve inequality for families of automorphic representations that arise in our framework.</description>

Abstract: We define a theta lift between the homology in degree $N-1$ of a locally symmetric space associated to $\mathrm{SL}_N(\mathbb{R})$ and the space of modular forms of weight $N$, similar to the Kudla-Millson lift in the orthogonal setting. We show that the Fourier coefficients of this lift are Poincar\'e duals of modular symbols associated to maximal parabolic subgroups. The constant term is a canonical cohomology classes obtained by transgressing the Euler class of a torus bundle. When $N=2$, we show that the lift surjects on the space of weight 2 modular forms spanned by an Eisenstein series and the eigenforms with non-vanishing L-function.</description>

      <title>Locally analytic vectors and $\mathbf{Z}_p$-extensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03272v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $K$ be a finite extension of $\mathbf{Q}_p$ and let $\mathcal{G}_K = \mathrm{Gal}(\overline{\mathbf{Q}_p}/K)$. Lately, interest has risen around a generalization of the theory of $(\varphi,\Gamma)$-modules, replacing the cyclotomic extension with an arbitrary infinitely ramified $p$-adic Lie extension. Computations from Berger suggest that locally analytic vectors should provide such a generalization for any arbitrary infinitely ramified $p$-adic Lie extension, and this has been conjectured by Kedlaya.
  In this paper, we focus on the case of $\mathbf{Z}_p$-extensions, using recent work of Berger-Rozensztajn and Porat on an integral version of locally analytic vectors and explain what can be the structure of the locally analytic vectors in the higher rings of periods $\widetilde{\mathbf{A}}^{\dagger}$ in this setting. We show that the existence of nontrivial locally analytic vectors in $\widetilde{\mathbf{A}}^{\dagger}$, a necessary condition for Kedlaya's conjecture to hold, is equivalent to the existence of an overconvergent lift of the field of norms attached to the $\mathbf{Z}_p$-extension.
  Finally, in the case where $K/\mathbf{Q}_p$ is unramified, we are able to prove that the only extensions for which such nontrivial locally analytic vectors exist are exactly the twisted cyclotomic extensions, up to a finite extension. In particular, this disproves Kedlaya's conjecture and also shows that there is no overconvergent lift of the field of norms in the anticyclotomic setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06128v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the zeros of theta functions $\Theta_{\Gamma_{4k}}$ associated with the lattices $\Gamma_{4k}$, a family of self-dual lattices generalizing the $\mathsf{E}_{8}$ lattice. Our results show two different behaviors of the zeros according to the lattice parity: When $\Gamma_{4k}$ is an even lattice, we show that the zeros all lie on the line $\Re z =\frac{1}{2}$ in the fundamental domain and prove that the zeros are equidistributed with respect to an explicit probability measure on the line $\Re z = \frac{1}{2}$. However, when the $\Gamma_{4k}$ is an odd lattice, there are no zeros on the line $\Re z =\frac{1}{2}$, only exponentially close to it. Our argument relies on representing $\Theta_{\Gamma_{4k}}$ as a polynomial in the modular $\lambda$-function. We then study the zeros of this polynomial and exploit some conformal properties of $\lambda$ to get our results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.16515v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This is the first paper in a series where we study arithmetic applications of the multiple elliptic Gamma functions originated from mathematical physics. The main purpose of this paper is the introduction of a framework for applications of these functions to Hilbert's 12th problem for general number fields with exactly one complex place following recent work by Bergeron, Charollois and Garc\'ia. Namely, we define geometric families of the multiple elliptic Gamma functions, upgrading the construction carried out by Felder, Henriques, Rossi and Zhu for rank $3$ lattices to lattices of higher ranks. These functions enjoy transformation properties under an action of the special linear group $\mathrm{SL}_n(\mathbb{Z})$ for $n \geq 2$ involving some Bernoulli rational functions as their so-called modularity defect. A second purpose of this paper is to use this collection of Bernoulli rational functions to construct $(n-1)$-cocycles for specific subgroups of $\mathrm{SL}_n(\mathbb{Z})$ associated to units groups in totally real number fields and use these cocycles to compute partial zeta values at $s=0$.</description>

Abstract: Since the time of Minkowski a basic problem in number theory has been to find lower bounds for the absolute value $\Delta(K)$ of the discriminant of a number field $K$ in terms of the degree $n(K)$ of $K$. In this paper we study another measure of the size of $K$ given by the covering radius $\mu(K)$ of the ring of integers $O_K$ of $K$. Here $\mu(K)$ is the $L^2$ radius $||V_2(K)||_2$ of the $L^2$ Voronoi cell $V_2(K)$ of $O_K$, where $V_2(K)$ is the set of points in $\mathbb{R} \otimes_{\mathbb{Q}} K$ that are at least as close to the origin as they are to any non-zero element of $O_K$. To put a limit on what lower bounds one can prove for $\mu(K)$ in terms of $n(K)$, we study infinite families of $K$ of increasing degree for which $\mu(K)$ can be bounded above by an explicit power of $n(K)$. We also study analogous questions when the $L^2$ norm is replaced by the $L^\infty$ norm.</description>

      <title>Resolution of Erd\H{o}s Problem #728: a writeup of Aristotle's Lean proof</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07421v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a writeup of a resolution of Erd\H{o}s Problem #728; this is the first Erd\H{o}s problem (a problem proposed by Paul Erd\H{o}s which has been collected in the Erd\H{o}s Problems website) regarded as fully resolved autonomously by an AI system. The system in question is a combination of GPT-5.2 Pro by OpenAI and Aristotle by Harmonic, operated by Kevin Barreto. The final result of the system is a formal proof written in Lean, which we translate to informal mathematics in the present writeup for wider accessibility.
  The proved result is as follows. We show a logarithmic-gap phenomenon regarding factorial divisibility: For any constants $0&lt;C_1&lt;C_2$ and $0 &lt; \varepsilon &lt; 1/2$ there exist infinitely many triples $(a,b,n)\in\mathbb N^3$ with $\varepsilon n \le a,b \le (1-\varepsilon)n$ such that \[ a!\,b!\mid n!\,(a+b-n)!\qquad\text{and}\qquad C_1\log n &lt; a+b-n &lt; C_2\log n. \] The argument reduces this to a binomial divisibility $\binom{m+k}{k}\mid\binom{2m}{m}$ and studies it prime-by-prime. By Kummer's theorem, $\nu_p\binom{2m}{m}$ translates into a carry count for doubling $m$ in base $p$. We then employ a counting argument to find, in each scale $[M,2M]$, an integer $m$ whose base-$p$ expansions simultaneously force many carries when doubling $m$, for every prime $p\le 2k$, while avoiding the rare event that one of $m+1,\dots,m+k$ is divisible by an unusually high power of $p$. These "carry-rich but spike-free" choices of $m$ force the needed $p$-adic inequalities and the divisibility. The overall strategy is similar to results regarding divisors of $\binom{2n}{n}$ studied earlier by Erd\H{o}s and by Pomerance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.11799v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Assuming a mild non-degeneracy condition excluding very low-level Cantor endpoints, and assuming a counting/input hypothesis for the contribution of non-deep orbit indices, we show that for the quadratic field $K=\mathbb{Q}(\alpha)$ there exist constants $A_K,B_K&gt;0$ such that \[ \mathrm{exit}(\alpha)\ \le\ A_K\,(\log_3 H)^2 + B_K. \] Consequently, $\mathrm{dist}(\alpha,\mathcal C)\ge H^{-\kappa_K\log H}$ for some $\kappa_K&gt;0$.</description>

Abstract: We extend bounds on additive energies of modular square roots by Dunn, Kerr, Shparlinski, Shkredov and Zaharescu and apply these results to obtain bounds on certain bilinear exponential sums with modular square roots. From here, we make partial progress on the large sieve for square moduli.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2102.02777v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I propose a class of non-positional numeral systems where numbers are represented by Dyck words, with the systems arising from a recursive extension of prime factorization. After describing two proper subsets of the Dyck language capable of uniquely representing all natural numbers and a superset of the rational numbers respectively, I consider "Dyck-complete" languages, in which every member of the Dyck language represents a number. I conclude by suggesting possible research directions.</description>

      <title>A classification of Fourier summation formulas and crystalline measures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11185v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We completely classify Fourier summation formulas, and in particular, all crystalline measures with quadratic decay. Our classification employs techniques from almost periodic functions, Hermite-Biehler functions, de Branges spaces and Poisson representation. We show how our classification generalizes recent results of Kurasov \&amp; Sarnak and Olevskii \&amp; Ulanovskii. As an application, we give a new classification result for nonnegative measures with uniformly discrete support that are bounded away from zero on their support. Moreover, we give a new construction using eta-quotients, generalizing an old example of Guinand.</description>

Abstract: We study the probability distribution of the number of common zeros of a system of $m$ random $n$-variate polynomials over a finite commutative ring $R$. We compute the expected number of common zeros of a system of polynomials over $R$. Then, in the case that $R$ is a field, under a necessary-and-sufficient condition on the sample space, we show that the number of common zeros is binomially distributed.</description>

      <title>Lattice packing of spheres in high dimensions using a stochastically evolving ellipsoid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05042v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that in any dimension $n$ there exists an origin-symmetric ellipsoid ${\mathcal{E}} \subset {\mathbb{R}}^n$ of volume $ c n^2 $ that contains no points of ${\mathbb{Z}}^n$ other than the origin, where $c &gt; 0$ is a universal constant. Equivalently, there exists a lattice sphere packing in ${\mathbb{R}}^n$ whose density is at least $cn^2 \cdot 2^{-n}$. Previously known constructions of sphere packings in ${\mathbb{R}}^n$ yielded densities of at most $C n \log n \cdot 2^{-n}$. Our proof utilizes a stochastically evolving ellipsoid that accumulates at least $c n^2$ lattice points on its boundary, while containing no lattice points in its interior except for the origin.</description>

      <title>Moduli of vector bundles on $\mu_n$-gerbes over genus 2 curves and the period-index problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03417v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a framework for describing vector bundles on $\mu_n$-gerbes over curves and illustrate the construction through two detailed examples. Using the interpretation of Brauer classes as obstructions to descending determinantal line bundles from the algebraic closure, together with a geometric analysis of the moduli space of twisted sheaves, we prove that for genus $2$ curves there exist Brauer classes over the base field whose period equals their index. Over $C_1$-fields, we further show that every $2$-torsion class in the Brauer group of a genus $2$ curve satisfies the period-index problem. As an application, we construct higher-dimensional varieties obtained as fibre products of genus $2$ curves over $C_1$-fields whose $2$-torsion algebraic Brauer classes also satisfy the period-index problem, providing new evidence toward the period-index conjecture.</description>

      <title>Computing quaternionic representations via twisted forms of Bruhat-Tits trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22713v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work is devoted to the study of representations of finite subgroups of the group of units of quaternion division algebras over a global or local field arising from the inclusion via extension of scalars splitting the algebra. Following a question by Serre, we study the set $\mathrm{IF}$ of conjugacy classes of integral representations that are conjugates of the given representation over the field. The set $\mathrm{IF}$ is often called the set of integral forms in the literature. In previous works we have seen that, for a given representation, the set $\mathrm{IF}$ can be indexed by the vertex set of a suitable subgraph of the Bruhat-Tits tree for the special linear group. In this work, we describe a construction that allows the simultaneous study of the set $\mathrm{IF}$ over different splitting fields. For this, we devise and use a theory of twisted Galois form of Bruhat-Tits trees. With this tool, we explicitly compute, in most cases, the cardinality of $\mathrm{IF}$ for the representation of the classical quaternion group of order $8$ studied by Serre, Feit and others, as much as for other similar groups.</description>

      <title>On the Diophantine problem related to power circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00835v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Myasnikov, Ushakov and Won introduced power circuits in 2012 to construct a polynomial algorithm for the word problem in the Baumslag group, which has a non-elementary Dehn function. Power circuits are circuits supporting addition and operation $(x,y) = x \cdot 2^y$ for integer numbers. Myasnikov, Ushakov and Won posed a question about decidability of the Diophantine problem over the structure $\langle \mathbb{N}_{&gt;0}; +, x \cdot 2^y, \leq, 1 \rangle$, which is closely related to power circuits. In this paper we prove undecidability of the Diophantine problem over this structure.</description>

Abstract: We introduce an $L^2$-norm on the space of Schwartz half-densities over algebraic stacks over local non-archimedean fields. We show that these $L^2$-norms are finite for the stacks of $PGL_2$-bundles on $\mathbb{P}^1$ with parabolic structures at $\ge 3$ points. The latter property was conjectured in the context of the analytic Langlands correspondence of arXiv:2103.01509.</description>
