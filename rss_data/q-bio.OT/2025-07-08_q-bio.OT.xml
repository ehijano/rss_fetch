      <title>A decade of SBOL Visual: growing adoption of a diagram standard for engineering biology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Standards play a crucial role in ensuring consistency, interoperability, and efficiency of communication across various disciplines. In the field of synthetic biology, the Synthetic Biology Open Language (SBOL) Visual standard was introduced in 2013 to establish a structured framework for visually representing genetic designs. Over the past decade, SBOL Visual has evolved from a simple set of 21 glyphs into a comprehensive diagrammatic language for biological designs. This perspective reflects on the first ten years of SBOL Visual, tracing its evolution from inception to version 3.0. We examine the standard's adoption over time, highlighting its growing use in scientific publications, the development of supporting visualization tools, and ongoing efforts to enhance clarity and accessibility in communicating genetic design information. While trends in adoption show steady increases, achieving full compliance and use of best practices will require additional efforts. Looking ahead, the continued refinement of SBOL Visual and broader community engagement will be essential to ensuring its long-term value as the field of synthetic biology develops.</description>

      <title>Enhanced knowledge retention through MedScrab: an interactive mobile game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Noncompliance with medication regimens poses an immense challenge in the management of chronic diseases, often resulting in exacerbated health complications and recurrent hospital admissions. Addressing this gap, our team designed an innovative mobile game aimed at bolstering medication adherence and information retention within the general population. Employing Amazon Mechanical Turk, participants were enlisted and allocated into two cohorts: one engaged with our mobile game and the other perused an informational pamphlet about medication. Both cohorts underwent a pre-intervention quiz, followed by their respective interventions, and concluded with a post-intervention quiz. Primary outcome measures included the difference in quiz scores and the game play duration. The investigation encompassed 243 participants with homogenous baseline attributes. Participants interacting with the mobile game depicted a significant enhancement in their post-intervention scores compared to the pre-intervention scores. We observed a notable correlation of 0.346 (p&lt;0.001) with a robust medium effect size of 0.641 (0.503 - 0.779). Although the duration of game play and post-intervention scores didn't exhibit a direct correlation, a tendency towards superior post-intervention scores was evident among participants who dedicated more time to the game. The interactive mobile game we developed exhibits potential as an engaging instrument for empowering patients and caregivers. Providing critical medication information and the potential side effects in a manner that increases retention would thereby mitigate medication noncompliance. Future research endeavors should focus on optimizing and broadening the application of such mobile interfaces to fortify public health initiatives.</description>

      <title>Roadmap for using large language models (LLMs) to accelerate cross-disciplinary research with an example from computational biology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are powerful artificial intelligence (AI) tools transforming how research is conducted. However, their use in research has been met with skepticism, due to concerns about hallucinations, biases and potential harms to research. These emphasize the importance of clearly understanding the strengths and weaknesses of LLMs to ensure their effective and responsible use. Here, we present a roadmap for integrating LLMs into cross-disciplinary research, where effective communication, knowledge transfer and collaboration across diverse fields are essential but often challenging. We examine the capabilities and limitations of LLMs and provide a detailed computational biology case study (on modeling HIV rebound dynamics) demonstrating how iterative interactions with an LLM (ChatGPT) can facilitate interdisciplinary collaboration and research. We argue that LLMs are best used as augmentative tools within a human-in-the-loop framework. Looking forward, we envisage that the responsible use of LLMs will enhance innovative cross-disciplinary research and substantially accelerate scientific discoveries.</description>
