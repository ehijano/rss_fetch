      <title>Nuclear shell model study of neutrinoless double beta decay under Left-Right symmetric model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the large scale nuclear shell model to calculate the nuclear matrix elements for the neutrino mediated neutrinoless double beta decay within the Left-Right symmetric model for four nuclei: $^{76}$Ge, $^{82}$Se, $^{130}$Te and $^{136}$Xe. We perform a systematic analysis on the general magnitude of different terms for related mechanisms. For the $\eta$ mechanism, we find that the weak magnetism $R$ term dominates the decay rate while the $p$-wave effect is suppressed. While for the $\lambda$ mechanism, the $\omega$ and the $q$ terms are with equal importance. For the latter $q$ term, important contributions from weak-magnetism MM part are observed. Finally, we give the constraints on the new physics parameters $m_{\beta\beta}$, $\lambda$ and $\eta$ from current experiments.</description>

      <title>A two-cluster approach to the properties of one- and two-neutron-halo nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a new approximate method for obtaining simple wave functions and effective operators for the ground state of exotic nuclei with a neutron halo. We treat the core and halo as inert objects in a two-cluster model. The relative wave function is a combination of simple harmonic oscillator states with a size that is determined from a relation between the nuclear radius and separation energy. Since these wave functions lack the expected exponential decay, we apply a multiplicative renormalization to the radial part of the operators, determined from the nuclear root-mean-square radius. This combination of oscillator wavefunctions and renormalized operators is then applied to the calculation of dipole strength distributions $dB(E1,\varepsilon)/d\varepsilon$ for several $1n$- and $2n$-halo nuclei. By fitting a single free parameter, the results show excellent agreement with the available experimental data.</description>

      <title>Assessing the joint effect of temperature and magnetic field on the neutron star equation of state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the effect of strong magnetic fields on the equation of state (EoS) of warm, homogeneous, Neutron Star (NS) matter in beta equilibrium. NS matter is described within a relativistic mean field (RMF) approximation, including both models with non-linear meson terms or with density dependent nucleon-meson couplings. We first study the effect of magnetic fields and finite temperature on the EoS separately, finding that the effect of the latter to be significantly stronger than the one of the former. We then study the combined effect of magnetic fields and temperature on the internal composition. We show how both factors cause an increase in the proton fraction at low density and that, as long as the temperatures considered are not higher than 10 MeV, the effect of the magnetic field on the proton fraction is not small enough to be neglected.</description>

      <title>Dissipative tidal effects to next-to-leading order and constraints on the dissipative tidal deformability using gravitational wave data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dissipative tidal interactions can be used to probe the out-of-equilibrium physics of neutron stars using gravitational wave observations. In this paper, we present the first post-Newtonian (PN) corrections to the orbital dynamics of a binary system containing objects whose tidal interactions have a dissipative contribution. We derive the 1PN-accurate equations of motion in the center-of-mass frame and a generalized energy-balance law that is valid for dissipative tidal interactions. We show how mass and energy loss due to the absorption of orbital energy change the orbital dynamics and derive the next-to-leading order correction to the gravitational wave phase of a binary system in a quasi-circular orbit containing initially non-spinning components. We then use this waveform model to constrain, for the first time, the individual dissipative tidal deformabilities of each of the binary components that generated the GW170817 event using real data. We find that the GW170817 data requires $\Xi_{1} \lesssim 1121$ and $\Xi_{2} \lesssim 1692$ at 90\% confidence, where $\Xi_{1,2}$ are the individual tidal deformabilities of the primary and secondary binary components that produced the GW170817 event.</description>

      <title>Droplets of Bosons at a Narrow Resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider bosons interacting through a narrow $s$-wave resonance. Such a resonance is characterized by an infinite scattering length and a large and negative effective range $r_0$. We argue that any number $N\ge3$ of bosons can form a self-bound cluster with the binding energy per particle increasing as $N^2$ for $1\ll N\ll (-r_0/a_\text{bg})^{1/2}$, where $a_\text{bg}$ is the background scattering length (between atoms and molecules). In the opposite limit $N\gg (-r_0/a_\text{bg})^{1/2}$, bosons form droplets with binding energy per particle saturating to a constant value independent of the particle number. The stability of clusters and droplets when the interaction is detuned from the resonance is also studied.</description>

      <title>Study of forbidden $\beta$ decays within the realistic shell model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02272v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For the first time, half-lives and energy spectra of forbidden $\beta$ decays are calculated within the realistic shell model. Namely, we approach this issue starting from a realistic nucleon-nucleon potential and deriving effective Hamiltonians and decay operators. Our goal is to explore the sensitivity of the shape of calculated energy spectra to the renormalization of forbidden $\beta$ -decay operators, an operation that allows to take into account those configurations that are not explicitly included in the chosen model space. The region that has been considered for this investigation are nuclei outside the $^{78}$Ni core, more precisely we have studied the second-forbidden $\beta$ decays of $^{94}$Nb and $^{99}$Tc, and fourth-forbidden $\beta$ decays of $^{113}$Cd and $^{115}$In, that are currently of a renewed experimental interest in terms of novel spectroscopic techniques. Our results evidence that the introduction of a renormalized $\beta$-decay operator leads to a marked improvement of the reproduction of experimental half-lives. As regards the spectra of both second-forbidden and fourth-forbidden decays, we have found that their calculated shapes are in good agreement with the observed ones, even if scarcely responsive to the renormalization of the decay operator. We carry out also a detailed inspection of the different components of the calculated spectra for a deeper insight about their role in reproducing the experimental shapes.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent single-nucleon potential at positive energy produced by semi-realistic interaction and its examination via nucleon-nucleus elastic scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19961v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on the variational principle, self-consistent single-particle (s.p.) potentials at positive energies are discussed, which correspond to the real part of the optical potential as the single folding potential (SFP). The nuclear-matter s.p. potential produced by the semi-realistic nucleonic interaction M3Y-P6, which has links to the bare nucleonic interaction, resembles those extracted from the empirical optical potential Applying M3Y-P6 both to the self-consistent mean-field calculations for the target nucleus and to the SFP for the scattered nucleon, we find that the differential cross-sections of the nucleon-nucleus elastic scattering are reproduced almost comparably to the empirical potentials up to $80\,\mathrm{MeV}$ incident energy. The results demonstrate that the s.p. potential compatible with available experimental data can be derived from a single energy-independent effective interaction in this wide energy range.</description>

      <title>Discovering Nuclear Models from Symbolic Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11477v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Numerous phenomenological nuclear models have been proposed to describe specific observables within different regions of the nuclear chart. However, developing a unified model that describes the complex behavior of all nuclei remains an open challenge. Here, we explore whether novel symbolic Machine Learning (ML) can rediscover traditional nuclear physics models or identify alternatives with improved simplicity, fidelity, and predictive power. To address this challenge, we developed a Multi-objective Iterated Symbolic Regression approach that handles symbolic regressions over multiple target observables, accounts for experimental uncertainties and is robust against high-dimensional problems. As a proof of principle, we applied this method to describe the nuclear binding energies and charge radii of light and medium mass nuclei. Our approach identified simple analytical relationships based on the number of protons and neutrons, providing interpretable models with precision comparable to state-of-the-art nuclear models. Additionally, we integrated this ML-discovered model with an existing complementary model to estimate the limits of nuclear stability. These results highlight the potential of symbolic ML to develop accurate nuclear models and guide our description of complex many-body problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05427v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The chiral magnetic effect (CME) is a collective quantum phenomenon that arises from the interplay between gauge field topology and fermion chiral anomaly, encompassing a wide range of physical systems from semimetals to quark-gluon plasma. This review, with a focus on CME and related effects in heavy ion collisions, aims to provide an introductory discussion on its conceptual foundation and measurement methodology, a timely update on the present status in terms of experimental findings and theoretical progress, as well as an outlook into the open problems and future developments.</description>

      <title>IMSRG with flowing 3 body operators, and approximations thereof</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13010v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the impact of retaining three-body operators within the in-medium similarity renormalization group (IMSRG), as well as various approximations schemes. After studying two toy problems, idential fermions with a contact interaction and the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model, we employ the valence-space formulation of the IMSRG to investigate the even-$A$ carbon isotopes with a chiral two-body potential. We find that retaining only those commutators expressions that scale as $N^7$ provides an excellent approximation of the full three-body treatment.</description>

      <title>First characterization of the scattering length distribution of vector meson interaction with deuteron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.07964v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Under the framework of the vector meson dominance model (VMD), the absolute scattering lengths of light vector mesons ($\phi$, $\omega$, and $\rho$) with the deuteron are calculated from the cross sections of vector meson photoproduction off a deuteron. Additionally, a fitting function is used to predict the scattering lengths of the heavy vector mesons $J/\psi$-$d$ and $% \Upsilon$-$d$. Based on these results, the distribution of the scattering lengths $|\alpha_{V d}|$ between vector mesons and the deuteron is presented for the first time and compared with the scattering lengths $|\alpha_{V p}|$ between vector mesons and the proton. It is found that as the mass of the vector meson increases, the scattering lengths $|\alpha_{V d}|$ become closer to $|\alpha_{V p}|$. In addition, the correlation analysis indicates a strong positive relationship between the scattering length and the vector meson radius, with a high correlation coefficient. The implications of results are essential for improving our understanding of the interaction between hadron and nucleus.</description>
