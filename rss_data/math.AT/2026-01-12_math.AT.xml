      <title>On the $m$-dimensional sectional category and induced invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we systematically study the $m$-dimensional sectional category of a fibration, introduced by Schwarz, as an approximating invariant for the sectional category. We develop the basic theory of this invariant, establish its fundamental properties, and show how it gives rise to a hierarchy of induced invariants, including the $m$-dimensional Lusternik-Schnirelmann category, the $m$-topological complexity, and the $m$-homotopic distance between maps. We further investigate the relationships between these $m$-dimensional invariants and their classical analogues, present a variety of examples in which these invariants are computed, and illustrate when they agree with or differ from their classical counterparts. We also introduce the notion of $m$-cohomological distance and study its interaction with the $m$-homotopic distance.</description>

      <title>Homological obstructions for regular embeddings of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In [36, Section 8], the present author proposed the hypergraph obstruction for the existence of k-regular embeddings. In this paper, we develop the hypergraph obstruction concretely and give some homological obstructions for the k-regular embeddings of graphs by using the embedded homology of sub-hypergraphs of the (k-1)-skeleton of the independence complexes. Regular embeddings of graphs can be regarded equivalently as geometric realizations of the independence complexes and consequently be regarded equivalently as simplicial embeddings of the independence complexes into the vectorial matroids. We prove that if there exists a k-regular embedding of a graph, then there is an induced homomorphism from the embedded homology of the sub-hyper(di)graphs of the (k-1)-skeleton of the (directed) independence complexes to the homology of (directed) matroids. Moreover, if there exists certain triple of graphs where each graph has a k-regular embedding, then there are induced commutative diagrams of certain Mayer-Vietoris sequences of the embedded homology of hyper(di)graphs, the homology of (directed) independence complexes and the homology of matroids. Furthermore, if there exists certain couple of graphs where each graph has a k-regular embedding, then there are induced commutative diagrams of certain Kunneth type short exact sequences of the embedded homology of hyper(di)graphs, the homology of (directed) independence complexes and the homology of matroids.</description>

      <title>Non-extendability of complex structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There exists a complex structure $J$ on a connected open subset $S^3_{\delta}\times S^3$ of $S^6$. The present paper proves that: (1) $J$ can be extended to a global almost complex structure $\widetilde{J}$ on $S^6$; (2) any extension to $S^6$ is necessarily non-integrable. Therefore, it is impossible to deform $\widetilde{J}$ to an integrable almost complex structure on $S^6$ while fixing it on $S^3_{\delta}\times S^3$. This phenomenon indicates that the deformation strategy suggested by S.-T. Yau in his Problem 52 cannot be realized in this sense.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.05706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $M$ and $N$ be smooth closed connected aspherical manifolds with good (in the sense of Serre) fundamental groups $G$ and $H$. We show that if $\widehat G\cong \widehat H$, then $M$ and $N$ are cobordant and the signatures of $M$ and $N$ agree modulo $8$. Moreover, $M$ is spin (resp.spin$^\CC$) if and only if $N$ is spin (resp.spin$^\CC$). We consider some analogous results for compact connected aspherical manifolds.</description>

      <title>Compact quotients of homogeneous spaces and homotopy theory of sphere bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A reductive homogeneous space $G/H$ is always diffeomorphic to the normal bundle of an orbit of a maximal compact subgroup of $G$. We prove that if $G/H$ admits compact quotients, then the sphere bundle associated to this normal bundle is fiber-homotopically trivial. We deduce that many reductive homogeneous spaces do not admit compact quotients, such as the complex spheres $\mathrm{O}(n+1,\mathbb{C})/\mathrm{O}(n,\mathbb{C})$ for all $n \notin \{1,3,7\}$, or $\mathrm{SL}(n,\mathbb{R})/\mathrm{SL}(m,\mathbb{R})$ for all $n&gt;m&gt;1$, which solves conjectures of T. Kobayashi from the early 1990s. We also prove that if the pseudo-Riemannian hyperbolic space $\mathbf{H}^{p,q}$ of signature $(p,q)$ admits compact quotients, then $p$ must be divisible by at least $2^{\lfloor q/2\rfloor}$.</description>

      <title>A model structure for locally constant factorization algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.14174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.14174v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Several model structures related to the homotopy theory of locally constant factorization algebras are constructed. This answers a question raised by D. Calaque in his habilitation thesis. Our methods also solve a problem related to cosheafification and factorization algebras identified by O. Gwilliam - K. Rejzner in the locally constant case.</description>

      <title>A relative orientation for the moduli space of stable maps to a del Pezzo surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.01941v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove orientation results for evaluation maps of moduli spaces of rational stable maps to del Pezzo surfaces over a field, both in characteristic $0$ and in positive characteristic. These results and the theory of degree developed in a sequel produce quadratically enriched counts of rational curves over non-algebraically closed fields of characteristic not $2$ or $3$. Orientations are constructed in two steps. First, the ramification locus of the evaluation map is shown to be the divisor in the moduli space of stable maps where image curves have a cusp. Second, this divisor is related to the discriminant of a branched cover of the moduli space given generically by pairs of points on the universal curve with the same image.</description>

      <title>Topological Signatures of ReLU Neural Network Activation Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12700v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the topological signatures of ReLU neural network activation patterns. We consider feedforward neural networks with ReLU activation functions and analyze the polytope decomposition of the feature space induced by the network. Mainly, we investigate how the Fiedler partition of the dual graph and show that it appears to correlate with the decision boundary -- in the case of binary classification. Additionally, we compute the homology of the cellular decomposition -- in a regression task -- to draw similar patterns in behavior between the training loss and polyhedral cell-count, as the model is trained.</description>
