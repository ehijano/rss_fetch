      <title>Sledgehamr: Simulating Scalar Fields with Adaptive Mesh Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the non-linear dynamics of coupled scalar fields often necessitates simulations on a three-dimensional mesh. These simulations can be computationally expensive if a large scale separation is involved. A common solution is adaptive mesh refinement which, however, greatly increases a simulation's complexity. In this work, we present sledgehamr, an AMReX-based code package to make the simulation of coupled scalar fields on an adaptive mesh more accessible. Compatible with both GPU and CPU clusters, sledgehamr offers a flexible and customizable framework. While the code had been primarily developed to evolve axion string networks, this framework enables various other applications, such as the study of gravitational waves sourced by the dynamics of scalar fields.</description>

      <title>Multi-messenger Probes of Asteroid Mass Primordial Black Holes: Superradiance Spectroscopy, Hawking Radiation, and Microlensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superradiance provides a unique opportunity for investigating dark sectors as well as primordial black holes (PBHs), which themselves are candidates for dark matter (DM) over a wide mass range. Using axion-like particles (ALPs) as an example, we show that line signals emerging from a superradiated ALP cloud combined with Hawking radiation from PBHs in extragalactic and galactic halos, along with microlensing observations lead to complementary constraints on parameter space combinations including the ALP-photon coupling, ALP mass, PBH mass, and PBH DM fraction, $f_{\rm PBH}$. For the PBH asteroid mass range $\sim10^{16}-10^{22}~{\rm g}$, where PBHs can provide the totality of DM, we demonstrate that ongoing and upcoming observations such as SXI, JWST, and AMEGO-X will be sensitive to possible line and continuum signals, respectively, providing probes of previously inaccessible regions of $f_{\rm PBH}$ parameter space. Further complementarity from a stochastic gravitational-wave background emerging from the PBH formation mechanism is also considered.</description>

      <title>A first determination of the strong coupling $\alpha_S$ at approximate N$^{3}$LO order in a global PDF fit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first determination of the value of the strong coupling via a simultaneous global fit of the proton parton distribution functions (PDFs) at approximate N$^{3}$LO (aN$^{3}$LO) order in QCD. This makes use of the MSHT global PDF fitting framework, and in particular the recent theoretical advances that allow a PDF fit to now be performed at this order. The value of the strong coupling is found to be $\alpha_S(M_Z^2)$(aN$^{3}$LO)$ = 0.1170 \pm 0.0016$. This is in excellent agreement with the NNLO value of $\alpha_S(M_Z^2)$(NNLO) $= 0.1171 \pm 0.0014$, indicating that good perturbative convergence has been found. The resulting uncertainties, calculated using the MSHT dynamic tolerance procedure, are somewhat larger, but more accurate, at aN$^{3}$LO, due to the missing higher order theoretical uncertainties that are included at this order, but not at NNLO. We in addition present a detailed breakdown of the individual dataset sensitivity to the value of the strong coupling, with special focus on the impact of fitting dijet rather than inclusive jet data. This choice is found to have a non-negligible impact, but with overall good consistency found, especially at aN$^{3}$LO.</description>

      <title>Glue in hadrons at medium resolution and the QCD instanton vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss a general framework for the evaluation of the gluonic form factors in light hadrons at low momentum transfer, in the QCD instanton vacuum. At medium resolution of the order of the inverse mean instanton size, the glue is mostly localized in single or pair of pseudoparticles, and globally constrained by the fluctuations of their topological charges. These pseudoparticles trap light quarks, giving rise to emerging multiflavor 't Hooft interactions. We explicitly evaluate the gluonic scalar, pseudoscalar, energy-momentum tensor (EMT), and the leading C-odd and C-even three gluons hadronic form factors, at next to leading order (NLO) in the instanton density, including molecular clusters of like and unlike instantons. We use the results for the EMT to address the contribution of the gluons in Ji$^\prime$s mass and spin sum rules, at low resolution. When evolved, our results for the mass and spin composition of the nucleon, are shown to be in good agreement with the recently reported lattice results at higher resolution.</description>

      <title>Direct detection of light dark matter charged under a $L_{\mu} - L_{\tau}$ symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A possible extension of the Standard Model able to explain the recent measurement of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon consists in adding a gauged $U(1)_{L_{\mu}-L_{\tau}}$ symmetry. If the dark matter particle is charged under this symmetry, the kinetic mixing between the new gauge boson and the photon induces dark matter-electron interactions. We derive direct detection constraints on light dark matter charged under a $U(1)_{L_{\mu}-L_{\tau}}$ symmetry with electron recoil experiments, and explore prospects with XLZD and OSCURA to close in the parameter space able to explain simultaneously the recent measurement on the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon and the observed relic density of dark matter. We further discuss the spin-dependent scattering contribution arising in this model, which was ignored previously in the literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss models of the flavour problem and dark matter based on the discrete $\mathcal{Z}_{\rm N} \times \mathcal{Z}_{\rm M} \times \mathcal{Z}_{\rm P}$ flavour symmetry. A new class of dark-matter emerges out of these models, which is defined as the flavonic dark matter. An ultra-violet completion of these models based on the dark-technicolour paradigm is also presented.</description>

      <title>On bipartite and tripartite entanglement at present and future particle colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement, rooted in the non-deterministic, non-local nature of quantum mechanics, serves as a fundamental correlation. High-energy particle colliders offer a unique platform for exploring entanglement in the relativistic regime. The recent observation of entanglement in $t\bar{t}$ production by ATLAS has sparked significant interest in investigating entanglement phenomena at colliders. While bipartite entanglement receives extensive attention, tripartite entanglement remains relatively uncharted. We investigate tripartite entanglement in $t\bar{t}Z$ production at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) within the Standard Model and with a dimension-$8$ effective operator. Additionally, we explore bipartite entanglement in $t\bar{t}$, $tW^-$, and di-boson production processes, namely $W^+W^-$, $ZZ$, and $W^+Z$, at the LHC and future $e^+e^-$ collider. We numerically compute various measures of entanglement through Monte Carlo events based on the spin density matrix, with its elements (polarization and spin correlation) obtained by analyzing the angular distribution of the final decayed leptons.</description>

      <title>ToMCCA: A Toy Monte Carlo Coalescence Afterburner</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of antinuclei in cosmic rays provides a unique opportunity to probe physics beyond the Standard Model. Antinuclei in our Galaxy may stem either from annihilation or decay of dark matter, or from collisions of cosmic rays with the interstellar medium, which constitute the background of indirect dark matter searches. Understanding the formation mechanism of (anti)nuclei is crucial for setting limits on their production in space. Coalescence models, which describe the formation of light nuclei from final-state interaction of nucleons, have been widely employed in high-energy collisions. In this work, we introduce ToMCCA (Toy Monte Carlo Coalescence Afterburner), which allows for detailed studies of the nuclear formation processes without the overload of general-purpose event generators. ToMCCA contains parameterizations of the multiplicity dependence of the transverse momentum distributions of protons and of the baryon-emitting source size, extracted from ALICE measurements in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 5 - 13$ TeV, as well as of the event multiplicity distributions, taken from the EPOS event generator. ToMCCA provides predictions of the deuteron transverse momentum distributions, with an agreement of $\sim5\%$ with the experimental data. The results of ToMCCA show that the coalescence mechanism in pp collisions depends only on the event multiplicity rather than on the collision system or its energy. This allows the model to be utilized for predictions at lower center-of-mass collision energies, which are the most relevant for the production of antinuclei from processes related to dark matter. This model can also be extended to heavier nuclei as long as the target nucleus wave function and its Wigner function are known.</description>

      <title>Fractional-charge hadrons and leptons to tell the Standard Model group apart</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gauge group of strong and electroweak interactions in Nature could be any of the four that share the same Lie algebra, $SU(3)_c\times SU(2)_L\times U(1)_Y/Z_p\equiv G_p$ with $Z_p=\left\{Z_6,Z_3,Z_2,Z_1\right\}$. Each of these cases allows in its spectrum for the matter fields of the SM but also for new distinctive representations, e.g. under the assumption that $q_L$ possesses the minimum possible hypercharge in Nature, $G_p$ allows for particles with a multiple of $p\,e/6$ for electric charge. This letter discusses how these new possibilities in the spectrum could be used to tell the SM group apart.</description>

      <title>Inclusive $\bar{B}\to X_s \ell^+\ell^-$ at the LHC: theory predictions and new-physics reach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present theoretical predictions for observables in inclusive $\bar{B}\to X_s \ell^+\ell^-$ suitable for measurements at hadron colliders through a sum-over-exclusive approach. At low $q^2$ we calculate the branching ratio and three angular observables. At high $q^2$ we provide the branching ratio and the ratio of the $\bar B \to X_s \ell^+\ell^-$ rate with respect to the inclusive $\bar B \to X_u \ell \bar\nu$ rate with the same phase-space cut. We compare our predictions to an extraction of the experimental rate through a sum-over-exclusive method using branching ratios of the exclusive $\bar B \to K^{(*)}\mu^+\mu^-$ modes measured at LHCb. Our analysis does not support a recent claim about a deficit in the inclusive branching ratio in the high-$q^2$ region. Finally, we present current model-independent bounds on new physics and emphasize the potential of complementary analyses of $\bar{B}\to X_s \ell^+\ell^-$ at Belle II and the LHC.</description>

      <title>Deformation-induced CPT violation in entangled pairs of neutral kaons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider description of kaon -- anti-kaon interference in the context of a theory with deformed $\cal CPT$ symmetry. In the case of such theoretical models, deviations from the standard $\cal CPT$ invariance is related to the momentum carried by the particles; in particular the rest masses of particles and antiparticles are equal. We find that the decay intensity of kaon -- anti-kaon pair has three contributing terms: the correct-parity, the wrong-parity, and the interference between them, all of which are affected by deformation. Using the fact that the presence of such terms were not observed we estimate the magnitude of deformation parameter $\kappa \gtrsim 10^{18}$ GeV, very close to the expected Planck mass scale. This raises hopes that the effect, if exists, could be detected in a near future accelerator experiments. An uncertainty of the energy measurement is crucial for accuracy of these predictions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rare kaon decay $K^+ \to \pi^+ \ell^+ \ell^-$ is an interesting process that offers insights into both Standard Model physics and potential New Physics contributions. While primarily driven by vector interactions in the Standard Model, it also provides a window to explore non-standard contributions. In this letter, we analyse the potential of $K^+ \to \pi^+ \ell^+ \ell^-$ decays to test the limits on scalar contributions. A simple yet effective analysis using differential decay width and the Forward-Backward Asymmetry is proposed to achieve the state-of-the-art limits on the extent of these scalar contributions. The bounds are obtained for the first time since the E865 experiment through a reinterpretation of the NA48/2 and NA62 experimental results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the descent via membrane nucleation through a landscape of vacua where the cosmological constant is given by a combination of four-form fluxes. It has been shown that this descent can be slowed exponentially for very low curvature vacua close to Minkowski space in a wide class of models satisfying certain parametric conditions, providing a possible solution to the cosmological constant problem. We explore in detail whether or not those parametric conditions are compatible with the membrane weak gravity conjecture. Whilst it is true that there is often tension, we show that this is not always the case and present an explicit model where Minkowski space is absolutely stable and the weak gravity conjecture is satisfied. This corresponds to an extension of the Bousso-Polchinski model into a generalised DBI action for four-forms. We also clarify how the landscape should be populated in a consistent model.</description>

      <title>Quantum thermodynamics of nonequilibrium processes in lattice gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A key objective in nuclear and high-energy physics is to describe nonequilibrium dynamics of matter, e.g., in the early universe and in particle colliders, starting from the Standard Model. Classical-computing methods, via the framework of lattice gauge theory, have experienced limited success in this mission. Quantum simulation of lattice gauge theories holds promise for overcoming computational limitations. Because of local constraints (Gauss's laws), lattice gauge theories have an intricate Hilbert-space structure. This structure complicates the definition of thermodynamic properties of systems coupled to reservoirs during equilibrium and nonequilibrium processes. We show how to define thermodynamic quantities such as work and heat using strong-coupling thermodynamics, a framework that has recently burgeoned within the field of quantum thermodynamics. Our definitions suit instantaneous quenches, simple nonequilibrium processes undertaken in quantum simulators. To illustrate our framework, we compute the work and heat exchanged during a quench in a $Z_2$ lattice gauge theory coupled to matter in 1+1 dimensions. The thermodynamic quantities, as functions of the quench parameter, evidence an expected phase transition. For general thermal states, we derive a simple relation between a quantum many-body system's entanglement Hamiltonian, measurable with quantum-information-processing tools, and the Hamiltonian of mean force, used to define strong-coupling thermodynamic quantities.</description>

      <title>A novel strategy to prove chiral symmetry breaking in QCD-like theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that chiral symmetry breaking occurs in the confining phase of QCD-like theories with $N_c$ colors and $N_f$ flavors. Our proof is based on a novel strategy, called `downlifting', by which solutions of the 't Hooft anomaly matching and persistent mass conditions for a theory with $N_f-1$ flavors are constructed from those of a theory with $N_f$ flavors, while $N_c$ is fixed. By induction, chiral symmetry breaking is proven for any $N_f\geq p_{min}$, where $p_{min}$ is the smallest prime factor of $N_c$. The proof can be extended to $N_f &lt;p_{min}$ under the additional assumption on the absence of phase transitions when quark masses are sent to infinity. Our results do not rely on ad-hoc assumptions on the spectrum of massless bound states.</description>

      <title>On the Proof of Chiral Symmetry Breaking through Anomaly Matching in QCD-like Theories: An Exemplification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our recent works revisit the proof of chiral symmetry breaking in the confining phase of four-dimensional QCD-like theories, i.e. $SU(N_c)$ gauge theories with $N_f$ flavors of vectorlike quarks in the fundamental representation. The analysis relies on the structure of 't Hooft anomaly matching and persistent mass conditions for theories with same $N_c$ and different $N_f$. In this paper, we work out concrete examples with $N_c=3$ and $N_c=5$ to support and elucidate the results in the companion papers. Within the same examples, we also test some claims made in earlier works.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the neutrino elastic differential cross-section (NDCS) and corresponding mean free path for neutral current scattering in the dense matter of a neutron star. A wide range of observed neutron star (NS) masses is considered, including the presence of $\Lambda$, $\Xi^{-}$, and $\Xi^{0}$ hyperons in the heaviest stars. Their presence significantly decreases the total neutrino mean free path in the heavier stars.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Hole Interpretation in Subsolar Mass Gravitational Wave Candidate SSM200308</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the recent second part of the third observation run by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration, a candidate with sub-solar mass components was reported, which we labelled as SSM200308. This study investigates the premise that primordial black holes (PBHs), arising from Gaussian perturbation collapses, could explain SSM200308. Through Bayesian analysis, we obtain the primordial curvature power spectrum that leads to the merger rate of PBHs aligning with observational data as long as they constitute $3.54^{+7.66}_{-2.82}\times 10^{-3}$ of the dark matter. However, while the gravitational wave (GW) background from binary PBH mergers is within current observational limits, the scalar-induced GWs associated with PBH formation exceed the constraints imposed by pulsar timing arrays, challenging the Gaussian perturbation collapse PBH model as the source of SSM200308.</description>

      <title>Wilson Loops and Random Matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Linear confinement with Casimir scaling of the string tension in confining gauge theories is a consequence of a certain property of the Polyakov loop related to random matrices. This mechanism does not depend on the details of the theories (neither the gauge group nor dimensions) and explains approximate Casimir scaling below string-breaking length. In this paper, we study 3d SU(2) pure Yang-Mills theory numerically and find the same random-matrix behavior for rectangular Wilson loops. We conjecture that this is a universal feature of strongly coupled confining gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Quantum querying based on multicontrolled Toffoli gates for causal Feynman loop configurations and directed acyclic graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum algorithms are a promising framework for a proper treatment of Feynman loop integrals due to the existence of a manifestly causal representation scenario. Particularly, unfolding causal configurations of multiloop Feynman diagrams is understood as querying \textit{directed acyclic graph} (DAG) configurations of undirected graphs in graph theory. In this paper we present a quantum algorithm for querying causality of multiloop Feynman diagrams using an ingenious change in the logic of the design of the oracle operator. The construction of the quantum oracle is surprisingly based exclusively on multicontrolled Toffoli gates and XNOT gates. The efficiency of the algorithm is evaluated performing a comparison with a quantum algorithm based on binary clauses. Additionally, we explicitly analise several three-, four- and five-eloop topologies, which have not been previously explored due to their higher complexity.</description>

      <title>$\bar b \bar b u d$ and $\bar b \bar b u s$ tetraquarks from lattice QCD using symmetric correlation matrices with both local and scattering interpolating operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the $\bar b \bar b u d$ tetraquark with quantum numbers $I(J^P) = 0(1^+)$ as well as the $\bar b \bar b u s$ tetraquark with quantum numbers $J^P = 1^+$ using lattice QCD. We improve on existing work by including both local and scattering interpolating operators on both sides of the correlation functions and use symmetric correlation matrices. This allows not only a reliable determination of the energies of QCD-stable tetraquark ground states, but also of low-lying excited states, which are meson-meson scattering states. The latter is particularly important for future finite-volume scattering analyses. Here, we perform chiral and continuum extrapolations of just the ground-state energies, for which finite-volume effects are expected to be small. Our resulting tetraquark binding energies, $-100 \pm 10\:^{+36}_{-43}\:\:{\rm MeV}$ for $\bar b \bar b u d$ and $-30 \pm 3\:^{+11}_{-31}\:\:{\rm MeV}$ for $\bar b \bar b u s$, are consistent with other recent lattice-QCD predictions.</description>

      <title>Regge trajectory relations for the universal description of the heavy-light systems: diquarks, mesons, baryons and tetraquarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.06794v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two newly proposed Regge trajectory relations are employed to analyze the heavy-light systems. One of the relations is $M=m_1+m_2+C'+\beta_x\sqrt{x+c_{0x}}$, $(x=l,\,n_r)$. Another reads $M=m_1+C'+\sqrt{\beta_x^2(x+c_{0x})+\frac{4}{3}\sqrt{{\pi}{\beta_x}}m^{3/2}_2(x+c_{0x})^{1/4}}$. $M$ is the bound state mass. $m_1$ and $m_2$ are the masses of the heavy constituent and the light constituent, respectively. $l$ is the orbital angular momentum and $n_r$ is the radial quantum number. $\beta_x$ and $c_{0x}$ are fitted. $m_1$, $m_2$ and $C'$ are input parameters. These two formulas consider both of the masses of heavy constituent and light constituent. We find that the heavy-light diquarks, the heavy-light mesons, the heavy-light baryons and the heavy-light tetraquarks satisfy these two formulas. When applying the first formula, the heavy-light systems satisfy the universal description irrespective of both of the masses of the light constituents and the heavy constituent. When using the second relation, the heavy-light systems satisfy the universal description irrespective of the mass of the heavy constituent. The fitted slopes differ distinctively for the heavy-light mesons, baryons and tetraquarks, respectively. When employing the first relation, the average values of $c_{fn_r}$ ($c_{fl}$) are $1.026$, $0.794$ and $0.553$ ($1.026$, $0.749$ and $0.579$) for the heavy-light mesons, the heavy-light baryons and the heavy-light tetraquarks, respectively. Upon application of the second relation, the mean values of $c_{fn_r}$ ($c_{fl}$) are $1.108$, $0.896$ and $0.647$ ($1.114$, $0.855$ and $0.676$) for the heavy-light mesons, the heavy-light baryons and the heavy-light tetraquarks, respectively. Moreover, the fitted results show that the Regge trajectories for the heavy-light systems are concave downwards in the $(M^2,\,n_r)$ and $(M^2,\,l)$ planes.</description>

      <title>Clockwork axion footprint on nano-hertz stochastic gravitational wave background</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.00746v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs) nano-Hz gravitational wave (GW) background signal can be naturally induced by the annihilation of domain walls (DWs) formed at a symmetry-breaking scale $f\simeq 200$~TeV in the clockwork axion framework. Based on our first successful and precise prediction, we for the first time suggest that the recent PTA observations strongly support the novel mechanism of the QCD instanton-induced DW annihilation in the clockwork axion framework. We also for the first time discover a novel correlation between dark matter (DM) relic abundance and nano-Hz GW background, which in turn indicates a natural connection between the axion decay constant and the symmetry-breaking scale in the clockwork framework. We find that the GW signal has a peak $h^2\Omega_{\rm GW}\simeq 10^{-6.6}-10^{-6.1}$ at about 50~nHz, which is definite and testable for future PTA data at frequencies $\gtrsim 25$~nHz and CMB-S4 experiment. We also propose various phenomena that may appear in PTAs and future GW interferometers.</description>

      <title>$K^+ N$ elastic scatterings for estimation of in-medium quark condensate with strange quarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.09397v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the low-energy $K^+N$ elastic scatterings in the context of the in-medium quark condensate with strange quarks. The chiral ward identity connects the in-medium quark condensate to the soft limit value of the pseudoscalar correlation function evaluated in nuclear matter. The in-medium correlation function of the psuedoscalar fields with strangeness describes in-medium kaon propagation and is obtained by kaon-nucleon scattering amplitudes in the low density approximation. We construct the kaon-nucleon scattering amplitudes in chiral perturbation theory up to the next-to-leading order and add some terms of the next-to-next-to-leading order with the strange quark mass to improve expansion of the strange quark sector. We also consider the effect of a possible broad resonance state around $P_\mathrm{lab} = 600$ MeV/c for $I=0$ reported in the previous study. The low energy constants are determined by existent $K^+N$ scattering data. We obtain good reproduction of the $K^+p$ scattering amplitude by chiral perturbation theory, while the description of the $KN$ amplitude with $I=0$ is not so satisfactory due to the lack of low energy data. Performing analytic continuation of the scattering amplitudes obtained by chiral perturbation theory to the soft limit, we estimate the in-medium strange quark condensate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.00129v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Increasingly precise astrophysical observations of the last decade in combination with intense theoretical studies allow for drawing a conclusion about potential Quark Matter presence in Neutron Stars interiors. Quark Matter may form the Neutron Star inner core or be immersed in the form of bubbles, or droplets. We consider the second scenario and demonstrate that even a small fraction of quark matter bubbles can lead to a high nonlinearity of the sound wave. Below the bubble resonant frequency the sound speed is lower than the ambient value. At the resonance it sharply grows. The peak is constrained by viscous dissipation. Above the resonance the speed exceeds the pure neutron star matter value. The dispersion equation for the bubbly neutron star compressibility is derived.</description>

Abstract: We systematically compute the $\Lambda_b(p, s_b) \to \Lambda_c(2595)^+$ and $\Lambda_b(p, s_b) \to \Lambda_c(2625)^+$ form factors within the Heavy Quark Effective Theory (HQET) framework including $\mathcal{O}(1/m_c^2)$. Besides taking into account the Standard Model-like vector and axial contributions, we further determine tensor and pseudo-tensor form factors. Our work constitutes a step forward with respect to previous analyses allowing for a comprehensive study of the matrix element parametrisation stemming from the HQET formalism. Finally, we demonstrate that the resulting form factors agree well with lattice Quantum Chromodynamics (LQCD) determinations stressing the need and relevance of the newly derived $1/m_c^2$ corrections.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we study masses and other static properties of triply heavy tetraquarks in the unified framework of the MIT bag which incorporates chromomagnetic interactions and enhanced binding energy. The masses, magnetic moments and charge radii of all strange and nonstrange (ground) states of triply heavy tetraquarks are computed, suggesting that all of triply heavy tetraquarks are above the respective two-meson thresholds. We also estimate relative decay widths of main decay channels of two-heavy mesons for these tetraquarks.</description>

      <title>Misalignment production of vector boson dark matter from axion-SU(2) inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.06889v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new mechanism to generate a coherently oscillating dark vector field from axion-SU(2) gauge field dynamics during inflation. The SU(2) gauge field acquires a nonzero background sourced by an axion during inflation, and it acquires a mass through spontaneous symmetry breaking after inflation. We find that the coherent oscillation of the dark vector field can account for dark matter in the mass range of $10^{-13}-1$ eV in a minimal setup. In a more involved scenario, the range can be wider down to the fuzzy dark matter region. One of the dark vector fields can be identified as the dark photon, in which case this mechanism evades the notorious constraints for isocurvature perturbation, statistical anisotropy, and the absence of ghosts that exist in the usual misalignment production scenarios. Phenomenological implications are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11892v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The capture of dark matter, and its subsequent annihilation, can heat old, isolated neutron stars. In order for kinetic heating to be achieved, the captured dark matter must undergo sufficient scattering to deposit its kinetic energy in the star. We find that this energy deposit typically occurs quickly, for most of the relevant parameter space. In order for appreciable annihilation heating to also be achieved, the dark matter must reach a state of capture-annihilation equilibrium in the star. We show that this can be fulfilled for all types of dark matter - baryon interactions. This includes cases where the scattering or annihilation cross sections are momentum or velocity suppressed in the non-relativistic limit. Importantly, we find that capture-annihilation equilibrium, and hence maximal annihilation heating, can be achieved without complete thermalization of the captured dark matter. For scattering cross sections that saturate the capture rate, we find that capture-annihilation equilibrium is typically reached on a timescale of less than $1$ year for vector interactions and $10^4$ years for scalar interactions.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we focus on the angular observables such as longitudinal polarization, $\tau$-polarization, and forward-backward asymmetry including the study of the lepton flavor violating observables. Our investigation is conducted within the Relativistic Independent Quark Model, emphasizing the potential model-dependent analysis of these observables in the decay channels $B_c \rightarrow \eta_c(J/\psi)/D (D^*), l \nu_l$ in the entire $q^2$ region. Considering the experimental aspects of $B$-hadron decays, the rapid confirmation of these quantities could signify a significant detection of physics beyond the Standard Model, opening up new avenues to understand the non-trivial flavor dynamics for further research into new physics.</description>

      <title>Doubly charmed pentaquark states in QCD sum rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10078v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have studied the mass spectra of doubly charmed pentaquark states in the $\Lambda _{c}^{(*)}D^{(*)}$ and $\Sigma _{c}^{(*)}D^{(*)}$ channels with $J^P=1/2^\pm$, $3/2^\pm$ and $5/2^\pm$ within the framework of QCD sum rules. We use the parity projected sum rules to separate the contributions of negative and positive parities from the two-point correlations induced by the pentaquark interpolating currents. Our results show that the bound states of $P_{cc}$ pentaquarks may exist in the $\Lambda _cD\, (\frac{1}{2}^-)$, $\Sigma _cD\, (\frac{1}{2}^-)$, $\Sigma _cD^*\, (\frac{3}{2}^-)$, $\Lambda _c^*D\, (\frac{3}{2}^-)$, $\Lambda _c^*D^*\, (\frac{5}{2}^-)$ channels with negative-parity and $\Sigma _cD\, (\frac{1}{2}^+)$, $\Sigma _cD^\ast\, (\frac{3}{2}^+)$, $\Sigma _c^\ast D\, (\frac{3}{2}^+)$ channels with positive-parity, since their masses are predicted to be lower than the corresponding meson-baryon thresholds. However, they are still allowed to decay into the $\Xi_{cc}^{(\ast)}\pi$ final states via strong interaction. The triply charged $P_{cc}^{+++}(ccuu\bar d)$ and neutral $P_{cc}^{0}(ccdd\bar u)$ in the isospin quartet would definitely be pentaquark states due to their exotic charges. We suggest searching for these characteristic doubly charmed pentaquark signals in the $P_{cc}^{+++}\to\Xi_{cc}^{(\ast) ++}\pi^+/\rho^+$, $\Sigma_c^{(\ast)++}D^{(\ast)+}$ and $P_{cc}^{0}\to\Xi_{cc}^{(\ast) +}\pi^-/\rho^-$, $\Sigma_c^{(\ast)0}D^{(\ast)0}$ decays in the near future.</description>

      <title>Investigations of $\Lambda$ states with spin-parity $\frac{3}{2}^{\pm}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00134v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present study provides spectroscopic investigations of spin-$\frac{3}{2}$ $\Lambda$ baryons with both positive and negative parities. The analysis mainly focuses on three states, namely $1P$, $2P$, and $2S$, and corresponding masses are calculated using the QCD sum rule method. To implement the method, we apply two types of interpolating currents with octet and singlet quantum numbers and compare the corresponding results with the reported masses of experimentally observed states. From the comparisons, it is extracted that the results of interpolating current with octet quantum numbers are in good agreement with the experimentally measured masses. The masses obtained with this interpolating current are $m=1513.64\pm 8.76$ MeV for $1P$ state with $J^P=\frac{3}{2}^-$, $m'=1687.91\pm 0.31$ MeV for $2P$ state with $J^P=\frac{3}{2}^-$ and $\tilde{m}=1882.37 \pm 11.95$ MeV for $2S$ state with $J^P=\frac{3}{2}^+$ and they are consistent with the experimental masses of $\Lambda(1520)$, $\Lambda(1690)$ and $\Lambda(1890)$, respectively, which confirm their spin-parity quantum numbers. Besides, we calculate the corresponding current coupling constants, which are utilized as inputs in the calculations of different form factors defining the widths of the states under study.</description>

      <title>Probing quantum decoherence at Belle II and LHCb</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02470v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the advent of Belle II and the LHCb upgrade, the precision measurements of various B-Physics observables are on cards. This holds significant potential for delving into physics beyond the standard model of electroweak interactions. These measurements can also serve as means to establish limits on phenomena occurring at much finer length scales, such as quantum decoherence, which may arise due to potential discreteness in space-time or non-trivial topological effects. In this work, we set up the formalism to investigate the impact of quantum decoherence on several potential observables in $B$ meson systems. The approach employs the trace-preserving Kraus operator formalism, extending unitary evolution to non-unitary dynamics while maintaining complete positivity. In this formalism, the decoherence effects are parametrized in terms of a single parameter. Through the analysis of purely leptonic, semileptonic, and non-leptonic decays of $B$ mesons, we identify observables that could, in principle, be influenced by decoherence. The theoretical expressions are provided without neglecting the impact of decay width difference ($\Delta \Gamma$) and $CP$ violation in mixing. Considering that many of these observables can be measured with high precision using the abundant data collected by LHCb and Belle II, our formalism can be applied to establish constraints on the decoherence parameter through multiple decay channels. This offers an alternative set-up for such studies, which, at present, are predominantly conducted in the neutrino sector.</description>

      <title>How much strangeness is needed for the axial-vector form factor of the nucleon?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04905v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the axial-vector together with its induced pseudo-scalar form factor of the nucleon as computed from the chiral Lagrangian with nucleon and isobar degrees of freedom. The form factors are evaluated at the one-loop level, where particular emphasis is put on the use of on-shell masses in the loop expressions. Our results are presented in terms of a novel set of basis functions that generalize the Passarino--Veltman scheme to the case where power-counting violating structures are to be subtracted. The particularly important role of the isobar degrees of freedom is emphasized. We obtain a significant and simultaneous fit to the available Lattice QCD results based on flavour SU(2) ensembles for the baryon masses and form factors up to pion masses of about 500 MeV. Our fits includes sizeable finite volume effects that are implied by using in-box values for the hadron masses entering our one-loop expressions. We conclude that from flavour SU(2) ensembles it appears not possible to predict the empirical formfactor at the desired precision. Effects from strange quarks are expected to remedy the situation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16441v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose to study atmospheric neutrino interactions with a unique event topology to distinguish neutrinos and anti-neutrinos using a liquid argon time projection chamber in an experiment such as DUNE. The detection of CC1P and CC0P events will allow to access neutrino oscillation physics complementary to accelerator based beam neutrinos. Our analysis shows that a sensitivity to the mass-ordering can be achieved with a significance close to 4{\sigma} and a CP violation sensitivity with more than 2{\sigma} with a data sample of 140 kt-yr of atmospheric neutrinos in the DUNE detector.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00614v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To access information on the internal structure of the nucleon, data from a variety of scattering experiments can be analyzed, in regimes where the information factorizes from an otherwise known scattering amplitude. A recent development, promising new insight, is the study of exclusive reactions in the backward kinematical region, where the information can be encoded in Transition Distribution Amplitudes (TDAs). We model the photon-to-nucleon TDAs, entering the factorized description of backward Timelike Compton Scattering, using techniques of light-front dynamics to integrate information from a quark model for the photon and the nucleon. We include the results of numerical predictions that could inform further experiments at Jefferson Lab and the future Electron--Ion Collider.</description>

      <title>Implications of purity constraints on light higgsinos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19598v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The lightest supersymmetric particles could be higgsinos that have a small mixing with gauginos. If the lightest higgsino-like state makes up some or all of the dark matter with a thermal freezeout density, then its mass must be between about 100 and 1150 GeV, and dark matter searches put bounds on the amount of gaugino contamination that it can have. Motivated by the generally good agreement of flavor- and CP-violating observables with Standard Model predictions, I consider models in which the scalar particles of minimal supersymmetry are heavy enough to be essentially decoupled, except for the 125 GeV Higgs boson. I survey the resulting purity constraints as lower bounds on the gaugino masses and upper bounds on the higgsino mass splittings. I also discuss the mild excesses in recent soft lepton searches for charginos and neutralinos at the LHC, and show that they can be accommodated in these models if $\tan\beta$ is small and $\mu$ is negative.</description>

      <title>Optimised observables and new physics prospects in the penguin-mediated decays $B_{d(s)}\to K^{(*)0}\phi$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01186v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the penguin-mediated decays $\bar{B}_{d(s)}\to\bar{K}^{*0}(K^{*0})\phi$ transitions. We propose a new optimised observable $L_{K^*\phi}$ from the ratio of longitudinal branching ratios of these decays, with limited hadronic uncertainties and enhanced sensitivity to New Physics. It exhibits a deviation at the $1.48\, \sigma$ level between its experimental value and its SM determination within QCD factorisation. This result can be accommodated together with the significant deviations found for the $K^{(*)}\bar{K}^{(*)}$ modes in our earlier works, if New Physics affects either the QCD penguin operator $Q_4$ or the chromomagnetic dipole operator $Q_{8g}$ for both $b\to d$ and $b\to s$ transitions. The allowed range for the Wilson coefficients $C_{4s,8gs}$ is narrower compared to $C_{4d,8gd}$ since the $b\to s$ transition $\bar{B}_d\to\bar{K}^{*0}\phi$ is in better agreement with the SM. If we add the measured branching ratio for the $\bar{B}_{d}\to \bar{K}^{0}\phi$ to our analysis, the simultaneous explanation of all the experimental data for the $K^{(*)}\bar{K}^{(*)}$ and the $K^*(\bar{K}^{(*)})\phi$ channels in terms of New Physics in $C_{4d,s}$ or $C_{8gd,s}$ operators only becomes very constrained. This set of observables can be explained more easily if we assume New Physics either in $(C_{4f},C_{6f})$ or $(C_{6f},C_{8gf})$ in both $f=d,s$. This should provide a strong incentive for the LHCb experiment to perform a measurement of the branching ratios of $\bar{B}_{d}\to\bar{K}^{(*)0}\phi$ and an improved measurement for the branching ratio of $\bar{B}_s\to K^{*0}\phi$.</description>

      <title>Left-Right Symmetry Breaking and Gravitational Waves : A Tale of Two Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.05829v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study possible ways gravitational waves (GW) are sourced in a theory with minimal left-right symmetry breaking. Generically first order phase transitions (FOPT) lead to gravitational waves sourced by bubble collisions, while second order phase transitions (SOPT) do not. However, due the presence of two degenerate fields, we obtain domain walls in the putative SOPT case, giving rise to GW via decaying domain walls, testable at experiments such as IPTA, DECIGO, and LISA. On the other hand, for the case of FOPT, we get the usual signal from spontaneously created bubbles, but also a late forming domain wall structure separating the two types of vacua. Thus the traditional FOPT case gives rise to two distinct peaks in the spectrum of GW, verifiable for the low symmetry breaking scales $10^4 - 10^6$ GeV, but beyond the reach of currently planned experiments for a high scale $\sim10^{10}$ GeV. Finally, we point out that a version of the left-right symmetric model which separates parity breaking from gauge symmetry breaking is also subject to domain wall formation and amenable to GW observations.</description>

      <title>Red Supergiant Candidates for Multimessenger Monitoring of the Next Galactic Supernova</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.08785v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compile a catalog of 578 highly probable and 62 likely red supergiants (RSGs) of the Milky Way, which represents the largest list of Galactic RSG candidates designed for continuous follow-up to date. We match distances measured by Gaia DR3, 2MASS photometry, and a 3D Galactic dust map to obtain luminous bright late-type stars. Determining the stars' bolometric luminosities and effective temperatures, we compare to Geneva stellar evolution tracks to determine likely RSG candidates, and quantify contamination using a catalog of Galactic AGB in the same luminosity-temperature space. We add details for common or interesting characteristics of RSG, such as multi-star system membership, variability, and classification as a runaway. As potential future core-collapse supernova (SN) progenitors, we study the ability of the catalog to inform the Supernova Early Warning System (SNEWS) coincidence network made to automate pointing, and show that for 3D position estimates made possible by neutrinos, the number of progenitor candidates can be significantly reduced, improving our ability to observe the progenitor pre-explosion and the early phases of the core-collapse supernova.</description>

      <title>The Possibility of Tachyons as Soliton Solutions in 3+1 Dimensions via k-field Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.14380v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tachyons or hypothetical faster-than-light (FTL) particles would fail the principle of causality. Such particles may only be imagined when they have no energy and momentum and, thus, no observable interaction. In this paper, we show that the classical relativistic field theory with non-standard Lagrangian densities (k-field models) does not rule out the existence of FTL particle-like solutions (solitons) with zero energy and momentum in 3+1 dimensions. However, contrary to our expectation, we show that it is possible to have k-field models that lead to energetic FTL soliton solutions in 3+1 dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.16893v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive re-evaluation of the $ft$ values in superallowed nuclear $\beta$ decays crucial for the precise determination of $V_{ud}$ and low-energy tests of the electroweak Standard Model. It consists of the first, fully data-driven analysis of the nuclear $\beta$ decay form factor, that utilizes isospin relations to connect the nuclear charged weak distribution to the measurable charge distributions. This prescription supersedes previous shell-model estimations, and allows for a rigorous quantification of theory uncertainties in $f$ which is absent in the existing literature. Our new evaluation shows an overall downward shift of the central values of $f$ at the level of 0.01\%.</description>

      <title>On the IR Divergences in de Sitter Space: loops, resummation and the semi-classical wavefunction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17990v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we revisit the infrared (IR) divergences in de Sitter (dS) space using the wavefunction method, and explicitly explore how the resummation of higher-order loops leads to the stochastic formalism. In light of recent developments of the cosmological bootstrap, we track the behaviour of these nontrivial IR effects from perturbation theory to the non-perturbative regime. Specifically, we first examine the perturbative computation of wavefunction coefficients, and show that there is a clear distinction between classical components from tree-level diagrams and quantum ones from loop processes. Cosmological correlators at loop level receive contributions from tree-level wavefunction coefficients, which we dub classical loops. This distinction significantly simplifies the analysis of loop-level IR divergences, as we find the leading contributions always come from these classical loops. Then we compare with correlators from the perturbative stochastic computation, and find the results there are essentially the ones from classical loops, while quantum loops are only present as subleading corrections. This demonstrates that the leading IR effects are contained in the semi-classical wavefunction which is a resummation of all the tree-level diagrams. With this insight, we go beyond perturbation theory and present a new derivation of the stochastic formalism using the saddle-point approximation. We show that the Fokker-Planck equation follows as a consequence of two effects: the drift from the Schr\"odinger equation that describes the bulk time evolution, and the diffusion from the Polchinski's equation which corresponds to the exact renormalization group flow of the coarse-grained theory on the boundary. Our analysis highlights the precise and simple link between the stochastic formalism and the semi-classical wavefunction.</description>

Abstract: We generalize the relativistic field-theoretic three-particle finite-volume scattering formalism to describe generic $DD\pi$ systems in the charm $C=2$ sector. This includes the isospin-0 channel, in which the recently discovered doubly-charmed tetraquark $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ is expected to manifest as a pole in the $DD \pi \to DD \pi$ scattering amplitude. The formalism presented here can also be applied to lattice QCD settings in which the $D^*$ is bound and, in particular, remains valid below the left-hand cut in $D D^*$ scattering, thus resolving an issue in previous analyses of lattice-determined finite-volume energies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08866v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Migdal effect is a key inelastic signal channel which could be used to detect low-mass dark matter, but it has never been observed experimentally using Standard Model probes. Here we propose an experiment which could detect the Migdal effect in diatomic molecules through low-energy neutron scattering. The enhancement of the Migdal rate through non-adiabatic couplings, which are absent in isolated atoms, combined with the distinctive photon energies of electronic transitions in CO, suggest that a positive detection of the molecular Migdal effect may be possible with modest beam times at existing neutron facilities.</description>

      <title>The radiative decay of scalar glueball from lattice QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01564v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform the first lattice QCD study on the radiative decay of the scalar glueball to the vector meson $\phi$ in the quenched approximation. The calculations are carried out on three gauge ensembles with different lattice spaicings, which enable us to do the continuum extrapolation. We first revisit the radiative $J/\psi$ decay into the scalar glueball $G$ and obtain the partial decay width $\Gamma(J/\psi \to \gamma G)=0.449(44)~\text{keV}$ and the branching fraction $\text{Br}(J/\psi \to \gamma G) = 4.8(5)\times 10^{-3}$, which are in agreement with the previous lattice results. We then extend the similar calculation to the process $G\to \gamma \phi$ and get the partial decay width $\Gamma(G \to \gamma \phi)= 0.074(47)~\text{keV}$, which implies that the combined branching fraction of $J/\psi\to\gamma G\to \gamma\gamma\phi$ is as small as $\mathcal{O}(10^{-9})$ such that this process is hardly detected by the BESIII experiment even with the large $J/\psi$ sample of $\mathcal{O}(10^{10})$. With the vector meson dominance model, the two-photon decay width of the scalar glueball is estimated to be $\Gamma(G\to\gamma\gamma)=0.53(46)~\text{eV}$, which results in a large stickiness $S(G)\sim \mathcal{O}(10^4)$ of the scalar glueball by assuming the stickiness of $f_2(1270)$ to be one.</description>

      <title>Quantum Mechanical Softening of the Hypertriton Transverse Momentum Spectrum in Heavy-Ion Collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02701v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the properties of hypernuclei helps to constrain the interaction between hyperon and nucleon, which is known to play an essential role in determining the properties of neutron stars. Experimental measurements have suggested that the hypertriton ($^3_\Lambda \text{H}$), the lightest hypernucleus, exhibits a halo structure with a deuteron core encircled by a $\Lambda$ hyperon at a distance of about 10 fm. This large $\Lambda-d$ distance in $^3_\Lambda \text{H}$ wave function is found to cause a suppressed $^3_\Lambda \text{H}$ yield and a softening of its transverse momentum ($p_T$) spectrum in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Within the coalescence model based on nucleons and $\Lambda$ hyperons from a microscopic hybrid hydro model with a hadronic afterburner for nuclear cluster production in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$= 5.02 TeV, we show how this softening of the hypertriton $p_T$ spectrum appears and leads to a significantly smaller mean $p_T$ for $^3_\Lambda \text{H}$ than for helium-3 ($^3$He). The latter is opposite to the predictions from the blast-wave model which assumes that $^3_\Lambda \text{H}$ and $^3$He are thermally produced at the kinetic freeze-out of heavy ion collisions. The discovered quantum mechanical softening of the (anti-)hypertriton spectrum can be experimentally tested in relativistic heavy-ion collisions at different collision energies and centralities and used to obtain valuable insights to the mechanisms for light (hyper-)nuclei production in these collisions.</description>
