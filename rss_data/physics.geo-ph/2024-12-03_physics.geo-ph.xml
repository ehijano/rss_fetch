      <title>Anthropogenic actinides in seawater and biota from the west coast of Sweden</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The assessment of the origin of the anthropogenic contamination in marine regions impacted by other sources than global fallout is a challenge. This is the case of the west coast of Sweden, influenced by the liquid effluents released by the European Nuclear Reprocessing Plants through North Sea currents and by Baltic Sea local and regional sources, among others. This work focused on the study of anthropogenic actinides (${}^{236}$U, ${}^{237}$Np and ${}^{239,240}$Pu) in seawater and biota from a region close to Gothenburg where radioactive wastes with an unknown composition were dumped in 1964. To this aim, a radiochemical procedure for the sequential extraction of U, Np and Pu from biota samples and the subsequent analysis of ${}^{236}$U, ${}^{237}$Np, ${}^{239}$Pu and ${}^{240}$Pu by Accelerator Mass Spectrometry was developed. The method was validated through the study of two reference materials provided by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA): IAEA-446 (Baltic Sea seaweed) and IAEA-437 (Mediterranean Sea mussels). The ${}^{233}$U$/{}^{236}$U atom ratio was also studied in the seawater samples. The obtained results indicate that the North Sea currents and global fallout are the major sources for ${}^{236}$U, ${}^{237}$Np and ${}^{239,240}$Pu to the studied area, with any clear evidence of other local sources. Complementary, information on the Concentrations Factors (CF) in biota was obtained, for which the available information is very scarce. For seaweed, CF values of $(4.1 \pm 1.1) \times 10^{3}$, $88 \pm 51$ and $70 \pm 20$ have been obtained for Pu, Np and U, respectively. Lower CF values of $(3.6 \pm 1.2) \times 10^{2}$, $37 \pm 15$ and $15.1 \pm 5.2$ for Pu, Np and U, respectively, have been obtained for mussels.</description>

      <title>Spatial-variant causal Bayesian inference for rapid seismic ground failures and impacts estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rapid and accurate estimation of post-earthquake ground failures and building damage is critical for effective post-disaster responses. Progression in remote sensing technologies has paved the way for rapid acquisition of detailed, localized data, enabling swift hazard estimation through analysis of correlation deviations between pre- and post-quake satellite imagery. However, discerning seismic hazards and their impacts is challenged by overlapping satellite signals from ground failures, building damage, and environmental noise. Previous advancements introduced a novel causal graph-based Bayesian network that continually refines seismic ground failure and building damage estimates derived from satellite imagery, accounting for the intricate interplay among geospatial elements, seismic activity, ground failures, building structures, damages, and satellite data. However, this model's neglect of spatial heterogeneity across different locations in a seismic region limits its precision in capturing the spatial diversity of seismic effects. In this study, we pioneer an approach that accounts for spatial intricacies by introducing a spatial variable influenced by the bilateral filter to capture relationships from surrounding hazards. The bilateral filter considers both spatial proximity of neighboring hazards and their ground shaking intensity values, ensuring refined modeling of spatial relationships. This integration achieves a balance between site-specific characteristics and spatial tendencies, offering a comprehensive representation of the post-disaster landscape. Our model, tested across multiple earthquake events, demonstrates significant improvements in capturing spatial heterogeneity in seismic hazard estimation. The results highlight enhanced accuracy and efficiency in post-earthquake large-scale multi-impact estimation, effectively informing rapid disaster responses.</description>

      <title>TomoATT: An open-source package for Eikonal equation-based adjoint-state traveltime tomography for seismic velocity and azimuthal anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: TomoATT is an open-source software package, aiming at determining seismic velocity and azimuthal anisotropy based on adjoint-state traveltime tomography methods. Key features of TomoATT include Eikonal equation modeling, adjoint-state method, sensitivity kernel regularization, and multi-level parallelization. Through several toy experiments, we demonstrate TomoATT's capability in accurate forward modeling, handling multipathing phenomenon, delivering reliable tomographic results, and achieving high-performance parallelization. Additionally, TomoATT is benchmarked with a synthetic experiment and two real-data applications in central California near Parkfield and Thailand. The successful recovery of the synthetic model, along with the imaging results that are consistent with previous studies and regional tectonics, verifies the effectiveness of TomoATT. Each inversion starts with only three simple input files (about model, data, and parameters) and completes within 2 hours using 64 processors. Overall, TomoATT offers an efficient and user-friendly tool for regional and teleseismic traveltime tomography, empowering researchers to image subsurface structures and deepen our understanding of the Earth's interior.</description>

      <title>High Magnitude Earthquake Identification Using an Anomaly Detection Approach on HR GNSS Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Earthquake early warning systems are crucial for protecting areas that are subject to these natural disasters. An essential part of these systems is the detection procedure. Traditionally these systems work with seismograph data, but high rate GNSS data has become a promising alternative for the usage in large earthquake early warning systems. Besides traditional methods, deep learning approaches have gained recent popularity in this field, as they are able to leverage the large amounts of real and synthetic seismic data. Nevertheless, the usage of deep learning on GNSS data remains a comparatively new topic. This work contributes to the field of early warning systems by proposing an autoencoder based deep learning pipeline that aims to be lightweight and customizable for the detection of anomalies viz. high magnitude earthquakes in GNSS data. This model, DetEQ, is trained using the noise data recordings from nine stations located in Chile. The detection pipeline encompasses: (i) the generation of an anomaly score using the ground truth and reconstructed output from the autoencoder, (ii) the detection of relevant seismic events through an appropriate threshold, and (iii) the filtering of local events, that would lead to false positives. Robustness of the model was tested on the HR GNSS real data of 2011 Mw 6.8 Concepcion earthquake recorded at six stations. The results highlight the potential of GNSS based deep learning models for effective earthquake detection.</description>

      <title>Improved calculation of the Young's modulus of rectangular prisms from their resonant frequency overtones by identifying appropriate shear constants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Young's modulus is an important parameter for characterizing the strength of, and wave propagation through, a given material. This study improves the estimation of Young's modulus using the impulse excitation (IE) technique based on an experimental analysis of 19 borosilicate glass bars. Analysis of the frequency equations relating Young's modulus to the out of plane and in plane flexural resonant frequencies of rectangular prisms has been conducted for both the fundamental frequency and its overtones at higher orders of vibration. The Young's modulus of three novaculite rocks with various porosities were then measured up to the seventh order of vibration to validate the optimum shear constant equation for estimating Young's modulus. Young's modulus was found to be nearly frequency independent for these rock samples.</description>

      <title>Well log data generation and imputation using sequence-based generative adversarial networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Well log analysis is crucial for hydrocarbon exploration, providing detailed insights into subsurface geological formations. However, gaps and inaccuracies in well log data, often due to equipment limitations, operational challenges, and harsh subsurface conditions, can introduce significant uncertainties in reservoir evaluation. Addressing these challenges requires effective methods for both synthetic data generation and precise imputation of missing data, ensuring data completeness and reliability. This study introduces a novel framework utilizing sequence-based generative adversarial networks (GANs) specifically designed for well log data generation and imputation. The framework integrates two distinct sequence-based GAN models: Time Series GAN (TSGAN) for generating synthetic well log data and Sequence GAN (SeqGAN) for imputing missing data. Both models were tested on a dataset from the North Sea, Netherlands region, focusing on different sections of 5, 10, and 50 data points. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach achieves superior accuracy in filling data gaps compared to other deep learning models for spatial series analysis. The method yielded R^2 values of 0.921, 0.899, and 0.594, with corresponding mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) values of 8.320, 0.005, and 151.154, and mean absolute error (MAE) values of 0.012, 0.005, and 0.032, respectively. These results set a new benchmark for data integrity and utility in geosciences, particularly in well log data analysis.</description>

      <title>QuakeFormer: A Uniform Approach to Earthquake Ground Motion Prediction Using Masked Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ground motion prediction (GMP) models are critical for hazard reduction before, during and after destructive earthquakes. In these three stages, intensity forecasting, early warning and interpolation models are corresponding employed to assess the risk. Considering the high cost in numerical methods and the oversimplification in statistical methods, deep-learning-based approaches aim to provide accurate and near-real-time ground motion prediction. Current approaches are limited by specialized architectures, overlooking the interconnection among these three tasks. What's more, the inadequate modeling of absolute and relative spatial dependencies mischaracterizes epistemic uncertainty into aleatory variability. Here we introduce QuakeFormer, a unified deep learning architecture that combines these three tasks in one framework. We design a multi-station-based Transformer architecture and a flexible masking strategy for training QuakeFormer. This data-driven approach enables the model to learn spatial ground motion dependencies directly from real seismic recordings, incorporating location embeddings that include both absolute and relative spatial coordinates. The results indicate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art ground motion prediction models across all three tasks in our research areas. We also find that pretraining a uniform forecasting and interpolation model enhances the performance on early warning task. QuakeFormer offers a flexible approach to directly learning and modeling ground motion, providing valuable insights and applications for both earthquake science and engineering.</description>

      <title>Bounds on the complex viscoelasticity for surface waves on ice-covered seas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Oceanic wave propagation through Earth's sea ice covers is a critical component of accurate ice and climate modeling. Continuum models of the polar ocean surface layer are characterized rheologically by the effective complex viscoelasticity of the composite of ice floes and sea water. Here we present the first rigorous theory of this parameter, and distill its dependence on mixture geometry into the spectral properties of a self-adjoint operator analogous to the Hamiltonian in quantum physics. Bounds for the complex viscoelasticity are obtained from the sea ice concentration and the contrast between the elastic and viscous properties of the ice and water/slush constituents. We find that several published wave attenuation datasets in both laboratory and field settings fall well within the bounds for specific contrast values of the ice/ocean composite.</description>

      <title>Automatic Differentiation-based Full Waveform Inversion with Flexible Workflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Full waveform inversion (FWI) is able to construct high-resolution subsurface models by iteratively minimizing discrepancies between observed and simulated seismic data. However, its implementation can be rather involved for complex wave equations, objective functions, or regularization. Recently, automatic differentiation (AD) has proven to be effective in simplifying solutions of various inverse problems, including FWI. In this study, we present an open-source AD-based FWI framework (ADFWI), which is designed to simplify the design, development, and evaluation of novel approaches in FWI with flexibility. The AD-based framework not only includes forword modeling and associated gradient computations for wave equations in various types of media from isotropic acoustic to vertically or horizontally transverse isotropic elastic, but also incorporates a suite of objective functions, regularization techniques, and optimization algorithms. By leveraging state-of-the-art AD, objective functions such as soft dynamic time warping and Wasserstein distance, which are difficult to apply in traditional FWI are also easily integrated into ADFWI. In addition, ADFWI is integrated with deep learning for implicit model reparameterization via neural networks, which not only introduces learned regularization but also allows rapid estimation of uncertainty through dropout. To manage high memory demands in large-scale inversion associated with AD, the proposed framework adopts strategies such as mini-batch and checkpointing. Through comprehensive evaluations, we demonstrate the novelty, practicality and robustness of ADFWI, which can be used to address challenges in FWI and as a workbench for prompt experiments and the development of new inversion strategies.</description>

      <title>Terrestrial atmospheric ion implantation occurred in the nearside lunar regolith during the history of Earth's dynamo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Light volatile elements in lunar regolith are thought to be a mixture of the solar wind and Earth's atmosphere, the latter sourced in the absence of geomagnetic field. However, the extent to which both the current and primitive geodynamo influence the transport of terrestrial ions still remains unclear, and this uncertainty is further complicated by the enigmatic composition and poorly constrained location of the Eoarchean exosphere. Here we use 3-D MHD numerical simulations with present-day magnetized and Archean unmagnetized atmospheres to investigate how Earth's intrinsic magnetic field affects this transfer, aiming to constrain how and when the lunar isotopic signature provides a record of Earth's paleoatmosphere. We find that atmospheric transfer is efficient only when the Moon is within Earth's magnetotail. The non-solar contribution to the lunar soil is best explained by implantation during the long history of the geodynamo, rather than any short, putatively unmagnetized epoch of early Earth. This further suggests the history of the terrestrial atmosphere, spanning billions of years, could be preserved in buried lunar soils. Our results indicate that the elemental abundances of Apollo samples are very sensitive to Earth's exobase altitude, which, at the time of ion implantation, was never smaller than 190 km.</description>

      <title>Diffusiophoresis in porous media saturated with a mixture of electrolytes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current theories of diffusiophoresis in porous media are limited to a porous medium saturated with a valence symmetric electrolyte. A predictive model for diffusiophoresis in porous media saturated with a valence asymmetric electrolyte, or a general mixture of valence symmetric and asymmetric electrolytes, is lacking. To close this knowledge gap, in this work we develop a mathematical model, based upon the regular perturbation method and numerical integration, to compute the diffusiophoretic mobility of a colloid in porous media saturated with a general mixture of electrolytes. We model the electrokinetics using the Poisson-Nernst-Planck equations and the fluid transport in porous media using the Brinkman equation with an electric body force. We report three novel key findings. First, we demonstrate that, in the same electrolyte concentration gradient, lowering the permeability of the porous medium can significantly weaken the colloid diffusiophoretic motion. Second, we show that, surprisingly, by using a valence asymmetric electrolyte the colloid diffusiophoretic motion in a denser porous medium can be stronger than that in a less dense porous medium saturated with a symmetric electrolyte. Third, we demonstrate that varying the composition of an electrolyte mixture does not only change the strength of the colloid diffusiophoretic motion drastically, but also qualitatively its direction. The model developed from this work can be used to understand and predict natural phenomena such as intracellular transport, as well as design technological applications such as enhanced oil recovery, nanoparticle drug delivery, and colloidal species separation.</description>

      <title>Importance of precipitation on the slowdown of creep behaviour induced by pressure-solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pressure-solution is a chemo-mechanical process, involving dissolution at grain/asperity contacts and precipitation away from them. It induces a compaction in time of rocks and sediments. The present study investigates numerically the impact of precipitation on the slowdown of creep behavior induced by pressure-solution. A recently published framework, called the Phase-Field Discrete Element Model, is carefully calibrated against existing indentation experiments and validated for other rate-limiting scenarios. It is shown that when precipitation is relatively slow, the slowdown of pressure-solution is due to a chemical mechanism (accumulation of solute concentration within the pore space), whereas, at fast precipitation, the slowdown is due to a mechanical mechanism (stress reduction at the contact).</description>

      <title>HOPE: An Automatically Differentiable High-Order Non-Oscillatory Finite-Volume Shallow-Water Dynamic Core</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19185v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An automatically differentiable, high-order non-oscillatory finite volume shallow water dynamic core has been constructed on a cubed sphere grid. This dynamic core has four advantageous properties: high order accuracy, essential non-oscillation, mass conservation, and scalability. Besides, the code development is based on PyTorch, enabling the model to run seamlessly on both CPU and GPU, while naturally possessing the capability of automatic differentiation. We named the new dynamic core as High Order Prediction Environment (HOPE). The spatial reconstruction is based on the two-dimensional tensor product polynomial and the genuine two-dimensional Weighted Essentially Non-Oscillatory (WENO) scheme. A novel panel boundary approach ensures that the accuracy can reach arbitrary order. The algorithm has very high degree of compatibility with GPU architecture, allowing the computational overhead to be mitigated through the utilization of GPU. The LMARS (Low Mach number Approximate Riemann Solver) scheme is adopted as Riemann solvers to determine fluxes on the Gaussian points on edges. Flux across the interface between each cell edge is computed using linear Gaussian quadrature, and the tendency of prognostic values is obtained by summing all fluxes around the cell. This shallow water dynamic core demonstrates outstanding performance in ideal shallow water test cases. In the steady-state geostrophic flow, the 11th order scheme reduces errors to nearly round-off error even on coarse grids (2 degrees). Furthermore, the Rossby-Haurwitz wave preserves its shape for over 90 days. To test the non-oscillation property, we designed a cylinder dam break case. The WENO approach effectively suppresses non-physical oscillation, and the genuine two-dimensional reconstruction exhibits significantly better isotropy than the dimension-by-dimension scheme.</description>
