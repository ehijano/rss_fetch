      <title>On the Role of Reflectarrays for Interplanetary Links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interplanetary links (IPL) serve as crucial enablers for space exploration, facilitating secure and adaptable space missions. An integrated IPL with inter-satellite communication (IP-ISL) establishes a unified deep space network, expanding coverage and reducing atmospheric losses. The challenges, including irregularities in charged density, hardware impairments, and hidden celestial body brightness are analyzed with a reflectarray-based IP-ISL between Earth and Moon orbiters. It is observed that $10^{-8}$ order severe hardware impairments with intense solar plasma density drops an ideal system's spectral efficiency (SE) from $\sim\!38~\textrm{(bit/s)/Hz}$ down to $0~\textrm{(bit/s)/Hz}$. An ideal full angle of arrival fluctuation recovery with full steering range achieves $\sim\!20~\textrm{(bit/s)/Hz}$ gain and a limited beamsteering with a numerical reflectarray design achieves at least $\sim\!1~\textrm{(bit/s)/Hz}$ gain in severe hardware impairment cases.</description>

      <title>Solar Radio Bursts and Space Weather</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Space Weather is the study of the conditions in the solar wind that can affect life on the surface of the Earth, particularly the increasingly technologically sophisticated devices that are part of modern life. Solar radio observations are relevant to such phenomena because they generally originate as events in the solar atmosphere, including flares, coronal mass ejections and shocks, that produce electromagnetic and particle radiations that impact the Earth. Low frequency solar radio emission arises in the solar atmosphere at the levels where these events occur: we can use frequency as a direct measure of density, and an indirect measure of height, in the atmosphere. The main radio burst types are described and illustrated using data from the Green Bank Solar Radio Burst Spectrometer, and their potential use as diagnostics of Space Weather is discussed.</description>

      <title>LLMSat: A Large Language Model-Based Goal-Oriented Agent for Autonomous Space Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As spacecraft journey further from Earth with more complex missions, systems of greater autonomy and onboard intelligence are called for. Reducing reliance on human-based mission control becomes increasingly critical if we are to increase our rate of solar-system-wide exploration. Recent work has explored AI-based goal-oriented systems to increase the level of autonomy in mission execution. These systems make use of symbolic reasoning managers to make inferences from the state of a spacecraft and a handcrafted knowledge base, enabling autonomous generation of tasks and re-planning. Such systems have proven to be successful in controlled cases, but they are difficult to implement as they require human-crafted ontological models to allow the spacecraft to understand the world. Reinforcement learning has been applied to train robotic agents to pursue a goal. A new architecture for autonomy is called for. This work explores the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) as the high-level control system of a spacecraft. Using a systems engineering approach, this work presents the design and development of an agentic spacecraft controller by leveraging an LLM as a reasoning engine, to evaluate the utility of such an architecture in achieving higher levels of spacecraft autonomy. A series of deep space mission scenarios simulated within the popular game engine Kerbal Space Program (KSP) are used as case studies to evaluate the implementation against the requirements. It is shown the reasoning and planning abilities of present-day LLMs do not scale well as the complexity of a mission increases, but this can be alleviated with adequate prompting frameworks and strategic selection of the agent's level of authority over the host spacecraft. This research evaluates the potential of LLMs in augmenting autonomous decision-making systems for future robotic space applications.</description>

      <title>Effects of wave damping and finite perpendicular scale on three-dimensional Alfven wave parametric decay in low-beta plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08179v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Shear Alfven wave parametric decay instability (PDI) provides a potential path toward significant wave dissipation and plasma heating. However, fundamental questions regarding how PDI is excited in a realistic three-dimensional (3D) open system and how critically the finite perpendicular wave scale--as found in both laboratory and space plasmas--affects the excitation remain poorly understood. Here, we present the first 3D, open-boundary, hybrid kinetic-fluid simulations of kinetic Alfven wave PDI in low-beta plasmas. Key findings are that the PDI excitation is strongly limited by the wave damping present, including electron-ion collisional damping (represented by a constant resistivity) and geometrical attenuation associated with the finite-scale Alfven wave, and ion Landau damping of the child acoustic wave. The perpendicular wave scale alone, however, plays no discernible role: waves of different perpendicular scales exhibit similar instability growth as long as the magnitude of the parallel ponderomotive force remains unchanged. These findings are corroborated by theoretical analysis and estimates. The new understanding of 3D kinetic Alfv\'en wave PDI physics is essential for laboratory study of the basic plasma process and may also help evaluate the relevance/role of PDI in low-beta space plasmas.</description>
