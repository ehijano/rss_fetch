      <title>Variability in Footpoint Mapping of BBFs Using Tsyganenko Models: Impact on Swarm Conjunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetospheric-ionospheric coupling studies often rely on multi-spacecraft conjunctions, which require accurate magnetic field mapping tools. For example, linking measurements from the magnetotail with those in the ionosphere involves determining when the orbital magnetic footpoint of THEMIS or MMS intersects with the footpoint of Swarm. One of the most commonly used tools for tracing magnetic field lines are the Tsyganenko models. In this study, we aim to analyze how the footpoint locations are impacted by the inputs parameters of these models, including solar wind conditions, geomagnetic activity, and the location in the magnetotail. A dataset of 2394 bursty bulk flows (BBFs) detected by MMS was mapped to Earth's ionosphere with four different Tsyganenko models. The MLT position showed a variability of approximately +/-1 MLT across the models. Footpoint locations were linked to the dawn-dusk position of the BBFs, with differences between models associated with variations in the interplanetary magnetic field clock angle. The MLAT values exhibited greater variability of approximately +/-2{\deg} around the mean value, with a systematic shift toward higher latitudes observed in two of the four models. This position is also influenced by the the input parameter of the model representing the dynamics of Earth's magnetosphere, with larger values corresponding to lower latitudes. The uncertainty on the footpoint location impacts the number of conjunctions. Generally, Swarm B exhibited more conjunctions than Swarm A or C in the northern hemisphere, and less than half of these conjunctions had Tsyganenko footpoint distances below the typical BBF footprint size in the ionosphere.</description>

      <title>Temperature anisotropy instabilities driven by intermittent velocity shears in the solar wind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Where and under what conditions the transfer of energy between electromagnetic fields and particles takes place in the solar wind remains an open question. We investigate the conditions that promote the growth of kinetic instabilities predicted by linear theory, to infer how turbulence and temperature-anisotropy-driven instabilities are interrelated. Using a large dataset from Solar Orbiter, we introduce the radial rate of strain, a novel measure computed from single-spacecraft data, that we interpret as a proxy for the double-adiabatic strain rate. The solar wind exhibits high absolute values of the radial rate of strain at locations with large temperature anisotropy. We measure the kurtosis and skewness of the radial rate of strain from the statistical moments to show that it is non-Gaussian for unstable intervals and increasingly intermittent at smaller scales with a power-law scaling. We conclude that the velocity field fluctuations in the solar wind contribute to the presence of temperature anisotropy sufficient to create potentially unstable conditions.</description>

      <title>Self-organization in collisionless, high-$\beta$ turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02418v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The MHD equations, as a collisional fluid model that remains in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE), have long been used to describe turbulence in myriad space and astrophysical plasmas. Yet, the vast majority of these plasmas, from the solar wind to the intracluster medium (ICM) of galaxy clusters, are only weakly collisional at best, meaning that significant deviations from LTE are not only possible but common. Recent studies have demonstrated that the kinetic physics inherent to this weakly collisional regime can fundamentally transform the evolution of such plasmas across a wide range of scales. Here we explore the consequences of pressure anisotropy and Larmor-scale instabilities for collisionless, $\beta \gg 1$ turbulence, focusing on the role of a self-organizational effect known as `magneto-immutability'. We describe this self-organization analytically through a high-$\beta$, reduced ordering of the CGL-MHD equations, finding that it is a robust inertial-range effect that dynamically suppresses magnetic-field-strength fluctuations, anisotropic-pressure stresses, and dissipation due to heat fluxes. As a result, the turbulent cascade of Alfv\'enic fluctuations continues below the putative viscous scale to form a robust, nearly conservative, MHD-like inertial range. These findings are confirmed numerically via Landau-fluid CGL-MHD turbulence simulations that employ a collisional closure to mimic the effects of microinstabilities. We find that microinstabilities occupy a small ($\sim 5\%$) volume-filling fraction of the plasma, even when the pressure anisotropy is driven strongly towards its instability thresholds. We discuss these results in the context of recent predictions for ion-versus-electron heating in low-luminosity accretion flows and observations implying suppressed viscosity in ICM turbulence.</description>
