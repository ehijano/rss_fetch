      <title>Long-time accuracy of ensemble Kalman filters for chaotic and machine-learned dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Filtering is concerned with online estimation of the state of a dynamical system from partial and noisy observations. In applications where the state is high dimensional, ensemble Kalman filters are often the method of choice. This paper establishes long-time accuracy of ensemble Kalman filters. We introduce conditions on the dynamics and the observations under which the estimation error remains small in the long-time horizon. Our theory covers a wide class of partially-observed chaotic dynamical systems, which includes the Navier-Stokes equations and Lorenz models. In addition, we prove long-time accuracy of ensemble Kalman filters with surrogate dynamics, thus validating the use of machine-learned forecast models in ensemble data assimilation.</description>

      <title>Transition Matrix without Continuation in the Conley Index Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a one-parameter family of flows over a parameter interval $\Lambda$, assuming there is a continuation of Morse decompositions over $\Lambda$, Reineck defined a singular transition matrix to show the existence of a connection orbit between some Morse sets at some parameter points in $\Lambda$. This paper aims to extend the definition of a singular transition matrix in cases where there is no continuation of Morse decompositions over the parameter interval. This extension will help study the bifurcation associated with the change of Morse decomposition from a topological dynamics viewpoint.</description>

      <title>Concave-convex nonautonomous scalar ordinary differential equations: from bifurcation theory to critical transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A mathematical modeling process for phenomena with a single state variable that attempts to be realistic must be given by a scalar nonautonomous differential equation $x'=f(t,x)$ that is concave with respect to the state variable $x$ in some regions of its domain and convex in the complementary zones. This article takes the first step towards developing a theory to describe the corresponding dynamics: the case in which $f$ is concave on the region $x\ge b(t)$ and convex on $x\le b(t)$, where $b$ is a $C^1$ map, is considered. The different long-term dynamics that may appear are analyzed while describing the bifurcation diagram for $x'=f(t,x)+\lambda$. The results are used to establish conditions on a concave-convex map $h$ and a nonnegative map $k$ ensuring the existence of a value $\rho_0$ giving rise to the unique critical transition for the parametric family of equations $x'=h(t,x)-\rho\,k(t,x)$, which is assumed to approach $x'=h(t,x)$ as time decreases, but for which no conditions are assumed on the future dynamics. The developed theory is justified by showing that concave-convex models fit correctly some laboratory experimental data, and applied to describe a population dynamics model for which a large enough increase on the peak of a temporary higher predation causes extinction.</description>

      <title>A Two-Dimensional Map of Arbitrary Period</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a two-dimensional discrete-time dynamical system which represents the evolution of an angle and angular velocity. While the angle evolves by a fixed amount in every step, the evolution of the angular velocity is governed by a nonlinear map. We study the periodicity and stability of solutions to the system for a range of parameter values and initial conditions. The coupled system is shown to be periodic for certain parameter choices and initial conditions. In the limit, when the change in the angle tends to zero, the map is equivalent to the dynamics of a simple pendulum. Based on the integral of motion of the pendulum, an approximate invariant for the system is obtained. Simulations showing the behavior of the system for different parameter values and initial conditions are presented.</description>

      <title>Computing the extinction path for epidemic models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In infectious disease modelling, the expected time from endemicity to extinction (of infection) may be analysed via WKB approximation, a method with origins in mathematical physics. The method is very general, but its uptake to date may have been limited by the practical difficulties of implementation. It is necessary to compute a trajectory of a (high dimensional) dynamical system, the `extinction path', and this trajectory is maximally sensitive to small perturbations, making numerical computation challenging. Our objective here is to make this methodology more accessible by presenting four computational algorithms, with associated Matlab code, together with discussion of various ways in which the algorithms may be tuned to achieve satisfactory convergence. We illustrate our methods using three standard infectious disease models. For each such model, we demonstrate that our algorithms are able to improve upon previously available results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply the Kosambi-Cartan-Chern theory to perform an extensive examination of Jacobi stability of geodesics around rotating black hole solutions to dynamical Chern-Simons gravity, a theory that introduces modifications to General Relativity via a scalar field non-minimally coupled to curvature scalars. We present a comparative study between Jacobi and Liapunov stability, pointing out the advantages of the more geometrical method over the usual Liapunov approach.</description>

      <title>Rigidity of the hyperbolic marked energy spectrum and entropy for $k$-surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Labourie raised the question of determining the possible asymptotics for the growth rate of compact $k$-surfaces, counted according to energy, in negatively curved $3$-manifolds, indicating the possibility of a theory of thermodynamical formalism for this class of surfaces. Motivated by this question and by analogous results for the geodesic flow, we prove a number of results concerning the asymptotic behavior of high energy $k$-surfaces, especially in relation to the curvature of the ambient space.
  First, we determine a rigid upper bound for the growth rate of quasi-Fuchsian $k$-surfaces, counted according to energy, and with asymptotically round limit set, subject to a lower bound on the sectional curvature of the ambient space. We also study the marked energy spectrum for $k$-surfaces, proving a number of domination and rigidity theorems in this context. Finally, we show that the marked area and energy spectra for $k$-surfaces in $3$-dimensional manifolds of negative curvature are asymptotic if and only if the sectional curvature is constant.</description>

      <title>Short-term wind forecasting via surface pressure measurements: stochastic modeling and sensor placement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a short-term wind forecasting framework for predicting real-time variations in atmospheric turbulence based on nacelle-mounted anemometer and ground-level air-pressure measurements. Our approach combines linear stochastic estimation and Kalman filtering algorithms to assimilate and process real-time field measurements with the predictions of a stochastic reduced-order model that is confined to a two-dimensional plane at the hub height of turbines. We bridge the vertical gap between the computational plane of the model at hub height and the measurement plane on the ground using a projection technique that allows us to infer the pressure in one plane from the other. Depending on the quality of this inference, we show that customized variants of the extended and ensemble Kalman filters can be tuned to balance estimation quality and computational speed 1-1.5 diameters ahead and behind leading turbines. In particular, we show how synchronizing the sign of estimates with that of velocity fluctuations recorded at the nacelle can significantly improve the ability to follow temporal variations upwind of the leading turbine. We also propose a convex optimization-based framework for selecting a subset of pressure sensors that achieve a desired level of accuracy relative to the optimal Kalman filter that uses all sensing capabilities.</description>

      <title>Diffusion and Discrete Temporal Models of the Growth of Free-Ranging Cats in Urban Areas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The survival of the domestic cat (Felis catus) in various ecosystems has become increasingly relevant due to its impact on wildlife, public health, and society. In countries like Mexico, social factors such as abandonment have led to the feralization of the species and an unexpected increase in its population in urban areas. To design and implement effective population control methods, a thorough analysis of the species' population dynamics, along with the social factors influencing it, is necessary. We propose a reaction-diffusion model to simulate the natural dispersal of the population within a bounded domain. After exploring the species' spreading ability, we construct a complex dynamical system based on the biological characteristics of cats and their intraspecific and interspecific interactions, which we explain and study in detail. Both deterministic and stochastic parameters are considered to enhance the realism of the simulations. Our results indicate that the population reaches equilibrium, highlighting the need for control methods combined with social regulations to achieve sustainability in the system.</description>

      <title>Towards a mathematical framework for modelling cell fate dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An adult human body is made up of some 30 to 40 trillion cells, all of which stem from a single fertilized egg cell. The process by which the right cells appear to arrive in their right numbers at the right time at the right place -- development -- is only understood in the roughest of outlines. This process does not happen in isolation: the egg, the embryo, the developing foetus, and the adult organism all interact intricately with their changing environments. Conceptual and, increasingly, mathematical approaches to modelling development have centred around Waddington's concept of an epigenetic landscape. This perspective enables us to talk about the molecular and cellular factors that contribute to cells reaching their terminally differentiated state: their fate. The landscape metaphor is however only a simplification of the complex process of development; it for instance does not consider environmental influences, a context which we argue needs to be explicitly taken into account and from the outset. When delving into the literature, it also quickly becomes clear that there is a lack of consistency and agreement on even fundamental concepts; for example, the precise meaning of what we refer to when talking about a `cell type' or `cell state.' Here we engage with previous theoretical and mathematical approaches to modelling cell fate -- focused on trees, networks, and landscape descriptions -- and argue that they require a level of simplification that can be problematic. We introduce random dynamical systems as one natural alternative. These provide a flexible conceptual and mathematical framework that is free of extraneous assumptions. We develop some of the basic concepts and discuss them in relation to now `classical' depictions of cell fate dynamics, in particular Waddington's landscape.</description>

      <title>Undecidability in the Ramsey theory of polynomial equations and Hilbert's tenth problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that several sets of interest arising from the study of partition regularity and density Ramsey theory of polynomial equations over integral domains are undecidable. In particular, we show that the set of homogeneous polynomials $p \in \mathbb{Z}[x_1,\cdots,x_n]$ for which the equation $p(x_1,\cdots,x_n) = 0$ is partition regular over $\mathbb{Z}\setminus\{0\}$ is undecidable conditional on Hilbert's tenth problem for $\mathbb{Q}$. For other integral domains, we get the analogous result unconditionally. More generally, we determine the exact lightface complexity of the various sets of interest. For example, we show that the set of homogeneous polynomials $p \in \mathbb{F}_q(t)[x_1,\cdots,x_n]$ for which the equation $p(x_1,\cdots,x_n) = 0$ is partition regular over $\mathbb{F}_q(t)\setminus\{0\}$ is $\Pi_2^0$-complete.
  We also prove several other results of independent interest. These include a compactness principle and a uniformity principle for density Ramsey theory on countable cancellative left amenable semigroups, as well as the existence of the natural extension for measure preserving systems of countable cancellative left reversible semigroups.</description>

      <title>Metastability in the stochastic nearest-neighbor Kuramoto model of coupled phase oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Kuramoto model (KM) of $n$ coupled phase-oscillators is analyzed in this work. The KM on a Cayley graph possesses a family of steady state solutions called twisted states. Topologically distinct twisted states are distinguished by the winding number $q\in\mathbb{Z}$. These states are known to be stable for small enough $q$. In the presence of small noise, the KM exhibits metastable transitions between $q$-twisted states: A typical trajectory remains in the basin of attraction of a given $q$-twisted state for an exponentially long time, but eventually transitions to the vicinity of another such state. In the course of this transition, it passes in close proximity of a saddle of Morse index $1$, called a relevant saddle. In this work, we provide an exhaustive analysis of metastable transitions in the stochastic KM with nearest-neighbor coupling. We start by analyzing the equilibria and their stability. First, we identify all equilibria in this model. Using the discrete Fourier transform and eigenvalue estimates for rank-1 perturbations of symmetric matrices, we classify the equilibria by their Morse indices. In particular, we identify all stable equilibria and all relevant saddles involved in the metastable transitions. Further, we use Freidlin-Wentzell theory and the potential-theoretic approach to metastability to establish the metastable hierarchy and sharp estimates of Eyring-Kramers type for the transition times. The former determines the precise order, in which the metastable transitions occur, while the latter characterizes the times between successive transitions. The theoretical estimates are complemented by numerical simulations and a careful numerical verification of the transition times. Finally, we discuss the implications of this work for the KM with other coupling types including nonlocal coupling and the continuum limit as $n$ tends to infinity.</description>

Abstract: Recently, the authors have proved the finiteness of common zeros of two iterated rational maps under some compositional independence assumptions. In this article, we advance towards a question of Hsia and Tucker on a Zariski non-density of common zeros of iterated morphisms on a variety. More precisely, we provide an affirmative answer in the case of H\'{e}non type maps on $\mathbb{A}^2$, endomorphisms on $(\mathbb{P}^1)^n$, and polynomial skew products on $\mathbb{A}^2$ defined over $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$. As a by-product, we prove a Tits' alternative analogy for semigroups generated by two regular polynomial skew products.</description>

Abstract: Zero-one biochemical reaction networks play key roles in cell signalling such as signalling pathways regulated by protein phosphorylation. Multistability of reaction networks is a crucial dynamics feature enabling decision-making in cells. It is well known that multistability can be lifted from a "subnetwork" (a network with less species and fewer reactions) to large networks. So, we aim to explore the multistability problem of small zero-one networks. In this work, we prove the following main results: 1. any zero-one network with a one-dimensional stoichiometric subspace admits at most one positive steady state (it must be stable), and all the one-dimensional zero-one networks can be classified according to if they indeed admit a stable positive steady state or not; 2. any two-dimensional zero-one network with up to three species either admits only degenerate positive steady states, or admits at most one positive steady state (it must be stable); 3. the smallest zero-one networks (here, by "smallest", we mean these networks contain species as few as possible) that admit nondegenerate multistationarity/multistability contain three species and five/six reactions, and they are three dimensional. In these proofs, we use the theorems based on the Brouwer degree theory and the theory of real algebraic geometry. Moreover, applying the tools of computational real algebraic geometry, we provide a systematical way for detecting the networks that admit nondegenerate multistationarity/multistability.</description>

      <title>Mathematical modelling of the vitamin C clock reaction: a study of two kinetic regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04108v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chemically reacting systems exhibiting a repeatable delay period before a visible and sudden change are referred to as clock reactions; they have a long history in education and provide an idealisation of various biochemical and industrial processes. We focus on a purely substrate-depletive clock reaction utilising vitamin C, hydrogen peroxide, iodine and starch. Building on a recent study of a simplified two-reaction model under high hydrogen peroxide concentrations, we develop a more detailed model which breaks the slow reaction into two steps, one of which is rate-limiting unless hydrogen peroxide levels are very high. Through asymptotic analysis, this model enables the effect of hydrogen peroxide concentration to be elucidated in a principled way, resolving an apparent discrepancy with earlier literature regarding the order of the slow reaction kinetics. The model is analysed in moderate- and high-hydrogen peroxide regimes, providing approximate solutions and expressions for the switchover time which take into account hydrogen peroxide concentration. The solutions are validated through simultaneously fitting the same set of parameters to several experimental series, then testing on independent experiments across widely varying hydrogen peroxide concentration. The study thereby presents and further develops a validated mechanistic understanding of a paradigm chemical kinetics system.</description>

      <title>Katok's entropy conjecture near real and complex hyperbolic metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11197v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that, given a real or complex hyperbolic metric $g_0$ on a closed manifold $M$ of dimension $n\geq 3$, there exists a neighborhood $\mathcal U$ of $g_0$ in the space of negatively curved metrics such that for any $g\in \mathcal U$, the topological entropy and Liouville entropy of $g$ coincide if and only if $g$ and $g_0$ are homothetic. This provides a partial answer to Katok's entropy rigidity conjecture. As a direct consequence of our theorem, we obtain a local rigidity result for the hyperbolic rank and for metrics with $C^2$ Anosov foliations near complex hyperbolic metrics.</description>

      <title>Effective density of surfaces near Teichm\"{u}ller curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03560v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of $SL_{2}(\mathbb{R})$ on the stratum of translation surfaces $\mathcal{H}(2)$. Especially, we obtain effective density theorems on $\mathcal{H}(2)$ for orbits of the upper triangular subgroup $P$ of $SL_{2}(\mathbb{R})$ with the based surfaces near a small Teichm\"{u}ller curve.
  The proof is based on the use of McMullen's classification theorem, together with the effective equidistribution theorems in homogeneous dynamics. In particular, we compare the $P$-orbit of a surface, and the $P$-orbit of its absolute periods using the Lindenstrauss-Mohammadi-Wang's effective equidistribution theorem.</description>

      <title>On the metric mean dimensions of saturated sets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09218v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Saturated set and its reduced case, the set of generic points, constitute two significant types of fractal-like sets in multifractal analysis of dynamical systems. In the context of infinite entropy systems, this paper aims to give some qualitative aspects of saturated sets and the set of generic points in both topological and measure-theoretic perspectives. For systems with specification property, we establish the certain variational principles for saturated sets in terms of Bowen and packing metric mean dimensions, and show the upper capacity metric mean dimension of saturated sets have full metric mean dimension. All results are useful for understanding the topological structures of dynamical systems with infinite topological entropy.
  As applications, we further exhibit some qualitative aspects of metric mean dimensions of level sets and the set of mean Li-Yorke pairs in infinite entropy systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum three-rotor problem in the identity representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15482v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum three-rotor problem concerns the dynamics of 3 equally massive particles moving on a circle subject to pairwise attractive cosine potentials and can model coupled Josephson junctions. Classically, it displays order-chaos-order behavior with increasing energy. The quantum system admits a dimensionless coupling with semiclassical behavior at strong coupling. We study stationary states with periodic `relative' wave functions. Perturbative and harmonic approximations capture the spectrum at weak coupling and that of low-lying states at strong coupling. More generally, the cumulative distribution of energy levels obtained by numerical diagonalization is well-described by a Weyl-like semiclassical estimate. However, the system has an $S_3 \times Z_2$ symmetry that is obscured when working with relative angles. By exploiting a basis for invariant states, we obtain the spectrum restricted to the identity representation. To uncover universal quantum hallmarks of chaos, we partition the spectrum into energy windows where the classical motion is regular, mixed or chaotic and unfold each separately. At strong coupling, we find striking signatures of transitions between regularity and chaos: spacing distributions morph from Poisson to Wigner-Dyson while the number variance shifts from linear to logarithmic behavior at small lengths. Some nonuniversal features are also examined. For instance, for strong coupling, the number variance saturates and oscillates at large lengths while the spectral form factor displays a nonuniversal peak at short times. Moreover, deviations from Poisson spacings at asymptotically low and high energies are well-explained by quantum harmonic and free-rotor spectra projected to the identity representation at strong and weak coupling. Interestingly, the degeneracy of free-rotor levels admits an elegant formula that we deduce using properties of Eisenstein primes.</description>

      <title>Learning Deep Dissipative Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11479v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study challenges strictly guaranteeing ``dissipativity'' of a dynamical system represented by neural networks learned from given time-series data. Dissipativity is a crucial indicator for dynamical systems that generalizes stability and input-output stability, known to be valid across various systems including robotics, biological systems, and molecular dynamics. By analytically proving the general solution to the nonlinear Kalman-Yakubovich-Popov (KYP) lemma, which is the necessary and sufficient condition for dissipativity, we propose a differentiable projection that transforms any dynamics represented by neural networks into dissipative ones and a learning method for the transformed dynamics. Utilizing the generality of dissipativity, our method strictly guarantee stability, input-output stability, and energy conservation of trained dynamical systems. Finally, we demonstrate the robustness of our method against out-of-domain input through applications to robotic arms and fluid dynamics.
