      <title>A New Route for the Determination of Protein Structure and Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding complex biological macromolecules, especially proteins, is vital for grasping their diverse chemical functions with direct impact in biology and pharmacology. While techniques like X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy have been valuable, they face limitations such as radiation damage and difficulties in crystallizing certain proteins. X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) offer promising solutions with their ultrafast, high-intensity pulses, potentially enabling structural determination before radiation damage occurs. However, challenges like low signal-to-noise ratio persist, particularly for single protein molecules. To address this, we propose a new method involving engineered protein scaffolds to create ordered arrays of proteins with controlled orientations, aiming at enhancing the signal at the detector. This innovative strategy has the potential to address signal limitations and protein crystallization issues, opening avenues for determining protein structures under physiological conditions. Moreover, it holds promise for studying conformational changes resulting from photo-induced changes, protein-drug and/or protein-protein interactions. Indeed, the prediction of protein-protein interactions, fundamental to numerous biochemical and cellular processes, and the time-dependent conformational changes they undergo, continue to pose a considerable challenge in biology and biochemistry.</description>

      <title>WiNNbeta: Batch and drift correction method by white noise normalization for metabolomic studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We developed a method called batch and drift correction method by White Noise Normalization (WiNNbeta) to correct individual metabolites for batch effects and drifts. This method tests for white noise properties to identify metabolites in need of correction and corrects them by using fine-tuned splines. To test the method performance we applied WiNNbeta to LC-MS data from our metabolomic studies and computed CVs before and after WiNNbeta correction in quality control samples.</description>
