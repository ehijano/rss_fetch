      <title>Numerical approximation of the stochastic heat equation with a distributional reaction term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the numerical approximation of the stochastic heat equation with a distributional reaction term. Under a condition on the Besov regularity of the reaction term, it was proven recently that a strong solution exists and is unique in the pathwise sense, in a class of H\"older continuous processes. For a suitable choice of sequence $(b^k)_{k\in \mathbb{N}}$ approximating $b$, we prove that the error between the solution $u$ of the SPDE with reaction term $b$ and its tamed Euler finite-difference scheme with mollified drift $b^k$, converges to $0$ in $L^m(\Omega)$ with a rate that depends on the Besov regularity of $b$. In particular, one can consider two interesting cases: first, even when $b$ is only a (finite) measure, a rate of convergence is obtained. On the other hand, when $b$ is a bounded measurable function, the (almost) optimal rate of convergence $(\frac{1}{2}-\varepsilon)$-in space and $(\frac{1}{4}-\varepsilon)$-in time is achieved. Stochastic sewing techniques are used in the proofs, in particular to deduce new regularising properties of the discrete Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process.</description>

      <title>The mean field stubborn voter model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse the effect of a fat-tailed waiting time distribution in the voter model on the complete graph with $N$ vertices. Our main result is the existence of a limiting infinite voter model on the slowest updating sites. We further derive explicitly the consensus probabilities in the limit model. To obtain these results, we study properties of the coalescing system of random walks that forms the dual of the limit voter model and prove, among other auxiliary statements, that the limit models comes down from infinity.</description>

      <title>A generic approach to homogenization of a diffusion driven by growing incompressible drift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study how the resolvent-family of a diffusion behaves, as thedrift grows to infinity. The limit turns out to be a selfadjoint pseudo-resolvent.After reduction of the underlying Hilbert-space, this pseudo-resolvent becomesa resolvent to a strongly continuous semi-group of contractions. We prove thatthis semi-group is associated to some Hunt-process on some suitable state-space which is constructed from equivalence classes of the drifts trajectories.Finally, we show a distributional limit theorem for the accelerated diffusiontoward the associated Hunt process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are interested in the discretization of stable driven SDEs with additive noise for $\alpha$ $\in$ (1, 2) and Lq -- Lp drift under the Serrin type condition $\alpha$/q + d/p &lt; $\alpha$ -- 1. We show weak existence and uniqueness as well as heat kernel estimates for the SDE and obtain a convergence rate of order (1/$\alpha$)*($\alpha$ -- 1 -- $\alpha$/q - d/p) for the difference of the densities for the Euler scheme approximation involving suitably cutoffed and time randomized drifts.</description>

      <title>Genetic contribution of an advantaged mutant in the biparental Moran model -- finite selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a population of N individuals, whose dynamics through time is represented by a biparental Moran model with two types: an advantaged type and a disadvantaged type. The advantage is due to a mutation, transmitted in a Mendelian way from parent to child that reduces the death probability of individuals carrying it. We assume that initially this mutation is carried by a proportion a of individuals in the population. Once the mutation is fixed, a gene is sampled uniformly in the population, at a locus independent of the locus under selection. We then give the probability that this gene initially comes from an advantaged individual, i.e. the genetic contribution of these individuals, as a function of a and when the population size is large.</description>

      <title>Metastable hierarchy in abstract low-temperature lattice models: an application to Kawasaki dynamics for Ising lattice gas with macrscopic number of particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article is divided into two parts. In the first part, we study the hierarchical phenomenon of metastability in low-temperature lattice models in the most general setting. Given an abstract dynamical system governed by a Hamiltonian function, we prove that there exists a hierarchical decomposition of the collection of stable plateaux in the system into multiple $\mathfrak{m}$ levels, such that at each level there exist tunneling metastable transitions between the stable plateaux, which can be characterized by convergence to a simple Markov chain as the inverse temperature $\beta$ tends to infinity. In the second part, as an application, we characterize the $3$-level metastable hierarchy in Kawasaki dynamics for Ising lattice gas with macroscopic number of particles. We prove that the ground states in this model are those in which the particles line up and form a one-dimensional strip, and identify the full structure relevant to the tunneling transitions between these ground states. In particular, the results differ from the previous work [5] in that the particles in the ground states are likely to form a strip rather than a square droplet. The main tool is the resolvent approach to metastability, recently developed in [24]. Along with the analysis, we present a theorem on the sharp asymptotics of the exit distribution from cycles, which to the author's knowledge is not known in the community and therefore may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Accuracy of the Graphon Mean Field Approximation for Interacting Particle Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a system of $N$ particles whose interactions are characterized by a (weighted) graph $G^N$. Each particle is a node of the graph with an internal state. The state changes according to Markovian dynamics that depend on the states and connection to other particles. We study the limiting properties, focusing on the dense graph regime, where the number of neighbors of a given node grows with $N$. We show that when $G^N$ converges to a graphon $G$, the behavior of the system converges to a deterministic limit, the graphon mean field approximation. We obtain convergence rates depending on the system size $N$ and cut-norm distance between $G^N$ and $G$. We apply the results for two subcases: When $G^N$ is a discretization of the graph $G$ with individually weighted edges; when $G^N$ is a random graph obtained through edge sampling from the graphon $G$. In the case of weighted interactions, we obtain a bound of order $O(1/N)$. In the random graph case, the error is of order $O(\sqrt{\log(N)/N})$ with high probability. We illustrate the applicability of our results and the numerical efficiency of the approximation through two examples: a graph-based load-balancing model and a heterogeneous bike-sharing system.</description>

      <title>Near critical asymptotics in the Frozen Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a variant of the classical Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph, where components with surplus are slowed down to prevent the apparition of complex components. The sizes of the components of this process undergo a similar phase transition to that of the classical model, and in the critical window the scaling limit of the sizes of the components is a "frozen" version of Aldous' multiplicative coalescent [2]. The aim of this article is to describe the long time asymptotics in the critical window for the total number of vertices which belong to a component with surplus.</description>

      <title>Poisson approximation for cycles in the generalised random graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generalised random graph contains $n$ vertices with positive i.i.d. weights. The probability of adding an edge between two vertices is increasing in their weights. We require the weight distribution to have finite second moments and study the point process $\mathcal{C}_n$ on $\{3,4,\dots\}$, which counts how many cycles of the respective length are present in the graph. We establish convergence of $\mathcal{C}_n$ to a Poisson point process. Under the stronger assumption of the weights having finite fourth moments we provide the following results. When $\mathcal{C}_n$ is evaluated on a bounded set $A$, we provide a rate of convergence. If the graph is additionally subcritical, we extend this to unbounded sets $A$ at the cost of a slower rate of convergence. From this we deduce the limiting distribution of the length of the shortest and the longest cycle when the graph is subcritical, including rates of convergence. All mentioned results also apply to the Chung-Lu model and the Norros-Reittu model.</description>

      <title>Self-repellent Brownian Bridges in an Interacting Bose Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a model of $d$-dimensional interacting quantum Bose gas, expressed in terms of an ensemble of interacting Brownian bridges in a large box and undergoing the influence of all the interactions between the legs of each of the Brownian bridges. We study the thermodynamic limit of the system and give an explicit formula for the limiting free energy and a necessary and sufficient criterion for the occurrence of a condensation phase transition. For $d\geq 5$ and sufficiently small interaction, we prove that the condensate phase is not empty. The ideas of proof rely on the similarity of the interaction to that of the self-repellent random walk, and build on a lace expansion method conducive to treating {\it paths} undergoing mutual repellence within each bridge.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider collections of SDEs indexed by a graph. Each SDE is driven by an additive Gaussian noise and each drift term interacts with all other SDEs within the graph neighbourhood. We derive the fundamental martingale for a class of Gaussian processes and use this to prove a Girsanov type theorem. Further, we use this to construct a clique factorisation to prove that the law of the interacting SDEs forms a 2-Markov Random Field.</description>

      <title>Zero-Sum Games for piecewise deterministic Markov decision processes with risk-sensitive finite-horizon cost criterion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the two-person zero-sum stochastic games for piece-wise deterministic Markov decision processes with risk-sensitive finite-horizon cost criterion on a general state space. Here, the transition and cost/reward rates are allowed to be un-unbounded from below and above. Under some mild conditions, we show the existence of the value of the game and an optimal randomized Markov saddle-point equilibrium in the class of all admissible feedback strategies. By studying the corresponding risk-sensitive finite-horizon optimal differential equations out of a class of possibly unbounded functions, to which the extended Feynman-Kac formula is also justified to hold, we obtain our required results.</description>

      <title>An Optimal Multilevel Quorum System for Probabilistic Consensus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the notion of a multilevel, slashable quorum system, where an application can obtain gradual levels of assurance that a certain value is bound to be decided (or "finalized") in a global consensus procedure, unless a large number of Byzantine processes are exposed to slashing (that is, penalty on staked assets). Our construction is a highly parameterized generalization of quorum systems based on finite projective spaces, with asymptotic high availability and optimal slashing properties. In particular, we show that any quorum system whose ground elements are disjoint subsets of nodes (e.g. "commmittees" in committee-based consensus protocols) has asymptotic high availability under very reasonable conditions, a general proof with significance of its own. Under similarly relaxed conditions, we show that our construction has asymptotically optimal slashing properties with respect to message complexity and process load; this illustrates a fundamental trade off between message complexity, load, and slashing. Our multilevel construction allows nodes to decide how many "levels" of finalization assurance they wish to obtain, noting that this functionality, if applied to a proof-of-stake blockchain, can be seen either as (i) a form of an early, slashing-based, probabilistic block finalization; or (ii) a service for reorg tolerance.</description>

      <title>Linear Operator Approximate Message Passing (OpAMP)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a framework for approximate message passing (AMP) in dynamic settings where the data at each iteration is passed through a linear operator. This framework is motivated in part by applications in large-scale, distributed computing where only a subset of the data is available at each iteration. An autoregressive memory term is used to mitigate information loss across iterations and a specialized algorithm, called projection AMP, is designed for the case where each linear operator is an orthogonal projection. Precise theoretical guarantees are provided for a class of Gaussian matrices and non-separable denoising functions. Specifically, it is shown that the iterates can be well-approximated in the high-dimensional limit by a Gaussian process whose second-order statistics are defined recursively via state evolution. These results are applied to the problem of estimating a rank-one spike corrupted by additive Gaussian noise using partial row updates, and the theory is validated by numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Mahler's problem and Turyn polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mahler's problem asks for the largest possible value of the Mahler measure, normalized by the $L_2$ norm, of a polynomial with $\pm1$ coefficients and large degree. We establish a new record value in this problem exceeding $0.95$ by analyzing certain Turyn polynomials, which are defined by cyclically shifting the coefficients of a Fekete polynomial by a prescribed amount. It was recently established that the distribution of values over the unit circle of Fekete polynomials of large degree is effectively modeled by a particular random point process. We extend this analysis to the Turyn polynomials, and determine expressions for the asymptotic normalized Mahler measure of these polynomials, as well as for their normalized $L_q$ norms. We also describe a number of calculations on the corresponding random processes, which indicate that the Turyn polynomials where the shift is approximately $1/4$ of the length have Mahler measure exceeding $95\%$ of their $L_2$ norm. Further, we show that these asymptotic values are not disturbed by a small change to make polynomials having entirely $\pm1$ coefficients, which establishes the result on Mahler's problem.</description>

Abstract: Information measures can be constructed from R\'enyi divergences much like mutual information from Kullback-Leibler divergence. One such information measure is known as Sibson's $\alpha$-mutual information and has received renewed attention recently in several contexts: concentration of measure under dependence, statistical learning, hypothesis testing, and estimation theory. In this paper, we survey and extend the state of the art. In particular, we introduce variational representations for Sibson's $\alpha$-mutual information and employ them in each of the contexts just described to derive novel results. Namely, we produce generalized Transportation-Cost inequalities and Fano-type inequalities. We also present an overview of known applications, spanning from learning theory and Bayesian risk to universal prediction.</description>

      <title>Group Dispersal Modelling revisited</title>

Abstract: In this paper we revisit the notion of grouped dispersal that have been introduced by Soubeyrand and co-authors \cite{soubeyrand2011patchy} to model the simultaneous (and hence dependent) dispersal  of several propagules from a single source  in a homogeneous  environment. We built a time continuous  measure valued process that takes into account the main feature of a grouped dispersal and derive its infinitesimal generator. To cope with the mutligeneration aspect associated to the demography we introduce  two types of propagules in the description of  the population which is one of  the main innovations here.  We also provide a rigorous description of the process and its generator. We derive  as well, some large population asymptotics of the process unveilling the  degenerate ultra parabolic system of PDE satisfied by the density of population. Finally, we also show that such a PDE system has a non-trivial solution which is unique in a certain functional space.</description>

      <title>Gaussian measure on the dual of $\mathrm{U}(N)$, random partitions, and topological expansion of the partition function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a Gaussian measure with parameter $q\in(0,1)$ on the dual of the unitary group of size $N$: we prove that a random highest weight under this measure is the coupling of two independent $q$-uniform random partitions $\alpha,\beta$ and a random highest weight of $\mathrm{U}(1)$. We prove deviation inequalities for the $q$-uniform measure, and use them to show that the coupling of random partitions under the Gaussian measure vanishes in the limit $N\to\infty$. We also prove that the partition function of this measure admits an asymptotic expansion in powers of $1/N$, and that this expansion is topological, in the sense that its coefficients are related to the enumeration of ramified coverings of elliptic curves. It provides a rigorous proof of the gauge/string duality for the Yang-Mills theory on a 2D torus with gauge group $\mathrm{U}(N),$ advocated by Gross and Taylor \cite{GT,GT2}.</description>

      <title>Faster algorithms for the alignment of sparse correlated Erd\"os-R\'enyi random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The correlated Erd\"os-R\'enyi random graph ensemble is a probability law on pairs of graphs with $n$ vertices, parametrized by their average degree $\lambda$ and their correlation coefficient $s$. It can be used as a benchmark for the graph alignment problem, in which the labels of the vertices of one of the graphs are reshuffled by an unknown permutation; the goal is to infer this permutation and thus properly match the pairs of vertices in both graphs. A series of recent works has unveiled the role of Otter's constant $\alpha$ (that controls the exponential rate of growth of the number of unlabeled rooted trees as a function of their sizes) in this problem: for $s&gt;\sqrt{\alpha}$ and $\lambda$ large enough it is possible to recover in a time polynomial in $n$ a positive fraction of the hidden permutation. The exponent of this polynomial growth is however quite large and depends on the other parameters, which limits the range of applications of the algorithm. In this work we present a family of faster algorithms for this task, show through numerical simulations that their accuracy is only slightly reduced with respect to the original one, and conjecture that they undergo, in the large $\lambda$ limit, phase transitions at modified Otter's thresholds $\sqrt{\widehat{\alpha}}&gt;\sqrt{\alpha}$, with $\widehat{\alpha}$ related to the enumeration of a restricted family of trees.</description>

      <title>How forest insect outbreaks depend on forest size and tree distribution: an individual-based model results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, an individual-based model of forest insect outbreaks is presented. The results obtained show that the outbreak is an emerging feature of the system. It is a common product of the characteristics of insects, the environment in which the insects live, and the way insects behave in it. The outbreak dynamics is an effect of scale. In a sufficiently large forest regardless of the density of trees and their spatial distribution, provided that the range of insect dispersion is large enough, it develops in the form of an outbreak. In very small forests, the dynamics becomes more chaotic. It loses the outbreak character and, especially in the forest with random tree distribution, there is a possibility that the insect population goes extinct. The local dynamics of the number of insects on one tree in a forest, where the dynamics of all insects has the character of outbreak, is characterized by a rapid increase in number and then a rapid decrease until the extinction of the local population. It is the result of the influx of immigrants from neighboring trees. The type of tree distribution in the forest becomes visible when the density of trees becomes low and/or the range of insect dispersion is small. When trees are uniformly distributed and the range of insect dispersion is small, the system persists as a set of more or less isolated local populations. In the forest with randomly distributed trees, the insect population becomes more susceptible to extinction when the tree density and/or range of insect dispersion are small.</description>

Abstract: We obtain Sobolev regularity estimates for solutions of non-local parabolic equations with locally unbounded drift satisfying some minimal assumptions. These results yield Krylov bound for the corresponding Feller stable process as well as some a priori regularity estimates on solutions of McKean-Vlasov equations. A key element of our arguments is a parabolic operator norm inequality that we prove using some ideas of Adams and Krylov.</description>

      <title>Bounds on the Distribution of a Sum of Two Random Variables: Revisiting a problem of Kolmogorov with application to Individual Treatment Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the following problem, proposed by Kolmogorov: given prescribed marginal distributions $F$ and $G$ for random variables $X,Y$ respectively, characterize the set of compatible distribution functions for the sum $Z=X+Y$. Bounds on the distribution function for $Z$ were given by Markarov (1982), and Frank et al. (1987), the latter using copula theory. However, though they obtain the same bounds, they make different assertions concerning their sharpness. In addition, their solutions leave some open problems in the case when the given marginal distribution functions are discontinuous. These issues have led to some confusion and erroneous statements in subsequent literature, which we correct.
  Kolmogorov's problem is closely related to inferring possible distributions for individual treatment effects $Y_1 - Y_0$ given the marginal distributions of $Y_1$ and $Y_0$; the latter being identified from a randomized experiment. We use our new insights to sharpen and correct results due to Fan and Park (2010) concerning individual treatment effects, and to fill some other logical gaps.</description>

Abstract: We establish sufficient conditions for the existence, and derive explicit formulas for the $\kappa$'th moments, $\kappa \geq 1$, of Markov modulated generalized Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes as well as their stationary distributions. In particular, the running mean, the autocovariance function, and integer moments of the stationary distribution are derived in terms of the characteristics of the driving Markov additive process. Our derivations rely on new general results on moments of Markov additive processes and (multidimensional) integrals with respect to Markov additive processes.</description>

      <title>Edgeworth-type expansion for the one-point distribution of the KPZ fixed point with a large height at a prior location</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.04999v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) fixed point $\mathrm{H}(x,\tau)$ with the step initial condition and investigate the distribution of $\mathrm{H}(x,\tau)$ conditioned on a large height at an earlier space-time point $\mathrm{H}(x',\tau')$. As $\mathrm{H}(x',\tau')$ tends to infinity, we prove that the conditional one-point distribution of $\mathrm{H}(x,\tau)$ in the regime $\tau&gt;\tau'$ converges to the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE) Tracy-Widom distribution and the next two lower-order error terms can be expressed as derivatives of the GUE Tracy-Widom distribution, which is a conceptual analogue to the Edgeworth expansion in the central limit theorem. These KPZ-type limiting behaviors are different from the Gaussian-type ones obtained in \cite{Liu-Wang22} where they study the finite-dimensional distribution of $\mathrm{H}(x,\tau)$ conditioned on a large height at a later space-time point $\mathrm{H}(x',\tau')$. They show, with the step initial condition, that the conditional random field $\mathrm{H}(x,\tau)$ in the regime $\tau&lt;\tau'$ converges to the minimum of two independent Brownian bridges modified by linear drifts as $\mathrm{H}(x',\tau')$ goes to infinity. The two results stated above provide the phase diagram of the asymptotic behaviors of a conditional law of KPZ fixed point in the regimes $\tau&gt;\tau'$ and $\tau&lt;\tau'$ when $\mathrm{H}(x',\tau')$ goes to infinity.</description>

Abstract: The stochastic differential equation of McKean-Vlasov type is identified such that the Fokker-Planck equation associated to it is the Boltzmann equation. Hence, we call its solutions as Boltzmann processes. They describe the dynamics (in position and velocity) of particles expanding in vacuum in accordance with the Boltzmann equation. Given a solution $f:=$ $\{f(t,x,v\}_{0 \leq t \leq T} $ of the Boltzmann equation, the existence of solutions to the McKean-Vlasov SDE is established for the non-cutoff hard sphere case.</description>

Abstract: We consider branching processes describing structured, interacting populations in continuous time. Dynamics of each individuals characteristics and branching properties can be influenced by the entire population. We propose a Girsanov-type result based on a spinal construction, and establish a many-to-one formula. By combining this result with the spinal decomposition, we derive a generalized continuous-time version of the Kesten-Stigum theorem that incorporates interactions. Additionally, we propose an alternative approach of the spine construction for exact simulations of stochastic size-dependent populations.</description>

Abstract: Via constructing an asymptotic coupling by reflection, in this paper we establish uniform-in-time estimates on probability distances for mean-field type SDEs, where the drift terms under consideration are dissipative merely in the long distance. As applications, we (i) explore the long time probability distance estimate between an SDE and its delay version; (ii) investigate the issue on uniform-in-time propagation of chaos for McKean-Vlasov SDEs, where the drifts might be singular with respect to the spatial variables and need not to be of convolution type; (iii) tackle the discretization error bounds in an infinite-time horizon for stochastic algorithms (e.g. backward/tamed/adaptive Euler-Maruyama schemes as three typical candidates) associated with McKean-Vlasov SDEs.</description>

      <title>Small ball probability for multiple singular values of symmetric random matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04999v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $A_n$ be an $n\times n$ random symmetric matrix with $(A_{ij})_{i&lt; j}$ i.i.d. mean $0$, variance 1, following a subGaussian distribution and diagonal elements i.i.d. following a subGaussian distribution with a fixed variance. We investigate the joint small ball probability that $A_n$ has eigenvalues near two fixed locations $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$, where $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$ are sufficiently separated and in the bulk of the semicircle law. More precisely we prove that for a wide class of entry distributions of $A_{ij}$ that involve all Gaussian convolutions (where $\sigma_{min}(\cdot)$ denotes the least singular value of a square matrix), $$\mathbb{P}(\sigma_{min}(A_n-\lambda_1 I_n)\leq\delta_1n^{-1/2},\sigma_{min}(A_n-\lambda_2 I_n)\leq\delta_2n^{-1/2})\leq c\delta_1\delta_2+e^{-cn}.$$ The given estimate approximately factorizes as the product of the estimates for the two individual events, which is an indication of quantitative independence. The estimate readily generalizes to $d$ distinct locations. As an application, we upper bound the probability that there exist $d$ eigenvalues of $A_n$ asymptotically satisfying any fixed linear equation, which in particular gives a lower bound of the distance to this linear relation from any possible eigenvalue pair that holds with probability $1-o(1)$, and rules out the existence of two equal singular values in generic regions of the spectrum.</description>

      <title>Improved bounds for polylogarithmic graph distances in scale-free percolation and related models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07217v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study graph distances in the geometric random graph models scale-free percolation SFP, geometric inhomogeneous random graphs GIRG, and hyperbolic random graphs HRG. Despite the wide success of the models, the parameter regime in which graph distances are polylogarithmic is poorly understood. We provide new and improved lower bounds. In a certain portion of the parameter regime, those match the known upper bounds.
  Compared to the best previous lower bounds by Hao and Heydenreich, our result has several advantages: it gives matching bounds for a larger range of parameters, thus settling the question for a larger portion of the parameter space. It strictly improves the lower bounds by Hao and Heydenreich for all parameters settings in which those bounds were not tight. It gives tail bounds on the probability of having short paths, which imply shape theorems for the $k$-neighbourhood of a vertex whenever our lower bounds are tight, and tight bounds for the size of this $k$-neighbourhood. And last but not least, our proof is much simpler and not much longer than two pages, and we demonstrate that it generalizes well by showing that the same technique also works for first passage percolation.</description>

      <title>Zigzag path connects two Monte Carlo samplers: Hamiltonian counterpart to a piecewise deterministic Markov process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.07694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.07694v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Zigzag and other piecewise deterministic Markov process samplers have attracted significant interest for their non-reversibility and other appealing properties for Bayesian posterior computation. Hamiltonian Monte Carlo is another state-of-the-art sampler, exploiting fictitious momentum to guide Markov chains through complex target distributions. We establish an important connection between the zigzag sampler and a variant of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo based on Laplace-distributed momentum. The position and velocity component of the corresponding Hamiltonian dynamics travels along a zigzag path paralleling the Markovian zigzag process; however, the dynamics is non-Markovian in this position-velocity space as the momentum component encodes non-immediate pasts. This information is partially lost during a momentum refreshment step, in which we preserve its direction but re-sample magnitude. In the limit of increasingly frequent momentum refreshments, we prove that Hamiltonian zigzag converges strongly to its Markovian counterpart. This theoretical insight suggests that, when retaining full momentum information, Hamiltonian zigzag can better explore target distributions with highly correlated parameters by suppressing the diffusive behavior of Markovian zigzag. We corroborate this intuition by comparing performance of the two zigzag cousins on high-dimensional truncated multivariate Gaussians, including a 11,235-dimensional target arising from a Bayesian phylogenetic multivariate probit modeling of HIV virus data.</description>

Abstract: We establish an abstract, effective, exponential large deviations type estimate for Markov systems satisfying a weaker form of mixing. We employ this result to derive such estimates, as well as a central limit theorem, for the skew product encoding a random torus translation, a model we call a mixed random-quasiperiodic dynamical system. This abstract scheme is applicable to many other types of skew product dynamics, including systems for which the spectral gap property for the transition or the transfer operator does not hold.</description>

      <title>Extreme ATM skew in a local volatility model with discontinuity: joint density approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.10849v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper concerns a local volatility model in which volatility takes two possible values, and the specific value depends on whether the underlying price is above or below a given threshold value. The model is known, and a number of results have been obtained for it. In particular, a power law behaviour of the implied volatility skew has been established in the case when the threshold is taken at the money. This result as well as some others have been obtained by techniques based on the Laplace transform. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate how to obtain similar results by another method. The proposed alternative approach is based on the natural relationship of the model with Skew Brownian motion and consists of the systematic use of the joint distribution of this stochastic process and some of its functionals.</description>

Abstract: This article analyzes and compares two general techniques of rare event simulation for generating paths of Markov processes over fixed time horizons: exponential tilting and stochastic bridge. These two methods allow to accurately compute the probability that a Markov process ends within a rare region, which is unlikely to be attained. Exponential tilting is a general technique for obtaining an alternative or tilted sampling probability measure, under which the Markov process becomes likely to hit the rare region at terminal time. The stochastic bridge technique involves conditioning paths towards two endpoints: the terminal point and the initial one. The terminal point is generated from some appropriately chosen probability distribution that covers well the rare region. We show that both methods belong to the class of importance sampling procedures, by providing a common mathematical framework of these two conceptually different methods of sampling rare trajectories. We also conduct a numerical comparison of these two methods, revealing distinct areas of application for each Monte Carlo method, where they exhibit superior efficiency. Detailed simulation algorithms are provided.</description>

      <title>On the convergence of adaptive approximations for stochastic differential equations</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we study numerical approximations for stochastic differential equations (SDEs) that use adaptive step sizes. In particular, we consider a general setting where decisions to reduce step sizes are allowed to depend on the future trajectory of the underlying Brownian motion. Since these adaptive step sizes may not be previsible, the standard mean squared error analysis cannot be directly applied to show that the numerical method converges to the solution of the SDE. Building upon the pioneering work of Gaines and Lyons, we shall instead use rough path theory to establish convergence for a wide class of adaptive numerical methods on general Stratonovich SDEs (with sufficiently smooth vector fields). To our knowledge, this is the first convergence guarantee that applies to standard solvers, such as the Milstein and Heun methods, with non-previsible step sizes. In our analysis, we require the sequence of adaptive step sizes to be nested and the SDE solver to have unbiased "L\'evy area" terms in its Taylor expansion. We conjecture that for adaptive SDE solvers more generally, convergence is still possible provided the method does not introduce "L\'evy area bias". We present a simple example where the step size control can skip over previously considered times, resulting in the numerical method converging to an incorrect limit (i.e. not the Stratonovich SDE). Finally, we conclude with an experiment demonstrating the accuracy of Heun's method and a newly introduced Splitting Path-based Runge-Kutta scheme (SPaRK) when used with adaptive step sizes.</description>

      <title>On the universal properties of stochastic processes under optimally tuned Poisson restart</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08409</link>

Abstract: Poisson restart assumes that a stochastic process is interrupted and starts again at random time moments. A number of studies have demonstrated that this strategy may minimize the expected completion time in some classes of random search tasks. What is more, it turned out that under optimally tuned restart rate, any stochastic process, regardless of its nature and statistical details, satisfies a number of universal relations for the statistical moments of completion time. In this paper, we describe several new universal properties of optimally restarted processes. Also we obtain a universal inequality for the quadratic statistical moments of completion time in the optimization problem where stochastic process has several possible completion scenarios.</description>

      <title>Learning the mechanisms of network growth</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00793v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel model-selection method for dynamic networks. Our approach involves training a classifier on a large body of synthetic network data. The data is generated by simulating nine state-of-the-art random graph models for dynamic networks, with parameter range chosen to ensure exponential growth of the network size in time. We design a conceptually novel type of dynamic features that count new links received by a group of vertices in a particular time interval. The proposed features are easy to compute, analytically tractable, and interpretable. Our approach achieves a near-perfect classification of synthetic networks, exceeding the state-of-the-art by a large margin. Applying our classification method to real-world citation networks gives credibility to the claims in the literature that models with preferential attachment, fitness and aging fit real-world citation networks best, although sometimes, the predicted model does not involve vertex fitness.</description>

      <title>Growth in products of matrices: fastest, average, and generic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00610v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The problems that we consider in this paper are as follows. Let A and B be 2x2 matrices (over reals). Let w(A, B) be a word of length n. After evaluating w(A, B) as a product of matrices, we get a 2x2 matrix, call it W. What is the largest (by the absolute value) possible entry of W, over all w(A, B) of length n, as a function of n? What is the expected absolute value of the largest (by the absolute value) entry in a random product of n matrices, where each matrix is A or B with probability 0.5? What is the Lyapunov exponent for a random matrix product like that? We give partial answer to the first of these questions and an essentially complete answer to the second question. For the third question (the most difficult of the three), we offer a very simple method to produce an upper bound on the Lyapunov exponent in the case where all entries of the matrices A and B are nonnegative.</description>
