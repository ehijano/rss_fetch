      <title>Empirical Thermophotovoltaic Performance Predictions and Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Significant progress has been made in the field of thermophotovoltaics, with efficiency recently rising to over 40% due to improvements in cell design and material quality, higher emitter temperatures, and better spectral management. However, inconsistencies in trends for efficiency with semiconductor bandgap energy across various temperatures pose challenges in predicting optimal bandgaps or expected performance for different applications. To address these issues, here we present realistic performance predictions for various types of single-junction cells over a broad range of emitter temperatures using an empirical model based on past cell measurements. Our model is validated using data from different authors with various bandgaps and emitter temperatures, and an excellent agreement is seen between the model and the experimental data. Using our model, we show that in addition to spectral losses, it is important to consider practical electrical losses associated with series resistance and cell quality to avoid overestimation of system efficiency. We also show the effect of modifying various system parameters such as bandgap, above and below-bandgap reflectance, saturation current, and series resistance on the efficiency and power density of thermophotovoltaics at different temperatures. Finally, we predict the bandgap energies for best performance over a range of emitter temperatures for different cell material qualities.</description>

      <title>A practical review on promoting connectivity in topology optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topology optimization facilitates the automated design of high-performance structures across various engineering fields but, if unconstrained, often produces designs that are complex and difficult to manufacture. A key attribute of the resulting designs is connectivity, which involves controlling the presence of solid and/or void islands of material. This manuscript provides a comprehensive overview of existing connectivity constraints developed for continuous design representations and highlights their advantages and limitations in influencing design outcomes and performance. The review further includes a practical comparison of five different connectivity constraints using a topology optimization framework for sandwich panels that balances acoustic and structural performance. With Pareto-front analyses, the constraints are evaluated based on computational cost, monotonicity, parameter dependency, and their impact on the optimized designs, their performance, and underlying dynamics. From the comparison, practical insights and rule of thumbs have been derived. The findings emphasize the critical role of selecting appropriate connectivity constraints, given their significant effect on the optimization results.</description>

      <title>Simple and fast method for the analysis of $^{236}$U, $^{237}$Np, $^{239}$Pu and $^{240}$Pu from seawater samples by Accelerator Mass Spectrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A simple and fast radiochemical procedure for the sequential extraction of U, Np and Pu from small-volume seawater samples ($&lt;10$ L) is presented. The method has been developed and optimized for the final determination of $^{236}$U, $^{237}$Np, $^{239}$Pu and $^{240}$Pu by Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS). It is based on the use of $^{242}$Pu as tracer for both Np and Pu isotopes. Samples are pre-concentrated by Fe(OH)$_2$ co-precipitation. TEVA and UTEVA resins are used in a very simplified way for the final purification of the Pu+Np and U fractions, respectively. The radiochemical yields of the three elements have been investigated in detail by alpha spectrometry (AS) and gamma spectrometry (GS). The obtained results indicate high and robust chemical yields for the three elements and similar ones for Pu and Np. Furthermore, the use of $^{242}$Pu as tracer for $^{237}$Np is validated by analyzing a reference seawater sample (IAEA-443) by radiometric techniques. We demonstrated that, if chemicals are properly chosen, processed blank levels can be kept at the same level of the extremely low detection limits that can be achieved by AMS ($10^5 - 10^6$ atoms/sample). The procedure is finally applied for the study by AMS of a reference seawater sample from the Mediterranean Sea (IAEA-418).</description>

      <title>Generative diffusion model with inverse renormalization group flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models represent a class of generative models that produce data by denoising a sample corrupted by white noise. Despite the success of diffusion models in computer vision, audio synthesis, and point cloud generation, so far they overlook inherent multiscale structures in data and have a slow generation process due to many iteration steps. In physics, the renormalization group offers a fundamental framework for linking different scales and giving an accurate coarse-grained model. Here we introduce a renormalization group-based diffusion model that leverages multiscale nature of data distributions for realizing a high-quality data generation. In the spirit of renormalization group procedures, we define a flow equation that progressively erases data information from fine-scale details to coarse-grained structures. Through reversing the renormalization group flows, our model is able to generate high-quality samples in a coarse-to-fine manner. We validate the versatility of the model through applications to protein structure prediction and image generation. Our model consistently outperforms conventional diffusion models across standard evaluation metrics, enhancing sample quality and/or accelerating sampling speed by an order of magnitude. The proposed method alleviates the need for data-dependent tuning of hyperparameters in the generative diffusion models, showing promise for systematically increasing sample efficiency based on the concept of the renormalization group.</description>

      <title>Correlation between structural and magnetic properties of epitaxial YIG films by pulsed laser deposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the relationships between film growth conditions, crystalline microstructure, and magnetic properties of epitaxial Yttrium Iron Garnet (Y$_3$Fe$_5$O$_{12}$, YIG) thin films, deposited on Gallium Gadolinium Garnet (Ga$_3$Gd$_5$O$_{12}$, GGG). A direct correlation was observed between the residual epitaxial strain, bulk magnetic properties like saturation magnetization and magnetic damping), and the performance of spin-wave transmission devices based on these films. This correlation offers a pathway for a simplified, rapid assessment of YIG film quality, avoiding the need for complex time-consuming characterization techniques. In addition, we report a comprehensive investigation into the influence of pulsed-laser deposition parameters, including deposition temperature, pressure, laser fluence, frequency, and annealing conditions. Through systematic deposition optimization, state-of-the-art YIG films exhibiting ultralow magnetic damping could be obtained, which is critical for high-performance spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Strain distribution in zincblende and wurtzite GaAs nanowires bent by a one-sided (In, Al)As stressor shell: consequences for torsion, chirality, and piezoelectricity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a finite-strain model that is capable of describing the large deformations in bent nanowire heterostructures. The model incorporates a nonlinear strain formulation derived from the first Piola-Kirchhoff stress tensor, coupled with an energy functional that effectively captures the lattice-mismatch-induced strain field. We use the finite element method to solve the resulting partial differential equations and extract cross-sectional maps of the full strain tensor for both zincblende and wurtzite nanowires with lattice-mismatched core and one-sided stressor shell. In either case, we show that the bending is essentially exclusively determined by $\varepsilon_{zz}$. However, the distinct difference in shear strain has important consequences with regard to both the mechanical deformation and the existence of transverse piezoelectric fields in the nanowires.</description>

      <title>OpticFusion: Multi-Modal Neural Implicit 3D Reconstruction of Microstructures by Fusing White Light Interferometry and Optical Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: White Light Interferometry (WLI) is a precise optical tool for measuring the 3D topography of microstructures. However, conventional WLI cannot capture the natural color of a sample's surface, which is essential for many microscale research applications that require both 3D geometry and color information. Previous methods have attempted to overcome this limitation by modifying WLI hardware and analysis software, but these solutions are often costly. In this work, we address this challenge from a computer vision multi-modal reconstruction perspective for the first time. We introduce OpticFusion, a novel approach that uses an additional digital optical microscope (OM) to achieve 3D reconstruction with natural color textures using multi-view WLI and OM images. Our method employs a two-step data association process to obtain the poses of WLI and OM data. By leveraging the neural implicit representation, we fuse multi-modal data and apply color decomposition technology to extract the sample's natural color. Tested on our multi-modal dataset of various microscale samples, OpticFusion achieves detailed 3D reconstructions with color textures. Our method provides an effective tool for practical applications across numerous microscale research fields. The source code and our real-world dataset are available at https://github.com/zju3dv/OpticFusion.</description>

      <title>High-speed readout for direct light orbital angular momentum photodetector via photoelastic modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent progress in direct photodetection of light orbital angular momentum (OAM) based on the orbital photogalvanic effect (OPGE) provides an effective way for on-chip direct electric readout of orbital angular momentum, as well as large-scale integration focal-plane array devices. However, the recognition of OAM order from photocurrent response requires the extraction of circular polarization-dependent response. To date, the operation speed of such detector is currently at the minute level and is limited by slow mechanical polarization modulation and low OAM recognition capability. In this work, we demonstrate that the operation speed can be greatly improved via electrical polarization modulation strategy with photoelasitc modulator accompanied by phase-locked readout approach with lock-in amplifier. We demonstrate an operation speed of up to 1 kHz with this new technology in the mid-infrared region (4 {\mu}m) on an OAM detector using multilayer graphene (MLG) as photosensitive material. In principle, with new modulation and readout scheme, we can potentially increase the operation speed to 50.14 kHz with a PEM that operates at a state-of-the-art speed. Our work paves the way toward high-speed operation of direct OAM detection devices based on OPGE effect and pushes such technology to a more practical stage for focal plane array applications.</description>

      <title>Automatic exposure volumetric additive manufacturing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tomographic volumetric additive manufacturing (VAM) achieves high print speed and design freedom by continuous volumetric light patterning. This differs from traditional vat photopolymerization techniques that use brief sequential (2D) plane- or (1D) point-localized exposures. The drawback to volumetric light patterning is the small exposure window. Overexposure quickly leads to cured out-of-part voxels due to the nonzero background dose arising from light projection through the build volume. For tomographic VAM, correct exposure time is critical to achieving high repeatability, however, we find that correct exposure time varies by nearly 40% depending on resin history. Currently, tomographic VAM exposure is timed based on subjective human determination of print completion, which is tedious and yields poor repeatability. Here, we implement a robust auto exposure routine for tomographic VAM using real-time processing of light scattering data, yielding accurate and repeatable prints without human intervention. The resulting print fidelity and repeatability approaches, and in some cases, exceeds that of commercial resin 3D printers. We show that auto exposure VAM generalizes well to a wide variety of print geometries with small positive and negative features. The repeatability and accuracy of auto exposure VAM allows for building multi-part objects, fulfilling a major requirement of additive manufacturing technologies.</description>

      <title>Dynamic modulation of dual-band nonreciprocal radiation in a graphene-Weyl semimetal plasmonic structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and develop a hybrid structure combining graphene and Weyl semimetal, capable of achieving dynamically adjustable dual-band nonreciprocal radiation. The results reveal that the nonreciprocal radiation can be attributed to the synergistic interaction between resonance mode excitation and the unique properties of Weyl materials, with the electric field distribution providing further insights into the graphene plasmon modes involved. By exploiting the resonant characteristics of graphene plasmons, we demonstrate that strong nonreciprocal radiation can be effectively regulated through adjusting the grating's geometric parameters, while maintaining robustness over a wide range. Notably, substantial dynamic tuning of the resonant wavelength for nonreciprocal radiation is achievable by modulating the Fermi level of graphene. Our research results offer promising prospects for the developing of complex energy harvesting and conversion systems within advanced thermal frameworks.</description>

      <title>Non-reciprocical Scattering in a Microwave Frequency Comb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate non-reciprocal scattering within the modes of a microwave frequency comb. Adjusting the pump frequencies, amplitudes, and phases of a Josephson parametric oscillator, we control constructive interference for the $m \longrightarrow \ell$ scattering processes, while concurrently achieving destructive interference for the inverse process $\ell \longrightarrow m$. We outline the methodology for realizing non-reciprocity in the context of two-mode isolation and a three-mode circulation, which we extend to multiple modes. We find good agreement between the experiments and a linearized theoretical model. Nonreciprocal scattering expands the toolset for parametric control, with the potential to engineer novel quantum correlations.</description>

      <title>Approaching optimal microwave-acoustic transduction on lithium niobate using SQUID arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electronic devices exploiting acoustic vibrations are ubiquitous in classical and quantum technologies. Central to these devices is the transducer, which enables the exchange of signals between electrical and acoustic networks. Among the various transduction mechanisms, piezoelectricity remains the most widely used. However, conventional piezoelectric transducers are limited to either small efficiencies or narrow bandwidths and they typically operate at fixed frequency. These limitations restrict their utility in many applications. Here we propose and demonstrate a robust strategy to realize piezoelectric microwave-acoustic transduction close to the maximal efficiency-bandwidth product of lithium niobate. We use SQUID arrays to transform the large complex impedance of wide-band interdigital transducers into 50 $\Omega$ and demonstrate unprecedented efficiency$\times$bandwidth $\approx$ 440 MHz, with a maximum efficiency of 62% at 5.7 GHz. Moreover, leveraging the flux dependence of SQUIDs, we realize transducers with in-situ tunability across nearly an octave around 5.5 GHz. Our transducer can be readily connected to other superconducting quantum devices, with applications in microwave-to-optics conversion schemes, quantum-limited phonon detection, or acoustic spectroscopy in the 4-8 GHz band.</description>

      <title>Integrated electronic controller for dynamic self-configuration of photonic circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconfigurable photonic integrated circuits (PICs) can implement arbitrary operations and signal processing functionalities directly in the optical domain. Run-time configuration of these circuits requires an electronic control layer to adjust the working point of their building elements and make them compensate for thermal drifts or degradations of the input signal. As the advancement of photonic foundries enables the fabrication of chips of increasing complexity, developing scalable electronic controllers becomes crucial for the operation of complex PICs. In this paper, we present an electronic application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) designed for reconfiguration of PICs featuring numerous tuneable elements. Each channel of the ASIC controller independently addresses one optical component of the PIC, as multiple parallel local feedback loops are operated to achieve full control. The proposed design is validated through real-time reconfiguration of a 16-channel silicon photonics adaptive beam coupler. Results demonstrate automatic coupling of an arbitrary input beam to a single-mode waveguide, dynamic compensation of beam wavefront distortions and successful transmission of a 50 Gbit/s signal through an optical free-space link. The low power consumption and compactness of the electronic chip provide a scalable paradigm that can be seamlessly extended to larger photonic architectures.</description>

      <title>Mixed anion control of enhanced negative thermal expansion in the oxysulfide of PbTiO3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rare physical property of negative thermal expansion (NTE) is intriguing because materials with large NTE over a wide temperature range can serve as high-performance thermal expansion compensators. However, applications of NTE are hindered by the fact that most of the available NTE materials show small magnitudes of NTE, and/or NTE occurs only in a narrow temperature range. Herein, for the first time, we investigated the effect of anion substitution instead of general Pb/Ti-site substitutions on the thermal expansion properties of a typical ferroelectric NTE material, PbTiO3. Intriguingly, the substitution of S for O in PbTiO3 further increases the tetragonality of PbTiO3. Consequently, an unusually enhanced NTE with an average volumetric coefficient of thermal expansion $\bar{\alpha}_V$ = -2.50 $\times$ 10$^{-5}$/K was achieved over a wide temperature range (300 -- 790 K), which is contrasted to that of pristine PbTiO3 ($\bar{\alpha}_V$ = -1.99 $\times$ 10$^{-5}$/K RT -- 763 K). The intensified NTE is attributed to the enhanced hybridization between Pb/Ti and O/S atoms by the substitution of S, as evidenced by our theoretical investigations. We therefore demonstrate a new technique for introducing mixed anions to achieve large NTE over a wide temperature range in PbTiO3-based ferroelectrics.</description>

      <title>Bidirectional microwave-optical conversion using an integrated barium-titanate transducer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient, low-noise, high-bandwidth transduction between optical and microwave photons is key to long-range quantum communication between distant superconducting quantum processors. Recent demonstrations of microwave-optical tranduction using the broadband direct electro-optic (Pockels) effect in optical thin films made of AlN or LiNbO$_3$ have shown promise. Due to the quadratic scaling of transduction efficiency with the electro-optic coefficient, material classes with stronger Pockels effects, such as the perovskite titanates BaTiO$_3$ or SrTiO$_3$, may unlock new performance regimes for future transducers. However, these materials require adapted designs and fabrication approaches due to their nonlinear and, in some cases, hysteretic electro-optic response, as well as limited process compatibility. Here, we engineer an on-chip, triply resonant transducer comprising low-loss BaTiO$_3$-on-SiO$_2$ waveguides monolithically integrated with a superconducting microwave resonator made of Nb. Exploiting the bias-induced Pockels effect of BaTiO$_3$, we demonstrate bidirectional microwave-optical transduction at millikelvin temperatures and total off-chip efficiencies reaching $1\times10^{-6}$ in pulsed operation. We establish a device concept permitting in-situ poling of the ferroelectric material without introducing excess microwave loss and tuning of the optical system without sacrificing microwave-optical overlap. Using a fully subtractive process, we fabricate Nb air bridges for crossings of conductors and both air- and oxide-clad optical waveguides. We investigate optically-induced heating through pulsed optical pumping, revealing fast thermalization and quasiparticle resilience of the microwave resonator. Our transducer concept is applicable to other materials with a large bias-induced Pockels effect and paves the way for efficient, low-power quantum interconnects.</description>
