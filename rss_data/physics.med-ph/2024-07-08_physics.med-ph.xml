      <title>Evaluating the severity of tandem coronary stenoses: Insights from simulated FFR and iFR techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aims: The presence of coronary tandem lesions poses a significant challenge for the accurate diagnosis and management of coronary artery diseases. This study set out to provide a deeper understanding of the haemodynamic interactions between tandem obstructive coronary lesions and their impact on different haemodynamic diagnostic parameters. Methods and Results: Using a computational fluid dynamic model, validated against in vitro laboratory experiments, we investigated the various combinations of moderate and severe stenoses interchangeably located in the proximal and distal segments of the artery. The investigation was conducted using two diagnostic parameters: one hyperaemic-based, i.e., FFR, and one rest-based, i.e., iFR, technique, both of which are commonly used to assess the physiological significance of coronary stenoses. The three main findings of this work are: (a) the recovery distance (the immediate local distance affected by the presence of stenosis) is much shorter for the rest-measured diagnostic parameter compared with the hyperaemic-measured diagnostic parameter; (b) pressure drop measurements immediately downstream of the stenotic sections overestimate the significance of stenoses, and (c) the presence of a moderate stenosis downstream of a severe stenosis increases FFR value (faster FFR recovery). Conclusion: These findings enhance our understanding of the diagnostic accuracy of hyperaemic-based and rest-based physiological diagnostic coronary assessments and the nuances of using these different techniques when assessing tandem coronary stenoses. This understanding can help inform tailored therapeutic approaches for the management of coronary artery disease.</description>

      <title>Laser driven miniature diamond implant for wireless retinal prostheses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The design and benchtop operation of a wireless miniature epiretinal stimulator implant is reported. The implant is optically powered and controlled using safe illumination at near-infrared wavelengths. An application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) hosting a digital control unit is used to control the implant's electrodes. The ASIC is powered using an advanced photovoltaic (PV) cell and programmed using a single photodiode. Diamond packaging technology is utilized to achieve high-density integration of the implant optoelectronic circuitry, as well as individual connections between a stimulator chip and 256 electrodes, within a 4.6 mm x 3.7 mm x 0.9 mm implant package. An ultrahigh efficiency PV cell with a monochromatic power conversion efficiency of 55% is used to power the implant. On-board photodetection circuity with a bandwidth of 3.7 MHz is used for forward data telemetry of stimulation parameters. In comparison to implants which utilize inductively coupled coils, laser power delivery enables a high degree of miniaturization and lower surgical complexity. The device presented combines the benefits of implant miniaturization and a flexible stimulation strategy provided by a dedicated stimulator chip. This development provides a route to fully wireless miniaturized minimally invasive implants with sophisticated functionalities.</description>

      <title>Novel second-order model for tumor evolution: description of cytostatic and cytotoxic effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cancer is a disease that takes millions of lives every year. Then, to propose treatments, avoid recurrence, and improve the patient's life quality, we need to analyze this disease from a biophysical perspective with a solid mathematical formulation. In this paper we introduce a novel deterministic model for the evolution of tumors under several conditions (untreated tumors and treated tumors using chemotherapy). Our model is characterized by a second-order differential equation, whose origin and interpretation are presented by exploiting our understanding of fluid mechanics (via continuity equations) and the theory of differential equations. Additionally, we show that our model can fit various experimental data sets. Thus, we prove that our nuanced and general model can describe accelerated growth, as well as cytostatic and cytotoxic effects. All in all, our model opens up a new window in the understanding of tumor evolution and represents a promising connection between the macroscopic and microscopic descriptions of cancer.</description>

      <title>Tumor likelihood estimation on MRI prostate data by utilizing k-Space information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel preprocessing and prediction pipeline for the classification of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that takes advantage of the information rich complex valued k-Space. Using a publicly available MRI raw dataset with 312 subject and a total of 9508 slices, we show the advantage of utilizing the k-Space for better prostate cancer likelihood estimation in comparison to just using the magnitudinal information in the image domain, with an AUROC of $86.1\%\pm1.8\%$. Additionally, by using high undersampling rates and a simple principal component analysis (PCA) for coil compression, we reduce the time needed for reconstruction by avoiding the time intensive GRAPPA reconstruction algorithm. By using digital undersampling for our experiments, we show that scanning and reconstruction time could be reduced. Even with an undersampling factor of 16, our approach achieves meaningful results, with an AUROC of $71.4\%\pm2.9\%$, using the PCA coil combination and taking into account the k-Space information. With this study, we were able to show the feasibility of preserving phase and k-Space information, with consistent results. Besides preserving valuable information for further diagnostics, this approach can work without the time intensive ADC and reconstruction calculations, greatly reducing the post processing, as well as potential scanning time, increasing patient comfort and allowing a close to real-time prediction.</description>

      <title>PyTomography: A Python Library for Quantitative Medical Image Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.01977v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is a need for open-source libraries in emission tomography that (i) use modern and popular backend code to encourage community contributions and (ii) offer support for the multitude of reconstruction algorithms available in recent literature, such as those that employ artificial intelligence. The purpose of this research was to create and evaluate a GPU-accelerated, open-source, and user-friendly image reconstruction library, designed to serve as a central platform for the development, validation, and deployment of various tomographic reconstruction algorithms. PyTomography was developed using Python and inherits the GPU-accelerated functionality of PyTorch and parallelproj for fast computations. Its flexible and modular design decouples system matrices, likelihoods, and reconstruction algorithms, simplifying the process of integrating new imaging modalities using various python tools. Example use cases demonstrate the software capabilities in parallel hole SPECT and listmode PET imaging. Overall, we have developed and publicly share PyTomography, a highly optimized and user-friendly software for medical image reconstruction, with a class hierarchy that fosters the development of novel imaging applications.</description>

      <title>X-ray dark-field via spectral propagation-based imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15874v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dark-field X-ray imaging is a novel modality which visualises scattering from unresolved microstructure. Most dark-field imaging techniques rely on crystals or structured illumination, but recent work has shown that dark-field effects are observable in straightforward propagation-based imaging (PBI). Based on the single-material X-ray Fokker--Planck equation with an a priori dark-field energy dependence, we propose an algorithm to extract phase and dark-field effects from dual-energy PBI images. We successfully apply the dark-field retrieval algorithm to simulated and experimental dual-energy data, and show that by accounting for dark-field effects, projected thickness reconstruction is improved compared to the classic Paganin algorithm. With the emergence of spectral detectors, the method could enable single-exposure dark-field imaging of dynamic and living samples.</description>

      <title>Shot noise-mitigated secondary electron imaging with ion count-aided microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07003v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern science is dependent on imaging on the nanoscale, often achieved through processes that detect secondary electrons created by a highly focused incident charged particle beam. Multiple types of measurement noise limit the ultimate trade-off between the image quality and the incident particle dose, which can preclude useful imaging of dose-sensitive samples. Existing methods to improve image quality do not fundamentally mitigate the noise sources. Furthermore, barriers to assigning a physically meaningful scale make the images qualitative. Here we introduce ion count-aided microscopy (ICAM), which is a quantitative imaging technique that uses statistically principled estimation of the secondary electron yield. With a readily implemented change in data collection, ICAM substantially reduces source shot noise. In helium ion microscopy, we demonstrate 3x dose reduction and a good match between these empirical results and theoretical performance predictions. ICAM facilitates imaging of fragile samples and may make imaging with heavier particles more attractive.</description>

      <title>Cellular-resolution X-ray microtomography of an entire mouse brain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13971v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Purpose: Histology is the gold standard for sub-cellular visualization of the mouse brain. It offers excellent in-plane resolution, but a comparably low out-of-plane resolution due to physical sectioning. X-ray microtomography does not require this trade-off. Tomographic imaging of the entire mouse brain with isotropic cellular resolution produces datasets of multiple terabytes in size. These data must be processed and made accessible to domain experts who may have only limited image processing knowledge.
  Approach: Extended-field X-ray microtomography covering an entire mouse brain was performed. The 4,495 projections from 8 $\times$ 8 offset acquisitions were stitched to reconstruct a volume of 15,000$^3$ voxels. The microtomography volume was non-rigidly registered to the Allen Mouse Brain Common Coordinate Framework v3 based on a combination of image intensity and landmark pairs.
  Results: We present a 3.3 teravoxel dataset covering a full mouse brain with 0.65 $\mu$m voxel size. The data were blockwise transformed to a common coordinate system, then stored in a public repository with a hierarchical format for navigation and overlay with anatomical annotations in online viewers such as Neuroglancer or siibra-explorer.
  Conclusions: This study demonstrates X-ray imaging and data processing for a full mouse brain, augmenting current atlases by improving resolution in the third dimension by an order of magnitude. The data are publicly available and easily accessible for domain experts via browser-based viewers.</description>

      <title>Towards AI Lesion Tracking in PET/CT Imaging: A Siamese-based CNN Pipeline applied on PSMA PET/CT Scans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09327v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Assessing tumor response to systemic therapies is one of the main applications of PET/CT. Routinely, only a small subset of index lesions out of multiple lesions is analyzed. However, this operator dependent selection may bias the results due to possible significant inter-metastatic heterogeneity of response to therapy. Automated, AI based approaches for lesion tracking hold promise in enabling the analysis of many more lesions and thus providing a better assessment of tumor response. This work introduces a Siamese CNN approach for lesion tracking between PET/CT scans. Our approach is applied on the laborious task of tracking a high number of bone lesions in full-body baseline and follow-up [68Ga]Ga- or [18F]F-PSMA PET/CT scans after two cycles of [177Lu]Lu-PSMA therapy of metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer patients. Data preparation includes lesion segmentation and affine registration. Our algorithm extracts suitable lesion patches and forwards them into a Siamese CNN trained to classify the lesion patch pairs as corresponding or non-corresponding lesions. Experiments have been performed with different input patch types and a Siamese network in 2D and 3D. The CNN model successfully learned to classify lesion assignments, reaching a lesion tracking accuracy of 83 % in its best configuration with an AUC = 0.91. For remaining lesions the pipeline accomplished a re-identification rate of 89 %. We proved that a CNN may facilitate the tracking of multiple lesions in PSMA PET/CT scans. Future clinical studies are necessary if this improves the prediction of the outcome of therapies.</description>
