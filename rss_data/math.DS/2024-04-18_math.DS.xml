      <title>Packing measure of the linear Gauss system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For every $k \in \mathbb{N}$ let $f_k:[\frac{1}{k+1}, \frac{1}{k}] \to [0,1]$ be decreasing, linear functions such that $f_k(\frac{1}{k+1}) = 1$ and $f_k(\frac{1}{k}) = 0$, $k = 1, 2, \dots$. We define iterated function system (IFS) $S_n$ by limiting the collection of functions $f_k$ to first n, meaning $S_n = \{f_k \}_{k=1}^n$. Let $J_n$ denote the limit set of $S_n$. Then $\lim\limits_{n\to \infty} \mathcal{P}_{h_n}(J_n) = 2$, where $h_n$ is the packing dimension of $J_n$ and $\mathcal{P}_{h_n}$ is the corresponding packing measure.</description>

      <title>Infinite sumsets of the form $B+B$ in sets with large density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a set $A \subset \mathbb{N}$ we characterize in terms of its density when there exists an infinite set $B \subset \mathbb{N}$ and $t \in \{0,1\}$ such that $B+B \subset A-t$, where $B+B : =\{b_1+b_2\colon b_1,b_2 \in B\}$. Specifically, when the lower density $\underline{d}(A) &gt;1/2$ or the upper density $\overline{d}(A)&gt; 3/4$, the existence of such a set $B\subset \mathbb{N}$ and $t\in \{0,1\}$ is assured. Furthermore, whenever $\underline{d}(A) &gt; 3/4$ or $\overline{d}(A)&gt;5/6$, we show that the shift $t$ is unnecessary and we also provide examples to show that these bounds are sharp. Finally, we construct a syndetic three-coloring of the natural numbers that does not contain a monochromatic $B+B+t$ for any infinite set $B \subset \mathbb{N}$ and number $t \in \mathbb{N}$.</description>

      <title>Van Hove singularities in the density of states of a chaotic dynamical system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The statistics of a chaotic recursion relation can be predicted by constructing an associated sequence of periodic elliptic operators. For such operators, the density of states is well understood, can be computed straightforwardly and explicit formulas can often be derived. The example studied here is a non-linear recursion relation which can be related to a sequence of periodic operators generated by a Fibonacci tiling rule. This link is used to derive an explicit formula for the limiting distribution of orbits of the non-linear recursion relation. This distribution contains characteristic features of the associated operators' densities of states, such as Van Hove singularities near to critical values.</description>

      <title>The port-Hamiltonian structure of continuum mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we present a novel approach to the geometric formulation of solid and fluid mechanics within the port-Hamiltonian framework, which extends the standard Hamiltonian formulation to non-conservative and open dynamical systems. Leveraging Dirac structures, instead of symplectic or Poisson structures, this formalism allows the incorporation of energy exchange within the spatial domain or through its boundary, which allows for a more comprehensive description of continuum mechanics. Building upon our recent work in describing nonlinear elasticity using exterior calculus and bundle-valued differential forms, this paper focuses on the systematic derivation of port-Hamiltonian models for solid and fluid mechanics in the material, spatial, and convective representations using Hamiltonian reduction theory. This paper also discusses constitutive relations for stress within this framework including hyper-elasticity, for both finite- and infinite-strains, as well as viscous fluid flow governed by the Navier-Stokes equations.</description>

      <title>Maximal transverse measures of expanding foliations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.05172v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For an expanding (unstable) foliation of a diffeomorphism, we use a natural dynamical averaging to construct transverse measures, which we call \emph{maximal}, describing the statistics of how the iterates of a given leaf intersect the cross-sections to the foliation. For a suitable class of diffeomorphisms, we prove that this averaging converges, even exponentially fast, and the limit measures have finite ergodic decompositions. These results are obtained through relating the maximal transverse measures to the maximal $u$-entropy measures of the diffeomorphism.</description>

      <title>Drift estimation in stochastic flows using kernel integral operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10698v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A stochastic differential equation (SDE) describes a motion in which a particle is governed simultaneously by the direction provided by a vector field / drift, and the scattering effects of white noise. The resulting motion can only be described as a random process instead of a solution curve. Due to the non-deterministic nature of this motion, the task of determining the drift from data is quite challenging, since the data does not directly represent the directional information of the flow. This paper describes an interpretation of vector field as a conditional expectation, which makes its estimation feasible via kernel-integral methods. It presents a numerical procedure based on kernel integral operators, that computes this expectation. In addition, some techniques are presented which can overcome the challenge of dimensionality if the SDE's carry some structure enabling sparsity.</description>

      <title>Some Applications of Dynamical Belyi Polynomials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2109.03339v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give necessary and sufficient conditions for post-critically finite polynomials to have persistent bad reduction at a given prime. We also answer in the negative a pair of questions posed by Silverman about conservative polynomials. Our proofs rely on conservative dynamical Belyi polynomials as exemplars of PCF (resp. conservative) maps.</description>

      <title>On the growth of the Floer barcode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.03613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.03613v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is a follow up to the authors' recent work on barcode entropy. We study the growth of the barcode of the Floer complex for the iterates of a compactly supported Hamiltonian diffeomorphism. In particular, we introduce sequential barcode entropy which has properties similar to barcode entropy, bounds it from above and is more sensitive to the barcode growth. We prove that in dimension two the sequential barcode entropy equals the topological entropy and hence equals the ordinary barcode entropy. We also study the behavior of the $\gamma$-norm under iterations. We show that the $\gamma$-norm of the iterates is separated from zero when the map has sufficiently many hyperbolic periodic points and, as a consequence, it is separated from zero $C^\infty$-generically in dimension two. We also touch upon properties of the barcode entropy of pseudo-rotations and, more generally, $\gamma$-almost periodic maps.</description>

      <title>Construction of unstable concentrated solutions of the Euler and gSQG equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.14657v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we construct solutions to the Euler and gSQG equations that are concentrated near unstable stationary configurations of point-vortices. Those solutions are themselves unstable, in the sense that their localization radius grows from order $\varepsilon$ to order $\varepsilon^\beta$ (with $\beta &lt; 1$) in a time of order $|\ln\varepsilon|$. This proves in particular that the logarithmic lower-bound obtained in previous papers (in particular [P. Butt\`a and C. Marchioro, Long time evolution of concentrated Euler flows with planar symmetry, SIAM J. Math. Anal., 50(1):735-760, 2018]) about vorticity localization in Euler and gSQG equations is optimal. In addition we construct unstable solutions of the Euler equations in bounded domains concentrated around a single unstable stationary point. To achieve this we construct a domain whose Robin's function has a saddle point.</description>
