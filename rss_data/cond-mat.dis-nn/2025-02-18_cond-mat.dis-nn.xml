      <title>Tentaclelike spectra and bound states in Hatano-Nelson chain with long-range impurity coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In non-Hermitian systems, the energy spectra and eigenstates exhibit high sensitivity to boundary conditions, lattice geometries, and local impurities. In this paper, we study the effect of long-range impurity coupling, located far from the boundaries, on the paradigmatic non-Hermitian Hatano-Nelson model. Through exact analytical treatment, we reveal the intriguing tentacle-like spectral structures that emerge from the otherwise Bloch or non-Bloch spectra under periodic or open boundary conditions, respectively. We show that these spectral tentacles are associated with emergent bound states near the impurity, with their number determined by the coupling range. We further determine the localization length of these tentacled states using the transfer matrix. Our work indicates that the long-range impurity coupling cannot be treated as a mere perturbative effect and holds promise for state manipulations in non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <title>Signature of glassy dynamics in dynamic modes decompositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Glasses are traditionally characterized by their rugged landscape of disordered low-energy states and their slow relaxation towards thermodynamic equilibrium. Far from equilibrium, dynamical forms of glassy behavior with anomalous algebraic relaxation have also been noted, e.g., in networks of coupled oscillators. Due to their disordered and high-dimensional nature, such systems have been difficult to study analytically, but data-driven methods are emerging as a promising alternative that may aid in their characterization. Here, we show that the gap between oscillatory and decaying modes in the Koopman spectrum vanishes in systems exhibiting algebraic relaxation. The dynamic mode decomposition, which is a data-driven spectral computation that approximates the Koopman spectrum, thus provides a model-agnostic signature for detecting and analyzing glassy dynamics. We demonstrate the utility of our approach through both a minimal example of one-dimensional ODEs and a high-dimensional example of coupled oscillators.</description>

      <title>When Homogeneous Systems Meet Dissipation and Disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the localization and topological properties of the non-equilibrium steady state (NESS) in a one-dimensional homogeneous system. Our results demonstrate that, despite the absence of disorder in the initial system, the NESS can exhibit localization under bond dissipation. Conversely, for an initially flat-band system with compactly localized wave functions, the NESS is delocalized. These dissipation-driven localization and delocalization phenomena are clearly distinguished using Wigner distributions. Furthermore, we find that the initial localization characteristics of the system significantly influence the localization properties of the NESS. Drawing upon the concept of Bose-Einstein condensate broadening in cold-atom experiments, along with experimental data, we systematically characterize the impact of disorder on the localization and topological properties of the NESS. The phase diagram reveals that the NESS can be topologically non-trivial even when the initial state is topologically trivial, and that the topological triviality of the initial state weakens the topological non-triviality of the NESS. This work provides new insights into the localization and topological phase transitions in homogeneous systems induced by bond dissipation and disorder.</description>

      <title>Effective medium theory for the electrical conductivity of random metallic nanowire networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interest in studying the conductive properties of networks made from randomly distributed nanowires is due to their numerous technological applications. Although the sheet resistance of such networks can be calculated directly, the calculations require many characteristics of the system (distributions of lengths, diameters and resistances of nanowires, distribution of junction resistance), the measurement of which is difficult. Furthermore, such calculations can hardly offer an analytical dependence of the sheet resistance on the basic physical parameters of the systems under consideration. Although various theoretical approaches offer such analytical dependencies, they are often based on more or less reasonable assumptions rather than rigorously proven statements. Here, we offer an approach based on Foster's theorem to reveal a dependence of the sheet resistance of dense nanowire networks on the main parameters of such networks. This theorem offers an additional perspective on the effective medium theory and extends our insight.</description>

      <title>Learning in a Multifield Coherent Ising Machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physical information processors can learn from examples if they are modified according to an abstract parameter update equation, termed a learning rule. We introduce a physical model for self-learning that encodes the learning rule in the Hamiltonian of the system. The model consists of a network of multi-modal resonators. One of the modes is driven parametrically into a bi-stable regime, forming a coherent Ising machine (CIM) -- that provides the long-term memory that stores learned responses (weights). The CIM is augmented with an additional spinor field that acts as short-term (activation) memory. We numerically demonstrate that, in the presence of suitable nonlinear interactions between the long-term memory Ising machine and the short-term memory auxiliary field, the system autonomously learns from examples.</description>

      <title>Topology from Nothing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Disorder remains a major obstacle to realizing topological Majorana zero modes (MZMs) in superconductor-semiconductor nanowires, and we show how deep learning can be used to recover topological MZMs mitigating disorder even when the pre-mitigation situation manifests no apparent topology. The disorder potential, as well as the scattering invariant ($T_V$) normally used to classify a device as topologically non-trivial are not directly measurable experimentally. Additionally, the conventional signatures of MZMs have proved insufficient due to their being accidentally replicated by disorder-induced trivial states. Recent advances in machine learning provide a novel method to solve these problems, allowing the underlying topology, suppressed by disorder, to be recovered using effective mitigation procedures. In this work, we leverage a vision transformer neural network trained on conductance measurements along with a CMA-ES optimization framework to dynamically tune gate voltages mitigating disorder effects. Unlike prior efforts that relied on indirect cost functions, our method directly optimizes $T_V$ alongside additional local density of states-based topological indicators. Using a lightweight neural network variant, we demonstrate that even highly disordered nanowires initially lacking any topologically non-trivial regions can be transformed into robust topological devices.</description>

      <title>DisQu: Investigating the Impact of Disorder in Quantum Generative Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16180v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Disordered Quantum many-body Systems (DQS) and Quantum Neural Networks (QNN) have many structural features in common. However, a DQS is essentially an initialized QNN with random weights, often leading to non-random outcomes. In this work, we emphasize the possibilities of random processes being a deceptive quantum-generating model effectively hidden in a QNN. When we choose weights in a QNN randomly the unitarity property of quantum gates is unchanged. As we show, this can lead to memory effects with multiple consequences on the learnability and trainability of QNN one would not expect from a classical neural network with random weights. This phenomenon may lead to a fundamental misunderstanding of the capabilities of common quantum generative models, where the generation of new samples is essentially averaging over random outputs. While we suggest that DQS can be effectively used for tasks like image augmentation, we draw the attention that overly simple datasets are often used to show the generative capabilities of quantum models, potentially leading to overestimation of their effectiveness.</description>

      <title>A universal route from avalanches in mean-field models with random fields to stochastic Poisson branching events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08526v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Avalanches in mean-field models can be mapped to memoryless branching processes defining a universality class. We present a reduced expression mapping a broad family of critical and subcriticial avalanches in mean-field models at the thermodynamic limit to rooted trees in a memoryless Poisson branching processes with random occurrence times. We derive the exact mapping for the athermal random field Ising model and the democratic fiber bundle model, where avalanche statistics progress towards criticality, and as an approximation for the self-organized criticality in slip mean-field theory. Avalanche dynamics and statistics in the three models differ only on the evolution of the field density, interaction strength, and the product of both terms determining the branching number.</description>

      <title>Online calibration scheme for training restricted Boltzmann machines with quantum annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.09785v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a scheme to calibrate the internal parameters of a quantum annealer to obtain well-approximated samples for training a restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM). Empirically, samples from quantum annealers obey the Boltzmann distribution, making them suitable for RBM training. Quantum annealers utilize physical phenomena to generate a large number of samples in a short time. However, hardware imperfections make it challenging to obtain accurate samples. Existing research often estimates the inverse temperature for the compensation. Our scheme efficiently utilizes samples for RBM training also to estimate internal parameters. Furthermore, we consider additional parameters and demonstrate that they improve sample quality. We evaluate our approach by comparing the obtained samples with classical Gibbs sampling, which theoretically generates accurate samples. Our results indicate that our scheme demonstrates performance on par with Gibbs sampling. In addition, the training results with our estimation scheme outperform those of the contrastive divergence algorithm, a standard training algorithm for RBM.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.03888v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The design of deep neural networks remains somewhat of an art rather than precise science. By tentatively adopting ergodic theory considerations on top of viewing the network as the time evolution of a dynamical system, with each layer corresponding to a temporal instance, we show that some rules of thumb, which might otherwise appear mysterious, can be attributed heuristics.</description>

      <title>Demystifying Spectral Bias on Real-World Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02663v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kernel ridge regression (KRR) and Gaussian processes (GPs) are fundamental tools in statistics and machine learning, with recent applications to highly over-parameterized deep neural networks. The ability of these tools to learn a target function is directly related to the eigenvalues of their kernel sampled on the input data distribution. Targets that have support on higher eigenvalues are more learnable. However, solving such eigenvalue problems on real-world data remains a challenge. Here, we consider cross-dataset learnability and show that one may use eigenvalues and eigenfunctions associated with highly idealized data measures to reveal spectral bias on complex datasets and bound learnability on real-world data. This allows us to leverage various symmetries that realistic kernels manifest to unravel their spectral bias.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10890v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the transition between elastic and viscous regimes for time-reversal broken Weyl semimetals. In these materials, Hall transport occurs through two parallel channels: the Fermi sea and the Fermi surface. The Fermi sea part remains unaffected by electron-electron scattering, whereas the Fermi surface is influenced by it. We model the disorder by dilute impenetrable spherical impurities. We analyze the flow of an electronic fluid with a finite odd viscosity in the presence of such disorder and compute the conductivity tensor. We find that in the generic case of finite intrinsic conductivity, the Hall angle in the viscous regime is parametrically suppressed compared to the elastic regime. In the special case where the intrinsic conductivity vanishes, the ratio between the transverse and the longitudinal resistivities matches the ratio between the odd and even components of the viscosity tensor.</description>
