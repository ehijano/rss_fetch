      <title>The distribution of interior branch lengths in phylogenetic trees under constant-rate birth-death models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phylogenetic trees represent the evolutionary relationships between extant lineages, omitting extinct or non-sampled lineages. Extending the work of Stadler and collaborators, this paper focuses on the distribution of branch lengths in phylogenetic trees arising under a constant-rate birth-death model. We derive branch length distributions of interior branches with and without random sampling of individuals of the extant population. We establish that branches connected to the tree leaves and interior branches behave very differently under sampling: pendant branches get longer as the sampling probability reaches zero, whereas the distribution of interior branches quickly reaches an asymptotic state.</description>

      <title>A symmetry-based approach to species-rich ecological communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Disordered systems theory provides powerful tools to analyze the generic behaviors of highdimensional systems, such as species-rich ecological communities or neural networks. By assuming randomness in their interactions, universality ensures that many microscopic details are irrelevant to system-wide dynamics; but the choice of a random ensemble still limits the generality of results. We show here, in the context of ecological dynamics, that these analytical tools do not require a specific choice of ensemble, and that solutions can be found based only on a fundamental rotational symmetry in the interactions, encoding the idea that traits can be recombined into new species without altering global features. Dynamical outcomes then depend on the spectrum of the interaction matrix as a free parameter, allowing us to bridge between results found in different models of interactions, and extend beyond them to previously unidentified behaviors. The distinctive feature of ecological models is the possibility of species extinctions, which leads to an increased universality of dynamics as the fraction of extinct species increases. We expect that these findings can inform new developments in theoretical ecology as well as for other families of complex systems.</description>

      <title>Decoding the interaction mediators from landscape-induced spatial patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interactions between organisms are mediated by an intricate network of physico-chemical substances and other organisms. Understanding the dynamics of mediators and how they shape the population spatial distribution is key to predict ecological outcomes and how they would be transformed by changes in environmental constraints. However, due to the inherent complexity involved, this task is often unfeasible, from the empirical and theoretical perspectives. In this paper, we make progress in addressing this central issue, creating a bridge that provides a two-way connection between the features of the ensemble of underlying mediators and the wrinkles in the population density induced by a landscape defect (or spatial perturbation). The bridge is constructed by applying the Feynman-Vernon decomposition, which disentangles the influences among the focal population and the mediators in a compact way. This is achieved though an interaction kernel, which effectively incorporates the mediators' degrees of freedom, explaining the emergence of nonlocal influence between individuals, an ad hoc assumption in modeling population dynamics. Concrete examples are worked out and reveal the complexity behind a possible top-down inference procedure.</description>
