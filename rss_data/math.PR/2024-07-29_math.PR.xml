      <title>Cutoff for the logistic SIS epidemic model with self-infection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a variant of the classical Markovian logistic SIS epidemic model on a complete graph, which has the additional feature that healthy individuals can become infected without contacting an infected member of the population. This additional ``self-infection'' is used to model situations where there is an unknown source of infection or an external disease reservoir, such as an animal carrier population. In contrast to the classical logistic SIS epidemic model, the version with self-infection has a non-degenerate stationary distribution, and we show that it exhibits the cutoff phenomenon, which is a sharp transition in time from one to zero of the total variation distance to stationarity. While this result is interesting in its own right, an additional contribution of our work is that the proof illustrates a recently formalised methodology of Barbour, Brightwell and Luczak, which can be used to show cutoff via a combination of concentration of measure inequalities and coupling techniques.</description>

      <title>Mean-field control of non exchangeable systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the optimal control of mean-field systems with heterogeneous and asymmetric interactions. This leads to considering a family of controlled Brownian diffusion processes with dynamics depending on the whole collection of marginal probability laws. We prove the well-posedness of such systems and define the control problem together with its related value function. We next prove a law invariance property for the value function which allows us to work on the set of collections of probability laws. We show that the value function satisfies a dynamic programming principle (DPP) on the flow of collections of probability measures. We also derive a chain rule for a class of regular functions along the flows of collections of marginal laws of diffusion processes. Combining the DPP and the chain rule, we prove that the value function is a viscosity solution of a Bellman dynamic programming equation in a $L^2$-set of Wasserstein space-valued functions.</description>

      <title>Exact expressions for the maximal probability that all $k$-wise independent bits are 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $M(n, k, p)$ denote the maximum probability of the event $X_1 = X_2 = \cdots = X_n=1$ under a $k$-wise independent distribution whose marginals are Bernoulli random variables with mean $p$. A long-standing question is to calculate $M(n, k, p)$ for all values of $n,k,p$. This question has been partially addressed by several authors, primarily with the goal of answering asymptotic questions. The present paper focuses on obtaining exact expressions for this probability. To this end, we provide closed-form formulas of $M(n,k,p)$ for $p$ near 0 as well as $p$ near 1.</description>

      <title>The Gradient Flow of the Bass Functional in Martingale Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given $\mu$ and $\nu$, probability measures on $\mathbb R^d$ in convex order, a Bass martingale is arguably the most natural martingale starting with law $\mu$ and finishing with law $\nu$. Indeed, this martingale is obtained by stretching a reference Brownian motion so as to meet the data $\mu,\nu$. Unless $\mu$ is a Dirac, the existence of a Bass martingale is a delicate subject, since for instance the reference Brownian motion must be allowed to have a non-trivial initial distribution $\alpha$, not known in advance. Thus the key to obtaining the Bass martingale, theoretically as well as practically, lies in finding $\alpha$.
  In \cite{BaSchTsch23} it has been shown that $\alpha$ is determined as the minimizer of the so-called Bass functional. In the present paper we propose to minimize this functional by following its gradient flow, or more precisely, the gradient flow of its $L^2$-lift. In our main result we show that this gradient flow converges in norm to a minimizer of the Bass functional, and when $d=1$ we further establish that convergence is exponentially fast.</description>

      <title>Unstable Invariant Measures and Connecting Orbits of Cooperative McKean-Vlasov SDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A general framework for studying McKean-Vlasov SDEs via monotone dynamical systems is established in this paper. Under a cooperative condition, we show McKean-Vlasov SDEs admit a comparison principle with respect to the stochastic order, and generate monotone dynamical systems on the $2$-Wasserstein space. Our main results prove the existence of unstable invariant measures, total orderedness of invariant measures, and the existence of monotone connecting orbits between order-related invariant measures for general cooperative McKean-Vlasov SDEs. To achieve our goals, we adopt the theory of monotone dynamical systems, extend the connecting orbit theorem, and deduce a dichotomy structure of equilibria. This method is different from existing approaches, like propagation of chaos and Fokker-Planck equations. A wide range of classical examples are covered by our framework, such as granular media equations in double-well and multi-well confinement potentials with quadratic interaction, double-well landscapes with perturbation, and higher dimensional equations, even driven by multiplicative noises.</description>

      <title>Freeness for tensors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We pursue the current developments in random tensor theory by laying the foundations of a free probability theory for tensors and establish its relevance in the study of random tensors of high dimension. We give a definition of freeness associated to a collection of tensors of possibly different orders. Our definition reduces to the usual freeness when only tensors of order 2 are concerned. We define the free cumulants which are associated to this notion of tensor freeness. We prove that the basic models of random tensors are asymptotically free as the dimension goes to infinity. On the way, we establish Schwinger-Dyson loop equations associated to random tensors.</description>

      <title>Estimating the number of clusters of a Block Markov Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Clustering algorithms frequently require the number of clusters to be chosen in advance, but it is usually not clear how to do this. To tackle this challenge when clustering within sequential data, we present a method for estimating the number of clusters when the data is a trajectory of a Block Markov Chain. Block Markov Chains are Markov Chains that exhibit a block structure in their transition matrix. The method considers a matrix that counts the number of transitions between different states within the trajectory, and transforms this into a spectral embedding whose dimension is set via singular value thresholding. The number of clusters is subsequently estimated via density-based clustering of this spectral embedding, an approach inspired by literature on the Stochastic Block Model. By leveraging and augmenting recent results on the spectral concentration of random matrices with Markovian dependence, we show that the method is asymptotically consistent - in spite of the dependencies between the count matrix's entries, and even when the count matrix is sparse. We also present a numerical evaluation of our method, and compare it to alternatives.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of geometric random graphs with the Simple algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph reconstruction can efficiently detect the underlying topology of massive networks such as the Internet. Given a query oracle and a set of nodes, the goal is to obtain the edge set by performing as few queries as possible. An algorithm for graph reconstruction is the Simple algorithm (Mathieu &amp; Zhou, 2023), which reconstructs bounded-degree graphs in $\tilde{O}(n^{3/2})$ queries. We extend the use of this algorithm to the class of geometric random graphs with connection radius $r \sim n^k$, with diverging average degree. We show that for this class of graphs, the query complexity is $\tilde{O}(n^{2k+1})$ when k &gt; 3/20. This query complexity is up to a polylog(n) term equal to the number of edges in the graph, which means that the reconstruction algorithm is almost edge-optimal. We also show that with only $n^{1+o(1)}$ queries it is already possible to reconstruct at least 75% of the non-edges of a geometric random graph, in both the sparse and dense setting. Finally, we show that the number of queries is indeed of the same order as the number of edges on the basis of simulations.</description>

      <title>On the impossibility of detecting a late change-point in the preferential attachment random graph model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of late change-point detection under the preferential attachment random graph model with time dependent attachment function. This can be formulated as a hypothesis testing problem where the null hypothesis corresponds to a preferential attachment model with a constant affine attachment parameter $\delta_0$ and the alternative corresponds to a preferential attachment model where the affine attachment parameter changes from $\delta_0$ to $\delta_1$ at a time $\tau_n = n - \Delta_n$ where $0\leq \Delta_n \leq n$ and $n$ is the size of the graph. It was conjectured in Bet et al. that when observing only the unlabeled graph, detection of the change is not possible for $\Delta_n = o(n^{1/2})$. In this work, we make a step towards proving the conjecture by proving the impossibility of detecting the change when $\Delta_n = o(n^{1/3})$. We also study change-point detection in the case where the labelled graph is observed and show that change-point detection is possible if and only if $\Delta_n \to \infty$, thereby exhibiting a strong difference between the two settings.</description>

      <title>On reduced inertial PDE models for Cucker-Smale flocking dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In particle systems, flocking refers to the phenomenon where particles' individual velocities eventually align. The Cucker-Smale model is a well-known mathematical framework that describes this behavior. Many continuous descriptions of the Cucker-Smale model use PDEs with both particle position and velocity as independent variables, thus providing a full description of the particles mean-field limit (MFL) dynamics. In this paper, we introduce a novel reduced inertial PDE model consisting of two equations that depend solely on particle position. In contrast to other reduced models, ours is not derived from the MFL, but directly includes the model reduction at the level of the empirical densities, thus allowing for a straightforward connection to the underlying particle dynamics. We present a thorough analytical investigation of our reduced model, showing that: firstly, our reduced PDE satisfies a natural and interpretable continuous definition of flocking; secondly, in specific cases, we can fully quantify the discrepancy between PDE solution and particle system. Our theoretical results are supported by numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Learning Chaotic Systems and Long-Term Predictions with Neural Jump ODEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Path-dependent Neural Jump ODE (PD-NJ-ODE) is a model for online prediction of generic (possibly non-Markovian) stochastic processes with irregular (in time) and potentially incomplete (with respect to coordinates) observations. It is a model for which convergence to the $L^2$-optimal predictor, which is given by the conditional expectation, is established theoretically. Thereby, the training of the model is solely based on a dataset of realizations of the underlying stochastic process, without the need of knowledge of the law of the process. In the case where the underlying process is deterministic, the conditional expectation coincides with the process itself. Therefore, this framework can equivalently be used to learn the dynamics of ODE or PDE systems solely from realizations of the dynamical system with different initial conditions. We showcase the potential of our method by applying it to the chaotic system of a double pendulum. When training the standard PD-NJ-ODE method, we see that the prediction starts to diverge from the true path after about half of the evaluation time. In this work we enhance the model with two novel ideas, which independently of each other improve the performance of our modelling setup. The resulting dynamics match the true dynamics of the chaotic system very closely. The same enhancements can be used to provably enable the PD-NJ-ODE to learn long-term predictions for general stochastic datasets, where the standard model fails. This is verified in several experiments.</description>

      <title>McKean-Vlasov PDE with Irregular Drift and Applications to Large Deviations for Conservative SPDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.13142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.13142v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by [Fehrman, Gess; Invent. Math., 2023], we provide a fine analysis of the McKean-Vlasov PDE with singular interactions and drift terms of square root form. As the corresponding skeleton equation of Dean-Kawasaki equation with singular interactions (a stochastic, conservative PDE), it determines the rate function of small noise large deviations. By imposing Ladyzhenskaya-Prodi-Serrin type conditions on the interaction kernel, we establish the large deviations in the framework of stochastic renormalized kinetic solution, when the intensity and the correlation of the noise are simultaneously sent to $0$ under a suitable scaling. This result contributes to demonstrating the consistency between the macroscopic fluctuation theory associated with singular interacting mean-field systems and fluctuating hydrodynamics related to the Dean-Kawasaki equation. As an application, we also obtain large deviations for the other stochastic conservative PDE called fluctuating Ising-Kac-Kawasaki dynamics. It is of great importance in exploring fluctuations of Kawasaki dynamical Ising-Kac model, since they formally exhibits the same key features in terms of Gaussian fluctuations, large deviations, and scaling limits near criticality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.12288v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we generalize the log-Sobolev inequalities to R\'enyi--Sobolev inequalities by replacing the entropy with the two-parameter entropy, which is a generalized version of entropy and closely related to R\'enyi divergences. We derive the sharp nonlinear dimension-free version of this kind of inequalities. Interestingly, the resultant inequalities show a transition phenomenon depending on the parameters. We then connect R\'enyi--Sobolev inequalities to contractive and data-processing inequalities, concentration inequalities, and spectral graph theory. Our proofs in this paper are based on the information-theoretic characterization of the R\'enyi--Sobolev inequalities, as well as the method of types.</description>

      <title>Regularization by rough Kraichnan noise for the generalised SQG equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12181v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the generalised Surface Quasi-Geostrophic (gSQG) equations in $\mathbb R^2$ with parameter $\beta\in (0,1)$, an active scalar model interpolating between SQG ($\beta=1$) and the 2D Euler equations ($\beta=0$) in vorticity form. Existence of weak $(L^1\cap L^p)$-valued solutions in the deterministic setting is known, but their uniqueness is open. We show that the addition of a rough Stratonovich transport noise of Kraichnan type regularizes the PDE, providing strong existence and pathwise uniqueness of solutions for initial data $\theta_0\in L^1\cap L^p$, for suitable values $p\in[2,\infty]$ related to the regularity degree $\alpha$ of the noise and the singularity degree $\beta$ of the velocity field; in particular, we can cover any $\beta\in (0,1)$ for suitable $\alpha$ and $p$ and we can reach a suitable ("critical") threshold. The result also holds in the presence of external forcing $f\in L^1_t (L^1\cap L^p)$ and solutions are shown to depend continuously on the data of the problem; furthermore, they are well approximated by vanishing viscosity and regular approximations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13457v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a new framework for establishing approximate factorization of entropy on arbitrary probability spaces, using a geometric notion known as non-negative sectional curvature. The resulting estimates are equivalent to entropy subadditivity and generalized Brascamp-Lieb inequalities, and provide a sharp modified log-Sobolev inequality for the Gibbs sampler of several particle systems in both continuous and discrete settings. The method allows us to obtain simple proofs of known results, as well as some new inequalities. We illustrate this through various applications, including discrete Gaussian free fields on arbitrary networks, the down-up walk on uniform $n$-sets, the uniform measure over permutations, and the uniform measure on the unit sphere in $\R^n$. Our method also yields a simple, coupling-based proof of the celebrated logarithmic Sobolev inequality for Langevin diffusions in a convex potential, which is one of the most emblematic applications of the Bakry-\'Emery criterion.</description>

We assume coupling constant $\Gamma=2$ and that the number $n$ of particles is large. We find that the correlation functions decay slowly along the edges of the wall, in a narrow interface stretching a distance of order $1/n$ from the hard edge. At distances much larger than $1/\sqrt{n}$, the effect of the hard wall is negligible and pair correlation functions decay very quickly, and in between sits an interpolating interface that we call the ``semi-hard edge''.
  More precisely, we provide asymptotics for the correlation kernel $K_{n}(z,w)$ as $n\to\infty$ in two microscopic regimes (with either $|z-w| = \mathcal{O} (1/\sqrt{n})$ or $|z-w| = \mathcal{O} (1/n)$), as well as in three macroscopic regimes (with $|z-w| \asymp 1$). For some of these regimes, the asymptotics involve oscillatory theta functions and weighted Szeg\H{o} kernels.</description>

      <title>Consequences of the random matrix solution to the Peterson-Thom conjecture</title>

Abstract: In this paper we show various new structural properties of free group factors using the recent resolution (due independently to Belinschi-Capitaine and Bordenave-Collins) of the Peterson-Thom conjecture. These results include the resolution to the coarseness conjecture independently due to the first-named author and Popa, a generalization of Ozawa-Popa's celebrated strong solidity result using vastly more general versions of the normalizer (and in an ultraproduct setting), a dichotomy result for intertwining of maximal amenable subalgebras of interpolated free group factors, as well as application to ultraproduct embeddings of nonamenable subalgebras of interpolated free group factors.</description>

      <title>Online Differentially Private Synthetic Data Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08012v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a polynomial-time algorithm for online differentially private synthetic data generation. For a data stream within the hypercube $[0,1]^d$ and an infinite time horizon, we develop an online algorithm that generates a differentially private synthetic dataset at each time $t$. This algorithm achieves a near-optimal accuracy bound of $O(\log(t)t^{-1/d})$ for $d\geq 2$ and $O(\log^{4.5}(t)t^{-1})$ for $d=1$ in the 1-Wasserstein distance. This result extends the previous work on the continual release model for counting queries to Lipschitz queries. Compared to the offline case, where the entire dataset is available at once, our approach requires only an extra polylog factor in the accuracy bound.</description>

      <title>Symmetries in Overparametrized Neural Networks: A Mean-Field View</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19995v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a Mean-Field (MF) view of the learning dynamics of overparametrized Artificial Neural Networks (NN) under data symmetric in law wrt the action of a general compact group $G$. We consider for this a class of generalized shallow NNs given by an ensemble of $N$ multi-layer units, jointly trained using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and possibly symmetry-leveraging (SL) techniques, such as Data Augmentation (DA), Feature Averaging (FA) or Equivariant Architectures (EA). We introduce the notions of weakly and strongly invariant laws (WI and SI) on the parameter space of each single unit, corresponding, respectively, to $G$-invariant distributions, and to distributions supported on parameters fixed by the group action (which encode EA). This allows us to define symmetric models compatible with taking $N\to\infty$ and give an interpretation of the asymptotic dynamics of DA, FA and EA in terms of Wasserstein Gradient Flows describing their MF limits. When activations respect the group action, we show that, for symmetric data, DA, FA and freely-trained models obey the exact same MF dynamic, which stays in the space of WI laws and minimizes therein the population risk. We also give a counterexample to the general attainability of an optimum over SI laws. Despite this, quite remarkably, we show that the set of SI laws is also preserved by the MF dynamics even when freely trained. This sharply contrasts the finite-$N$ setting, in which EAs are generally not preserved by unconstrained SGD. We illustrate the validity of our findings as $N$ gets larger in a teacher-student experimental setting, training a student NN to learn from a WI, SI or arbitrary teacher model through various SL schemes. We last deduce a data-driven heuristic to discover the largest subspace of parameters supporting SI distributions for a problem, that could be used for designing EA with minimal generalization error.</description>
