      <title>Peaks in weak lensing mass maps for cluster astrophysics and cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clusters of galaxies can be identified from peaks in weak lensing aperture mass maps constructed from weak lensing shear catalogs. Such purely gravitational cluster selection considerably differs from traditional cluster selections based on baryonic properties of clusters. In this review, we present the basics and applications of weak lensing shear-selected cluster samples. Detailed studies of baryonic properties of shear-selected clusters shed new light on cluster astrophysics. The purely gravitational selection suggests that the selection function can be quantified more easily and robustly, which is crucial for deriving accurate cosmological constraints from the abundance of shear-selected clusters. The recent advance of shear-selected cluster studies is driven by the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam survey, in which more than 300 shear-selected clusters with the signal-to-noise ration greater than 5 are identified. It is argued that various systematic effects in the cosmological analysis can be mitigated by carefully choosing the set-up of the analysis, including the choice of the kernel functions and the source galaxy sample.</description>

      <title>HOD-informed prior for EFT-based full-shape analyses of LSS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To improve the performance of full-shape analyses of large-scale structure, we consider using a halo occupation distribution (HOD)-informed prior for the effective field theory (EFT) nuisance parameters. We generate 320 000 mock galaxy catalogs using 10 000 sets of HOD parameters across 32 simulation boxes with different cosmologies. We measure and fit the redshift-space power spectra using a fast emulator of the EFT model, and the resulting best-fit EFT parameter distributions are used to create the prior. This prior effectively constrains the EFT nuisance parameter space, limiting it to the space of HOD-mocks that can be well fit by a EFT model. We have tested the stability of the prior under different configurations, including the effect of varying the HOD sample distribution and the inclusion of the hexadecapole moment. We find that our HOD-informed prior and the cosmological parameter constraints derived using it are robust. While cosmological fits using the standard EFT prior suffer from prior effects, sometimes failing to recover the true cosmology within Bayesian credible intervals, the HOD-informed prior mitigates these issues and significantly improves cosmological parameter recovery for $\Lambda$CDM and beyond. This work lays the foundation for better full-shape large-scale structure analyses in current and upcoming galaxy surveys, making it a valuable tool for addressing key questions in cosmology.</description>

      <title>Shaping Dark Photon Spectral Distortions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cosmic microwave background (CMB) spectrum is an extraordinary tool for exploring physics beyond the Standard Model. The exquisite precision of the measurement makes it particularly sensitive to small effects caused by hidden sector interactions. In particular, CMB spectral distortions can unveil the existence of dark photons which are kinetically coupled to the standard photon. In this work, we use the COBE-FIRAS dataset to derive accurate and robust limits on photon-to-dark-photon oscillations for a large range of dark photon masses, from $10^{-10}$ to $10^{-4}$ eV. We consider in detail the redshift dependence of the bounds, computing CMB distortions due to photon injection/removal using a Green's function method. Our treatment improves on previous results, which had set limits studying energy injection/removal into baryons rather than photon injection/removal, or ignored the redshift evolution of distortions. The difference between our treatment and previous ones is particularly noticeable in the predicted spectral shape of the distortions, a smoking gun signature for photon-to-dark-photon oscillations. The characterization of the spectral shape is crucial for future CMB missions, which could improve the present sensitivity by orders of magnitude, exploring regions of the dark photon parameter space that are otherwise difficult to access.</description>

      <title>Main beam treatment in parametric, pixel-based component separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We implement a simple, main beam correction in the maximum-likelihood, parametric component separation approach, which allows on accounting for different beamwidths of input maps at different frequencies without any preprocessing. We validate the approach on full-sky and cut-sky simulations and discuss the importance and impact of the assumptions and simplifications.
  We find that, in the cases when the underlying sky model is indeed parametric, the method successfully recovers component spectral parameters and component maps at the pre-defined resolution.
  The improvement on the precision of the estimated spectral parameters is found to be minor due to the redness of the foreground angular spectra, however the method is potentially more accurate, in particular if the foreground properties display strong, spatial variability, as it does not assume commutation of the beam smoothing and mixing matrix operators. The method permits a reconstruction of the CMB map with a resolution significantly superior to that of the lowest resolution map used in the analysis and with the nearly optimal noise level, facilitating exploitation of the cosmological information contained on angular scales, which would be otherwise inaccessible.
  The method preserves all the advantages of a pixel-domain implementation of the parametric approach, and, as it deals with the beams in the harmonic domain, it can also straightforwardly account for spatially stationary map-domain noise correlations.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Axion-like Curvaton: Non-Gaussianity and Primordial Black Holes Without Large Power Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss a mechanism of primordial black hole (PBH) formation that does not require specific features in the inflationary potential, revisiting previous literature. In this mechanism, a light spectator field evolves stochastically during inflation and remains subdominant during the post-inflationary era. Even though the curvature power spectrum stays small at all scales, rare perturbations of the field probe a local maximum in its potential, leading to non-Gaussian tails in the distribution of curvature fluctuations, and to copious PBH production. For a concrete axion-like particle (ALP) scenario we analytically determine the distribution of the compaction function for perturbations, showing that it is characterized by a heavy tail, which produces an extended PBH mass distribution. We find the ALP mass and decay constant to be correlated with the PBH mass, for instance, an ALP with a mass $m_a = 5.4 \times 10^{14}$ eV and a decay constant $f_a = 4.6 \times 10^{-5} Mpl$ can lead to PBHs of mass $M_{\rm PBH} = 10^{21}$ g as the entire dark matter (DM) of the universe, and is testable in future PBH observations via lensing in the NGRST and mergers detectable in the LISA and ET Gravitational Waves (GW) detectors. We then extend our analysis to mixed ALP and PBH dark matter and Higgs-like spectator fields. We find that PBHs cluster strongly over all cosmological scales, clashing with CMB isocurvature bounds. We argue that this problem is shared by all PBH production from inflationary models that depend solely on large non-Gaussianity without a peak in the curvature power spectrum and discuss possible remedies.</description>

      <title>Polarization of active galactic nuclei with significant VLBI-Gaia displacements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerous studies have reported significant displacements in the coordinates of active galactic nuclei between measurements using radio interferometry techniques and those obtained by the Gaia space observatory. There is a consensus that these discrepancies do indeed manifest astrometrically resolved sub-components of AGN rather than random measurement noise. Among other evidence, it has been reported that AGN with VLBI-to-Gaia displacements (VGD) pointing downstream their parsec-scale radio jets exhibit higher optical polarization compared to sources with the opposite VGD orientation. We aim to verify this previously reported connection between optical polarization and VGD-jet angle using a larger dataset of polarimetric measurements and updated Gaia DR3 positions. We also seek additional evidence supporting the disc-jet dichotomy as an explanation of such a connection by using mm-wave polarization and multi-band optical polarization measurements. We performed optical polarimetric observations of 157 AGN using three telescopes. We cross-match public astrometric data from VLBI and Gaia experiments, obtain corresponding positional displacements, and join this catalog with the polarimetric and jet directions data. AGN with downstream VGD are confirmed to have significantly higher optical fractional polarization than the upstream sample. At the same time, the mm-wavelength polarization of the two samples demonstrates very similar distributions. Our results support the hypothesis that the VLBI-to-Gaia displacements pointing down the radio jet are likely caused by a component in the jet emitting highly polarized synchrotron radiation and dominating in the overall optical emission. The upstream-oriented VGD are likely to be produced by the low-polarized emission of the central engine sub-components dominating in the optical.</description>

      <title>Phase Separation Baryogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Distinct behavior of decaying particles in true and false vacua of the theory can lead to enhanced generation of baryon asymmetry, a scenario we call \textit{phase separation baryogenesis}. We demonstrate that for leptogenesis this naturally allows for right handed neutrinos to generate resonantly-enhanced lepton asymmetry without fine-tuning of their masses as in typical theories. Our mechanism allows for a variety of neutrino mass hierarchies and hence possible novel connections with observations. We present a concrete realization in a minimal model with a scalar field undergoing a phase transition.</description>

      <title>On the Gravitational Wave Counterpart to a Gamma-ray Galactic Center Signal from Millisecond Pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The new tools of gravitational wave and multi-messenger astronomy allow for the study of astrophysical phenomenon in new ways and enables light to be shed on some of the longest-enduring mysteries of high-energy astrophysics. Among the latter stands the Galactic center gamma-ray excess, associated with a source whose nature could be annihilating dark matter or a yet-unresolved population of millisecond pulsars (MSPs). MSPs are most likely asymmetric about their axis of rotation, and are thus thought to also source quasi-monochromatic gravitational waves, that dark matter processes would not emit. Using statistical methods, we simulate realistic MSP population samples with differing morphology and moment of inertia, that could give rise to the gamma-ray excess, and we compute the corresponding gravitational wave signal amplitude and frequency. We find that the gravitational wave signal frequency likely ranges between $\sim$200 and 1400 Hz, and that the collective dimensionless strain from the center of the Galaxy has an amplitude between $10^{-26}$ and $10^{-24}$, thus most likely beyond current and near-term detectors, unless the unresolved MSPs are extraordinarily gamma-ray dim.</description>

      <title>Discovery potential of a long-lived partner of inelastic dark matter at MATHUSLA in $U(1)_{X_3}$ extension of the standard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the discovery potential at the MATHUSLA experiment of a long-lived particle (LLP), which is the heavier state of inelastic scalar dark matter (DM) in third generation-philic $U(1)$ ($U(1)_{X_3}$) extension of the standard model. Since the heavier state and DM state form the complex scalar charged under the $U(1)_{X_3}$, it is natural that the heavier state $P$ is almost degenerate with the DM state and hence long-lived. We find that third generation-philic right-handed $U(1)$, $U(1)_{R_3}$, model is the most interesting, because third generation-philic models are less constrained by the current experimental results and right-handed $U(1)$ interactions leave visible final decay products without produing neutrinos. For a benchmark of the model parameters consistent with the current phenomenological constraints, we find that the travel distance of the LLP can be $\mathcal{O}(100)$ m and the LLP production cross section at the 14 TeV LHC can be $\mathcal{O}(10)$ fb. Thus, we conclude that the LLP can be discovered at the MATHUSLA with a sufficiently large number of LLP decay events inside the MATHUSLA detector.</description>

      <title>The DESI One-Percent Survey: Modelling the clustering and halo occupation of all four DESI tracers with Uchuu</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.06315v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present results from a set of mock lightcones for the DESI One-Percent Survey, created from the Uchuu simulation. This This 8 (Gpc/h)^3 N-body simulation comprises 2.1 trillion particles and provides high-resolution dark matter (sub)haloes in the framework of the Planck base-LCDM cosmology. Employing the subhalo abundance matching (SHAM) technique, we populate the Uchuu (sub)haloes with all four DESI tracers (BGS, LRG, ELG and QSO) to z = 2.1. Our method accounts for redshift evolution as well as the clustering dependence on luminosity and stellar mass. The two-point clustering statistics of the DESI One-Percent Survey generally agree with predictions from Uchuu across scales ranging from 0.3 Mpc/h to 100 Mpc/h for the BGS and across scales ranging from 5 Mpc/h to 100 Mpc/h for the other tracers. We observe some differences in clustering statistics that can be attributed to incompleteness of the massive end of the stellar mass function of LRGs, our use of a simplified galaxy-halo connection model for ELGs and QSOs, and cosmic variance. We find that at the high precision of Uchuu, the shape of the halo occupation distribution (HOD) of the BGS and LRG samples are not fully captured by the standard 5-parameter HOD model. However, the ELGs and QSOs show agreement with an adopted Gaussian distribution for central haloes with a power law for satellites. We observe fair agreement in the large-scale bias measurements between data and mock samples, although the BGS data exhibits smaller bias values, likely due to cosmic variance. The bias dependence on absolute magnitude, stellar mass and redshift aligns with that of previous surveys. These results provide DESI with tools to generate high-fidelity lightcones for the remainder of the survey and enhance our understanding of the galaxy-halo connection.</description>

      <title>Standard Siren Cosmology with Gravitational Waves from Binary Black Hole Mergers in Active Galaxy Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.01330v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The detection of gravitational waves (GW) with an electromagnetic counterpart enabled the first Hubble Constant $H_0$ measurement through the standard siren method. Current constraints suggest that $\sim 20-30\%$ of LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA (LVK) Binary Black Hole (BBH) mergers might occur in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) disks. The claim for a possible association of several BBH mergers with flaring AGNs suggests that cosmological analyses using BBH and AGNs might be promising. We explore standard siren analyses through a method that takes into account the presence of background flaring AGNs, without requiring a unique host galaxy identification, and apply it to realistic GW simulations. Depending on the fraction of LVK BBHs that induce flares, we expect to constrain $H_0$ at the $\sim 6-7\%$ ($\sim 4-5\%$) precision with $\sim 2-3$ years or $\sim 160-240$ events ($\sim 1$ year or $500$ events) of LVK at design (A+) sensitivity, assuming that systematic BBH follow-up searches are performed. %Assuming a more restrictive $\Omega_{\rm m}$ prior and that at least $20\%$ of BBHs produces detectable flares, we may reach a $3\%$ ($2\%$) precision in $H_0$ after 2 (1) year of LVK at design (A+) sensitivity. We also show that in a scenario where only $\sim 1\%$ of the BBHs induce detectable flares it is possible to achieve an $H_0$ precision from $7.5\%$ to $15\%$ with $\sim 240$ events. In addition, a $\sim 5-27\%$ precision is achievable with complete AGN catalogs and 1 year of LVK run, without the need of any flare identification.</description>

      <title>Towards unbiased recovery of cosmic filament properties: the role of spine curvature and optimized smoothing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18669v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cosmic filaments, the most prominent features of the cosmic web, possibly hold untapped potential for cosmological inference. While it is natural to expect the structure of filaments to show universality similar to that seen in dark matter halos, the lack of agreement between different filament finders on what constitutes a filament has hampered progress on this topic. We initiate a programme to systematically investigate and uncover possible universal features in the phase space structure of cosmic filaments, by generating particle realizations of mock filaments with $\textit{a priori}$ known properties. Using these, we identify an important source of bias in the extraction of radial density profiles, which occurs when the local curvature $\kappa$ of the spine exceeds a threshold determined by the filament thickness. This bias exists even for perfectly determined spines, thus affecting $\textit{all}$ filament finders. We show that this bias can be nearly eliminated by simply discarding the regions with the highest $\kappa$, with little loss of precision. An additional source of bias is the noise generated by the filament finder when identifying the spine, which depends on both the finder algorithm as well as intrinsic properties of the individual filament. We find that, to mitigate this bias, it is essential not only to smooth the estimated spine, but to $\textit{optimize}$ this smoothing separately for each filament. We propose a novel optimization based on minimizing the estimated filament thickness, along with Fourier space smoothing. We implement these techniques using two tools, $\texttt{FilGen}$ which generates mock filaments and $\texttt{FilAPT}$ which analyses and processes them. We expect these tools to be useful in calibrating the performance of filament finders, thereby enabling searches for filament universality.</description>

      <title>Exploration of the polarization angle variability of the Crab Nebula with POLARBEAR and its application to the search for axion-like particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02096v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Crab Nebula, also known as Tau A, is a polarized astronomical source at millimeter wavelengths. It has been used as a stable light source for polarization angle calibration in millimeter-wave astronomy. However, it is known that its intensity and polarization vary as a function of time at a variety of wavelengths. Thus, it is of interest to verify the stability of the millimeter-wave polarization. If detected, polarization variability may be used to better understand the dynamics of Tau~A, and for understanding the validity of Tau~A as a calibrator. One intriguing application of such observation is to use it for the search of axion-like particles (ALPs). Ultralight ALPs couple to photons through a Chern-Simons term, and induce a temporal oscillation in the polarization angle of linearly polarized sources. After assessing a number of systematic errors and testing for internal consistency, we evaluate the variability of the polarization angle of the Crab Nebula using 2015 and 2016 observations with the 150 GHz POLARBEAR instrument. We place a median 95% upper bound of polarization oscillation amplitude $A &lt; 0.065^\circ$ over the oscillation frequencies from $0.75~\mathrm{year}^{-1}$ to $0.66~\mathrm{hour}^{-1}$. Assuming that no sources other than ALP are causing Tau A's polarization angle variation, that the ALP constitutes all the dark matter, and that the ALP field is a stochastic Gaussian field, this bound translates into a median 95% upper bound of ALP-photon coupling $g_{a\gamma\gamma} &lt; 2.16\times10^{-12}\,\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}\times(m_a/10^{-21} \mathrm{eV})$ in the mass range from $9.9\times10^{-23} \mathrm{eV}$ to $7.7\times10^{-19} \mathrm{eV}$. This demonstrates that this type of analysis using bright polarized sources is as competitive as those using the polarization of cosmic microwave background in constraining ALPs.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Neutrino Decoupling and its Observable Imprints: Insights from Entropic-Dual Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19038v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Very different processes characterize the decoupling of neutrinos to form the cosmic neutrino background (C$\nu$B) and the much later decoupling of photons from thermal equilibrium to form the cosmic microwave background (CMB). The C$\nu$B emerges from the fuzzy, energy-dependent neutrinosphere and encodes the physics operating in the early universe in the temperature range $T\sim 10\,{\rm MeV}$ to $T\sim10\,{\rm keV}$. This is the epoch where beyond Standard Model (BSM) physics may be influential in setting the light element abundances and the necessarily distorted fossil neutrino energy spectra. Here we use techniques honed in extensive CMB studies to analyze the C$\nu$B as calculated in detailed neutrino energy transport and nuclear reaction simulations. Our moment method, relative entropy, and differential visibility approach can leverage future high precision CMB and primordial abundance measurements to provide new insights into the C$\nu$B and any BSM physics it encodes. We demonstrate that the evolution of the energy spectrum of the C$\nu$B throughout the weak decoupling epoch is accurately captured in the Standard Model by only three parameters per species, a non-trivial conclusion given the deviation from thermal equilibrium. Furthermore, we can interpret each of the three parameters as physical characteristics of a non-equilibrium system. The success of our compact description within the Standard Model motivates its use also in BSM scenarios. We demonstrate how observations of primordial light element abundances can be used to place constraints on the C$\nu$B energy spectrum, deriving response functions that can be applied for general C$\nu$B spectral distortions. Combined with the description of those deviations that we develop here, our methods provide a convenient and powerful framework to constrain the impact of BSM physics on the C$\nu$B.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Hole Interpretation in Subsolar Mass Gravitational Wave Candidate SSM200308</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03328v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the recent second part of the third observation run by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration, a candidate with sub-solar mass components was reported, which we labelled as SSM200308. This study investigates the premise that primordial black holes (PBHs), arising from Gaussian perturbation collapses, could explain SSM200308. Through Bayesian analysis, we obtain the primordial curvature power spectrum that leads to the merger rate of PBHs aligning with observational data as long as they constitute {$f_{\mathrm{PBH}}=5.66^{+58.68}_{-5.44}\times 10^{-2}$ } of the dark matter. However, while the gravitational wave (GW) background from binary PBH mergers is within current observational limits, the scalar-induced GWs associated with PBH formation exceed the constraints imposed by pulsar timing arrays, challenging the Gaussian perturbation collapse PBH model as the source of SSM200308.</description>

      <title>Deep learning for cosmological parameter inference from a dark matter halo density field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09483v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a lightweight deep convolutional neural network (lCNN) to estimate cosmological parameters from simulated three-dimensional dark matter (DM) halo distributions and associated statistics. The training dataset comprises 2000 realizations of a cubic box with a side length of 1000 $h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$, and interpolated over a cubic grid of $300^3$ voxels, with each simulation produced using $512^3$ DM particles and $512^3$ neutrinos. Under the flat $\Lambda$CDM model, simulations vary standard six cosmological parameters including $\Omega_m$, $\Omega_b$, $h$, $n_s$, $\sigma_8$, $w$, along with the neutrino mass sum, $M_\nu$. We find that: 1) within the framework of lCNN, extracting large-scale structure information is more efficient from the halo density field compared to relying on the statistical quantities including the power spectrum, the two-point correlation function, and the coefficients from wavelet scattering transform; 2) combining the halo density field with its Fourier transformed counterpart enhances predictions, while augmenting the training dataset with measured statistics further improves performance; 3) achieving high accuracy in inferring $\Omega_m$, $h$, and $\sigma_8$ by the neural network model, while being inefficient in predicting $\Omega_b$, { $n_s$}, $M_\nu$ and $w$; 4) { compared to the simple fully connected network trained with three statistical quantities, our CNN yields statistically reduced errors, showing improvements of approximately 23\% for $\Omega_m$, 11\% for $h$, 8\% for $n_s$, and 21\% for $\sigma_8$. Additionally, in comparison with the likelihood-based analysis on $P(k)$ data, our CNN provides much tighter constraints on parameters, especially on $\Omega_m$ and $\sigma_8$.} Our study emphasizes this lCNN-based novel approach in extracting large-scale structure information and estimating cosmological parameters.</description>

      <title>Analytic model for the statistics of ultra-high magnification events</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16749v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Highly magnified individual stars such as Icarus and Earendel have recently been observed near critical curves of galaxy clusters with Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations. These stars are estimated to be magnified with a factor of more than a few thousands. In addition to the smooth mass distribution in the macro-lens model, the distribution of microlenses originating from, for instance, intracluster stars affects the event rate and the peak magnification significantly. We propose an analytic model of the high-magnification tail of the probability distribution function (PDF) in which the probability is assumed to be proportional to the number of independent microlens critical curves. Our model can explain the parameter dependence of the PDF on the mass fraction of the microlenses and the background magnification seen in ray-tracing simulations. The effect of a finite source size is also studied to derive a fitting formula for the suppression factor. For an application of our model, we calculate the event rate of the Icarus-like system and the probability distribution of observed positions of such system, showing good agreement with the HST observations. Our model predicts a complicated dependence of the probability distribution of observed positions of highly magnified events on the magnification threshold.</description>

      <title>Ultralight Dark Matter Search with Space-Time Separated Atomic Clocks and Cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13723v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We devise and demonstrate a method to search for non-gravitational couplings of ultralight dark matter to standard model particles using space-time separated atomic clocks and cavity-stabilized lasers. By making use of space-time separated sensors, which probe different values of an oscillating dark matter field, we can search for couplings that cancel in typical local experiments. This provides sensitivity to both the temporal and spatial fluctuations of the field. We demonstrate this method using existing data from a frequency comparison of lasers stabilized to two optical cavities connected via a 2220 km fiber link [Schioppo et al., Nat. Commun. 13, 212 (2022)], and from the atomic clocks on board the Global Position System satellites. Our analysis results in constraints on the coupling of scalar dark matter to electrons, d_me, for masses between 1e-19 eV/c^2 and 2e-15 eV/c^2. These are the first constraints on d_me alone in this mass range.</description>

      <title>New slow-roll approximations for inflation in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06147v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose new slow-roll approximations for inflationary models with the Gauss-Bonnet term. We find more accurate expressions of the standard slow-roll parameters as functions of the scalar field. To check the accuracy of approximations considered we construct inflationary models with quadratic and quartic monomial potentials and the Gauss-Bonnet term. Numerical analysis of these models indicates that the proposed inflationary scenarios do not contradict to the observation data. New slow-roll approximations show that the constructed inflationary models are in agreement with the observation data, whereas one does not get allowed observational parameters at the same values of parameters of the constructed models in the standard slow-roll approximation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04062v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The question of geodesic completeness of cosmological spacetimes has recently received renewed scrutiny. A particularly interesting result is the observation that the well-known Borde-Guth-Vilenkin (BGV) theorem may misdiagnose geodesically complete cosmologies. We propose a simple amendment to the BGV theorem which addresses such loopholes while retaining much of its generality. We give straightforward proofs of some recently offered conjectures concerning (generalized) Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker spacetimes: geodesic completeness implies (i) the existence of a bounce, loitering phase or an emergent cosmology, and (ii) a phase of accelerated expansion with strictly increasing Hubble rate. Our results are purely kinematic and do not assume general relativity or energy conditions.</description>

      <title>Axion Stars: Mass Functions and Constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09499v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The QCD axion and axion-like particles, as leading dark matter candidates, can also have interesting implications for dark matter substructures if the Peccei-Quinn symmetry is broken after inflation. In such a scenario, axion perturbations on small scales will lead to the formation of axion miniclusters at matter-radiation equality, and subsequently the formation of axion stars. Such compact objects open new windows for indirect searches for axions. We compute the axion star mass function based on recent axion minicluster studies and Bose star simulations. Applying this mass function, we find post-inflation axion-like particles with masses $1.8 \times 10^{-21}~{\rm eV}&lt;m_a&lt; 3.3 \times 10^{-17}~{\rm eV}$ are constrained by the lack of dynamical heating of stars in ultrafaint dwarfs. We also find that current microlensing surveys are insensitive to QCD axion stars. While we focus on the gravitational detectability of axion stars, our result can be directly applied to other interesting signatures of axion stars, e.g. their decay to photons, that require as input the abundance, mass, and density distribution of axion stars.</description>

      <title>Deep extragalactic HI survey of the COSMOS field with FAST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16597v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a deep HI survey at L-band conducted with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) over the COSMOS field. This survey is strategically designed to overlap with the MIGHTEE COSMOS field, aiming to combine the sensitivity of the FAST and high-resolution of the MeerKAT. We observed the field with FAST for approximately 11 hours covering $\sim$2 square degrees, and reduced the raw data to HI spectral cubes over the frequency range 1310-1420 MHz. The FAST-HI data reach a median 3$\sigma$ column density of $N_{\rm HI}\sim2\times10^{17}$ cm$^{-2}$ over a 5 km s$^{-1}$ channel width, allowing for studies of the distribution of HI gas in various environments, such as in galaxies, the Circum-Galactic Medium (CGM) and Intergalactic Medium (IGM). We visually searched the spectral cubes for HI sources, and found a total of 80 HI detections, of which 56 have been cross-matched with the MIGHTEE-HI catalogue. With the cross-matched sources, we compare their HI masses and find that the total HI mass fraction in the IGM and CGM surrounding the galaxy pairs is statistically higher than the HI fraction surrounding the isolated galaxies by a difference of 13$\pm$4%, indicating that the CGM and IGM associated with interacting systems are richer in neutral hydrogen compared to those around isolated galaxies in the local Universe. We also describe several FAST-MeerKAT synergy projects, highlighting the full potential of exploiting both single-dish and interferometric observations to study the distribution and evolution of the diffuse HI gas.</description>
