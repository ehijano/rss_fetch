      <title>Performance of Silicon photomultipliers at low temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present experimental results of characterization of Silicon photomultipliers in a temperature range from 90~mK to 40~K. Two SiPMs, one from ONSEMI and one from Hamamatsu Photonics were tested. Operating voltage range, dark count rate, afterpulsing and photon detection efficiency were determined with illumination by 275 and 470 nm light fed into the cryostat via an optical fiber. A cryogenic shutter provided a true dark condition, where thermal radiation from room temperature is shielded and the thermal excitations in the chips are frozen. A second tunneling breakdown was observed at this condition, which substantially limits the operating voltage range for the temperatures 20-30 K. Below $\sim$5 K, both SiPMs recover to an operating over-voltage range of 3-5 V. We found the chips function through the entire tested temperature range, and are capable of withstanding thermal cycling with no major performance degradation.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Robust High-Precision Atomic Gravimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08550</link>

Abstract: Atomic gravimeters are the most accurate sensors for measuring gravity, yet a significant challenge lies in achieving high precision while also maintaining high dynamic range and robustness. Here, we develop a protocol for achieving robust high-precision atomic gravimetry based upon adaptive Bayesian quantum estimation. Our protocol incorporates a sequence of interferometry measurements taken with short to long interrogation times and offers several crucial advantages. Firstly, it enables a high dynamic range without the need to scan multiple fringes for pre-estimation, making it more efficient than the conventional frequentist method. Secondly, it improves robustness against noise, allowing for a significant improvement in measurement precision in noisy environments. The enhancement can be more than 5 times for a transportable gravimeter [Sci. Adv. 5, eaax0800 (2019)] and up to an order of magnitude for a state-of-the-art fountain gravimeter [Phys. Rev. A 88, 043610 (2013)]. Notably, by optimizing the interferometry sequence, our approach can improve the scaling of the measurement precision ($\Delta g_{est}$) versus the total interrogation time ($\tilde{T}$) to $\Delta g_{est} \propto \tilde{T}^{-2}$ or even better, in contrast to the conventional one $\Delta g_{est} \propto \tilde{T}^{-0.5}$. Our approach offers superior precision, increased dynamic range, and enhanced robustness, making it highly promising for a range of practical sensing applications.</description>

      <title>Non-classicality induces recombination in high-harmonic generation with circularly polarized fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11042v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-harmonic generation (HHG) is a nonlinear process in which a strong driving field interacts with a material, resulting in the frequency up-conversion of the driver into its high-order harmonics. This process is highly sensitive to the field's polarization: circular polarization, for instance, inhibits HHG. In this work, we demonstrate that the use of non-classical structured light enables HHG in this otherwise prohibitive configuration for classical drivers. In particular, we consider circularly polarized light with non-classical fluctuations, introduced via squeezing along one polarization direction, and show that these non-classical features prompt the HHG process, with the spectral properties of the emitted harmonics depending on the type of squeezing applied. We examine the electron dynamics during HHG, revealing that non-classical fluctuations act as an effective force that guides the electron trajectories toward recombination. This approach opens new pathways for integrating quantum optics in HHG, providing novel means of controlling the light-matter interaction dynamics.</description>
