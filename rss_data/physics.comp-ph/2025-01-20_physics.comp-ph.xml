      <title>Butterfly Patterns for Stretched Inhomogeneous Gel Networks using Large-Scale Molecular Dynamics Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-scale coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations of inhomogeneous gel networks were performed to investigate abnormal butterfly patterns in two-dimensional scattering. The networks were diamond lattice-based with distributions in the number of beads between the crosslink points. Remarkably, the results confirm that the abnormal butterfly pattern orig-inates from stronger inhomogeneity. For the examined systems, the range of scattering wavevector q for the normal butterfly pattern was markedly different from those for the abnormal butterfly patterns. The findings address an essential aspect of the discrepancy between theorical prediction and experimental observations.</description>

      <title>Temporal and topological partitioning in real-world growing networks for scale-free properties study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a method to study evolution rules and scale-free hypothesis of real-world growing networks using natural partitions of nodes and edges based on temporal and topological attributes, and analyzing degree distributions.
  We apply this method to the Software Heritage dataset, which collects software releases and revisions from open-source communities.Nodes with native temporal information does not fully capture the overall network dynamics, and degree distributions show greater regularity with fewer outliers, suggesting a more likely scale-free regime when examining networks derived from temporal and topological partitions.
  However, underlying aging, fitness, and inheritance mechanisms, along with chosen partitioning, hinder definitive conclusions and suggest that the very common ``pure parametric power-law'' hypothesis for the tail of degree distributions is too strong. Node's type derived from partions and changes in evolution rules, shown by variations in the average number of new edges per node over time, highlight the need for tools better suited for studying transient regimes and ease comparison of real-world networks with minimal models.</description>

      <title>Improved methodology for deep aquifer characterization using hydrogeological, self-potential, and magnetotellurics data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.10083v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Estimating subsurface properties like hydraulic conductivity using hydrogeological data alone is challenging in field sites with sparse wells. Geophysical data, including Self-potential (SP) and Magnetotelluric (MT), can improve understanding of hydrogeological structures and interpolate data between wells. However, determining hydraulic conductivity requires a proper petrophysical relationship between hydraulic conductivity and inferred geophysical properties, which may not exist or be unique. In this work, we propose a joint-inversion approach without assuming petrophysical relationships, using self-potential data to connect groundwater flow velocity to electrical potential differences, and MT data to estimate hydraulic conductivity and electrical conductivity. A spectral method is employed for the self-potential forward problem. To accelerate joint data inversion, a dimension reduction technique through the Principal Component Geostatistical Approach is used. The applicability and robustness of the joint-inversion method are demonstrated through inversion tests using hydrogeophysical data sets generated from subsurface models with and without petrophysical relationships. The joint hydraulic head-SP-MT data inversion can reasonably estimate hydraulic conductivity and electrical resistivity, even without knowledge of a one-to-one petrophysical relationship. On average, joint inversion yields a 25% improvement in hydraulic conductivity estimates compared to single data-type inversion. Our proposed joint inversion approach, with SP-data compensating for the absence of a known petrophysical relationship, provided close agreement with joint inversion of head and MT data using a known petrophysical relationship. Successful inversion tests demonstrate the usefulness of SP data in connecting hydrogeological properties and geophysical data without requiring a petrophysical relationship.</description>

      <title>Slip-dominated structural transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04066v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use molecular dynamics to show that plastic slip is a crucial component of the transformation mechanism of a square-to-triangular structural transition. The latter is a stylized analog of many other reconstructive phase transitions. To justify our conclusions we use a novel atomistically-informed mesoscopic representation of the field of lattice distortions in molecular dynamics simulations. Our approach reveals a hidden alternating slip distribution behind the seemingly homogeneous product phase which points to the fact that lattice invariant shears play a central role in this class of phase transformations. While the underlying pattern of anti-parallel displacements may be also interpreted as microscopic shuffling, its precise crystallographic nature strongly suggests the plasticity-centered interpretation.</description>

      <title>BullFrog: Multi-step perturbation theory as a time integrator for cosmological simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19049v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modelling the cosmic large-scale structure can be done through numerical N-body simulations or by using perturbation theory. Here, we present an N-body approach that effectively implements a multi-step forward model based on Lagrangian Perturbation Theory (LPT) in a $\Lambda$CDM Universe. This is achieved by introducing the second-order accurate BullFrog integrator, which automatically performs 2LPT time steps to second order without requiring the explicit computation of 2LPT displacements. Importantly, we show that BullFrog trajectories rapidly converge to the exact solution as the number of time steps increases, at any moment in time, even though 2LPT becomes invalid after shell-crossing. As a validation test, we compare BullFrog against other N-body integrators and high-order LPT, both for a realistic $\Lambda$CDM cosmology and for simulations with a sharp UV cutoff in the initial conditions. The latter scenario enables controlled experiments against LPT and, in practice, is particularly relevant for modelling coarse-grained fluids arising in the context of effective field theory. We demonstrate that BullFrog significantly improves upon other LPT-inspired integrators, such as FastPM and COLA, without incurring any computational overhead compared to standard N-body integrators. Implementing BullFrog in any existing N-body code is straightforward, particularly if FastPM is already integrated.</description>

      <title>High-Rank Irreducible Cartesian Tensor Decomposition and Bases of Equivariant Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18263v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Irreducible Cartesian tensors (ICTs) play a crucial role in the design of equivariant graph neural networks, as well as in theoretical chemistry and chemical physics. Meanwhile, the design space of available linear operations on tensors that preserve symmetry presents a significant challenge. The ICT decomposition and a basis of this equivariant space are difficult to obtain for high-rank tensors. After decades of research, Bonvicini (2024) recently achieves an explicit ICT decomposition for $n=5$ with factorial time/space complexity. In this work we, for the first time, obtains decomposition matrices for ICTs up to rank $n=9$ with reduced and affordable complexity, by constructing what we call path matrices. The path matrices are obtained via performing chain-like contractions with Clebsch-Gordan matrices following the parentage scheme. We prove and leverage that the concatenation of path matrices is an orthonormal change-of-basis matrix between the Cartesian tensor product space and the spherical direct sum spaces. Furthermore, we identify a complete orthogonal basis for the equivariant space, rather than a spanning set (Pearce-Crump, 2023), through this path matrices technique. To the best of our knowledge, this is also the first analytic, rather than numerical, method for theoretically obtaining arbitrary rank orthogonal ICT decomposition matrices and orthogonal equivariant bases. We further extend our result to the arbitrary tensor product and direct sum spaces, enabling free design between different spaces while keeping symmetry. The Python code is available at https://github.com/ShihaoShao-GH/ICT-decomposition-and-equivariant-bases, where the $n=6,\dots,9$ ICT decomposition matrices are obtained in 1s, 3s, 11s, and 4m32s on 28-cores Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 6330 CPU @ 2.00GHz, respectively.</description>
