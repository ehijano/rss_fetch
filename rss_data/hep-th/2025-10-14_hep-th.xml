      <title>Exact BPS double-kinks in generalized $\phi^4$, $\phi^6$ and sine-Gordon models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a $(1+1)$-dimensional theory with a single real scalar field $\phi$ whose kinematics is modified by a generalizing function $f(\phi)$. After briefly reviewing its Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) structure, we focus on a particular $f(\phi)$ to obtain analytic BPS double-kink solutions in three different models governed by the $\phi^4$, $\phi^6$, and sine-Gordon superpotentials. In all cases, the resulting double-kinks approach the boundaries by following an exponential decay, with the generalizing function controlling its dependence on $x$ and mass. We also calculate the BPS bound explicitly and study how the double kinks behave near the origin. The energy distribution of the novel BPS states engenders symmetric two-lump profiles for the $\phi^4$ and sine-Gordon superpotentials. Whereas, for the $\phi^6$ superpotential, the BPS energy profiles form asymmetric two-lumps.</description>

      <title>Baryons, skyrmions and $\theta$-periodicity anomaly in chiral and vector-like gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the solitons of chiral gauge theories and vector-like $SU(N)$ gauge theories with matter in mixed one and two-index representations. Focusing on the Color-flavor locked (CFL) phase, we compute the topology of the coset. In the Bars-Yanckielowicz (BY) models, where the selection rules arising from the unbroken symmetry group allow for the decay of any heavy baryon, we find that Skyrmions are absent. Skyrmions are absent also in the Georgi-Glashow (GG) models, where the selection rules are compatible with the existence of heavy baryons. This mismatch suggests that some deeper dynamical mechanism must be responsible with either the instability of heavy baryons or the unreliability of the Skyrme model in the low-energy EFT. In the vector-like models all the expected baryons are mirrored by Skyrmions. Then we turn to the study of domain walls. We determine some aspects of their dynamics by matching the $\theta$-periodicity anomaly. We find that, for complete CFL, there the $\theta$-periodicity anomaly is always matched without introducing new dynamical degrees of freedom in the low-energy EFT. If part of the color group is unbroken, new dynamical degrees of freedom must be added to the low-energy EFT with few exceptions. We also discuss the possibility that such models may develop pancakes, solitonic objects consisting of a metastable domain wall bounded by a vortex.</description>

      <title>Analytic results in conformal field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the 1980s, many exact results have been discovered in $2d$ CFT, from critical exponents to correlation functions to complete solutions of certain models. In $d&gt;2$, there is a wealth of numerical results as well as promising analytic approaches, but comparably fewer exact answers.
  The aim of this conference was to review the most promising analytic methods and results in CFT in any dimension. In particular we tried to understand to which extent the $2d$ methods can be extended to $d&gt;2$, and what is missing to exactly solve $d&gt;2$ CFTs.</description>

      <title>On thermal holographic RG flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Holographic Renormalization Group (RG) flows, described by Einstein gravity coupled to matter fields, have been thoroughly explored in the context of vacuum states. In this work, we shift the focus to thermal states. Using the Hamilton-Jacobi formalism for the coupled system, we derive the Ward identity associated with broken dilatation symmetry in thermal correlators and obtain the modified Callan-Symanzik equation for the dual thermal CFT. We then employ the Hamiltonian approach to analyze the black hole interior and comment on the near-singularity behavior from this perspective.</description>

      <title>Newtonian potential from scattering amplitudes in super-renormalizable gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using scattering amplitudes, we compute the coupling between a general super-renormalizable gravity theory and massive scalar particles. This allows us to derive the $D$-dimensional Newtonian potential at both tree-level and one-loop level-the latter containing the first calculation by using newly derived three-graviton Feynman rules. In four-dimensional spacetime, we numerically demonstrate that the Newtonian potential remains finite at the origin, providing compelling evidence that the singularity-free nature of super-renormalizable gravity persists at the one-loop level.</description>

      <title>B-RNS-GSS formalism and $L_{\infty}$-actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pure spinor formalism and RNS formalism are related by a chain of equivalences constructed by introducing and integrating-out BRST quartets. This is known as B-RNS-GSS formalism. One of the steps can be understood as adding auxiliary fields to lift a strong homotopy action of the SUSY Lie superalgebra in the large Hilbert space to a strict action. We develop a general prescription for this ``strictification'' procedure, which can be applied for any strong homotopy action of a Lie superalgebra. We explain how it is related to the B-RNS-GSS formalism.</description>

      <title>Metallic transports from Taub-NUT AdS black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute holographic DC conductivity associated with the Taub-NUT-$AdS_4$ black holes following the probe D-brane approach. In particular, we examine the effects of frame dragging on charge transport in both low and high temperature regimes. Our analysis reveals that in the low temperature regime, the conductivity is sensitive to the presence of the Misner string that causes frame dragging. Notably, the increase in the conductivity near the Misner string is sharper as compared to points farther away from it. On the other hand, in the high temperature regime, the effects due to frame dragging are significantly suppressed, and the thermal contribution to the charge transport takes over that due to the U(1) charge carriers.</description>

      <title>Integrability in Three-Dimensional Gravity: Eigenfunction-Forced KdV Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We uncover a direct connection between three-dimensional gravity with chiral boundary conditions and a class of forced integrable systems. Starting from the Chern-Simons formulation, we derive consistent boundary conditions on a non-compact spatial slice, leading to boundary dynamics described by the potential modified KdV hierarchy. The dynamics reduce to a forced KdV equation, where the forcing term is determined self-consistently by the eigenfunctions of the associated Schr\"{o}dinger operator. Using the inverse scattering transform, the reflectionless sector is solved via the Gelfand-Levitan-Marchenko method, while the radiative sector exhibits universal dispersive decay. This framework unifies AdS$_3$ boundary dynamics with integrable hierarchies and elucidates the roles of solitons and radiation in the dual conformal field theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Freelance holography program is an extension of the gauge/gravity correspondence in which the boundary theory can reside on any timelike codimension-one surface in AdS space, and the boundary conditions on the bulk fields can be chosen arbitrarily. Freelance holography provides the framework for a systematic study of various boundary conditions and associated bulk geometries. In this work, we analyze in detail the AdS$_3$ freelance holography. One can explicitly solve for the bulk AdS$_3$ Einstein gravity equations of motion. For generic boundary conditions, the solutions are described by two arbitrary functions of one variable. We study holographic renormalization group (RG) flows, the interpolation between different boundary conditions at different boundaries and associated surface charges and their algebras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a historiographical review of algorithms and computer codes developed for solving integration-by-parts relations for Feynman integrals. This procedure is one of the key steps in the evaluation of Feynman integrals, since it enables to express integrals belonging to a given family as linear combinations of master integrals. In this review, we restrict ourselves to considering general algorithms which can, in principle, be applied to any family of Feynman integrals.</description>

      <title>A family of three maximally symmetric boost-invariant flows in relativistic hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I discuss the constructions of boost-invariant dissipative conformal hydrodynamic flows by elaborating on the geometric procedure by Gubser and Yarom, which starts from a static, maximally symmetric flow on dS$_3\times\mathbb{R}$. Three foliations of dS$_3$ preserve three-dimensional non-Abelian isometry groups, namely, the flat ISO(2)-invariant, the spherical (closed) SO(3)-invariant, and the hyperbolic (open) SO(2,1)-invariant slicings. I show that the fluids that preserve these symmetries, after they have been Weyl transformed to flat spacetime, give rise to three physically distinct and boost-invariant solutions of the relativistic dissipative Navier-Stokes equations: the well-known and widely studied Bjorken and Gubser flows, and a seemingly thus far unexplored solution that arises from the hyperbolic slicing of dS$_3$. The new solution combines the radial expansion characteristic of the Gubser flow with the late-proper-time applicability of Bjorken's solution, and features a finite, radially bounded droplet whose expanding edge resembles a free-streaming shockwave.</description>

      <title>Hidden zeros for higher-derivative YM and GR amplitudes at tree-level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the recently discovered phenomenon of hidden zeros to tree amplitudes for Yang-Mills (YM) and general relativity (GR) theories with higher-derivative interactions. This includes gluon amplitudes with a single insertion of the local $F^3$ operator, as well as graviton amplitudes at sub-leading and sub-sub-leading orders in the low-energy expansion of bosonic closed string amplitudes -- referred to as $R^2$ and $R^3$ amplitudes, respectively. The kinematic condition for hidden zeros leads to unavoidable propagator singularities in unordered graviton amplitudes. We investigate in detail the systematic cancellation of these divergences, which resolves ambiguities in the proof of hidden zeros. Our approach is based on universal expansions that express tree amplitudes as linear combinations of bi-adjoint scalar amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic properties in soliton field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The crucial role of hydrodynamic instabilities in soliton field theory is revealed. We demonstrate that the essential of soliton formation mechanism is the sound mode instability induced by thermodynamic instability. This instability triggers phase separation, where new thermal phases are generated to produce solitons. These solitons can be regarded as a coexistence state composed of a matter phase and a vacuum phase, with an interface proving surface tension to maintain dynamical equilibrium. The phase separation mechanism naturally allows the existence of vacuum bubbles, characterized by a vacuum phase surrounded by a matter phase with negative pressure. Furthermore, we show that the soliton interface resemble a fluid membrane, whose interface pressure satisfies a Young-Laplace-type relation, resulting in the emergence of the membrane instability induced by surface tension. In the thin-wall limit, the dispersion relation is analytically derived. This instability triggers topological transition of the interface, splitting a cylindrical interface into multiple spheres with a smaller total surface area. Such results highlight the duality between solitons and fluids.</description>

      <title>Scattering in the dual regime of Yang-Baxter deformed O(2N) sigma models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We continue to explore the previously suggested dual regime of Yang-Baxter (YB) deformed $\mathrm{O}(2N)$ sigma models, which is a new one-parametric deformation of the $\mathrm{O}(2N)$ model. It can be obtained from the conventional YB deformed $\mathrm{O}(2N+2)$ sigma model by freezing two isometries. The scattering matrix in the non-deformed $\mathrm{O}(n)$ model is known coincide with the rational $\mathfrak{so}_n$-invariant $R-$matrix. For $n = 2N$ this rational solution allows for two trigonometric deformations: the usual $D_N^{(1)}$ and the twisted $D_{N}^{(2)}$. The usual one is known to coincide with the scattering matrix of the conventional $\mathrm{YB-O}(2N)$ model. A natural question to ask is what sigma model corresponds to the twisted solution. In this work we claim that it is precisely our dual regime of $\mathrm{YB-O}(2N)$. We find the corresponding unitarizing function $F_N(\theta)$ explicitly, and, as a bonus, extract some physical properties of this system using the thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz technique.</description>

      <title>GraviGUT unification with revisited Pati-Salam model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a graviGUT unification scheme based on the simple orthogonal group $\mathrm{SO}(1,9 ,\mathbb{C})$ that resolves the chiral duplication of weak isospin in Pati--Salam models. In the conventional $SU(4)\times SU(2)_+\times SU(2)_-$ framework, the unobserved second chiral $SU(2)$ is typically removed by ad hoc high-energy scale breaking. Here we instead \emph{geometrize} it: one $SU(2)$ factor is identified with a chiral half of the Lorentz group, so it belongs to gravity rather than to an additional weak force. This identification becomes natural inside $\mathrm{SO}(1,9 ,\mathbb{C})$, where the algebra decomposes as $\mathfrak{so}(1,3)_{\mathbb{C}}\oplus\mathfrak{so}(6)_{\mathbb{C}}\oplus(\text{coset})$. We construct a parity-symmetric chiral action that, upon breaking \emph{dynamically} selects one chirality: the surviving Yang--Mills factor is identified with $SU(2)_+$, while the opposite chirality persists as the gravitational chiral connection. These lead to concrete phenomenological handles, including graviton and weak-boson vertices with the other fundamental forces in $SU(3)$ and $U(1)$ and parity-sensitive gravitational-wave signatures, that distinguish the $\mathrm{SO}(1,9,\mathbb{C})$ construction from both traditional Pati--Salam and larger, less economical unifications.</description>

      <title>Helicity amplitudes of $N(1520)$ and $N(1535)$ including pentaquark components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the helicity amplitudes of the $N(1520)$ and $N(1535)$ resonances in the electromagnetic transition process $\gamma^*p\to N^*$, where the $N(1520)$ and $N(1535)$ are assumed to include both the $L=1$ three-quark and $L=0$ spatial symmetric $q^4\bar q$ pentaquark components. The helicity transition amplitudes $A_{1/2}$, $A_{3/2}$ (for spin 3/2 states) and $S_{1/2}$ are computed within the constituent quark model. The inclusion of the $q^4 \bar q$ pentaquark components via the $\gamma^*\to q\bar q$ diagram significantly improves the theoretical description of the helicity amplitudes for both $N(1520)$ and $N(1535)$, yielding a closer agreement with experimental data compared to the pure three-quark picture. The work reveals that the $N(1520)$ and $N(1535)$ resonances may contain a considerable pentaquark components.</description>

      <title>Lie symmetry analysis of the two-Higgs-doublet model field equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply Lie symmetry analysis of partial differential equations (PDEs) to the Euler-Lagrange equations of the two-Higgs-doublet model (2HDM), to determine its scalar Lie point symmetries. A Lie point symmetry is a structure-preserving transformation of the spacetime variables and the fields of the model, which is also continuous and connected to the identity. Symmetries of PDEs may in general be divided into strict variational symmetries, divergence symmetries and non-variational symmetries, where the first two are collectively referred to as variational symmetries. Variational symmetries are usually preserved under quantization, and variational Lie symmetries yield conservation laws. We demonstrate that there are no scalar Lie point divergence symmetries or non-variational Lie point symmetries in the 2HDM, and re-derive its well-known strict variational Lie point symmetries, thus confirming the consistency of our implementation of Lie's method. Moreover, we prove three general results which may simplify Lie symmetry calculations for a wide class of particle physics models. Lie symmetry analysis of PDEs is a broadly applicable method for determining Lie symmetries. As demonstrated here by example, it can be applied to models with many variables, parameters and reparametrization freedom, while any missing discrete symmetries may be identified through the automorphism groups of the resulting Lie symmetry algebras.</description>

      <title>Conformal Data for the O(3) Wilson-Fisher CFT from Fuzzy Sphere Realization of Quantum Rotor Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a model for strongly interacting fermions with internal O(3) symmetry on the fuzzy-sphere that (i) preserves the rotational symmetry of the fuzzy sphere and (ii) undergoes a quantum phase transition in the (2+1)-dimensional O(3) Wilson-Fisher universality class. Using exact diagonalization (ED) and density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), we locate the quantum critical point via conformal perturbation theory and obtain scaling dimensions from finite-size spectra. We identify 24 primary operators and determine some of their operator product expansion coefficients through first-order conformal perturbation theory. The results are benchmarked against conformal bootstrap and large quantum-number expansions and reveal a weakly irrelevant operator that plays a role in dimerized antiferromagnets. Our work establishes the fuzzy sphere as a general framework for quantitatively accessing conformal data in non-Abelian conformal field theories (CFTs).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.09838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The high-energy behaviour of scattering amplitudes involving massive particles has attracted interest in recent years. In these proceedings, we report on the analytic tool AsyInt for solving massive multi-loop Feynman integrals in the high-energy limit, which are fundamental building blocks for such amplitudes in the full Standard Model. We present recent analytic results for two-loop four-point Feynman integrals with both internal and external masses in this limit, featuring polylogarithmic and elliptic structures.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Catalysis of charmonium in the vector channel</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.09927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of an external magnetic field on the vector charmonium system within the framework of Hilbert moment QCD sum rules. By incorporating magnetic corrections to the perturbative contributions of the QCD sector, we analyze the behavior of the hadronic parameters of the $J/\psi$ resonance -- namely, its continuum threshold $s_0$, decay constant $f_V$, width $\Gamma_V$, and its mass $M_V$, as functions of the magnetic field strength. Our results show that $s_0$ and $f_V$ increase monotonically, while $\Gamma_V$ decreases significantly and $M_V$ remains essentially constant. These behaviors indicate a strengthening of the hadronic state in the presence of a magnetic field, consistent with the phenomenon of magnetic catalysis. Although magnetic catalysis has traditionally been associated with light-quark systems via chiral symmetry breaking, our results demonstrate that similar effects persist in the heavy-quark sector, despite the absence of chiral dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The tidal deformation of compact objects, characterised by their Love numbers, provides insights into the internal structure of neutron stars and black holes. While bosonic tidal Love numbers vanish for black holes in general relativity, it has been recently revealed that fermionic tidal perturbations can induce non-zero Love numbers for Kerr black holes. In this paper, we investigate the response of the Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole to the fermionic Weyl field. As a result, we find that the corresponding fermionic tidal Love numbers are also non-vanishing for the Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes except for the extremal ones, which highlights the universal distinct behavior of the fermionic tidal Love numbers compared to the bosonic counterparts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a machine-learning framework based on symbolic regression to extract the full symbol alphabet of multi-loop Feynman integrals. By targeting the analytic structure rather than reduction, the method is broadly applicable and interpretable across different families of integrals. It successfully reconstructs complete symbol alphabets in nontrivial examples, demonstrating both robustness and generality. Beyond accelerating computations case by case, it uncovers the analytic structure universally. This framework opens new avenues for multi-loop amplitude analysis and provides a versatile tool for exploring scattering amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Speed of sound peak in two-color dense QCD: confronting effective models with lattice data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lattice simulations of two-color, two-flavor Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) at finite quark chemical potential have revealed a distinctive peak structure in the sound velocity. Although chiral perturbation theory (ChPT) and the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model have been employed to explain this phenomenon, neither approach has fully captured the observed behavior. To address this discrepancy, we have extended the NJL framework by incorporating the Medium Separation Scheme (MSS). This approach isolates medium contributions from divergent integrals, allowing for a more accurate treatment of finite-density effects. Our results indicate a clear increase in the diquark gap ($\Delta$) with increasing chemical potential, consistent with what is also seen in perturbative QCD predictions at high densities. {}Furthermore, the MSS-modified NJL model successfully reproduces the observed peak in the sound velocity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Appell functions associated to an arbitrary positive definite lattice $\Lambda$ and a choice of $M\leq {\rm dim}(\Lambda)$ linearly independent vectors $d_r\in \Lambda$, $r=1,\dots,M$. These functions are instances of multi-variable quasi-elliptic functions, and specific examples have appeared at various places in mathematics and theoretical physics. For example, if $\Lambda$ is chosen to be one-dimensional, these functions reduce to the classical Appell function, which is a prominent example in the theory of mock modular forms. The Appell functions introduced here are examples of depth $M$ mock modular forms. We derive a structural formula for their modular completion. Motivated by partition functions in theoretical physics, we discuss the case where $\Lambda$ is the $A_N$ root lattice in detail.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Implications of Thermodynamic Split Conjecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building on initial work on the Thermodynamic Split Conjecture (TSC), which posits that black hole and cosmological horizon thermodynamics are generically inequivalent, we examine the consequences of that split for the Gibbons Hawking temperature and its role across cosmology. We consider many key results in both early and late universe cosmology and show that many important results such as those governing eternal inflation, vacuum tunneling, quantum breaking and primordial black holes can change. The analysis further reveals that small, TSC motivated corrections to horizon thermodynamics can subtly modify Friedmann dynamics, potentially helping to address the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions. The work thus provides a unified route from quantum gravity motivated thermodynamics to observational cosmology and motivates dedicated tests of the thermal laws governing the Universe itself.</description>

      <title>Pseudoscalar heavy-quarkonium hadroproduction from nonrelativistic fragmentation at NLL/NLO$^+$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the inclusive hadroproduction of pseudoscalar heavy quarkonia, $\eta_c$ and $\eta_b$ mesons, in high-energy proton collisions. Our framework bases on the single-parton collinear fragmentation within a variable-flavor number scheme, tailored to describe the moderate to large transverse momentum regime. To this end, we construct a new set of collinear fragmentation functions, denoted as NRFF1.0, which evolve via standard DGLAP equations with a consistent treatment of flavor thresholds. Initial conditions for all parton-induced channels are computed using next-to-leading-order nonrelativistic QCD. We perform our analysis within the NLL/NLO$^+$ hybrid factorization framework, employing the JETHAD numerical interface together with the symJETHAD symbolic engine. These tools allow us to deliver predictions for high-energy observables sensitive to quarkonium final states at 13 TeV LHC. To the best of our knowledge, the NRFF1.0 sets represent the first-ever release of collinear fragmentation functions for heavy quarkonia that consistently includes all partonic channels within collinear factorization.</description>

      <title>Big Bang Nucleosynthesis constraints on space-time noncommutativity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the implications of the modified dispersion relations, due to the noncommutativity of the spacetime, for a photon gas filling the early Universe in the framework of the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) processes, during the period of light elements formation. We consider three types of deformations present in the dispersion relations for the radiation gas, from which we obtain the low temperature corrections to the energy density and pressure. The cosmological implications of the modified equations of state in the BBN era are explored in detail for all radiation models. The effects induced on the nucleosynthesis process by spacetime noncommutativity are investigated by evaluating the abundances of relic nuclei (Hydrogen, Deuterium, Helium-3, Helium-4, and Lithium-7). The primordial mass fraction estimates and their deviations due to changes in the freezing temperature impose an upper limit on the energy density of the deformed photon gas, which follows from the modified Friedmann equations. The deviations from the standard energy density of the radiative plasma are therefore constrained by the abundances of the Helium-4 nuclei. Upper limits on the free parameters of the spacetime noncommutativity are obtained via a numerical analysis performed using the \texttt{PRyMordial} software package. The primordial abundances of the light elements are obtained by evaluating the thermonuclear reaction rates for the considered noncommutative spacetime models. An MCMC (Markov Chain Monte Carlo) analysis allows to obtain restrictions on the free parameters of the modified dispersion relations. The numerical and statistical approach is implemented in the python code \texttt{PRyNCe}, available on GitHub.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that axions can be produced from Abelian-Higgs cosmic strings due to the axion-gauge coupling. The strong magnetic field is confined in the string, and the electric field is induced around the moving string, allowing axion productions from the dynamics of cosmic strings. Our numerical analysis on the string collision shows that a sizable number of axions can be produced at the reconnection, and further emissions occur from moving kinks afterward. Furthermore, the simulation on the string network shows multimodal axion emissions in the sense that axions are produced in both the low-energy and high-energy regimes. The former can contribute to the cold dark matter and the latter can be regarded as dark radiation. We found that the axion with sub-GeV mass can explain the current relic dark matter abundance and simultaneously predicts a sizable amount of dark radiation which can be probed by future observations.</description>

      <title>Spinning into Quantum Geometry: Dirac and Wheeler-DeWitt Dynamics from Stochastic Helicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin networks in loop quantum gravity provide a kinematical picture of quantum geometry but lack a natural mechanism for dynamical Dirac-type evolution, while the Wheeler--DeWitt equation typically enters only as an imposed constraint. We propose a stochastic framework in which each spin-network edge carries helicity-resolved amplitudes -- two-state internal labels that undergo Poisson-driven flips. The resulting coupled master equations, after analytic continuation and the introduction of a fundamental length scale, generate Dirac-type dynamics on discrete geometry. At long times, the same process relaxes to helicity-symmetric equilibrium states, which are shown to satisfy a Wheeler--DeWitt-type condition. In this way, both quantum evolution and the gravitational constraint emerge within a single probabilistic framework. Our approach thus provides a background-independent and stochastic route to quantum geometry, offering an alternative to canonical quantization and a fresh perspective on the problem of time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A central challenge in probing the quantum nature of gravity is to distinguish effects that are genuinely quantum from those that can be explained classically. In this work, we study how quantized gravitational waves interact with thermal quantum systems, modeled as harmonic oscillators. We show that, unlike classical waves, quantized gravitons generate entanglement and leave behind a persistent ``graviton-induced quantum memory'' even after the wave has passed. This effect is further shaped by the presence of thermal noise, which does not simply wash out quantum correlations but can in fact amplify them in distinctive ways. Our analysis reveals clear signatures - such as nonlinear thermal corrections and a prethermal time-crystal-like phase-that cannot arise from any classical treatment. These results identify experimentally relevant markers of gravitons and provide a framework for exploring how finite-temperature environments may help uncover the quantum nature of gravity.</description>

Abstract: In this study, we investigate the $P$-$V$ criticality and Ruppeiner geometry in the extended phase space of Hayward anti-de Sitter (AdS) black holes. Through thermodynamic analysis, we confirm that Hayward-AdS black holes undergo distinct $P$-$V$ phase transitions and exhibit well-defined critical phenomena in the vicinity of their critical points. These behaviors are characterized by four critical exponents that typically obey the scaling laws predicted by mean-field theory--indicating a consistent thermodynamic framework with classical phase transition systems ($e.g.,$ van der Waals fluids). Furthermore, we employ Ruppeiner geometry to probe the thermodynamic fluctuations of Hayward-AdS black holes, and by calculating the corresponding curvature scalar, we gain direct insights into the interaction nature of the black hole's microscopic constituents.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the behavior of basis-independent quantum coherence between two modes of a free Dirac field as observed by relatively accelerated observers. Our findings reveal three key results: (i) the basis-independent coherence between modes A and BI decreases with increasing acceleration but remains finite even in the limit of infinite acceleration; (ii) at zero acceleration, the coherence between modes $A$ and $B_II$ is nonzero contrasting with the behavior of basis-dependent coherence, which typically vanishes in this case; and (iii) the basis-independent coherence between modes BI and BII remains constant regardless of acceleration, exhibiting a freezing phenomenon. These results demonstrate the intrinsic robustness of basis-independent coherence under Unruh effects.</description>

      <title>Islands in Simulated Cosmos: Probing the Hubble Flow around Groups and Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The local Hubble flow offers a powerful laboratory to study the interplay between cosmic expansion and gravitational dynamics. On large scales, galaxy velocities follow Hubble's law, but within groups and clusters local gravitational effects introduce significant departures from linearity. Using the IllustrisTNG cosmological simulations, we investigate whether dark energy leaves detectable imprints on the local velocity-radius relation. We model the kinematics with extensions of the Lemaitre-Tolman framework and apply Bayesian inference to recover halo masses and the Hubble constant H0. The fits reveal systematic biases: halo masses are underestimated with a median ratio $M_{fit}/M_{true} = 0.95 \pm 0.28$, while the inferred Hubble constant clusters around $H_0 = 64 \pm 16 km/s/Mpc$, compared to the simulation input of 67.74. This corresponds to an average 25\% uncertainty in H0 recovery from the local flow method. While the mass and expansion rate can be constrained, different model variants whether including angular momentum, friction, or altered radial scaling-remain statistically indistinguishable. Our results highlight both the promise and the limitations of using local kinematics as a precision probe of dark energy.</description>

      <title>Field Theoretic Approach to Interacting Two Body Tunneling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two body tunneling problems are hard to treat analytically due to the incompatibility between tunneling and perturbation theory. The lack of classical solutions of the Euclidean Lagrangian of continuous systems further thwarts semi-classical expansions. To develop an analytic theory which provides insight on interacting two-particle tunneling, we use new results to derive the Bethe-Salpeter equation of a tunneling field theory with Yukawa coupling. We show that in the one plus one dimensional case a closed solution in the instantaneous positive-energy regime is permitted. We then compute the scattering amplitude in first-order perturbation theory and recover the Lippmann-Schwinger equation to confirm physical consistency and relevancy.</description>

      <title>The Magic Barrier before Thermalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the time dependence of anti-flatness in the entanglement spectrum, a measure for non-stabilizerness and lower bound for non-local quantum magic, on a subsystem of a linear SU(2) plaquette chain during thermalization. Tracing the time evolution of a large number of initial states, we find that the anti-flatness exhibits a barrier-like maximum during the time period when the entanglement entropy of the subsystem grows rapidly from the initial value to the microcanonical entropy. The location of the peak is strongly correlated with the time when the entanglement exhibits the strongest growth. This behavior is found for generic highly excited initial computational basis states and persists for coupling constants across the ergodic regime, revealing a universal structure of the entanglement spectrum during thermalization. We conclude that quantitative simulations of thermalization for nonabelian gauge theories require quantum computing. We speculate that this property generalizes to other quantum chaotic systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15921v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the low-energy regime of BFSS quantum mechanics using its holographic dual. We identify three distinct thermodynamic phases (black holes) and analyze their thermodynamic properties extensively, including phase transitions amongst the several phases. While the properties of the canonical ensemble aligns with existing conjectures on BFSS thermodynamics, we uncover intriguing and unexpected behavior in the microcanonical ensemble. Specifically, for sufficiently low energies, we observe the dominance of the localized phase. Surprisingly, we also identify an energy range where the non-uniform phase becomes dominant. The transition between these phases is mediated by a Kol-type topology-changing phenomenon.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08836v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Explicit examples of the AdS/CFT correspondence where both bulk and boundary theories are tractable are hard to come by, but the minimal tension string on $AdS_3 \times S^3 \times T^4$ is one notable example. In this paper, we discuss how one can construct sigma models on twistor space, with a particular focus on applying these techniques to the aforementioned string theory. We derive novel incidence relations, which allow us to understand to what extent the minimal tension string encodes information about the bulk. We identify vertex operators in terms of bulk twistor variables and a map from twistor space to spacetime is presented. We also demonstrate the presence of a partially broken global supersymmetry algebra in the minimal tension string and we argue that this implies that there exists an $\mathcal{N} = 2$ formulation of the theory. The implications of this are studied and we demonstrate the presence of an additional constraint on physical states.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the renormalization of the gauge-invariant composite operators proposed in \cite{Dudal:2023jsu} to describe the $SU(2)\times U(1)$ Higgs model from a gauge-invariant perspective. To establish the relationship between the counterterms, we use the Algebraic Renormalization approach \cite{Piguet:1995er}. Therefore, we also derive the set of Ward identities of the model after introducing these composite operators. Using these Ward identities, we demonstrate important exact relations between the correlation functions of elementary fields and composite fields.</description>

      <title>Weak Hopf non-invertible symmetry-protected topological spin liquid and lattice realization of (1+1)D symmetry topological field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15336v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce weak Hopf symmetry as a tool to explore (1+1)-dimensional topological phases with non-invertible symmetries. Drawing inspiration from Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT), we construct a lattice model featuring two boundary conditions: one that encodes topological symmetry and another that governs non-topological dynamics. This cluster ladder model generalizes the well-known cluster state model. We demonstrate that the model exhibits weak Hopf symmetry, incorporating both the weak Hopf algebra and its dual. On a closed manifold, the symmetry reduces to cocommutative subalgebras of the weak Hopf algebra. Additionally, we introduce weak Hopf tensor network states to provide an exact solution for the model. As every fusion category corresponds to the representation category of some weak Hopf algebra, fusion category symmetry naturally corresponds to a subalgebra of the dual weak Hopf algebra. Consequently,the cluster ladder model offers a lattice realization of arbitrary fusion category symmetries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15962v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an interesting study of Feynman integral reduction that does not employ integration-by-parts identities. Our approach proceeds by studying the equivalence relations of integral contours in the Feynman parameterization. We find that the integration contour can take a more general form than that given by the Cheng-Wu theorem. We apply this idea to one-loop integrals, and derive universal reduction formulas that can be used to efficiently reduce any one-loop integral. We expect that this approach can be useful in the reduction of multi-loop integrals as well.</description>

Abstract: We introduce supersymmetric extensions of the Hom-Lie deformation of the Virasoro algebra (super Curtright-Zachos algebra), as realized in the GL(1,1) quantum superspace, for Bloch electron systems under Zeeman effects. By examining the duality inherent in quantum superspace scaling operators, we establish a correspondence between quantum superspace and its physical realization through a novel operator mixing mechanism. For the continuous case, we construct super Curtright-Zachos algebra using magnetic translations and spin matrix bases, demonstrating explicit realizations for both N=1 and N=2 supersymmetric algebras with a natural N=2 decomposition. For the discrete case, we establish cyclic matrix representations in tight-binding models. We organize these structures through the *-bracket formalism with Z2-grading, revealing how the quantum superspace structure manifests in physical systems while preserving essential algebraic properties.</description>

      <title>A Family of Vertex Algebras from Argyres-Douglas Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20015v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We find that multiple vertex algebras can arise from a single 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal field theory (SCFT). The connection is given by the BPS monodromy operator $M$, which is a wall-crossing invariant quantity that captures the BPS spectrum on the Coulomb branch. For a class of low-rank Argyres-Douglas theories, we find that the trace of the multiple powers of the monodromy operator $\mathrm{Tr} M^N$ yield modular functions that can be identified with the vacuum characters of certain vertex algebra for each $N$. In particular, we realize unitary VOAs of the Deligne-Cvitanovi\'c exceptional series type $(A_2)_1$, $(G_2)_1$, $(D_4)_1$, $(F_4)_1$, $(E_6)_1$ from Argyres-Douglas theories. We also find the modular invariant characters of the `intermediate vertex algebras' $(E_{7\frac{1}{2}})_1$ and $(X_1)_1$. Our analysis allows us to construct 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ gauge theories that flow to $\mathcal{N}=4$ SCFTs in the IR, whose specialized half-index can be identified with these modular invariant characters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.21204v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Here we generalize a well-known computation and uncover a phase-transition, showing that Wilson lines do not necessarily exhibit Coulomb scaling laws in AdS/BCFT at zero temperature. The area difference between a surface that returns to the boundary, and one that plunges into the bulk, determines the potential between two quarks. This classic AdS/CFT calculation is naturally extended to Wilson surfaces associated to general p-form symmetries in boundary conformal field theories (BCFTs) by embedding a Karch-Randall (KR) brane in the geometry. We find (generalized) Coulomb law scaling in subregion size $\Gamma$ is recovered only above the critical angle for the brane, $\theta_{c,p}$. The potential between the two quarks (or defect operators) vanishes precisely when the surface connecting them ceases to exist at $\theta_{c,p}$. This screening effect, where the operators are fully screened below the critical angle, is a phase transition from Coulomb law to perimeter law with the brane angle $\theta_b$ acting as an order parameter. This effect is also explored at finite temperature where we introduce a new regularization procedure to obtain closed-form results.</description>

Abstract: After obtaining the flavor $D6$-brane gauge fields/their fluctuations in the type IIA dual of T&gt;T_c QCD-like theories at intermediate coupling (via the ${\cal M}$-theory uplift's ${\cal O}(R^4)$ corrections) in the absence/presence of a strong magnetic field, we compute the photoproduction spectral function and get a nice agreement with gauged supergravity backgrounds arXiv:2204.00024 [hep-th]. We demonstrate from the EoS that the holographic dual, in principle, could correspond to several $T&gt;T_c$ scenarios: anisotropic paramagnetic plasma transitioning via a smooth crossover to exotic matter as the universe cools, the stable wormhole, and a paramagnetic pressure/energy-anisotropic plasma. Given that $T&gt;T_c$ QGP is expected to be paramagnetic, see Bali et al '14, the third possibility appears to be the preferred one. We also show that it is not possible that the anisotropic plasma leads to the formation of a compact star. IR renormalization of the DBI action requires a boundary Log-det-Ricci-tensor counter term. {\it Noting (i) photoproduction spectral function determined from gauge field fluctuations receiving ${\cal O}(R^4)$-corrections, if complexified, include a non-analytic-complexified gauge-coupling dependence, and correspond to Contact 3-Structures; (ii) pressure/energy density, etc. determined from world-volume gauge fields and not ${\cal O}(R^4)$-corrected, if complexified, are analytic in the complexified gauge coupling, and correspond to Almost Contact 3-Structures (AC3S) both induced from the $G_2$ structure of a closed seven-fold, we conjecture (i) the lack of $N$-path connectedness in the parameter space associated with AC3S and C3S arXiv:2211.13186[hep-th] to be equivalent to that gauge field fluctuations can not be finite, and (zero-instanton sector) ${\cal O}(R^4)$ non-renormalized gauge fields produce ${\cal O}(R^4)$-corrected gauge fluctuation; (ii) C3S--UV--&gt; AC3S.</description>

Abstract: We present a method to compute the symmetry-resolved entanglement entropy of spherical regions in higher-dimensional conformal field theories. By employing Casini-Huerta-Myers mapping, we transform the entanglement problem into thermodynamic calculations in hyperbolic space. This method is demonstrated through computations in both free field theories and holographic field theories. For large hyperbolic space volume, our results reveal a universal expansion structure of symmetry-resolved entanglement entropy, with the equipartition property holding up to the constant order. Using asymptotic analysis techniques, we prove this expansion structure and the equipartition property in arbitrary dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21762v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The topological string/spectral theory correspondence establishes a precise, non-perturbative duality between topological strings on local Calabi-Yau threefolds and the spectral theory of quantized mirror curves. While this duality has been rigorously formulated for the closed topological string sector, the open string sector remains less understood. Building on the results of [1-3], we make further progress in this direction by constructing entire, off-shell eigenfunctions for the quantized mirror curve from open topological string partition functions. We focus on local $\mathbb{F}_0$, whose mirror curve corresponds to the Baxter equation of the two-particle, relativistic Toda lattice. We then study the standard and dual four-dimensional limits, where the quantum mirror curve for local $\mathbb{F}_0$ degenerates into the modified Mathieu and McCoy-Tracy-Wu operators, respectively. In these limits, our framework provides a way to construct entire, off-shell eigenfunctions for the difference equations associated with these operators. Furthermore, we find a simple relation between the on-shell eigenfunctions of the modified Mathieu and McCoy-Tracy-Wu operators, leading to a functional relation between the operators themselves.</description>

Abstract: We investigated the Goon-Penco(GP) relationship in (n+1)-dimensional black branes with an arbitrary cosmological constant. Our analysis revealed that the GP relation preserved its form in four-dimensional and (n+1)-dimensional spacetimes, demonstrating its universal behavior with respect to dimensionality. Furthermore, we established that the GP relation exhibits universality across all states of the black hole, including those associated with the event horizon and the cosmological horizon. These findings confirm that the GP relationship remains valid for (n+1)-dimensional black holes and black branes with an arbitrary cosmological constant, independent of the coordinate system employed.</description>

Abstract: We clarify a key point in the geometric reinterpretation of the Grosse-Wulkenhaar (GW) model proposed in "Geometry of the Grosse-Wulkenhaar model" [JHEP 03 (2010) 053]. Specifically, we show that the analysis in Section 6 was applied not to the actual $\Omega$-term in the GW action, but to a closely related term involving a mixed use of ordinary and star-products. Once corrected, the main conclusion -- relating the harmonic potential term to background curvature -- remains valid, though the parameter identification must be revised. This also resolves a discrepancy concerning the emergence of certain vacuum solutions in the self-dual limit of the model.</description>

      <title>ModMax Electrodynamics and Holographic Magnetotransport</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02884v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study magnetotransport in a holographic model where ModMax nonlinear electrodynamics is coupled to Einstein anti--de Sitter gravity. To incorporate momentum relaxation, we introduce spatially linear free scalar fields that break translational symmetry, resulting in an anisotropic medium. Using linear response theory, we compute the DC conductivity matrix in the presence of an external magnetic field, expressing the conductivities in terms of horizon data. Our results demonstrate how the nonlinear ModMax parameter modifies charge transport, particularly influencing the Hall angle and Nernst signal. The nonlinear corrections introduce distinct deviations in both longitudinal and Hall conductivities while preserving the characteristic temperature scaling of strange metals, offering new insights into strongly coupled systems with nonlinear electromagnetic interactions. Notably, the Nernst signal reproduces that of high-$T_c$ cuprate superconductors showing a superconducting dome and a normal phase, with the ModMax deformation parameter tuning critical and onset temperatures. In the strongly nonlinear regime, we find evidence of an exotic state dominated by quasiparticle excitations in the dual material.</description>

      <title>On internal mechanical properties of Electroweak Magnetic Monopoles and their effects on stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04872v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By considering properties of the energy-momentum tensor of the electroweak magnetic monopole and its Born-Infeld extension, we attempt to make comments on the stability of these configurations. Specifically, we perform a study of the behaviour of the so-called internal force and pressure of these extended field-theoretic solitonic objects, which are derived from the energy-momentum tensor. Our method is slightly different from the so-called Laue's criterion for stability of nuclear matter, a local form of which had been proposed and applied in the earlier literature to the `t Hooft-Polyakov (HP) magnetic monopole, and found to be violated.By applying our method first to HP monopole, we also observe that, despite its topological stability, the total (finite) internal force (which has only radial components) is directed inwards, towards the centre of the monopole, which would imply instability. Thus this mechanical criterion for stability is arguably violated in the case of the HP monopole, as is the local version of Laue's criterion. The criterion is satisfied for the short-range part of the energy momentum tensor, in which the long-range part, due to the massless photon of the U(1) subgroup, is subtracted. Par contrast, the total internal force of the Cho-Maison (CM) electroweak monopole has both radial and angular components, which diverge at the origin, leading to rotational instabilities. Finally, by studying finite-energy extensions of the CM, either with non-minimal Higgs couplings with the hypercharge sector or hypercharge Born-Infeld type models, we find that the total force, integrated over space, is finite, but it has also angular components in the Born-Infeld case. The latter feature is interpreted as indicating that the Born-Infeld-CM monopole might be subject to rotations upon the action of perturbations, but it does not necessarily imply instabilities of the configuration.</description>

      <title>The $\mathcal{W}$-algebra bootstrap of 6d $\mathcal{N}=(2,0)$ theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08094v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 6d (2,0) SCFTs of type $\mathfrak{g}$ have protected subsectors that were conjectured in arxiv:1404.1079 to be captured by $\mathcal{W}_\mathfrak{g}$ algebras. We write down the crossing equations for mixed four-point functions $\langle S_{k_1} S_{k_2}S_{k_3}S_{k_4}\rangle$ of 1/2-BPS operators $S_{k_i}$ in 6d (2,0) theories and detail how a certain twist reduces this system to a 2d meromorphic CFT multi-correlator bootstrap problem. We identify the relevant 6d (2,0) $\mathcal{W}$-algebras of type $\mathfrak{g} = \{A_{N-1},D_N\}$ as truncations of $\mathcal{W}_{1+\infty}$ and solve OPE associativity conditions for their structure constants, both using $\texttt{OPEdefs}$ and the holomorphic bootstrap of arxiv:1503.07111. With this, we solve the multi-correlator bootstrap for twisted 6d four-point correlators $\mathcal{F}_{k_1k_2k_3k_4}$ involving all $S_{k_i}$ up to $\{k_i\}=4$ and extract closed-form expressions for 6d OPE coefficients. We describe the implications of our CFT data on conformal Regge trajectories of the (2,0) theories and finally, demonstrate the consistency of our results with protected higher-derivative corrections to graviton scattering in M-theory on $AdS_7\times S^4/\mathbb{Z}_\mathfrak{o}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19083v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The gauge invariant minimal couplings for a class of relativistic free matter fields with global symmetry (related to usual charge conservation) have been obtained by incorporating an iterative Noether mechanism. Non-relativistic reduction of both matter and gauge sectors of the obtained interacting theory is then performed simultaneously which in turn yield a set of new effective actions which are invariant under the Galilean relativistic framework. To be precise, we show that one can obtain the Schr\"odinger field theory coupled to Galilean electromagnetism from the scalar quantum electrodynamics theory. Higher derivative corrections have also been included for which the non-relativistic reductions have been consistently carried out once again. On the other hand, the action for quantum electrodynamics leads to the Galilean Pauli-Schr\"odinger theory where the gauge field is non-relativistic or Galilean. Further, some novel relations are found (in both the electric and magnetic limits) between various components appearing in the Galilean avatar of electrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Perturbations of Black Holes in Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton-Axion (EMDA) Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04589v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend our earlier work on the linearised perturbations of static black holes in Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton (EMD) theories to the case where the black holes are solutions in an enlarged theory including also an axion. We study the perturbations in a 3-parameter family of such EMDA theories. The systems of equations describing the linearised perturbations can always be separated, but they can only be decoupled when the three parameters are restricted to a 1-parameter family of EMDA theories, characterised by a parameter $b$ that determines the coupling of the axion to the $\epsilon^{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}\, F_{\mu\nu}\, F_{\rho\sigma}$ term. In the specific case when $b=1$, the theory is related to an ${\cal N}=2$ supergravity. In this one case we find that the perturbations in the axial and the polar sectors are related by a remarkable transformation, which generalises one found by Chandrasekhar for the perturbations of Reissner-Nordstr\"om in Einstein-Maxwell theory. This transformation is of a form found in supersymmetric quantum mechanical models. The existence of such mappings between the axial and polar perturbations appears to correlate with those cases where there is an underlying supergravity supporting the solution, even though the black hole backgrounds are non-extremal and therefore not supersymmetric. We prove the mode stability of the static black hole solutions in the supersymmetric EMDA theory. For other values of the parameter $b$ in the EMDA theories that allow decoupling of the modes, we find that one of the radial potentials can be negative outside the horizon if $b$ is sufficiently large, raising the possibility of there being perturbative mode instabilities in such a case.</description>

      <title>Schwinger--DeWitt expansion for the heat kernel of nonminimal operators in causal theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06439v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We suggest a systematic calculational scheme for heat kernels of covariant nonminimal operators in causal theories whose characteristic surfaces are null with respect to a generic metric. The calculational formalism is based on a pseudodifferential operator calculus which allows one to build a linear operator map from the heat kernel of the minimal operator to the nonminimal one. This map is realized as a local expansion in powers of spacetime curvature, dimensional background fields, and their covariant derivatives with the coefficients -- the functions of the Synge world function and its derivatives. Finiteness of these functions, determined by multiple proper time integrals, is achieved by a special subtraction procedure which is an important part of the calculational scheme. We illustrate this technique on the examples of the vector Proca model and the vector field operator with a nondegenerate principal symbol. We also discuss smoothness properties of heat kernels of nonminimal operators in connection with the nondegenerate nature of their operator symbols.</description>

      <title>Extending fusion rules with finite subgroups: For a general understanding of quotient or gauging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08639v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a general method for realizing simple current extensions of the conformal field theories. We systematically obtain the $Z_{N}$ symmetry extended fusion ring of bulk and chiral theories and the corresponding modular partition functions with nonanomalous subgroup $Z_{n}(\subset Z_{N})$. The bulk (or nonchiral) fusion ring provides fundamental algebraic data for conformal bootstrap, and the chiral fusion ring provides fundamental data for the graded symmetry topological field theories. The latter also provides algebraic data of smeared boundary conformal field theories describing zero modes of the extended models. For more general multicomponent or coupled systems, we also obtain a new series of extended theories. By applying the folding trick to the resultant coupled theories, their partition functions correspond to charged or gapped domain walls or massless renormalization group flows preserving quotient group structures. This work opens new research directions in studying the classification of conformal field theories and the corresponding topological quantum field theories (or topological orders) by establishing the traditional methods in abstract algebra and modular form.</description>

Abstract: In this study, we present a novel family of exact black hole solutions constructed in the context of five-dimensional Gauss-Bonnet gravity. These solutions add a non-linear charge to the Ba\~{n}ados-Teitelboim-Zanelli-like configurations known to exist with arbitrary Thurston horizon geometry. We establish constraints on the parameter space defining physically viable black holes, aligning with the standard energy conditions. An explicit proof of the first law of thermodynamics within our scenario is provided. We also employ holographic techniques to characterize the DC conductivities for the distinct horizon geometries, identifying a critical temperature indicative of phase transitions and exploring pertinent limits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12180v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct generalized symmetries in two-dimensional symmetric product orbifold CFTs $\text{Sym}^N(\mathcal{T}),$ for a generic seed CFT $\mathcal{T}$. These symmetries are more general than the universal and maximally symmetric ones previously constructed. We show that, up to one fine-tuned example when the number of copies $N$ equals four, the only symmetries that can be preserved under twisted sector marginal deformations are invertible and maximally symmetric. The results are obtained in two ways. First, using the mathematical machinery of $G$-equivariantization of fusion categories, and second, via the projector construction of topological defect lines. As an application, we classify all preserved symmetries in symmetric product orbifold CFTs with the seed CFT given by any $A$-series $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ minimal model. We comment on the implications of our results for holography.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.21829v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We initiate a systematic framework for the analysis of analytic properties of finite Feynman integrals that are multiple polylogarithms. Based on the Feynman parameter representation in complex projective space, we make a complete classification of logarithmic singularities of the integral on its principal branch, by what we call touching configurations -- a geometric relationship between the integrand singularity and linear subspaces tied to boundary elements of the integral contour. These on the one hand indicate first entries of the symbol of the integral, and on the other hand induce a special set of new integrals that we call elementary discontinuities. These elementary discontinuities are derived through an operation called bi-projection, and actual discontinuities of the integral across logarithmic branch cuts are their linear combinations. By recursively applying the same analysis to the induced integrals one can fully construct the symbol of the original integral. We explicitly show how this analysis works at one loop in a massless hexagon and a box with two massive and two massless loop propagators. This framework may naturally extend to higher-loop integrals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25801v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We complete our investigation into the residual symmetries of the Kerr-Schild double copy for the Schwarzschild solution. In the first paper in this series, we showed that the infinite-dimensional residual gauge algebra collapses to the finite-dimensional global isometries when restricted to Killing vectors. Here, we extend the analysis to proper conformal Killing vectors (CKVs), solving the field equations via the method of characteristics to obtain explicit conformal solutions. While asymptotic flatness and horizon regularity remove divergent contributions, the surviving components form a non-trivial infinite-dimensional algebra, revealing a structural mismatch with the canonical Schwarzschild solution. We resolve this by constructing a unified, Weyl-compensated BRST complex, showing that the infinite-dimensional modes are BRST-exact and do not correspond to physical degrees of freedom. This demonstrates the quantum consistency of the Kerr-Schild double copy, confirming that the physical spectrum is restricted to global isometries.</description>

Abstract: The low energy effective theory on the moduli space of vacua of 4d superYang-Mills (sYM) theory defines a special K\"ahler geometry. For simple sYM gauge algebras, $\mathfrak{g}$, we classify all compatible special K\"ahler structures by showing that they are in one-to-one correspondence with certain equivalence classes of integral symplectic representations of the Weyl group of $\mathfrak{g}$. We further demonstrate that, for principal Dirac pairing, these equivalence classes are in one-to-one correspondence with the S-duality orbits of the global structures of the corresponding $\mathfrak{g}$ sYM gauge theory, after a mistake in the field theory literature is corrected. This provides a low-energy test of S-duality. We also discuss twisted product geometries made from factors with special K\"ahler structures with non-principal Dirac pairings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02442v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the holographic correspondence as a tool to study the classical flux tube profile connecting a static quark-antiquark pair in a $2+1$-dimensional strongly-coupled large $N$ QCD-like theory. The final result extends already known findings in the literature in several ways. First, it is an analytical function of both the space-like boundary coordinates; in other words, we keep track of what happens both along and transversely to the inter-quark axis. Then, we take into account the finiteness of the inter-quark distance and the first correction in the strong coupling expansion. To the same order, we also confirm the relation between the mass of the lightest glueball in the spectrum and the intrinsic width of the flux tube profile. We conclude by trying to gain some insights about the quantum fluctuations. Intriguingly, our proposal is in agreement with widespread expectations in the literature. En passant, we also derive a semi-analytical formula that gives the first correction to the scalar glueball masses in the strong coupling expansion.</description>

We also identify the correct light-cone definitions of the symmetry generators and their dynamical forms in terms of the fields and take the $c\rightarrow0$ limit. It is observed that these generators produce the known kinematic Carrollian conformal algebraic commutation relations.</description>

Abstract: Previous work on Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity has shown that, at low temperatures, the annealed entropy becomes negative and departs from the quenched entropy. From the perspective of the random-matrix theory (RMT) dual of JT gravity, this effect is encoded in the level spacing statistics of the spectral edge that is universally described by the Airy model. At low temperature, the quenched entropy exhibits a power law dependence determined by the symmetry class of the RMT ensemble. Here we study the same question in the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model which possesses much more structure than RMT. Through numerical simulations, we find that the level spacing statistics of the SYK model match the relevant RMT ensembles even near the spectral edge, thus leading to an agreement with the RMT prediction for the quenched entropy at low temperatures. We also show similar effects in supersymmetric wormholes filled with matter, which is modeled by the $\mathcal N = 2$ supersymmetric SYK model. Numerically extracting the spectral edge properties of the BPS operators allows us to compute the quenched entanglement entropy of the wormhole in the large particle number limit.</description>

      <title>Tetrads in SU(3) X SU(2) X U(1) Yang-Mills geometrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:1207.0912v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The relationship between gauge and gravity amounts to understanding underlying new geometrical local structures. These structures are new tetrads specially devised for Yang-Mills theories, Abelian and Non-Abelian in four-dimensional Lorentzian curved spacetimes. In the present manuscript a new tetrad is introduced for the Yang- Mills SU(3) x SU(2) x U(1) formulation. These new tetrads establish a link between local groups of gauge transformations and local groups of spacetime transformations that we previously called LB1 and LB2. New theorems are proved regarding isomorphisms between local internal SU(3) x SU(2) x U(1) groups and local tensor products of spacetime LB1 and LB2 groups of transformations. These new tetrads define at every point in spacetime two orthogonal planes that we called blades or planes one and two. These are the local planes of covariant diagonalization of the stress-energy tensor. These tetrads are gauge dependent. Tetrad local gauge transformations leave the tetrads inside the local original planes without leaving them. These local tetrad gauge transformations enable the possibility to connect local gauge groups Abelian or non-Abelian with local groups of tetrad transformations. These new tetrads have displayed manifestly and non-trivially the coupling between Yang-Mills fields and gravity. The new tetrads and the stress-energy tensor allow for the introduction of three new local gauge invariant objects. Using these new gauge invariant objects and in addition a new general local duality transformation, a new algorithm for the gauge invariant diagonalization of the Yang-Mills stress-energy tensor is developed as an application. This is a paper about grand Standard Model gauge theories - General Relativity gravity unification and grand group unification in four-dimensional curved Lorentzian spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Simple Gradient Flow Equation for the Bounce Solution</title>

      <description>arXiv:1907.02417v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent work of Chigusa, Moroi, and Shoji, we propose a new simple gradient flow equation to derive the bounce solution which contributes to the decay of the false vacuum. Our discussion utilizes the discussion of Coleman, Glaser, and Martin and we solve a minimization problem of the kinetic energy while fixing the potential energy. The bounce solution is derived as a scale-transformed of the solution of this problem. We also show that the convergence of our method is robust against a choice of the initial configuration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1908.10868v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present SimpleBounce, a C++ package for finding the bounce solution for the false vacuum decay. This package is based on a flow equation which is proposed by the author and solves Coleman-Glaser-Martin's reduced problem: the minimization problem of the kinetic energy while fixing the potential energy. The bounce configuration is obtained by a scale transformation of the solution of this problem. For models with 1--8 scalar field(s), the bounce action can be calculated with O(0.1) % accuracy in O(0.1) s. This package is available at https://github.com/rsato64/SimpleBounce.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves on Kerr Black Holes I: Reconstruction of Linearized Metric Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20311v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The gravitational perturbations of a rotating Kerr black hole are notoriously complicated, even at the linear level. In 1973, Teukolsky showed that their physical degrees of freedom are encoded in two gauge-invariant Weyl curvature scalars that obey a separable wave equation. Determining these scalars is sufficient for many purposes, such as the computation of energy fluxes. However, some applications -- such as second-order perturbation theory -- require the reconstruction of metric perturbations. In principle, this problem was solved long ago, but in practice, the solution has never been worked out explicitly. Here, we do so by writing down the metric perturbation (in either ingoing or outgoing radiation gauge) that corresponds to a given mode of either Weyl scalar. Our formulas make no reference to the Hertz potential (an intermediate quantity that plays no fundamental role) and involve only the radial and angular Kerr modes, but not their derivatives, which can be altogether eliminated using the Teukolsky--Starobinsky identities. We expect these analytic results to prove useful in numerical studies and for extending black hole perturbation theory beyond the linear regime.</description>

      <title>Family of Exact and Inexact Quantum Speed Limits for Completely Positive and Trace-Preserving Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08584v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditional quantum speed limits formulated in density matrix space are generally unattainable for a wide class of dynamics and it is difficult to characterize the fastest possible dynamics. To address this, we present two distinct quantum speed limits in Liouville space for Completely Positive and Trace-Preserving (CPTP) dynamics. The first bound saturates for time-optimal CPTP dynamics, while the second bound is exact for all states and all CPTP dynamics. Our bounds have a clear physical and geometric interpretation arising from the uncertainty relations for operators acting on Liouville space, and the geometry of quantum evolution in Liouville space. We also obtain the form of the Liouvillian, which generates the time-optimal CPTP dynamics that connect the given initial and target states. To illustrate our findings, we show that the speed of evolution in Liouville space bounds the growth of the spectral form factor and Krylov complexity of states, which are crucial for studying information scrambling and quantum chaos. In another important application, we show that our results can help us understand the counter-intuitive phenomenon of the Mpemba effect in non-equilibrium open quantum dynamics, as the minimal relaxation time scale obtained by speed limits is dictated by the eigenmodes of the Liouvillian.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Entanglement and Bell Inequality Violation in Top Anti-Top Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01672v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A top quark and an anti-top quark produced together at colliders have correlated spins. These spins constitute a quantum state that can exhibit entanglement and violate Bell's inequality. In realistic collider experiments, most analyses allow the axes, as well the Lorentz frame to vary event-by-event, thus introducing a dependence on the choice of event-dependent basis leading us to adopt "fictitious states," rather than genuine quantum states. The basis dependence of fictitious states allows for an optimization procedure, which makes the usage of fictitious states advantageous in measuring entanglement and Bell inequality violation. In this work, we show analytically that the basis which diagonalizes the spin-spin correlations is optimal for maximizing spin correlations, entanglement, and Bell inequality violation. We show that the optimal basis is approximately the same as the fixed beam basis (or the rotated beam basis) near the $t\bar t$ production threshold, while it approaches the helicity basis far above threshold. Using this basis, we present the sensitivity for entanglement and Bell inequality violation in $t\bar t$ events at the LHC and a future $e^+e^-$ collider. Since observing Bell inequality violation appears to be quite challenging experimentally, and requires a large dataset in collider experiments, choosing the optimal basis is crucially important to observe Bell inequality violation. Our method and general approach are equally applicable to other systems beyond $t \bar t$, including interactions beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Quantum Black Hole as a Harmonic Oscillator from the Perspective of the Minimum Uncertainty Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09181v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Starting from the eigenvalue equation for the mass of a black hole derived by M\"akel\"a and Repo, we show that, by reparametrizing the radial coordinate and the wave function, it can be rewritten as the eigenvalue equation of a quantum harmonic oscillator. We then study the interior of a Schwarzschild black hole using two quantization approaches. In the standard quantization, the area and mass spectra are discrete, characterized by a quantum number $n$, but the wave function is not square-integrable, limiting its physical interpretation. In contrast, a minimal-uncertainty quantization approach yields an area spectrum that grows as $n^2$, and consequently the mass $M$ also increases. In this framework, the wave function is finite and square-integrable, with convergence requiring that the deformation parameter $\beta$ be regulated by a discrete quantum number $m$. The wave function exhibits quantum tunneling connecting the black hole interior with both its exterior and a white hole region, effects that disappear in the limit $\beta \to 0$. These results demonstrate how minimal-length effects both regularize the wave function and modify the semiclassical structure of the black hole.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement learning-based statistical search strategy for an axion model from flavor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10023v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a reinforcement learning-based search strategy to explore new physics beyond the Standard Model. The reinforcement learning, which is one of machine learning methods, is a powerful approach to find model parameters with phenomenological constraints. As a concrete example, we focus on a minimal axion model with a global $U(1)$ flavor symmetry. Agents of the learning succeed in finding $U(1)$ charge assignments of quarks and leptons solving the flavor and cosmological puzzles in the Standard Model, and find more than 150 realistic solutions for the quark sector taking renormalization effects into account. For the solutions found by the reinforcement learning-based analysis, we discuss the sensitivity of future experiments for the detection of an axion which is a Nambu-Goldstone boson of the spontaneously broken $U(1)$. We also examine how fast the reinforcement learning-based searching method finds the best discrete parameters in comparison with conventional optimization methods. In conclusion, the efficient parameter search based on the reinforcement learning-based strategy enables us to perform a statistical analysis of the vast parameter space associated with the axion model from flavor.</description>

      <title>Astrometry meets Pulsar Timing Arrays: Synergies for Gravitational Wave Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14010v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-precision astrometry offers a promising approach to detect low-frequency gravitational waves, complementing pulsar timing array (PTA) observations. We explore the response of astrometric measurements to a stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) in synergy with PTA data. Analytical, covariant expressions for this response are derived, accounting for the presence of a possible dipolar anisotropy in the SGWB. We identify the optimal estimator for extracting SGWB information from astrometric observations and examine how sensitivity to SGWB properties varies with the sky positions of stars and pulsars. Using representative examples of current PTA capabilities and near-future astrometric sensitivity, we demonstrate that cross-correlating astrometric and PTA data can improve constraints on SGWB properties, compared to PTA data alone. The improvement is quantified through Fisher forecasts for the SGWB amplitude, spectral tilt, and dipolar anisotropy amplitude. In the future, such joint constraints could play a crucial role in identifying the origin of SGWB signals detected by PTAs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06411v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a method for estimating the validity range of the quantum Markovian master equation as applied to the Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) detector within a broader context, particularly without necessitating an exact solution for the detector's evolution. We propose a relaxed van Hove limit (i.e., late-time limit) and offer a perturbative estimate of the error order resulting from the standard derivation procedure of open quantum dynamics. Our primary findings include reliability criteria for the Markov approximation and conditions for the applicability of the rotating wave approximation. Nevertheless, the specific forms of these validity conditions rely on the details of the detector-field system, such as the spacetime background, the trajectory of the detector, and the type of quantum field being analyzed. Finally, we illustrate our results by reexamining the open dynamics of an accelerating UDW detector undergoing the Unruh effect, where the validity conditions narrow the parameter space to ensure the solution's reliability regarding the quantum Markovian master equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12039v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work explores both classical and quantum aspects of an axisymmetric black hole within a non-commutative gauge theory. The rotating solution is derived using a modified Newman-Janis procedure. The analysis begins with the horizon structure, ergospheres, and angular velocity. The thermodynamic properties are examined through surface gravity, focusing on the Hawking temperature, entropy, and heat capacity. In addition, the remnant mass is calculated. The Hawking radiation is treated as a tunneling process for bosonic and fermionic particles, along with the corresponding particle creation density. Geodesic motion is explored, emphasizing null geodesics, radial accelerations, the photon sphere, and black hole shadows. Finally, the gravitational lensing in the strong deflection limit is investigated.</description>

      <title>Electric potentials and field lines for uniformly-charged tube and cylinder expressed by Appell's hypergeometric function and integration of $Z(u|m) \mathrm{sc}(u|m)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11693v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The closed-form expressions of electric potentials and field lines for a uniformly-charged tube and cylinder are presented using elliptic integrals and Appell's hypergeometric functions, where field lines are depicted by introducing the concept of the field line potential in axisymmetric systems, whose contour lines represent electric field lines outside the charged region, thought of as an analog of the conjugate harmonic function in the presence of non-uniform metric. The field line potential for the tube shows a multi-valued behavior and enables us to define a topological charge. The integral of $Z(u|m)\operatorname{sc}(u|m)$, where $ Z $ and $ \operatorname{sc} $ are the Jacobi zeta and elliptic functions, is also expressed by Appell's hypergeometric function as a by-product, which was missing in classical tables of formulas. In the Addendum appended after the main article, several relevant references are provided and the decomposition of the solution by ``degrees of transcendence'' is proposed. The attached supplementary calculations provide detailed derivations of several formulas including the integral in the title and discuss the resemblance between the field line potential for tube and the electric potential for disk.</description>

Considering the interstellar medium (ISM) as a cold, ionized, chiral plasma, we derive the time delay between two traveling signals, expressed in terms of a modified dispersion measure (DM) which receives additional contribution from the chiral parameters. Faraday rotation angle is also addressed in this chiral plasma scenario, yielding modified rotation measures (RM). Using DMs data from five pulsars, we establish constraints on the chiral parameter magnitude at the order of $10^{-23}$ -- $10^{-22}$ GeV. On the other hand, the Faraday rotation retrieved from RM measurements implied upper constraints as tight as $10^{-36}$ GeV.</description>

      <title>Primordial Stochastic Gravitational Waves from Massive Higher-Spin Bosons</title>

Abstract: Can a stationary stone radiate gravitational waves (GWs)? While the answer is typically "no" in flat spacetime, we get a "yes" in inflationary spacetime. In this work, we study the stationary-stone-produced GWs in inflation with a concrete model, where the role of stones is played by massive higher-spin particles. We study particles of spin-2 and higher produced by helical chemical potentials, and show that the induced GWs feature a scale-invariant and helicity-biased power spectrum in the slow-roll limit. Including slow-roll corrections leads to interesting backreactions from the higher-spin boson production, resulting in an intriguing scale-dependence of GWs at small scales. Given the existing observational and theoretical constraints, we identify viable parameter regions capable of generating visibly large GWs for future observations.</description>

      <title>Holographic phase transitions via thermally-assisted tunneling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12437v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct the thermal bounce solution in holographic models that describes first-order phase transitions between the deconfined and confined phases in strongly-coupled gauge theories. This new, periodic Euclidean solution represents transitions that occur via thermally-assisted tunneling and interpolates between the $O(4)$-symmetric vacuum bubble at zero temperature and the high temperature $O(3)$-symmetric critical bubble associated with classical thermal fluctuations. The exact thermal bounce solution can be used to obtain the bounce action at low temperatures which allows for a more accurate determination of vacuum decay rates, significantly improving previous estimates in holographic models. In particular, provided the phase transition is sufficiently supercooled, new predictions are obtained for the gravitational wave signal strength for critical temperatures ranging from the TeV scale up to $10^{12}$ GeV, some of which are within reach of future gravitational wave detectors.</description>

      <title>Exploring two dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant phases with time reversal symmetry and their transitions with topological operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20021v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use various topological operations to systematically study phase transitions between theories with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ and time reversal symmetry in two spacetime dimensions. The phases (and accompanying CFTs) we consider come in two types - bosonic phases that are defined on unorientable manifolds and fermionic phases that are sensitive to a $\text{Pin}^-$ structure. In both cases, our analysis leads to eight phase diagrams, with the two sets of eight connected by fermionization/bosonization. Starting from a seed CFT, we obtain the CFT that governs each transition. Many of these exhibit symmetry enriched criticality. In addition to showing many symmetry enriched CFTs in their natural habitats, our work discusses the fermionic analogs of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ bosonic operations, which we have not seen discussed in the literature.</description>

      <title>Emergent photons and mechanisms of confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00079v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We numerically study $\mathbb{Z}_N$ lattice gauge theories in 4D as prototypical models of systems with $\mathbb{Z}_N$ 1-$\textit{form symmetry}$. For $N \geq 3$, we provide evidence that such systems exhibit not only the expected phases with spontaneously broken/restored symmetry but also a third photon phase. When present, the 1-form symmetry provides a precise notion of confinement, and it is commonly believed that confinement ensues due to the proliferation of extended, string-like objects known as $\textit{center vortices}$, which carry a $\mathbb{Z}_N$ flux. However, this picture is challenged by the three-phase scenario investigated here. We show that both the confined and the photon phases are associated with the proliferation of center vortices and that the key difference between them lies in whether or not vortex-junctions - the $\textit{monopoles}$ - proliferate.</description>

      <title>Complete monotonicity of log-functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04225v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article we investigate the property of complete monotonicity within a special family $\mathcal{F}_s$ of functions in $s$ variables involving logarithms. The main result of this work provides a linear isomorphism between $\mathcal{F}_s$ and the space of real multivariate polynomials. This isomorphism identifies the cone of completely monotone functions with the cone of non-negative polynomials. We conclude that the cone of completely monotone functions in $\mathcal{F}_s$ is semi-algebraic. This gives a finite time algorithm to decide whether a function in $\mathcal{F}_s$ is completely monotone</description>

      <title>Insights in $f(Q)$ cosmology: the relevance of the connection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03506v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the role of the affine connection in $f(Q)$ gravity, a modified theory where gravity is governed by non-metricity within the symmetric teleparallel framework. Although the connection is constrained to be flat and torsionless, it is not uniquely determined by the metric, allowing for multiple physically distinct formulations. We analyze three such connections compatible with a homogeneous and isotropic universe to show that they yield markedly different cosmological dynamics, even under the same functional form of $f(Q)$. Using both analytical and numerical methods, including a Born-Infeld type model of $f(Q)$, we demonstrate that specific connections can resolve cosmological singularities like the Big Bang and Big Rip, replacing them with smooth de Sitter phases. Others retain singularities but with notable modifications in their behavior. These findings highlight the physical relevance of connection choice in $f(Q)$ gravity and its potential to address fundamental cosmological questions.</description>

      <title>$\alpha$-attractor inflation modified by GUP in light of ACT observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10547v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Here, the $\alpha$-attractor inflation is investigated within a framework incorporating a minimal measurable length, as implemented by the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP). The GUP modifications to the Friedmann equations and cosmological perturbation parameters are employed to assess the model observational viability against the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) data. Our results indicate that in the $r-n_s$ plane, the predictions of the standard $\alpha$-attractor model ($\beta=0$) lies near the $2\sigma$ boundary of joint observations. More interestingly enough is that in the presence of GUP effect, the predictions of the model for the GUP parameter $\beta \gtrsim O(10^{13})$ shifts into the $68\%$ CL interval. This value for $\beta$ is in well agreement with upper bounds on the GUP parameter deduced from cosmological analysis as well as quantum and gravitational experiments.</description>

      <title>Nature of the $P_c$ states from compositeness criteria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21858v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Based on a coupled-channel approach, we investigate the structures of four $P_c$ states through compositeness criteria. Toward a more precise description of the states, we have obtained refined fit results of the LHCb data on the $J/\psi p$ invariant mass distribution of the $\Lambda_b^0\to J/\psi p K^-$ decay. Allowing for the fact that each of the four $P_c$ states couples strongly to a nearby $S$-wave channel, three criteria on the compositeness/elementariness are adopted in this study: the pole-counting rule, the spectral density function, and the Gamow wave function. Compositeness information is extracted from the scattering amplitudes and the pole parameters (pole positions and residues), without any preconceived assumptions on the nature of the $P_c$ states, and without any dependence on the model parametrization. Consistently within the framework of all the three methods, it has been found that the $P_c(4312)\,1/2^-$ is mainly composed by $\bar{D}\Sigma_c$, $P_c(4380)\,3/2^-$ by $\bar{D}\Sigma_c^*$, while the $P_c(4440)\,1/2^-$ and $P_c(4457)\,3/2^-$ states both turn out as composite states of $\bar{D}^*\Sigma_c$. The upper limits of the values of their elementariness are estimated to be rather small. This paper provides an additional confirmation of the molecular interpretation for the $P_c$ states in the literature.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Symmetry-Fragmentation of Nonabelian Anyons In Symmetry-Enriched Topological Phases: A String-Net Model Realization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.24115v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symmetry-enriched topological (SET) phases combine intrinsic topological order with global symmetries, giving rise to novel symmetry phenomena. While SET phases with Abelian anyons are relatively well understood, those involving nonabelian anyons remain elusive. This obscurity stems from the multidimensional internal gauge spaces intrinsic to nonabelian anyons -- a feature first made explicit in [1,2] and further explored and formalized in our recent works [3-8]. These internal spaces can transform in highly nontrivial ways under global symmetries. In this work, we employ an exactly solvable model -- the multifusion Hu-Geer-Wu string-net model introduced in a companion paper [9] -- to reveal how the internal gauge spaces of nonabelian anyons transform under symmetries. We uncover a universal mechanism, global symmetry fragmentation (GSF), whereby symmetry-invariant anyons exhibit internal Hilbert space decompositions into eigensubspaces labeled by generally fractional symmetry charges. Meanwhile, symmetry-permuted anyons hybridize and fragment their internal spaces in accordance with their symmetry behavior. These fragmented structures realize genuinely nonlinear symmetry representations -- to be termed coherent representations -- that transcend conventional linear and projective classifications, reflecting the categorical nature of symmetries in topological phases. Our results identify nonlinear fragmentation as a hallmark of nonabelian SETs and suggest new routes for symmetry-enabled control in topological quantum computation.</description>

      <title>A Conservative Theory of Semiclassical Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05237v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We argue that semiclassical gravity is rendered consistent by considering that quantum systems emit a gravitational field only when they interact with members of Stable Determination Chains (SDCs). These are chains of non-gravitational interactions between quantum systems modeled via decoherence and test functions that obey conditions that aim to address the measurement problem and allow for a conservative theory of gravity. It is conservative because it does not need to modify the fundamental equations of quantum theory, unlike spontaneous and gravity-induced collapse approaches to semiclassical gravity, and without invoking relationalism. Furthermore, it does not appeal to nonlocal, retrocausal, or superdeterministic hidden variables. When systems do not interact with SDCs, they do not emit a gravitational field, and the expectation value of their stress-energy tensor does not enter the semiclassical equations describing the gravitational field in a region. In the absence of SDCs in a region, spacetime can be flat. This theory holds a version of the equivalence principle, which establishes that different bodies under the same gravitational field evolve similarly in the absence of non-gravitational interactions. It can be tested by experiments investigating the gravitational field emitted by quasi-isolated systems, and the lack of gravity-mediated entanglement and certain kinds of collapse in the Bose-Marletto-Vedral (BMV) experiment. It provides multiple benefits, such as a semiclassical estimation of the value of the cosmological constant and the prediction of a time-varying dark energy that weakens with time, in agreement with some evidence. More broadly, we propose a new testable framework in which there is a conditional emission of a gravitational field by quantum systems, which may undermine the main motivations for a theory of quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Positivity bounds in scalar-QED EFT at one-loop level</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06302v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the implication of positivity bounds on loop-generated dim-8 operator coefficients is a nontrivial task, as these bounds only strictly hold when all the contributions are included in the dispersion relation up to a certain loop order in the UV theory. As a step towards more realistic gauge theories such as the Standard Model, in this paper we study the positivity bounds in the Scalar QED Effective Field Theory (EFT) from the scalar-photon scattering ($\gamma\phi \to \gamma\phi$) and the photon-photon scattering ($\gamma\gamma \to \gamma\gamma$), derived from the dispersion relation of the full one-loop EFT amplitudes. Assuming the UV theory is weakly coupled and all heavy particles have spin $\leq1$, the leading dim-8 interaction for both amplitudes are generated at the one-loop level in the UV theory. Gauge invariance imposes strong constraints on the loop structures, while potential IR divergences also require careful treatments. Our findings reveal that, for $\gamma\phi \to \gamma\phi$, while the tree-level bound does not necessarily hold, the one-loop $\beta$-function of the corresponding coefficient always tends to restore the tree-level bound in the IR, unless its actual loop order in the UV theory is further suppressed. For $\gamma\gamma \to \gamma\gamma$, on the other hand, the tree-level positivity bound is still robust at the one-loop level in the UV theory. These findings are verified in two example UV models with a heavy scalar extension. Importantly, the bounds on the $\beta$-functions that we obtain should be considered as an accidental feature at one loop, rather than a fundamental property of the theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10033v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) from the collapse of density perturbations induced by primordial gravitational waves (PGWs). The PGWs' interpretation of the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) detected by the Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) corresponds to PBHs formation in the mass range $[10^{-12}-10^{-3}] M_{\odot}$. Importantly, our analysis shows that PGWs' interpretation of recent PTA data remains viable, as it does not lead to PBH overproduction. We derive the amplitude of PGWs by leveraging existing constraints on the PBH abundance across a wide mass range. Notably, these constrained amplitudes predict SGWB signals that would be detectable by future gravitational wave observatories.</description>

      <title>QED-IR as Topological Quantum Theory of Dressed States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11668v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate quantum electrodynamics in the infrared regime (QED-IR) using the adiabatic approximation and the framework of the functional Berry phase. In this approach, the physical state space is exact, nonperturbatively dressed, and endowed with a topological structure. Electrons do not exist as bare particles, but as topologically protected electron--photon clouds, defining a new kind of ``infrared quantum''. These clouds are weakly bound in energy (with a binding scale estimated at \(\Lambda_{\mathrm{IR}} \sim 0.5~\mathrm{meV}\)) and remain stable provided photon energies stay below this threshold. Crucially, the theory becomes exactly solvable in this regime due to the quantization of the functional Berry flux, which governs the infrared dynamics of the dressed states.
  When hard (high-energy) processes are involved, the topological protection of the dressed states is lifted, and the theory smoothly recovers conventional perturbative QED. In contrast, in the deep infrared, the electromagnetic interaction never fully vanishes, leading to observable effects. We argue that the energy required to dissolve the infrared electron--photon cloud in QED is of order \(\mathrm{meV}\), comparable to the thermal energy of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), \(k_B T_{\mathrm{CMB}} \approx 2.3 \times 10^{-4}\,\mathrm{eV}\). However, the observed temperature anisotropies correspond to fluctuations near \(10^{-9}\,\mathrm{eV}\), far too small to destroy the cloud, though potentially capable of perturbing its topological phase structure. This suggests that CMB deviations could reflect residual topological imprints of the functional infrared dynamics. Finally, we propose that analogous cloud-like structures may manifest in other quantum systems governed by low-energy photon dynamics, such as atomic and molecular environments.</description>

      <title>Free Independence and Unitary Design from Random Matrix Product Unitaries</title>

Abstract: Unitary randomness underpins both fundamental tasks in quantum information and the modern theory of quantum chaos. On one side, a central concept is that of approximate unitary designs: circuits that look random according to small moments and for forward-in-time protocols. In a distinct setting, out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs), intensely studied as a measure of information scrambling, have recently been shown to probe freeness between Heisenberg operators, the noncommutative generalization of statistical independence. Bridging these two concepts, we study the emergence of freeness in a random matrix product unitary ensemble. We prove that, with only polynomial bond dimension, these unitaries reproduce Haar values of higher-order OTOCs for local, finite-trace observables, while traceless observables instead require exponential resources. Indeed, local observables are precisely those predicted to thermalize in chaotic many-body systems according to the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. Moreover, adding to previous literature, we show how random matrix product unitaries constitute approximate designs: we exactly compute the frame potential of the ensemble, showing convergence to the Haar value with polynomial deviations and so indicating that global observables are freely independent on-average. Our results highlight the need to refine previous notions of unitary design in the context of operator dynamics, guiding us towards protocols for quantum advantage and shedding light on the emergent complexity of chaotic many-body systems.</description>

      <title>On continuum and resonant spectra from exact WKB analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09211v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Resonance phenomena are central to many quantum systems, where resonant states are typically characterized by pole singularities of the S-matrix. In this work, we employ the complex scaling method (CSM) in conjunction with exact WKB analysis to elucidate the geometric structure of scattering problems that encompass both bound and resonant states. By analyzing the continuum spectrum via the exact WKB framework, we derive the S-matrix for the inverted Rosen--Morse potential and reveal its underlying complex-geometric features. Furthermore, we reinterpret the Aguilar--Balslev--Combes theorem, the foundation of CSM, from a geometric perspective, and discuss the physical significance of the Siegert boundary condition within a rigorously defined modified Hilbert space. Our analysis bridges scattering cross-sections and spectral theory, offering new geometric insights into quantum resonance and scattering phenomena.</description>

      <title>Blowup relations and $q$-Painlev\'e VI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10938v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose and study blowup relations obeyed by the partition functions of $5d$ $\mathcal{N}=1$ (quiver) SYM theories with $SU(2)$ gauge group and four flavours. By analyzing the Weyl group action on the sets of blowup relations, we identify the integer parameters of a blowup relation with the weights of a corresponding Lie algebra. We also explain how this action of the Weyl group follows from the Weyl group symmetry of the partition function. Finally, we use these relations to derive bilinear relations on the $q$-Painlev\'e VI tau functions.</description>

      <title>Polynomials and asymptotic constants in a resurgent problem from 't Hooft</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26297v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a recent study of the quantum theory of harmonic oscillators, Gerard 't Hooft proposed the following problem: given $G(z)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty\sqrt{n}\,z^n$ for $|z|&lt;1$, find its analytic continuation for $|z|\ge1$, excluding a branch-cut $z\in[1,\,\infty)$. A solution is provided by the bilateral convergent sum $G(z)=\frac12\sqrt{\pi}\sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty(2\pi{\rm i}n-\log(z))^{-3/2}$. On the negative real axis, $G(-{\rm e}^u)$ has a sign-constant asymptotic expansion in $1/u^2$, for large positive $u$. Optimal truncation leaves exponentially suppressed terms in an asymptotic expansion ${\rm e}^{-u}\sum_{k=0}^\infty P_k(x)/u^k$, with $P_0(x)=x-\frac23$ and $P_k(x)$ of degree $2k+1$ evaluated at $x=u/2-\lfloor u/2\rfloor$. At large $k$, these polynomials become excellent approximations to sinusoids. The amplitude of $P_k(x)$ increases factorially with $k$ and its phase increases linearly, with $P_k(x)\sim\sin((2k+1)C-2\pi x)R^{2k+1}\Gamma(k+\frac12)/\sqrt{2\pi}$, where $C\approx1.0688539158679530121571$ and $R\approx0.5181839789815558726739$ are asymptotic constants satisfying $R\exp({\rm i}\,C)=\sqrt{-1/(2+\pi{\rm i})}$.</description>

      <title>Carrollian Lie Algebroids: Taming Singular Carrollian Geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03877v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Developments in Carrollian gravity and holography necessitate the use of singular Carroll vector fields, a feature that cannot be accommodated within standard Carrollian geometry. We introduce Carrollian Lie algebroids as a framework to study such singular Carrollian geometries. In this approach, we define the Carroll distribution as the image of the kernel of the degenerate metric under the anchor map. The Carroll distribution is, in general, a singular Stefan--Sussmann distribution that will fluctuate between rank-1 and rank-0, and so captures the notion of a singular Carroll vector field. As an example, we show that an invariant Carrollian structure on a principal bundle leads to a Carrollian structure on the associated Atiyah algebroid that will, in general, have a singular Carroll distribution. Mixed null-spacelike hypersurfaces, under some simplifying assumptions, also lead to examples of Carrollian Lie algebroids. Furthermore, we establish the existence of compatible connections on Carrollian Lie algebroids, and as a direct consequence, we conclude that Carrollian manifolds can always be equipped with compatible affine connections.</description>

      <title>Anyon Bound States and Hybrid Superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04830v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interactions of anyonic quasi-particles (vortices) in the Chern--Simons extension of the Ginzburg--Landau model is investigated and we show that it manifestly realizes a hybridization of type I/II superconductivity. Through Gauss' law, each vortex simultaneously carries a flux quantum and a proportional Noether charge, thereby realizing an anyonic excitation. The Chern--Simons coupling also modifies the screening structure of the gauge fields, producing complex-conjugate masses that yield a common penetration depth with an oscillatory phase. This altered asymptotic behavior breaks the conventional type-I/type-II dichotomy of the Ginzburg--Landau model. As a result, vortex anyons experience short-range repulsion and long-range attraction, enabling the formation of separated multi-vortex bound states with non-monotonic interaction energy.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Emergence of Lorentzian Signature from Curvature-Minimizing Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07891v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A simple covariant model is presented where the signature of the metric is a dynamical field. Degenerate minima of a curvature-minimizing potential correspond to Euclidean, Lorentzian or mixed phases of geometry. The Lorentzian phase emerges as the only stable configuration supporting causal propagation.</description>
