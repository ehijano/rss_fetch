      <title>Exact solutions of the Kuramoto model with asymmetric higher order interactions of arbitrary order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Higher order interactions can lead to new equilibrium states and bifurcations in systems of coupled oscillators described by the Kuramoto model. However, even in the simplest case of 3-body interactions there are more than one possible functional forms, depending on how exactly the bodies are coupled. Which of these forms is better suited to describe the dynamics of the oscillators depends on the specific system under consideration. Here we show that, for a particular class of interactions, reduced equations for the Kuramoto order parameter can be derived for arbitrarily many bodies. Moreover, the contribution of a given term to the reduced equation does not depend on its order, but on a certain effective order, that we define. We give explicit examples where bi and tri-stability is found and discuss a few exotic cases where synchronization happens via a third order phase transition.</description>

      <title>Discontinuous Transition to Active Nematic Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active fluids exhibit chaotic flows at low Reynolds number known as active turbulence. Whereas the statistical properties of the chaotic flows are increasingly well understood, the nature of the transition from laminar to turbulent flows as activity increases remains unclear. Here, through simulations of a minimal model of unbounded active nematics, we find that the transition to active turbulence is discontinuous. We show that the transition features a jump in the mean-squared velocity, as well as bistability and hysteresis between laminar and chaotic flows. From distributions of finite-time Lyapunov exponents, we identify the transition at a value $A^*\approx 4900$ of the dimensionless activity number. Below the transition to chaos, we find subcritical bifurcations that feature bistability of different laminar patterns. These bifurcations give rise to oscillations and to chaotic transients, which become very long close to the transition to turbulence. Overall, our findings contrast with the continuous transition to turbulence in channel confinement, where turbulent puffs emerge within a laminar background. We propose that, without confinement, the long-range hydrodynamic interactions of Stokes flow suppress the spatial coexistence of different flow states, and thus render the transition discontinuous.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear port-Hamiltonian system identification from input-state-output data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A framework for identifying nonlinear port-Hamiltonian systems using input-state-output data is introduced. The framework utilizes neural networks' universal approximation capacity to effectively represent complex dynamics in a structured way. We show that using the structure helps to make long-term predictions compared to baselines that do not incorporate physics. We also explore different architectures based on MLPs, KANs, and using prior information. The technique is validated through examples featuring nonlinearities in either the skew-symmetric terms, the dissipative terms, or the Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Spectral bounds on the entropy flow rate and Lyapunov exponents in differentiable dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04485v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Some microscopic dynamics are also macroscopically irreversible, dissipating energy and producing entropy. For many-particle systems interacting with deterministic thermostats, the rate of thermodynamic entropy dissipated to the environment is the average rate at which phase space contracts. Here, we use this identity and the properties of a classical density matrix to derive upper and lower bounds on the entropy flow rate with the spectral properties of the local stability matrix. These bounds are an extension of more fundamental bounds on the Lyapunov exponents and phase space contraction rate of continuous-time dynamical systems. They are maximal and minimal rates of entropy production, heat transfer, and transport coefficients set by the underlying dynamics of the system and deterministic thermostat. Because these limits on the macroscopic dissipation derive from the density matrix and the local stability matrix, they are numerically computable from the molecular dynamics. As an illustration, we show that these bounds are on the electrical conductivity for a system of charged particles subject to an electric field.</description>
