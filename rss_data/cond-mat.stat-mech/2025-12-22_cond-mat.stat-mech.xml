      <title>Optimal active engines obey the thermodynamic Lorentz force law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: What are the fundamental limitations for finite-time engines that extract work from active nonequilibrium systems, and what are the optimal protocols that approach them? We show that the finite-time work extraction for nonconservative overdamped Langevin systems may be rewritten as a Lorentz force Lagrangian action, with the kinetic term corresponding to a thermodynamic metric term that is an $L_2$-optimal transport cost for the time-dependent probability density, and the magnetic field coupling term corresponding to an effective quasistatic work extraction, proving that optimal protocols counterdiabatically steer the thermodynamic state trajectory to satisfy a Lorentz force law defined on thermodynamic state space. We utilize and reinterpret classic concepts from electromagnetism in the setting of cyclical nonequilibrium processes. We show that the housekeeping heat can be controlled to be arbitrarily close to zero by minimizing nonequilibrium fluctuations. It immediately follows from our results that the constant-velocity angle clamp protocol applied to the $F_1$ molecular motor in a recent experiment [Mishima et at, 2025] is in fact the globally optimal protocol: it produces zero housekeeping heat and simultaneously minimizes dissipation and maximizes work transduction.</description>

      <title>A symbiotic SIR process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a symmetric two-disease SIR co-infection model on networks in which co-infected individuals recover at a rate distinct from that of single infections. The model explicitly represents all co-infection states and features absorbing recovered compartments for both diseases. Within a mean-field network approximation, we derive the basic reproduction number of the coupled system and show that invasion thresholds coincide with those of two independent SIR processes. Exploiting an exchange symmetry in the equal-transmission regime, we reduce the dynamics to a lower-dimensional invariant subsystem and analyze the impact of the co-infection recovery rate. We prove that slower recovery of co-infected individuals monotonically increases the co-infection burden and yields a lower bound on epidemic duration that grows as the co-infection recovery rate decreases. Numerical simulations further indicate that reduced co-infection recovery can increase the epidemic peak, an effect supported by a sensitivity-equation analysis. Together, these results highlight how co-infection-specific recovery dynamics can substantially alter transient epidemic behavior, even in the absence of endemic equilibria.</description>

      <title>Quantum quenches across continuous and first-order quantum transitions in one-dimensional quantum Ising models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum dynamics generated by quantum quenches (QQs) of the Hamiltonian parameters in many-body systems, focusing on protocols that cross first-order and continuous quantum transitions, both in finite-size systems and in the thermodynamic limit. As a paradigmatic example, we consider the quantum Ising chain in the presence of homogeneous transverse ($g$) and longitudinal ($h$) magnetic fields. This model exhibits a continuous quantum transition (CQT) at $g=g_c$ and $h=0$, and first-order quantum transitions (FOQTs) driven by $h$ along the line $h=0$ ($g&lt;g_c$). In the integrable limit $h=0$, the system can be mapped onto a quadratic fermionic theory; however, any nonvanishing longitudinal field breaks integrability and the spectrum of the resulting Hamiltonian is generally expected to enter a chaotic regime. We analyze QQs in which the longitudinal field is suddenly changed from a negative value $h_i &lt; 0$ to a positive value $h_f&gt;0$. We focus on values of $h_f$ such that the spectrum of the post-QQ Hamiltonian ${\hat H}(g,h_f)$ lies in the chaotic regime, where thermalization may emerge at asymptotically long times. We study the out-of-equilibrium dynamics for different values of $g$, finding qualitatively distinct behaviors for $g &gt; g_c$ (where the chain is in the disordered phase), for $g = g_c$ (QQ across the CQT), and for $g&lt;g_c$ (QQ across the FOQT line).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze regional earthquake energy statistics from the Southern California and Japan seismic catalogs and find scale-invariant energy distributions characterized by an exponent $\tau \simeq 1.67$. To quantify how closely scale-invariant dynamics with different exponent values resemble real earthquakes, we generate synthetic energy distributions over a wide range of $\tau$ under conditions of constant activity. Earthquake-like behavior, in a broad sense, is obtained for $1.5 \leqslant \tau &lt; 2.0$. When energy variations are further restricted to be within a factor of ten relative to real earthquakes, the admissible range narrows to $1.58 \leqslant \tau \leqslant 1.76$. We identify the physical mechanisms governing the dynamics in the different regimes: fault dynamics characterized by a balance between slow energy accumulation and release through scale-free events in the earthquake-like regime; externally supplied energy relative to a slowly driven fault for $\tau &lt; 1.5$; and dominance of small events in the energy budget for $\tau &gt; 2$</description>

      <title>Convection Patterns in Nonequilibrium Kawasaki Dynamics at Low Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a conservative stochastic lattice dynamics (Kawasaki dynamics) in contact everywhere in the bulk with a heat bath. Particles interact via an Ising Hamiltonian and phase separation occurs at low temperature. We drive the system out of equilibrium by imposing a temperature field that varies spatially on macroscopic scales while preserving local equilibrium. Under these conditions, the usual low-temperature long-range order is replaced by robust convection patterns, featuring regularly spaced stripe structures for suitable geometries. These nonequilibrium states differ markedly from those obtained in an equilibrium dynamics with the same local temperature profile. We develop a macroscopic description that captures these behaviors and provides a unified framework for understanding the observed patterns.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide an overview of the Gross-Pitaevskii-Poisson equation (GPPE) that is used to model self-gravitating superfluid systems, which include gravitationally collapsed boson and axion stars and dark-matter haloes. We outline how this framework can be used to develop minimal models for neutron stars and for pulsars and their glitches. We account not only for vortices in the neutron superfluid inside these stars, but also for the flux tubes in the proton-superconductor subsystem, using a coupled model with the neutron superfluid, proton superconductor, the Maxwell equations for the vector potential ${\bf A}$, and the Poisson equation for self-gravity.</description>

      <title>Growth of Dynamic and Static Correlations in the Aging Dynamics of a Glass-Forming Liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using extensive molecular dynamics simulations, we have performed finite-size scaling (FSS) in the aging regime of a model glass-forming liquid to investigate how the length scales associated with amorphous order (static length) and dynamic heterogeneity (dynamic length) evolve with waiting time. The $\alpha$-relaxation time in the aging regime reveals non-monotonic finite-size effects with a peak at an intermediate system size, which, as far as we know, are not found in the equilibrium systems, and the peak position shifts to larger system sizes with decreasing temperature and increasing waiting time, indicating a growth of a characteristic length scale with waiting time. The extracted correlation volume associated with amorphous order increases logarithmically with the waiting time. Detailed analysis of the dependence of the length scale on waiting time allowed us to estimate the static length scale in the deep supercooled liquid regime. The dynamic length scale, obtained from FSS and block analysis of the four-point dynamic susceptibility, follows a power-law growth with waiting time. The values of the length scales obtained agree well with those obtained from different spatial correlation functions.</description>

      <title>Reentrant melting of scarred odd crystals by self-shear</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatial confinement can induce geometrical frustration in condensed phases, giving rise to topological defects that confer materials with new and exotic properties. Here, we experimentally uncover the remarkable effect of confinement-induced defect strings termed `grain boundary scars' on the behavior of dense two-dimensional assemblies of granular spinners, a canonical odd elastic solid. We show that the spatial arrangement of these scars fundamentally reshapes the flows triggered by chiral activity. Specifically, they cause the topologically protected edge flows - a ubiquitous feature of confined spinner assemblies - to decouple from the bulk. Strikingly, increasing the net chiral activity of the system by tuning the ratio of counterclockwise to clockwise spinners caused spontaneous self-shearing. The resulting odd radial stresses led to a chiral activity-mediated reentrant melting transition at a fixed areal spinner density. Our findings open new avenues for exploiting geometrical frustration to elicit novel responses from odd elastic solids.</description>

      <title>Networks as the fundamental constituents of the universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review an approach that uses binary relations as the fundamental constituents of the universe, utilizing them as building blocks for both space and matter. The model is defined by an ultraviolet continuous fixed point of a statistical model on random networks, governed by the combinatorial Ollivier-Ricci curvature, which acts as a network analogue of the Einstein-Hilbert action. The model exhibits two distinct phases separated by this fixed point, a geometric and a random phase, representing space and matter, respectively. At weak coupling and on large scales, the network organizes into a holographic surface whose collective state encodes both an emergent 3D space and the matter distributed in it. The Einstein equations emerge as constitutive relations expressing matter in terms of fundamental network degrees of freedom while dynamics in a comoving frame is governed by relativistic quantum mechanics. Quantum mechanics, however is an effective theory breaking down at the scale of the radius of curvature of the holographic network. On smaller scales, not only relativistic invariance is lost but also the Lorentzian signature of space-time. Finally, the manifold nature of space-time breaks down on the Planck length, where the random character of the fundamental network on the smallest scales becomes apparent. The network model seems to naturally encode several of the large-distance features of cosmology, albeit still at a qualitative level. The holographic property of black holes arises intrinsically from the expander nature of random regular graphs. There is a natural mechanism to resolve the cosmological constant problem and dark matter appears naturally as a metastable allotrope in the network fabric of space-time. In this model, both gravity and quantum mechanics are macroscopic statistical effects reflecting the free energy minimization of fundamental binary degrees of freedom.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study opinion formation in a society where agents interact on a modular network generated using a stochastic block model (SBM). Opinion dynamics is modeled through the Biswas-Chatterjee-Sen (BChS) kinetic exchange model, in which agents undergo pairwise interactions that could be positive or negative. By tuning the relative strength of intra- and inter-group connectivity inherent to the SBM, as well as the disagreement probability, we identify distinct collective phases. In particular, we observe a robust regime with strong intragroup ordering but no global consensus, in addition to fully ordered and disordered states. These results demonstrate how modular interaction structure can qualitatively alter collective opinion dynamics and hinder consensus formation.</description>

Abstract: Creep tests on heterogeneous materials under subcritical loading typically show a power-law decaying strain rate before failure, with the exponent often considered material-dependent but independent of applied stress. By imposing successive small stress relaxations through a displacement feedback loop, we probe creep dynamics and show experimentally that this exponent varies with both applied load and loading direction. Simulations of a disordered fiber bundle model reproduce this load dependence, demonstrating that such models capture essential features of delayed rupture dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08877v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, novel exact identities known as Fluctuation-Response Relations (FRRs) have been derived for nonequilibrium steady states of Markov jump processes. These identities link the fluctuations of state or current observables to a combination of responses of these observables to perturbations of transition rates. Here, we complement these results by deriving analogous FRRs applicable to mixed covariances of one state and one current observable. We further derive novel Inverse FRRs expressing individual state or current response in terms of a combination of covariances rather than vice versa. Using these relations, we demonstrate that the breaking of the Onsager symmetry requires the presence of state-current correlations. On the practical side, we demonstrate the applicability of FRRs for explaining the behavior of fluctuations in quantum dot devices or enzymatic reaction networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08938v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spectrum of Markov generators encodes physical information beyond simple decay and oscillation, which reflects irreversibility and governs the structure of correlation functions. In this work, we prove an ellipse theorem that provides a universal thermodynamic geometric constraint on the spectrum of Markov rate matrices. The theorem states that all eigenvalues lie within a specific ellipse in the complex plane. In particular, the imaginary parts of the spectrum, which indicate oscillatory modes, are bounded by the maximum thermodynamic force associated with individual transitions. This spectral bound further constrains the initial short-time behavior of correlation functions between two arbitrary observables. Finally, we compare our result with a previously proposed conjecture, which remains an open problem and warrants further investigation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16812v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Monte-Carlo simulations are widely used to simulate complex molecular systems, but standard approaches suffer from metastability. Lately, the use of non-local proposal updates in a collective-variable (CV) space has been proposed in several works. Here, we generalize these approaches and explicitly spell out an algorithm for non-linear CVs and underdamped Langevin dynamics. We prove reversibility of the resulting scheme and demonstrate its performance on several numerical examples, observing a substantial performance increase compared to methods based on overdamped Langevin dynamics as considered previously. Advances in generative machine-learning-based proposal samplers now enable efficient sampling in CV spaces of intermediate dimensionality (tens to hundreds of variables), and our results extend their applicability toward more realistic molecular systems.</description>

Abstract: Continuous normalizing flows are known to be highly expressive and flexible, which allows for easier incorporation of large symmetries and makes them a powerful computational tool for lattice field theories. Building on previous work, we present a general continuous normalizing flow architecture for matrix Lie groups that is equivariant under group transformations. We apply this to lattice gauge theories in two dimensions as a proof of principle and demonstrate competitive performance, showing its potential as a tool for future lattice computations.</description>

      <title>Emergent dynamical scaling in the inviscid limit of 3D stochastic Navier-Stokes equation with thermal noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05811v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the Navier-Stokes equation in the presence of thermal noise, both at finite viscosity (revisiting the seminal work by Forster-Nelson-Stephen) and in the inviscid limit, which has not yet been explored. We determine the space-time velocity correlations in this dynamics, using functional renormalisation group and direct numerical simulations. While spectrally truncated three-dimensional Euler flows reach a stationary equilibrium state, they exhibit non-trivial temporal correlations. We show that these non-trivial correlations persist for small but finite viscosity, yielding an emergent $\tau\sim k^{-1}$ dynamical scaling, where $\tau$ is the decorrelation time. We characterise the crossover from the scaling $\tau\sim 1/(\nu k^2)$, expected at large viscosity, to the scaling $\tau\sim 1/(u_{\rm rms}k)$ found in the inviscid limit.</description>

      <title>Quasiprobability Thermodynamic Uncertainty Relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14354v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive a quantum extension of the thermodynamic uncertainty relation where dynamical fluctuations are quantified by the Terletsky-Margenau-Hill quasiprobability, a quantum generalization of the classical joint probability. The obtained inequality plays a complementary role to existing quantum thermodynamic uncertainty relations, focusing on observables' change rather than exchange of charges through jumps and respecting initial coherence. Quasiprobabilities show anomalous behaviors that are forbidden in classical systems, such as negativity; we reveal that negativity or a non-classically enhanced escape rate is necessary to increase an output-to-dissipation ratio beyond classical limitations and show that the requirements are basis-independent and stronger than quantum coherence. To illustrate these statements, we employ a model that can exhibit a dissipationless heat current, which would be prohibited in classical systems; we construct a state that has much coherence but does not lead to a dissipationless current due to the absence of anomalous behaviors in quasiprobabilities.</description>

      <title>Percolation Diagrams Derived from First-Principles Investigation of Chemical Short-Range Order in Binary Alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08253v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent developments in the percolation theory of passivation have shown that chemical short-range order (SRO) affects the aqueous passivation behavior of alloys. However, there has been no systematic exploration to quantify these SRO effects on percolation in practical alloys and the related passivation behavior. In this study, we quantify the effects of SRO on percolation in a binary size-mismatched Cu-Rh alloy and study the related passivation behavior. We develop a mixed-space cluster expansion model trained on the mixing energy calculated using density functional theory. We use the cluster expansion model to sample the configuration space via variance-constrained semi-grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations and develop SRO diagrams over a range of compositions and temperatures. Building on this with the percolation crossover model, specifically the variation of percolation threshold with SRO in the FCC lattice, we construct the first nearest-neighbor chemical percolation diagram. These diagrams can inform the design of the next generation of corrosion-resistant metallic alloys.</description>

      <title>Chaotic many-body quantum dynamics, spectral correlations, and energy diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02198v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study chaotic many-body quantum dynamics in a minimal model with spatial structure and local interactions. It has a time-independent Hamiltonian, in contrast to quantum circuits and Brownian models, and is simple at the single-site level, in contrast to Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev chains. It is analytically tractable for large local Hilbert space dimension and weak intersite coupling. In this limit we show that energy dynamics is described by a classical master equation and is diffusive. We also show that the spectral form factor can be expressed exactly in terms of the solution to this master equation. For a two-site system we obtain closed-form expressions for both the two-point correlator of energy density and the spectral form factor, in essentially perfect agreement with numerical simulations. For an $L$-site system we show at late times how a linear ramp emerges in the spectral form factor, as universally expected from level repulsion in chaotic quantum systems. Conversely, at earlier times we identify two distinct mechanisms for an increase of the spectral form factor above its ramp value. One of these is associated with energy diffusion and is effective until the Thouless time, which varies as $L^2$. The other involves contributions like those that would appear if the system were composed of many uncoupled subsystems: they generate a large enhancement of the spectral form factor, and are suppressed on a timescale varying as $(\ln L)^2$. Besides being exact for the limit considered, we believe our approach provides the natural approximation even for small local Hilbert space dimension and strong intersite coupling. We present a numerical study of a spin-half chain, finding an early-time enhancement of the spectral form factor which is qualitatively similar to that in our solvable model.</description>

      <title>Local spreading of stabilizer R\'enyi entropy in a brickwork random Clifford circuit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07769v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonstabilizerness, or magic, constitutes a fundamental resource for quantum computation and a crucial ingredient for quantum advantage. Recent progress has substantially advanced the characterization of magic in many-body quantum systems, with stabilizer R\'enyi entropy (SRE) emerging as a computable and experimentally accessible measure. In this work, we investigate the spreading of SRE in terms of single-qubit reduced density matrices, where an initial product state that contains magic in a local region evolves under brickwork random Clifford circuits. For the case with Haar-random local Clifford gates, we find that the spreading profile exhibits a diffusive structure within a ballistic light cone when viewed through a normalized version of single-qubit SRE, despite the absence of explicit conserved charges. We further examine the robustness of this non-ballistic behavior of the normalized single-qubit SRE spreading by extending the analysis to a restricted Clifford circuit, where we unveil a superdiffusive spreading.</description>
