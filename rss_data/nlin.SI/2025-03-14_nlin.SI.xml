      <title>Korteweg-de Vries Integrals for Modified Black Hole Potentials: Instabilities and other Questions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasi-normal modes (QNMs) and greybody factors are some of the most characteristic features of the dynamics of black holes (BHs) and represent the basis for a number of fundamental physics tests with gravitational wave observations. It is therefore important to understand the properties of these quantities, naturally introduced within BH perturbation theory, in particular the stability properties under modifications of the BH potential. Instabilities in the QNMs have been recently shown to appear in the BH pseudospectrum under certain circumstances. In this work, we give a novel point of view based on the existence of some recently discovered hidden symmetries in BH dynamics and the associated infinite series of conserved quantities, the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) integrals. We provide different motivations to use the KdV integrals as indicators of some crucial BH spectral properties. In particular, by studying them in different scenarios described by modified BH barriers, we find strong evidence that the KdV conserved quantities represent a useful tool to look for instabilities in the BH spectrum of QNMs and in their greybody factors.</description>

      <title>On the Jordan-Chevalley decomposition problem for operator fields in small dimensions and Tempesta-Tondo conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the Jordan-Chevalley decomposition problem for an operator field in small dimensions. In dimensions three and four, we find tensorial conditions for an operator field $L$, similar to a nilpotent Jordan block, to possess local coordinates in which $L$ takes a strictly upper triangular form. We prove the Tempesta-Tondo conjecture for higher order brackets of Fr\"olicher-Nijenhuis type.</description>

      <title>Integrable Kuralay equations: geometry, solutions and generalizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.05348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.05348v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the Kuralay equations, namely, the Kuralay-I equation (K-IE) and the Kuralay-II equation (K-IIE). The integrable motion of space curves induced by these equations is investigated. The gauge equivalence between these two equations is established. With the help of the Hirota bilinear method, the simplest soliton solutions are also presented. The nonlocal and dispersionless versions of the K-IE and K-IIE are considered.</description>

      <title>Field analogue of the Ruijsenaars-Schneider model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.01697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.01697v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We suggest a field extension of the classical elliptic Ruijsenaars-Schneider model. The model is defined in two different ways which lead to the same result. The first one is via the trace of a chain product of $L$-matrices which allows one to introduce the Hamiltonian of the model and to show that the model is gauge equivalent to a classical elliptic spin chain. In this way, one obtains a lattice field analogue of the Ruijsenaars-Schneider model with continuous time. The second method is based on investigation of general elliptic families of solutions to the 2D Toda equation. We derive equations of motion for their poles, which turn out to be difference equations in space with a lattice spacing $\eta$, together with a zero curvature representation for them. We also show that the equations of motion are Hamiltonian. The obtained system of equations can be naturally regarded as a field generalization of the Ruijsenaars-Schneider system. Its lattice version coincides with the model introduced via the first method. The limit $\eta \to 0$ is shown to give the field extension of the Calogero-Moser model known in the literature. The fully discrete version of this construction is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Integrable fishnet circuits and Brownian solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08030v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce classical many-body dynamics on a one-dimensional lattice comprising local two-body maps arranged on discrete space-time mesh that serve as discretizations of Hamiltonian dynamics with arbitrarily time-varying coupling constants. Time evolution is generated by passing an auxiliary degree of freedom along the lattice, resulting in a `fishnet' circuit structure. We construct integrable circuits consisting of Yang-Baxter maps and demonstrate their general properties, using the Toda and anisotropic Landau-Lifschitz models as examples. Upon stochastically rescaling time, the dynamics is dominated by fluctuations and we observe solitons undergoing Brownian motion.</description>

      <title>Rogue wave patterns associated with Adler Moser polynomials in the nonlocal nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03757v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, novel rogue wave patterns in the nolocal nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (NLS) are investigated by means of asymptotic analysis, including heart-pentagon, oval-trangle, and fan-trangle. It is demonstrated that when multiple free parameters get considerably large, rogue wave patterns can approximately be predicted by the root structures of Adler-Moser polynomials. These polynomials, which extend the Yablonskii-Vorob'ev polynomial hierarchy, exhibit richer geometric shapes in their root distributions. The (x,t)-plane is partitioned into three regions and through a combination of asymptotic results in different regions, unreported rogue wave patterns can be probed. Predicted solutions are compared with true rogue waves in light of graphical illustrations and numerical confirmation, which reveal excellent agreement between them.</description>
