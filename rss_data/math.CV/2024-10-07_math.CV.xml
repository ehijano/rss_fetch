      <title>Bergman kernels for monogenic and contragenic functions in the interior and exterior of a sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contragenic functions are defined to be reduced-quaternion-valued harmonic functions which are orthogonal to all monogenic and antimonogenic functions in the $L^2$ norm of a given domain. The parallelism between the spaces of contragenic functions in the interior and exterior of the unit sphere in $\R^3$ is described in detail. Bergman reproducing kernels for the spaces of contragenic functions are given, mirroring the corresponding kernels for the spaces of vector parts of monogenic functions. Numerical examples are given showing the accuracy of truncations of the integral kernels. A striking duality is observed between the basic interior contragenic functions and the vector parts of exterior monogenic functions, and vice versa.</description>

      <title>Geometric Combinatorics of Polynomials II: Polynomials and Cell Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article introduces a finite piecewise Euclidean cell complex homeomorphic to the space of monic centered complex polynomials of degree $d$ whose critical values lie in a fixed closed rectangular region. We call this the branched rectangle complex since its points are indexed by marked $d$-sheeted planar branched covers of the fixed rectangle. The vertices of the cell structure are indexed by the combinatorial "basketballs" studied by Martin, Savitt and Singer. Structurally, the branched rectangle complex is a full subcomplex of a direct product of two copies of the order complex of the noncrossing partition lattice. Topologically, it is homeomorphic to the closed $2n$-dimensional ball where $n=d-1$. Metrically, the simplices in each factor are orthoschemes. It can also be viewed as a compactification of the space of all monic centered complex polynomials of degree $d$.
  We also introduce a finite piecewise Euclidean cell complex homeomorphic to the space of monic centered complex polynomials of degree $d$ whose critical values lie in a fixed closed annular region. We call this the branched annulus complex since its points are indexed by marked $d$-sheeted planar branched covers of the fixed annulus.It can be constructed from the branched rectangle complex as a cellular quotient by isometric face identifications. And it can be viewed as a compactification of the space of all monic centered complex polynomials of degree $d$ with distinct roots.
  Finally, the branched annulus complex deformation retracts to the branched circle complex, which we identify with the dual braid complex. Our explicit embedding of the dual braid complex as a spine for the space of polynomials with distinct roots provides a direct proof that these two classifying spaces for the braid group are homotopy equivalent.</description>

      <title>Koebe conjecture and the Weyl problem for convex surfaces in hyperbolic 3-space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.08001</link>
      <description>arXiv:1910.08001v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the Koebe circle domain conjecture is equivalent to the Weyl type problem that every complete hyperbolic surface of genus zero is isometric to the boundary of the hyperbolic convex hull of the complement of a circle domain. It provides a new way to approach the Koebe's conjecture using convex geometry. Combining our result with the work of He-Schramm on the Koebe conjecture, one establishes that every simply connected non-compact polyhedral surface is discrete conformal to the complex plane or the open unit disk. The main tool we use is Schramm's transboundary extremal lengths.</description>

      <title>Shift-cyclicity in analytic function spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10224v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this survey, we consider Banach spaces of analytic functions in one and several complex variables for which: (i) polynomials are dense, (ii) point-evaluations on the domain are bounded linear functionals, and (iii) the shift operator corresponding to each variable is a bounded linear map. We discuss the problem of determining the shift-cyclic functions in such a space, i.e., functions whose polynomial multiples form a dense subspace. This problem is known to be intimately connected to some deep problems in other areas of mathematics, such as the dilation completeness problem and even the Riemann hypothesis.
  What makes determining shift-cyclic functions so difficult is that often we need to employ techniques that are specific to the space in consideration. We therefore cover several different function spaces that have frequently appeared in the past such as the Hardy spaces, Dirichlet-type spaces, complete Pick spaces and Bergman spaces. We highlight the similarities and the differences between shift-cyclic functions among these spaces and list some important general properties that shift-cyclic functions in any given analytic function space must share. Throughout this discussion, we also motivate and provide a large list of open problems related to shift-cyclicity.</description>
