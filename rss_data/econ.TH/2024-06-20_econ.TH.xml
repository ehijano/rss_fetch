      <title>Combining Combined Forecasts: a Network Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the practice of experts aggregating forecasts before informing a decision-maker. The significance of this subject extends to various contexts where experts inform their assessments to a decision-maker following discussions with peers. My findings show that, irrespective of the information structure, aggregation rules introduce no bias to decision-making in expected terms. Nevertheless, the concern revolves around variance. In situations where experts are equally precise, and pair-wise correlation of forecasts is the same across all pairs of experts, the network structure plays a pivotal role in decision-making variance. For classical structures, I show that star networks exhibit the highest variance, contrasting with $d$-regular networks that achieve zero variance, emphasizing their efficiency. Additionally, by employing the Poisson random graph model under the assumptions of a large network size and a small connection probability, the results indicate that both the expected Network Bias and its variance converge to zero as the network size becomes sufficiently large. These insights enhance the understanding of decision-making under different information, network structures and aggregation rules. They enrich the literature on combining forecasts by exploring the effects of prior network communication on decision-making.</description>

      <title>Nash equilibria of quasisupermodular games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove three results on the existence and structure of Nash equilibria for quasisupermodular games. A theorem is purely order-theoretic, and the other two involve topological hypotheses. Our topological results genralize Zhou's theorem (for supermodular games) and Calciano's theorem.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric Analysis of Random Utility Models Robust to Nontransitive Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Random Utility Model (RUM) is the gold standard in describing the behavior of a population of consumers. The RUM operates under the assumption of transitivity in consumers' preference relationships, but the empirical literature has regularly documented its violation. In this paper, I introduce the Random Preference Model (RPM), a novel framework for understanding the choice behavior in a population akin to RUMs, which preserves monotonicity and accommodates nontransitive behaviors. The primary objective is to test the null hypothesis that a population of rational consumers generates cross-sectional demand distributions without imposing constraints on the unobserved heterogeneity or the number of goods. I analyze data from the UK Family Expenditure Survey and find evidence that contradicts RUMs and supports RPMs. These findings underscore RPMs' flexibility and capacity to explain a wider spectrum of consumer behaviors compared to RUMs. This paper generalizes the stochastic revealed preference methodology of McFadden &amp; Richter (1990) for finite choice sets to settings with nontransitive and possibly nonconvex preference relations.</description>

      <title>Redistribution Through Market Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consumer data can be used to sort consumers into different market segments, allowing a monopolist to charge different prices at each segment. We study consumer-optimal segmentations with redistributive concerns, i.e., that prioritize poorer consumers. Such segmentations are efficient but may grant additional profits to the monopolist, compared to consumer-optimal segmentations with no redistributive concerns. We characterize the markets for which this is the case and provide a procedure for constructing optimal segmentations given a strong redistributive motive. For the remaining markets, we show that the optimal segmentation is surprisingly simple: it generates one segment with a discount price and one segment with the same price that would be charged if there were no segmentation. We also show that a regulator willing to implement the redistributive-optimal segmentation does not need to observe precisely the composition and the frequency of each market segment, the aggregate distribution over prices suffices.</description>

      <title>Guaranteed shares of benefits and costs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a general fair division model with transferable utilities we discuss endogenous lower and upper guarantees on individual shares of benefits or costs. Like the more familiar exogenous bounds on individual shares described by an outside option or a stand alone utility, these guarantees depend on my type but not on others' types, only on their number and the range of types. Keeping the range from worst share to best share as narrow as permitted by the physical constraints of the model still leaves a large menu of tight guarantee functions. We describe in detail these design options in several iconic problems where each tight pair of guarantees has a clear normative meaning: the allocation of indivisible goods or costly chores, cost sharing of a public facility and the exploitation of a commons with substitute or complementary inputs. The corresponding benefit or cost functions are all sub- or super-modular, and for this class we characterise the set of minimal upper and maximal lower guarantees in all two agent problems.</description>

      <title>Bundling in Oligopoly: Revenue Maximization with Single-Item Competitors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a principal seller with $m$ heterogeneous products to sell to an additive buyer over independent items. The principal can offer an arbitrary menu of product bundles, but faces competition from smaller and more agile single-item sellers. The single-item sellers choose their prices after the principal commits to a menu, potentially under-cutting the principal's offerings. We explore to what extent the principal can leverage the ability to bundle product together to extract revenue.
  Any choice of menu by the principal induces an oligopoly pricing game between the single-item sellers, which may have multiple equilibria. When there is only a single item this model reduces to Bertrand competition, for which the principal's revenue is $0$ at any equilibrium, so we assume that no single item's value is too dominant. We establish an upper bound on the principal's optimal revenue at every equilibrium: the expected welfare after truncating each item's value to its revenue-maximizing price. Under a technical condition on the value distributions -- that the monopolist's revenue is sufficiently sensitive to price -- we show that the principal seller can simply price the grand-bundle and ensure (in any equilibrium) a constant approximation to this bound (and hence to the optimal revenue). We also show that for some value distributions violating our conditions, grand-bundle pricing does not yield a constant approximation to the optimal revenue in any equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Allocation Requires Prediction Only if Inequality Is Low</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Algorithmic predictions are emerging as a promising solution concept for efficiently allocating societal resources. Fueling their use is an underlying assumption that such systems are necessary to identify individuals for interventions. We propose a principled framework for assessing this assumption: Using a simple mathematical model, we evaluate the efficacy of prediction-based allocations in settings where individuals belong to larger units such as hospitals, neighborhoods, or schools. We find that prediction-based allocations outperform baseline methods using aggregate unit-level statistics only when between-unit inequality is low and the intervention budget is high. Our results hold for a wide range of settings for the price of prediction, treatment effect heterogeneity, and unit-level statistics' learnability. Combined, we highlight the potential limits to improving the efficacy of interventions through prediction.</description>

      <title>Embracing the Enemy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09734v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study an organization with a principal and two agents. All three have a long-run agenda which drives their repeated interactions. The principal can influence the competition for agency by endorsing an agent. Her agenda is more aligned with her ``friend'' than with her ``enemy.'' Even when fully aligned with the friend, the principal embraces the enemy by persistently endorsing him once an initial ``cordon sanitaire'' to exclude the enemy breaks exogenously. A dynamically optimizing principal with extreme agenda either implements the commitment solution or reverts to static Nash. For less extreme principals, losing commitment power has more gradual effects.</description>

      <title>A Note on the Stability of Monotone Markov Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11568v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This note studies monotone Markov chains, a subclass of Markov chains with extensive applications in operations research and economics. While the properties that ensure the global stability of these chains are well studied, their establishment often relies on the fulfillment of a certain splitting condition. We address the challenges of verifying the splitting condition by introducing simple, applicable conditions that ensure global stability. The simplicity of these conditions is demonstrated through various examples including autoregressive processes, portfolio allocation problems and resource allocation dynamics.</description>

      <title>Collusion-Resilience in Transaction Fee Mechanism Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09321v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Users bid in a transaction fee mechanism (TFM) to get their transactions included and confirmed by a blockchain protocol. Roughgarden (EC'21) initiated the formal treatment of TFMs and proposed three requirements: user incentive compatibility (UIC), miner incentive compatibility (MIC), and a form of collusion-resilience called OCA-proofness. Ethereum's EIP-1559 mechanism satisfies all three properties simultaneously when there is no contention between transactions, but loses the UIC property when there are too many eligible transactions to fit in a single block. Chung and Shi (SODA'23) considered an alternative notion of collusion-resilience, called c-side-contract-proofness (c-SCP), and showed that, when there is contention between transactions, no TFM can satisfy UIC, MIC, and c-SCP for any c at least 1. OCA-proofness asserts that the users and a miner should not be able to "steal from the protocol." On the other hand, the c-SCP condition requires that a coalition of a miner and a subset of users should not be able to profit through strategic deviations (whether at the expense of the protocol or of the users outside the coalition).
  Our main result is the first proof that, when there is contention between transactions, no (possibly randomized) TFM in which users are expected to bid truthfully satisfies UIC, MIC, and OCA-proofness. This result resolves the main open question in Roughgarden (EC'21). We also suggest several relaxations of the basic model that allow our impossibility result to be circumvented.</description>
