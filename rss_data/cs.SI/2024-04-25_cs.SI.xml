      <title>Hidden in Plain Sight: Exploring the Intersections of Mental Health, Eating Disorders, and Content Moderation on TikTok</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social media platforms actively moderate content glorifying harmful behaviors like eating disorders, which include anorexia and bulimia. However, users have adapted to evade moderation by using coded hashtags. Our study investigates the prevalence of moderation evaders on the popular social media platform TikTok and contrasts their use and emotional valence with mainstream hashtags. We notice that moderation evaders and mainstream hashtags appear together, indicating that vulnerable users might inadvertently encounter harmful content even when searching for mainstream terms. Additionally, through an analysis of emotional expressions in video descriptions and comments, we find that mainstream hashtags generally promote positive engagement, while moderation evaders evoke a wider range of emotions, including heightened negativity. These findings provide valuable insights for content creators, platform moderation efforts, and interventions aimed at cultivating a supportive online environment for discussions on mental health and eating disorders.</description>

      <title>SMI-5: Five Dimensions of Social Media Interaction for Platform (De)Centralization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Web 3.0 focuses on the decentralization of the internet and creating a system of interconnected and independent computers for improved privacy and security. We extend the idea of the decentralization of the web to the social media space: whereby we ask: in the context of the social media space, what does "decentralization" mean? Does decentralization of social media affect user interactions? We put forth the notion that decentralization in the social media does not solely take place on the physical network level, but can be compartmentalized across the entire social media stack. This paper puts forth SMI-5: the five dimensions of social media interaction for describing the (de)centralization of social platforms. We then illustrate a case study that the user interactions differ based on the slices of the SMI layer analyzed, highlighting the importance of understanding the (de)centralization of social media platforms from an a more encompassing perspective rather than only the physical network.</description>

      <title>DyGCL: Dynamic Graph Contrastive Learning For Event Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting events such as political protests, flu epidemics, and criminal activities is crucial to proactively taking necessary measures and implementing required responses to address emerging challenges. Capturing contextual information from textual data for event forecasting poses significant challenges due to the intricate structure of the documents and the evolving nature of events. Recently, dynamic Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been introduced to capture the dynamic patterns of input text graphs. However, these models only utilize node-level representation, causing the loss of the global information from graph-level representation. On the other hand, both node-level and graph-level representations are essential for effective event prediction as node-level representation gives insight into the local structure, and the graph-level representation provides an understanding of the global structure of the temporal graph. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose a Dynamic Graph Contrastive Learning (DyGCL) method for event prediction. Our model DyGCL employs a local view encoder to learn the evolving node representations, which effectively captures the local dynamic structure of input graphs. Additionally, it harnesses a global view encoder to perceive the hierarchical dynamic graph representation of the input graphs. Then we update the graph representations from both encoders using contrastive learning. In the final stage, DyGCL combines both representations using an attention mechanism and optimizes its capability to predict future events. Our extensive experiment demonstrates that our proposed method outperforms the baseline methods for event prediction on six real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>Information Cocoons on Social Media: Why and How Should the Government Regulate Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Information cocoons are frequently cited in the literature on whether and how social media might lead to ideological segregation and political polarization. From the behavioural and communication perspectives, this paper first examines why algorithm-based social media, as opposed to its traditional counterpart, is more likely to produce information cocoons. We then explore populism and short-termism in voting, bias and noise in decision-making, and prerequisite capital for innovation, demonstrating the importance of information diversity for a sustainable information environment. Finally, this study argues for libertarian paternalism by evaluating the criteria and trade-offs involved in regulating algorithms and proposes to employ nudges to address the core issues while preserving freedom of choice.</description>

      <title>Are There Echo Chambers in the US News Ecosystem? Evidence From Twitter/X</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates echo chambers in social networks through an analysis of Twitter news accounts. Utilizing bias labels from the AllSides website, we construct a dataset representing six dimensions of news bias. Through manual extraction of follower/following relationships, we analyze interactions among 65 active Twitter news accounts. Despite the relatively small size of the network node data utilized, results reveal distinct clustering patterns indicative of echo chambers, with limited interaction between conflicting ideologies. This study underscores the potential impact of bias on information dissemination and democratic expression. These findings offer valuable insights into the dynamics of echo chambers in contemporary social media environments.</description>

      <title>Inside the echo chamber: Linguistic underpinnings of misinformation on Twitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social media users drive the spread of misinformation online by sharing posts that include erroneous information or commenting on controversial topics with unsubstantiated arguments often in earnest. Work on echo chambers has suggested that users' perspectives are reinforced through repeated interactions with like-minded peers, promoted by homophily and bias in information diffusion. Building on long-standing interest in the social bases of language and linguistic underpinnings of social behavior, this work explores how conversations around misinformation are mediated through language use. We compare a number of linguistic measures, e.g., in-/out-group cues, readability, and discourse connectives, within and across topics of conversation and user communities. Our findings reveal increased presence of group identity signals and processing fluency within echo chambers during discussions of misinformation. We discuss the specific character of these broader trends across topics and examine contextual influences.</description>

      <title>Mining higher-order triadic interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex systems often present higher-order interactions which require us to go beyond their description in terms of pairwise networks. Triadic interactions are a fundamental type of higher-order interaction that occurs when one node regulates the interaction between two other nodes. Triadic interactions are a fundamental type of higher-order networks, found in a large variety of biological systems, from neuron-glia interactions to gene-regulation and ecosystems. However, triadic interactions have been so far mostly neglected. In this article, we propose a theoretical principle to model and mine triadic interactions from node metadata, and we apply this framework to gene expression data finding new candidates for triadic interactions relevant for Acute Myeloid Leukemia. Our work reveals important aspects of higher-order triadic interactions often ignored, which can transform our understanding of complex systems and be applied to a large variety of systems ranging from biology to the climate.</description>

      <title>Seed Selection in the Heterogeneous Moran Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Moran process is a classic stochastic process that models the rise and takeover of novel traits in network-structured populations. In biological terms, a set of mutants, each with fitness $m\in(0,\infty)$ invade a population of residents with fitness $1$. Each agent reproduces at a rate proportional to its fitness and each offspring replaces a random network neighbor. The process ends when the mutants either fixate (take over the whole population) or go extinct. The fixation probability measures the success of the invasion. To account for environmental heterogeneity, we study a generalization of the Standard process, called the Heterogeneous Moran process. Here, the fitness of each agent is determined both by its type (resident/mutant) and the node it occupies. We study the natural optimization problem of seed selection: given a budget $k$, which $k$ agents should initiate the mutant invasion to maximize the fixation probability? We show that the problem is strongly inapproximable: it is $\mathbf{NP}$-hard to distinguish between maximum fixation probability 0 and 1. We then focus on mutant-biased networks, where each node exhibits at least as large mutant fitness as resident fitness. We show that the problem remains $\mathbf{NP}$-hard, but the fixation probability becomes submodular, and thus the optimization problem admits a greedy $(1-1/e)$-approximation. An experimental evaluation of the greedy algorithm along with various heuristics on real-world data sets corroborates our results.</description>

      <title>An adaptation of InfoMap to absorbing random walks using absorption-scaled graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.10953v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: InfoMap is a popular approach to detect densely connected "communities" of nodes in networks. To detect such communities, InfoMap uses random walks and ideas from information theory. Motivated by the dynamics of disease spread on networks, whose nodes can have heterogeneous disease-removal rates, we adapt InfoMap to absorbing random walks. To do this, we use absorption-scaled graphs (in which edge weights are scaled according to absorption rates) and Markov time sweeping. One of our adaptations of InfoMap converges to the standard version of InfoMap in the limit in which the node-absorption rates approach $0$. We demonstrate that the community structure that one obtains using our adaptations of InfoMap can differ markedly from the community structure that one detects using methods that do not account for node-absorption rates. We also illustrate that the community structure that is induced by heterogeneous absorption rates can have important implications for susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) dynamics on ring-lattice networks. For example, in some situations, the outbreak duration is maximized when a moderate number of nodes have large node-absorption rates.</description>

      <title>Analyzing User Ideologies and Shared News During the 2019 Argentinian Elections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08701v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The extensive data generated on social media platforms allow us to gain insights over trending topics and public opinions. Additionally, it offers a window into user behavior, including their content engagement and news sharing habits. In this study, we analyze the relationship between users' political ideologies and the news they share during Argentina's 2019 election period. Our findings reveal that users predominantly share news that aligns with their political beliefs, despite accessing media outlets with diverse political leanings. Moreover, we observe a consistent pattern of users sharing articles related to topics biased to their preferred candidates, highlighting a deeper level of political alignment in online discussions. We believe that this systematic analysis framework can be applied to similar scenarios in different countries, especially those marked by significant political polarization, akin to Argentina.</description>

      <title>Message-Passing on Hypergraphs: Detectability, Phase Transitions and Higher-Order Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00708v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hypergraphs are widely adopted tools to examine systems with higher-order interactions. Despite recent advancements in methods for community detection in these systems, we still lack a theoretical analysis of their detectability limits. Here, we derive closed-form bounds for community detection in hypergraphs. Using a Message-Passing formulation, we demonstrate that detectability depends on hypergraphs' structural properties, such as the distribution of hyperedge sizes or their assortativity. Our formulation enables a characterization of the entropy of a hypergraph in relation to that of its clique expansion, showing that community detection is enhanced when hyperedges highly overlap on pairs of nodes. We develop an efficient Message-Passing algorithm to learn communities and model parameters on large systems. Additionally, we devise an exact sampling routine to generate synthetic data from our probabilistic model. With these methods, we numerically investigate the boundaries of community detection in synthetic datasets, and extract communities from real systems. Our results extend the understanding of the limits of community detection in hypergraphs and introduce flexible mathematical tools to study systems with higher-order interactions.</description>

      <title>Why do people think liberals drink lattes? How social media afforded self-presentation can shape subjective social sorting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02338v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Social sorting, the alignment of social identities, affiliations, and/or preferences with partisan groups, can increase in-party attachment and decrease out-party tolerance. We propose that self-presentation afforded by social media profiles fosters subjective social sorting by shaping perceptions of alignments between non-political and political identifiers. Unlike previous work, we evaluate social sorting of naturally occurring, public-facing identifiers in social media profiles selected using a bottom-up approach. Using a sample of 50 million X users collected five times between 2016 and 2018, we identify users who define themselves politically and generate networks representing simultaneous co-occurrence of identifiers in profiles. We then systematically measure the alignment of non-political identifiers along political dimensions, revealing alignments that reinforce existing associations, reveal unexpected relationships, and reflect online and offline events. We find that while most identifiers bridge political divides, social sorting of identifiers along political lines is occurring to some degree in X profiles. Our results have implications for understanding the role of social media in facilitating (the perception of) polarization and polarization mitigation strategies such as bridging interventions and algorithms.</description>

      <title>A Comparative Study on Enhancing Prediction in Social Network Advertisement through Data Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13812v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the ever-evolving landscape of social network advertising, the volume and accuracy of data play a critical role in the performance of predictive models. However, the development of robust predictive algorithms is often hampered by the limited size and potential bias present in real-world datasets. This study presents and explores a generative augmentation framework of social network advertising data. Our framework explores three generative models for data augmentation - Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) - to enrich data availability and diversity in the context of social network advertising analytics effectiveness. By performing synthetic extensions of the feature space, we find that through data augmentation, the performance of various classifiers has been quantitatively improved. Furthermore, we compare the relative performance gains brought by each data augmentation technique, providing insights for practitioners to select appropriate techniques to enhance model performance. This paper contributes to the literature by showing that synthetic data augmentation alleviates the limitations imposed by small or imbalanced datasets in the field of social network advertising. At the same time, this article also provides a comparative perspective on the practicality of different data augmentation methods, thereby guiding practitioners to choose appropriate techniques to enhance model performance.</description>

      <title>BotDGT: Dynamicity-aware Social Bot Detection with Dynamic Graph Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15070v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Detecting social bots has evolved into a pivotal yet intricate task, aimed at combating the dissemination of misinformation and preserving the authenticity of online interactions. While earlier graph-based approaches, which leverage topological structure of social networks, yielded notable outcomes, they overlooked the inherent dynamicity of social networks -- In reality, they largely depicted the social network as a static graph and solely relied on its most recent state. Due to the absence of dynamicity modeling, such approaches are vulnerable to evasion, particularly when advanced social bots interact with other users to camouflage identities and escape detection. To tackle these challenges, we propose BotDGT, a novel framework that not only considers the topological structure, but also effectively incorporates dynamic nature of social network. Specifically, we characterize a social network as a dynamic graph. A structural module is employed to acquire topological information from each historical snapshot. Additionally, a temporal module is proposed to integrate historical context and model the evolving behavior patterns exhibited by social bots and legitimate users. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of BotDGT against the leading methods that neglected the dynamic nature of social networks in terms of accuracy, recall, and F1-score.</description>

      <title>The False COVID-19 Narratives That Keep Being Debunked: A Spatiotemporal Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.12303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.12303v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic led to a global infodemic that has brought unprecedented challenges for citizens, media, and fact-checkers worldwide. To address this challenge, over a hundred fact-checking initiatives worldwide have been monitoring the information space in their countries and publishing regular debunks of viral false COVID-19 narratives. This study examines the database of the CoronaVirusFacts Alliance, which contains 10,381 debunks related to COVID-19 published in multiple languages by different fact-checking organisations. Our spatiotemporal analysis reveals that similar or nearly duplicate false COVID-19 narratives have been spreading in multiple modalities and on various social media platforms in different countries, sometimes as much as several months after the first debunk of that narrative has been published by an International Fact-checking Network (IFCN) fact-checker. We also find that misinformation involving general medical advice has spread across multiple countries and hence has the highest proportion of false COVID-19 narratives that keep being debunked. Furthermore, as manual fact-checking is an onerous task in itself, therefore the need to repeatedly debunk the same narrative in different countries is leading, over time, to a significant waste of fact-checker resources. To this end, we propose the idea of including a multilingual debunk search tool in the fact-checking pipeline, in addition to recommending strongly that social media platforms need to adopt the same technology at scale, so as to make the best use of scarce fact-checker resources.</description>

      <title>A Survey of Graph Meets Large Language Model: Progress and Future Directions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12399v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph plays a significant role in representing and analyzing complex relationships in real-world applications such as citation networks, social networks, and biological data. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs), which have achieved tremendous success in various domains, have also been leveraged in graph-related tasks to surpass traditional Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) based methods and yield state-of-the-art performance. In this survey, we first present a comprehensive review and analysis of existing methods that integrate LLMs with graphs. First of all, we propose a new taxonomy, which organizes existing methods into three categories based on the role (i.e., enhancer, predictor, and alignment component) played by LLMs in graph-related tasks. Then we systematically survey the representative methods along the three categories of the taxonomy. Finally, we discuss the remaining limitations of existing studies and highlight promising avenues for future research. The relevant papers are summarized and will be consistently updated at: https://github.com/yhLeeee/Awesome-LLMs-in-Graph-tasks.</description>

      <title>Multi-perspective Feedback-attention Coupling Model for Continuous-time Dynamic Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07983v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, representation learning over graph networks has gained popularity, with various models showing promising results. Despite this, several challenges persist: 1) most methods are designed for static or discrete-time dynamic graphs; 2) existing continuous-time dynamic graph algorithms focus on a single evolving perspective; and 3) many continuous-time dynamic graph approaches necessitate numerous temporal neighbors to capture long-term dependencies. In response, this paper introduces the Multi-Perspective Feedback-Attention Coupling (MPFA) model. MPFA incorporates information from both evolving and raw perspectives, efficiently learning the interleaved dynamics of observed processes. The evolving perspective employs temporal self-attention to distinguish continuously evolving temporal neighbors for information aggregation. Through dynamic updates, this perspective can capture long-term dependencies using a small number of temporal neighbors. Meanwhile, the raw perspective utilizes a feedback attention module with growth characteristic coefficients to aggregate raw neighborhood information. Experimental results on a self-organizing dataset and seven public datasets validate the efficacy and competitiveness of our proposed model.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models in Biomedical and Health Informatics: A Bibliometric Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16303v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have rapidly become important tools in Biomedical and Health Informatics (BHI), enabling new ways to analyze data, treat patients, and conduct research. This bibliometric review aims to provide a panoramic view of how LLMs have been used in BHI by examining research articles and collaboration networks from 2022 to 2023. It further explores how LLMs can improve Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications in various BHI areas like medical diagnosis, patient engagement, electronic health record management, and personalized medicine. To do this, our bibliometric review identifies key trends, maps out research networks, and highlights major developments in this fast-moving field. Lastly, it discusses the ethical concerns and practical challenges of using LLMs in BHI, such as data privacy and reliable medical recommendations. Looking ahead, we consider how LLMs could further transform biomedical research as well as healthcare delivery and patient outcomes. This bibliometric review serves as a resource for stakeholders in healthcare, including researchers, clinicians, and policymakers, to understand the current state and future potential of LLMs in BHI.</description>

      <title>Efficient GPU Implementation of Static and Incrementally Expanding DF-P PageRank for Dynamic Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08299v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: PageRank is a widely used centrality measure that "ranks" vertices in a graph by considering the connections and their importance. In this report, we first introduce one of the most efficient GPU implementations of Static PageRank, which recomputes PageRank scores from scratch. It uses a synchronous pull-based atomics-free PageRank computation, with the low and high in-degree vertices being partitioned and processed by two separate kernels. Next, we present our GPU implementation of incrementally expanding (and contracting) Dynamic Frontier with Pruning (DF-P) PageRank, which processes only a subset of vertices likely to change ranks. It is based on Static PageRank, and uses an additional partitioning between low and high out-degree vertices for incremental expansion of the set of affected vertices with two additional kernels. On a server with an NVIDIA A100 GPU, our Static PageRank outperforms Hornet and Gunrock's PageRank implementations by 31x and 5.9x respectively. On top of the above, DF-P PageRank outperforms Static PageRank by 2.1x on real-world dynamic graphs, and by 3.1x on large static graphs with random batch updates.</description>
