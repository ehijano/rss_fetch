      <title>Stochastic Vector Approximate Message Passing with applications to phase retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase retrieval refers to the problem of recovering a high-dimensional vector $\boldsymbol{x} \in \mathbb{C}^N$ from the magnitude of its linear transform $\boldsymbol{z} = A \boldsymbol{x}$, observed through a noisy channel. To improve the ill-posed nature of the inverse problem, it is a common practice to observe the magnitude of linear measurements $\boldsymbol{z}^{(1)} = A^{(1)} \boldsymbol{x},..., \boldsymbol{z}^{(L)} = A^{(L)}\boldsymbol{x}$ using multiple sensing matrices $A^{(1)},..., A^{(L)}$, with ptychographic imaging being a remarkable example of such strategies. Inspired by existing algorithms for ptychographic reconstruction, we introduce stochasticity to Vector Approximate Message Passing (VAMP), a computationally efficient algorithm applicable to a wide range of Bayesian inverse problems. By testing our approach in the setup of phase retrieval, we show the superior convergence speed of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>A reproducible pipeline for extracting representative signals from wire cuts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a reproducible pipeline for extracting representative signals from 2D topographic scans of the tips of cut wires. The process fully addresses many potential problems in the quality of wire cuts, including edge effects, extreme values, trends, missing values, angles, and warping. The resulting signals can be further used in source determination, which plays an important role in forensic examinations. With commonly used measurements such as the cross-correlation function, the procedure controls the false positive rate and false negative rate to the desirable values as the manual extraction pipeline but outperforms it with robustness and objectiveness.</description>

      <title>Scalable Bayesian Clustering for Integrative Analysis of Multi-View Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the era of Big Data, scalable and accurate clustering algorithms for high-dimensional data are essential. We present new Bayesian Distance Clustering (BDC) models and inference algorithms with improved scalability while maintaining the predictive accuracy of modern Bayesian non-parametric models. Unlike traditional methods, BDC models the distance between observations rather than the observations directly, offering a compromise between the scalability of distance-based methods and the enhanced predictive power and probabilistic interpretation of model-based methods. However, existing BDC models still rely on performing inference on the partition model to group observations into clusters. The support of this partition model grows exponentially with the dataset's size, complicating posterior space exploration and leading to many costly likelihood evaluations. Inspired by K-medoids, we propose using tessellations in discrete space to simplify inference by focusing the learning task on finding the best tessellation centers, or "medoids." Additionally, we extend our models to effectively handle multi-view data, such as data comprised of clusters that evolve across time, enhancing their applicability to complex datasets. The real data application in numismatics demonstrates the efficacy of our approach.</description>

      <title>On Nonparanormal Likelihoods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonparanormal models describe the joint distribution of multivariate responses via latent Gaussian, and thus parametric, copulae while allowing flexible nonparametric marginals. Some aspects of such distributions, for example conditional independence, are formulated parametrically. Other features, such as marginal distributions, can be formulated non- or semiparametrically. Such models are attractive when multivariate normality is questionable.
  Most estimation procedures perform two steps, first estimating the nonparametric part. The copula parameters come second, treating the marginal estimates as known. This is sufficient for some applications. For other applications, e.g. when a semiparametric margin features parameters of interest or when standard errors are important, a simultaneous estimation of all parameters might be more advantageous.
  We present suitable parameterisations of nonparanormal models, possibly including semiparametric effects, and define four novel nonparanormal log-likelihood functions. In general, the corresponding one-step optimization problems are shown to be non-convex. In some cases, however, biconvex problems emerge. Several convex approximations are discussed.
  From a low-level computational point of view, the core contribution is the score function for multivariate normal log-probabilities computed via Genz' procedure. We present transformation discriminant analysis when some biomarkers are subject to limit-of-detection problems as an application and illustrate possible empirical gains in semiparametric efficient polychoric correlation analysis.</description>

      <title>A functional regression model for heterogeneous BioGeoChemical Argo data in the Southern Ocean</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.04012v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Leveraging available measurements of our environment can help us understand complex processes. One example is Argo Biogeochemical data, which aims to collect measurements of oxygen, nitrate, pH, and other variables at varying depths in the ocean. We focus on the oxygen data in the Southern Ocean, which has implications for ocean biology and the Earth's carbon cycle. Systematic monitoring of such data has only recently begun to be established, and the data is sparse. In contrast, Argo measurements of temperature and salinity are much more abundant. In this work, we introduce and estimate a functional regression model describing dependence in oxygen, temperature, and salinity data at all depths covered by the Argo data simultaneously. Our model elucidates important aspects of the joint distribution of temperature, salinity, and oxygen. Due to fronts that establish distinct spatial zones in the Southern Ocean, we augment this functional regression model with a mixture component. By modelling spatial dependence in the mixture component and in the data itself, we provide predictions onto a grid and improve location estimates of fronts. Our approach is scalable to the size of the Argo data, and we demonstrate its success in cross-validation and a comprehensive interpretation of the model.</description>
