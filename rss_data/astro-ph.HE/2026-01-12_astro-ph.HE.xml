      <title>Accretion disc winds in X-ray binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite early theoretical expectations that large-scale, massive outflows would be triggered by accretion onto black holes and neutron stars, their presence was not firmly established until the 2000s. Since then, they have been recognised as a common, perhaps ubiquitous, feature of accretion discs in X-ray binaries. Over the past two decades, our understanding of these outflows has expanded significantly, with their associated phenomenology now observed across the X-ray, ultraviolet, optical, and near-infrared regimes. In this review, we provide a comprehensive summary of the observational properties of both low- and high-ionisation winds, treating each separately as well as part of a broader phenomenon, and place these findings in the context of current theoretical modelling. We discuss their close connection with disc atmospheres, their impact on the accretion process, and their role within the broader framework that includes the radio jet and the different accretion flow configurations and states. We also address current challenges and outline some of the anticipated developments, particularly those linked to upcoming observational facilities.</description>

      <title>Superluminous supernovae: diverse rise times explain diverse spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Type I superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) are a diverse class of exceptionally bright massive star explosions, which typically exhibit absorption from ionised oxygen in their early spectra. While their photometric properties (luminosity and duration) both span an order of magnitude, population studies suggest that these distributions are continuous. However, spectroscopic samples have shown some indications of distinct sub-types, either through similarity to certain prototype objects, or in terms of their velocity evolution. Here we show that a well-observed SLSN, PTF12dam, completely changes its O II absorption profile as it rises to maximum light, moving from one proposed sub-type to another. This supports an interpretation where spectroscopic diversity is driven by the ejecta temperature at maximum light, rather than fundamental differences in the explosion or progenitor. Motivated by this, we develop a new diagnostic, the Brightness-Timescale-Temperature-Radius diagram, and a simple toy model for the evolution of the photospheric velocity, to show that diversity in the light curve rise time (likely due to differences in ejected mass) naturally explains why SLSNe with broader light curves generally have weaker O II lines, lower photospheric velocities after maximum, and slower changes in photospheric velocity over time. We show that the velocity distribution of the known SLSN population favours a relatively flat ejecta density profile, consistent with a hot bubble inflated by a central engine.</description>

      <title>The Cosmic-ray Knee as a Local Signature of Nearby PeVatrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A "knee" in the cosmic-ray spectrum, characterized by a sudden steepening of the spectral shape at $\sim 4$ PeV, may be interpreted either as a global feature of Galactic cosmic rays or as a local signature. In the former scenario, cosmic-ray spectra throughout the Galaxy would be similar to that observed in the solar neighborhood, and the knee would be a common feature of the cosmic-ray sea. In the latter scenario, the PeV cosmic-ray flux varies across the Galactic disk, and the knee is dominantly contributed by a small number of nearby sources. By simulating cosmic-ray propagation in the Galactic magnetic field and interstellar medium, we show that the two scenarios correspond to different regimes of the birth rate of PeV proton accelerators and depend on the presence of powerful nearby sources. By comparison with both cosmic-ray and gamma-ray observations, we find that a local knee would be best explained by sources located at distances of order $\sim1$ kpc and with ages in the range 0.1-1 Myr, with the Cygnus Cocoon being a particularly promising candidate.</description>

      <title>Dust-obscured radio-emitting tidal disruption event coincident with a high-energy neutrino event</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the growing number of high-energy neutrinos (TeV-PeV) detected by IceCube, their astrophysical origins remain largely unidentified. Recent observations have linked a few tidal disruption events (TDEs) to the production of high-energy neutrino emission, all of which display dust-reprocessed infrared flares, indicating a dust- and gas-rich environment. By cross-matching the neutrino events and a sample of mid-infrared outbursts in nearby galaxies with transient radio flares, we uncover an optically obscured TDE candidate, SDSS J151345.75 $+$ 311125.2, which shows both spatial and temporal coincidence with the sub-PeV neutrino event IC170514B. Using a standard equipartition analysis of the synchrotron spectral evolution spanning 605 days post mid-infrared discovery, we find a little evolution in the radio-emitting region, with a kinetic energy up to $10^{51}$ erg, depending on the outflow geometry and shock acceleration efficiency assumed. High-resolution European VLBI Network imaging reveals a compact radio emission that is unresolved at a scale of $&lt;$ 2.1 pc, with a brightness temperature of $T_b&gt;5\times10^6$ K, suggesting that the observed late-time radio emission might originate from the interaction between a decelerating outflow and a dense circumnuclear medium. If the association is genuine, the neutrino production is possibly related to the acceleration of protons through pp collisions during the outflow expanding process, implying that the outflow-cloud interaction could provide a physical site with a high-density environment for producing the sub-PeV neutrinos. Such a scenario can be tested with future identifications of radio transients coincident with high-energy neutrinos.</description>

      <title>Probing the morphology of the Gum Nebula through pulsar observables and a novel distance estimation method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Various existing models of the Gum Nebula differ significantly in their parameters and suggested origins, which can be independently tested for consistency with data on some key observables of pulsars in the direction of the nebula. Our analysis of such data on the Vela pulsar, assuming a dominant scattering region in its foreground, suggests that the fractional distance of the scatterer is $0.89 \pm 0.01$, and for the given distance of the Vela pulsar, it translates to $254 \pm 16$ pc. Using independent distances of ten pulsars, we suggest a refined description of the Gum Nebula electron density model with its basic morphology similar to that used in the YMW16 model, which now provides better estimates of pulsar distances in these directions. In our new Gum Nebula model, as expected, the Vela pulsar would be behind the frontal edge of the Gum shell, which was intriguingly located in front of the nebula in the YMW16 model. We also present a new technique to better constrain the pulsar distances using their dispersion measure and temporal broadening simultaneously, and find that it is less affected by the uncertainties in the Galactic electron density distribution models. Notably, the new approach shows that the expected temporal broadening as a function of trial distance does not follow a monotonic increasing trend, but instead exhibits oscillations at regions of enhanced electron density. This behaviour is expected, as the method employs the integral form of temporal broadening with the appropriate weighting kernel, leading to more reliable estimates.</description>

      <title>A Minimalist Merger Interpretation of XRISM's Gas Velocity Measurements in the Coma Cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent microcalorimetric X-ray observations of the Coma cluster by XRISM have sparked active discussion regarding the physical origin of its gas velocity features. Here, we demonstrate that an off-axis minor merger in its early phase $-$ when the infalling subhalo is near its primary apocenter and the stripped tail is not yet mixed with the main cluster atmosphere $-$ can drive intracluster gas motions generally consistent with the XRISM results. These include a pronounced velocity gradient and an approximately uniform velocity dispersion of $\simeq100-200\,\rm{km\,s^{-1}}$ in the cluster core. Our merger scenario was originally suggested in Lyskova et al. (2019) to reproduce the major X-ray morphological features of Coma. In addition, we introduce a simple and robust diagnostic of intracluster gas motions based on the ratio of the line-of-sight velocity to the velocity dispersion.</description>

      <title>Feasibility of event-by-event primary mass discrimination using radio observables and supervised machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the feasibility of event-by-event primary mass discrimination using radio observables only. Although the analysis does not require an explicit reconstruction of the shower maximum ($X_{max}$), the discrimination power still arises from the sensitivity of the radio observables to the longitudinal development of the extensive air shower (EAS). Such radio-based approaches could be particularly relevant for radio-only experiments, such as GRAND. To assess this feasibility, we obtained conservative upper limits for the discrimination accuracy using a supervised machine-learning (ML) algorithm, namely a random forest (RF). The input features used were the peak electric fields and the spectral slopes, which have complementary discrimination power, along with the antenna distances to the shower axis. The RF was trained and tested using large event sets generated by the fast radio emission simulation and simplified detector response implemented in the RDSim framework. We obtained discrimination accuracies between 81\% and 96\% over the studied zenith range, even after normalizing each shower by its own electromagnetic energy. Since the analysis includes deliberately conservative choices, such as a large 10\% uncertainty on the reconstructed EM energy, these quoted values should be interpreted as conservative upper limits suitable for a feasibility assessment. Our results demonstrate that event-by-event primary mass discrimination using radio observables is, in principle, feasible.</description>

      <title>Investigating Active Galactic Nuclei variability with the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blazars, a type of active galactic nuclei (AGN) with relativistic jets pointed at the observer, exhibit flux variability across the electromagnetic spectrum due to particle acceleration in their jets. Power spectral density (PSD) studies show breaks at specific frequencies, particularly in X-rays, linked to the accretion regime and black hole mass. However, very-high-energy gamma-ray PSD breaks remain unexplored due to current instrument limitations. The Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO), with up to ten times greater sensitivity compared to current generation instruments, will allow precise PSD reconstruction and unprecedented study of blazar flares. These flares reveal key insights into particle acceleration, photon production, and jet properties. The AGN monitoring and flare programs in CTAO's Key Science Project aim to deepen our understanding of blazar emissions.</description>

      <title>The fate of the failed supernova candidate M31-2014-DS1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fate of massive stars above 20M$_{\odot}$ remains uncertain. Debate persists about whether they die as supernovae (SNe), or if they collapse directly into black holes (BHs) with little or no optical outburst -- so-called ``failed supernovae''. The source M31-2014-DS1 experienced an optical outburst in 2014 and has remained faint at visual wavelengths since then. Due to its persistent faintness, it has been proposed as a failed SN candidate. We present new observations of this candidate obtained using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), the Submillimeter Array (SMA), and Chandra. The JWST observations demonstrate that a luminous mid-infrared source persists at the same location a decade after the star faded at visual wavelengths. We model its current spectral energy distribution (SED) as a dust-enshrouded star. No X-ray emission is detected, disfavoring the hypothesis that the late-time luminosity is powered by accretion onto a BH. We find that the remaining source is highly obscured by an asymmetric distribution of circumstellar dust, making it difficult to quantify its physical properties using spherically symmetric radiative transfer codes. The dust geometry requires that the inferred bolometric luminosity is only a lower limit, as a significant fraction of the central source's radiation may escape without being reprocessed by dust. We discuss the implications of these findings in the context of failed SN models and consider the potential overlap with signatures expected from a stellar merger, which also seems to provide a plausible explanation of this source.</description>

      <title>Cosmic wallflowers: the circumgalactic origins of isolated ultra-compact star clusters at $z&gt;7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of gravitationally lensed stellar clusters at high redshift with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has revealed extremely compact, massive star-forming systems in galaxies at $z &gt; 6$, providing a new window into early cluster formation. In this work, we investigate star cluster formation in the circumgalactic environments of gas-rich galaxies with stellar masses spanning between $\sim$$10^{8}$ - $10^{11}$ M$_{\odot}$ at $z &gt; 7$, using the MassiveBlackPS cosmological hydrodynamical simulation with 2 pc resolution. We identify 55 baryon-dominated clusters forming outside galactic discs but within the virial radius of the primary halo. Star formation in these systems proceeds rapidly, reaching peak stellar surface densities above $10^{5}$ M$_{\odot}$ pc$^{-2}$, closely matching the compact clusters recently discovered by JWST in the lensed Cosmic Gems Arc at $z \approx 9.6$. Such extreme densities are a key pre-requisite to trigger runaway stellar collisions, indicating that a subset of our clusters would be a likely host of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs). We find that massive star clusters can form efficiently in the circumgalactic medium at early times through filament fragmentation, whereby high gas densities lead to rapid local collapse via a combination of thermal and gravitational instabilities. This formation pathway implies that some compact clusters formed in the quiet outskirts of forming galaxies rather than within their discs. Small variations in filament properties, including metallicity, density, and dark-matter content, influence the likelihood of a star cluster being able to form an IMBH seed. The formation of clusters in circumgalactic environments points to a potential evolutionary pathway connecting early off-disc clusters, present-day globular clusters, and the seeds of massive BHs.</description>

      <title>Dipole Radiation and Kinetic Mixing from Dark Photon Solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wave-like dark matter composed of spin-1 particles, known as dark photons, is theorized to form clumps called "vector solitons". These solitons are compact astrophysical objects that exhibit coherent oscillations and a high concentration relative to the local dark matter density. A significant portion of dark matter in galactic halos today may consist of these solitons. This study explores how photons can be produced from these vector solitons by the influence of external electromagnetic fields or charge densities, via a dimension-6 dark photon-photon coupling and a kinetic mixing, respectively. We further explore the astrophysical implications of these phenomena, highlighting a novel avenue for dark matter discovery that our research provides.</description>

      <title>A nonlinear voice from GW250114 ringdown</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detection of quadratic quasi-normal modes would provide a direct probe into black hole nonlinear perturbations. We report the first observational evidence of a set of quadratic quasi-normal modes in the gravitational-wave ringdown of a binary black hole merger. Analyzing the signal from GW250114, we detect six nonlinear modes from the quadratic coupling of the fundamental $(2,2,0)$ mode and its first two overtones. At 5 final mass ($M_\mathrm{f}$) after the merger, the evidence for these nonlinear modes reaches a Bayes factor of 74. To single out these contributions, we employ recent theoretical progress to compute the waveforms and subtract the corresponding nonlinear modes from a numerical relativity surrogate waveform. Our data analysis uses a novel method that incorporates inspiral-merger inference results as a highly constraining prior for the ringdown inference. We further perform a test allowing for phenomenological deviations for the theoretically predicted amplitudes of the quadratic modes. The results show that an amplitude of zero is excluded at $3.0~\sigma$ significance level, while the theoretical expectation is consistent with the inference. This detection marks a first step towards observationally characterizing nonlinear perturbations in the ringdown of a black hole.</description>

      <title>Fading into darkness: A weak mass ejection and low-efficiency fallback accompanying black hole formation in M31-2014-DS1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stellar-mass black holes (BHs) can form from the near-complete collapse of massive stars, causing them to abruptly disappear. The star M31-2014-DS1 in the Andromeda galaxy was reported to exhibit such a disappearance between 2014 and 2022, with properties consistent with the failed explosion of a $\approx 12 - 13$ M$_\odot$ yellow supergiant leading to the formation of a $\approx 5$ M$_\odot$ BH. We present mid-infrared (MIR) observations of the remnant obtained with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and X-ray observations from the Chandra X-ray Observatory in 2024. The JWST MIRI/NIRSpec data reveal an extremely red source, showing strong blueshifted absorption from molecular gas (CO, CO$_2$, H$_2$O, SO$_2$) and deep silicate dust features. Modeling the dust continuum confirms continued bolometric fading of the central source to $\log(L/L_\odot)\approx3.88$ ($\approx7-8$% of the progenitor luminosity), surrounded by a dust shell spanning $\approx40-200$ au. Modeling of the molecular gas indicates $\sim 0.1$ M$_\odot$ of gas expanding at $\approx 100$ km s$^{-1}$ near the inner edge of the dust shell. No X-ray source is detected down to a luminosity limit of $L_X\lesssim1.5\times10^{35}$ erg s$^{-1}$. We show that the panchromatic observations are explained by (i) a low-energy ($\approx10^{46}$ erg) ejection of the outer H-rich progenitor envelope and (ii) a fading central BH powered by inefficient ($\sim0.1$% in mass) accretion of loosely bound fallback material. The analysis robustly establishes the bolometric fading of M31-2014-DS1 and provides the first cohesive insights into BH formation via low-energy explosions and long-term fallback.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Ionization by Schwarzschild Primordial Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.05935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) are theorized to form from the collapse of overdensities in the very early Universe. PBHs in the asteroid-mass range $10^{17} \, {\rm g}\lesssim M \lesssim 10^{23} \, {\rm g}$ could serve as all or most of the dark matter today, but are particularly difficult to detect due to their modest rates of Hawking emission and sub-micron Schwarzschild radii. We consider whether the steep gradients of a PBH's gravitational field could generate tidal forces strong enough to disrupt atoms and nuclei. Such phenomena may yield new observables that could uniquely distinguish a PBH from a macroscopic object of the same mass. We first consider the gravitational ionization of ambient neutral hydrogen and evaluate prospects for detecting photon radiation from the recombination of ionized atoms. During the present epoch, this effect would be swamped by Hawking radiation -- which would itself be difficult to detect for PBHs at the upper end of the asteroid-mass window. We then consider the gravitational ionization and heating of neutral hydrogen immediately following recombination at $z\simeq1090$, and identify a broad class of PBH distributions with typical mass $5\times10^{21}\,{\rm g}\lesssim M \lesssim 10^{23}\, {\rm g}$ within which gravitational interactions would have been the dominant form of energy deposition to the medium. We also identify conditions under which tidal forces from a transiting PBH could overcome the strong nuclear force, either by dissociating deuterons, which would be relevant during big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN), or by inducing fission of heavy nuclei. We find that gravitational dissociation of deuterons dominates photodissociation rates due to Hawking radiation for PBHs with masses $10^{14}\,{\rm g}\lesssim M \lesssim 10^{16}\,{\rm g}$. We additionally identify the phenomenon of gravitationally induced fission of heavy nuclei via tidal deformation.</description>

      <title>Skyrme-Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov mass models on a 3D mesh: V. The N2LO extension of the Skyrme EDF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present BSkG5, the latest entry in the Brussels-Skyrme-on-a-Grid (BSkG) series and the first large-scale nuclear structure model based on next-to-next-to-leading order (N2LO) Skyrme energy density functional (EDF). By extending the traditional Skyrme EDF ansatz with central terms containing up to four gradients, we are able to combine an excellent global description of nuclear ground state properties with a stiff equation of state for pure neutron matter that is consistent with all astronomical observations of neutron stars. More precisely, the new model matches the accuracy of earlier BSkG models but with two parameters less: we achieve root-mean-square deviations of 0.649 MeV for 2457 atomic masses, 0.0267 fm for 810 charge radii, and 0.43 MeV for 45 primary fission barriers of actinide nuclei. We demonstrate that the complexities of N2LO EDFs are not insurmountable, even for demanding many-body calculations.</description>

      <title>Constraining Hamiltonians from chiral effective field theory with neutron-star data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-messenger observations of neutron stars (NSs) and their mergers have placed strong constraints on the dense-matter equation of state (EOS). The EOS, in turn, depends on microscopic nuclear interactions that are described by nuclear Hamiltonians. These Hamiltonians are commonly derived within chiral effective field theory (EFT). Ideally, multi-messenger observations of NSs could be used to directly inform our understanding of EFT interactions, but such a direct inference necessitates millions of model evaluations. This is computationally prohibitive because each evaluation requires us to calculate the EOS from a Hamiltonian by solving the quantum many-body problem with methods such as auxiliary-field diffusion Monte Carlo (AFDMC), which provides very accurate and precise solutions but at a significant computational cost. Additionally, we need to solve the stellar structure equations for each EOS which further slows down each model evaluation by a few seconds. In this work, we combine emulators for AFDMC calculations of neutron matter, built using parametric matrix models, and for the stellar structure equations, built using multilayer perceptron neural networks, with the \texttt{PyCBC} data-analysis framework to enable a direct inference of coupling constants in an EFT Hamiltonian using multi-messenger observations of NSs. We find that astrophysical data can provide informative constraints on two-nucleon couplings despite the high densities probed in NS interiors.</description>

      <title>Testing the Shock-cooling Emission Model from Star-disk Collisions for Quasi-periodic Eruptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12762v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs), the repeated outbursts observed in soft X-ray bands, have attracted broad interest, but their physical origin is under debate. One of the popular models, the star-disk collision model, suggests that QPEs can be produced through periodic collisions of an orbiting star with the accretion disk of a central black hole (BH). However, previous tests of the star-disk collision model mainly focus on the timing analysis. Other observed properties, such as peak luminosities $L_{\rm{p}}$, durations $t_{\rm{e}}$, and radiation temperatures $T_{\rm{p}}$ of the eruptions, are not systematically investigated. For a sample of six QPE sources and two QPE-like sources, we test the shock-cooling emission model from star-disk collisions by using these observables to derive the constraints on the stellar radius $R_\star$. We find that, except for two sources (eRo-QPE3 and eRo-QPE4), the rest of the sample either has no allowed $R_\star$ to simultaneously reproduce the observed $L_{\rm{p}}$ and $t_{\rm{e}}$, or the required $R_\star$ is too large to avoid being disrupted by the central BH. For the two exceptions, a stellar radius of the order of $1\ R_{\rm{\odot}}$ is necessary to satisfy all the constraints. Another issue with the simplest version of this model is that it predicts $k T_{\rm{p}} \sim 10\ \rm{eV}$, one order of magnitude lower than the observed value.</description>

      <title>Violent mergers revisited: The origin of the fastest stars in the Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11781v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Binary systems of two carbon-oxygen white dwarfs are one of the most promising candidates for the progenitor systems of Type Ia supernovae.
  Violent mergers, where the primary white dwarf ignites when the secondary white dwarf smashes onto it while being disrupted on its last orbit, were the first proposed double degenerate merger scenario that ignites dynamically.
  However, violent mergers likely contribute only a few per cent to the total Type Ia supernova rate and do not yield normal Type Ia supernova light curves.
  Here we revisit the scenario, simulating a violent merger with better methods, and in particular a more accurate treatment of the detonation.
  We find good agreement with previous simulations, with one critical difference. The secondary white dwarf, being disrupted and accelerated towards the primary white dwarf, and impacted by its explosion, does not fully burn. Its core survives as a bound object.
  The explosion leaves behind a $0.16\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ carbon-oxygen white dwarf travelling $2800\,\mathrm{km/s}$, making it an excellent (and so far the only) candidate to explain the origin of the fastest observed hyper-velocity white dwarfs.
  We also show that before the explosion, $5\times10^{-3}\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ of material consisting predominantly of helium, carbon, and oxygen has already been ejected at velocities above $1000\,\mathrm{km/s}$.
  Finally, we argue that if a violent merger made D6-1 and D6-3, and violent mergers require the most massive primary white dwarfs in binaries of two carbon-oxygen white dwarfs, there has to be a much larger population of white dwarf mergers with slightly lower-mass primary white dwarfs. Because of its size, this population can essentially only give rise to normal Type Ia supernovae, likely exploding via the quadruple detonation channel and leaving no bound object behind.</description>

      <title>First detection of ultra-high energy emission from gamma-ray binary LS I +61 303</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23345v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the first detection of gamma-ray emission up to ultra-high-energy (UHE; $&gt;$100 TeV) emission from the prototypical gamma-ray binary system LS I +61 303 using data from the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO). It is detected with significances of 9.2$\sigma$ in WCDA (1.4--30.5 TeV) and 6.2$\sigma$ in KM2A (25--267 TeV); in KM2A alone we identify 16 photon-like events above 100 TeV against an estimated 5.1 background events, corresponding to a 3.8$\sigma$ detection. These results provide compelling evidence of extreme particle acceleration in LS I +61 303. Furthermore, we observe orbital modulation at 4.0$\sigma$ confidence between 25 and 100 TeV, and a hint of energy-dependent orbital modulation. These features can be understood in a composite scenario in which leptonic and hadronic processes jointly contribute.</description>

      <title>First Results from the PanRadio Gamma-Ray Burst Collaboration: The 400-day Afterglow of GRB 230815A</title>

Abstract: We introduce the PanRadio Gamma-ray Burst (GRB) program carried out on the Australia Telescope Compact Array: a systematic, multi-year, radio survey of all southern $\textit{Swift}$ GRB events, comprehensively following the multi-frequency evolution of their afterglows from within an hour to years post-burst. We present the results of the 400-day observing campaign following the afterglow of the long-duration (collapsar) GRB 230815A, the first one detected through this program. Typically, GRB 230815A would not otherwise receive traditional radio follow-up, given it has no known redshift and lacks comprehensive multi-wavelength follow-up due to its high line-of-sight extinction with $A_V=2.3$. We found its early X-ray jet break at ${\sim}0.1$ days post-burst to be at odds with the evolution of the multi-frequency radio light curves that were traced over an unusually long duration of $400$ days. The radio light curves approximately evolved (with minor deviations) according to the standard self-similar expansion for a relativistic blast wave in a homogeneous environment prior to the jet break, showing no evidence for evolutions of the microphysical parameters describing the electron acceleration processes. We reconcile these features by proposing a two-component jet: the early X-ray break originates from a narrow component with a half-opening angle ${\sim}2.1^{\circ}$, while the evolution of the radio afterglow stems from a wider component with a half-opening angle of $\gtrapprox 35^{\circ}$. The PanRadio GRB program will establish a sample of comprehensively followed GRBs, where a rigorous inspection of their microphysical and dynamical parameters can be performed, thereby revealing the diversity of features in their outflows and environments.</description>

      <title>On the Cooling of Compact Stars in Light of the HESS J1731-347 Remnant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21406v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent analyses on the central compact object in the HESS J1731-347 supernova remnant reported not only surprising structural properties (mass $M$ and radius $R$), but also an interesting thermal evolution. More precisely, it has been estimated that $M=0.77^{+0.20}_{-0.17}M_\odot$ and $R=10.4^{+0.86}_{-0.78}$ km (at the $1\sigma$ level), while a redshited surface temperature of $153^{+4}_ {-2}$ keV at an age of 2-6 kyrs has been reported. In the present work, we conduct an in-depth investigation on the possible nature (hadronic, hybrid, quark) of this compact object by attempting to not only explain its mass and radius but also the corresponding estimations for its temperature and age. In the case of hybrid stars we also examine possible effects of the symmetry energy on the activation of different neutrino emitting process, and hence on the resulting cooling curves. We found that the reported temperature and age may be compatible to hadronic stellar configurations regardless of whether pairing effects are included. In the scenario of hybrid stars, we found that the strange quark matter core has to be in a superconducting state in order to reach an agreement with the observational constraints. In addition, the hadronic phase must be soft enough so that the direct Urca process is not activated. Furthermore, we have shown that the considered cooling constraints can be reconciled within the framework of strange stars. However, quark matter has to be in a superconducting state and the quark direct Urca process needs to be blocked.</description>

      <title>A solution to the S8 tension through neutrino-dark matter interactions</title>

Abstract: Neutrinos and dark matter (DM) are two of the least understood components of the Universe, yet both play crucial roles in cosmic evolution. Clues about their fundamental properties may emerge from discrepancies in cosmological measurements across different epochs of cosmic history. Possible interactions between them could leave distinctive imprints on cosmological observables, offering a rare window into dark sector physics beyond the standard $\Lambda$CDM framework. We present compelling evidence that DM-neutrino interactions can resolve the persistent structure growth parameter discrepancy, $S_8 = \sigma_8\,\sqrt{\Omega_m/0.3}$, between early and late universe observations. By incorporating cosmic shear measurements from current Weak Lensing surveys, we demonstrate that an interaction strength of $u \sim 10^{-4}$ not only provides a coherent explanation for the high-multipole observations from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (\texttt{ACT}), but also alleviates the $S_8$ discrepancy. Combining early universe constraints with \texttt{DES Y3 cosmic shear} data yields a nearly $3\sigma$ preference for non-zero DM neutrino interactions. This strengthens previous observational claims and provides a clear path toward a significant breakthrough in cosmological research. Our findings challenge the standard $\Lambda$CDM paradigm and highlight the potential of future large-scale structure surveys, which can rigorously test this interaction and unveil the fundamental properties of DM.</description>

      <title>Realistic assessment of a single gravitational wave source localization taking into account precise pulsar distances with pulsar timing arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02819v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) are anticipated to detect continuous gravitational waves (GWs) from individual supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) in the near future. To identify the host galaxy of a GW source, PTAs require significantly improved angular resolution beyond the typical range of 100-1000 square degrees achieved by recent continuous GW searches. In this study, we investigate how precise pulsar distance measurements can enhance the localization of a single GW source. Accurate distance information, comparable to or better than the GW wavelength (typically 1~pc) can refine GW source localization. In the near future, with the advent of Square Kilometre Array (SKA), such high-precision distance measurements will be feasible for a few nearby pulsars. We focus on the relatively nearby pulsars J0437-4715 (156 pc) and J0030+0451 (331 pc), incorporating their actual distance uncertainties based on current VLBI measurements and the anticipated precision of the SKA-era. By simulating 87 pulsars with the GW signal and Gaussian white noise in the timing residuals, we assess the impact of the pulsar distance information on GW source localization. Our results show that without precise distance information, localization remains insufficient to identify host galaxies under 10 ns noise. However, incorporating SKA-era distance precision for nearby pulsars J0437-4715 and J0030+0451 can reduce localization uncertainties to the required level of $10^{-3}$ $\rm deg^{2}$. Localization accuracy strongly depends on the geometric configuration of pulsars with well-measured distances and improves notably near and between such pulsars. The improvement of the localization will greatly aid in identifying the host galaxy of a GW source and constructing an SMBHB catalog. It will further enable follow-up electromagnetic observations to investigate the SMBHB in greater detail.</description>

      <title>Cascading from the winds to the disk: the universality of supernovae-driven turbulence in different galactic interstellar media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01653v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Star-forming galaxies are in a state of turbulence, with one of the principle components of the turbulence sourced by the constant injection of momentum from supernovae (SNe) explosions. Utilizing high-resolution stratified, gravito-hydrodynamical models of SNe-driven turbulence with interstellar medium (ISM) cooling and heating, we explore how SNe-driven turbulence changes across different galactic conditions, parameterized by the galactic mass and potential, SNe-driving rate, and seeding functions. We show that even though the underlying ISM changes between starburst and Milky Way analogue models, the velocity fluctuations in the turbulence of both models, but not the kinetic energy fluctuations, can be normalized into a universal, single cascade, $du^2(k)/dk \propto k^{-3/2}$, where $u$ is the velocity and $k$ is the wavemode, indicating that the structure of the turbulence is robust to significant changes in the ISM and SNe seeding. Moreover, the cascades connect smoothly from the winds into the galactic disk, pushing the outer-scale of the turbulence, $\ell_{\rm cor}$, to over $\ell_{\rm cor} \approx 6 \ell_0$, where $\ell_0$ is the gaseous scale-height. By providing an analytical model for the sound speed spectrum, $dc_s^2(k)/dk$, in the weak-cooling, adiabatic limit, we show that it is the compressible turbulent modes, $u_c$, that control the volume-filling phase structure of the galactic disks in our models, with $dc_s^2(k)/dk \propto k^{-2} \propto du_c^2(k)/dk$. This may indicate that galactic turbulence does not only have highly-universal features across different galaxies, but also directly sets the volume-filling hot and warm phase structure of the underlying galactic ISM through turbulent compressible modes.</description>

      <title>A relativistic treatment of accretion disk torques on extreme mass-ratio inspirals around non-spinning black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20457v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a relativistically accurate formalism to model the interaction between stellar mass compact objects embedded in thin accretion disks around a non-spinning supermassive black hole, using tools from self-force theory and Hamiltonian perturbation theory. We then apply this formalism to analyze the evolution of a compact object on a nearly circular and equatorial orbit interacting with a thin equatorial disk. We provide analytic and relativistically-accurate expressions for the rates of energy and angular momentum exchanged during interactions due to Lindblad and corotation resonances. Our results show that relativistic corrections can enhance the magnitude of the torque by 1-2 orders of magnitude compared to purely Newtonian expressions when the orbit of the compact object is smaller than $10$ Schwarzschild radii of the supermassive black hole. We also demonstrate that strong relativistic shifts the inner Lindblad resonances closer to the compact object than the outer Lindblad resonances when the compact object is closer than 4 Schwarzschild radii to the supermassive black hole, potentially leading to a reversal in the direction of the torque acting on the compact object. Finally, we provide a dephasing estimate and show that using the relativistic torque formula is crucial to obtain reliable estimates for extreme mass ratio inspirals in orbits closer than 5 Schwarzschild radii to the supermassive black hole. Our results highlight the importance of using relativistically-accurate models of environmental interactions in extreme mass-ratio inspirals close to a supermassive black hole.</description>

      <title>Astrophysical Reaction Rates for Charged-Particle Induced Reactions on Proton-Rich Nuclides</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03206v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Astrophysical reaction rates for reactions with proton-rich isotopes of Ne to Bi from stability to the proton dripline were calculated with an updated version of the SMARAGD statistical model (Hauser-Feshbach) code. Here, the focus was on reactions with protons or $\alpha$ particles as required for nucleosynthesis in proton-rich matter. For completeness, also neutron-induced reactions are provided for the same set of targets. Some comments on dependencies of rates on various nuclear properties and on the appropriate way to compare to experiments are given. The new rate set for charged-particle induced reactions provides a better description of experimental data than previously widely used rates, especially for reactions involving $\alpha$ particles.</description>

      <title>High-energy astrochemistry in the molecular interstellar medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10060v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the past decade, there has been a significant shift in astrochemistry with a renewed focus on the role of non-thermal processes on the molecular interstellar medium, in particular energetic particles (such as cosmic ray particles and fast electrons) and X-ray radiation. This has been brought about in large part due to new observations of interstellar complex organic molecules (iCOMS) in environments that would inhibit their formation, such as cold, dense gas in prestellar cores or in the highly energetic environments in galactic centers. In parallel, there has been a plethora of new laboratory investigations on the role of high-energy radiation and electrons on the chemistry of astrophysical ices, demonstrating the ability of this radiation to induce complex chemistry. In recent years, theoretical models have also begun to include newer cosmic-ray-driven processes in both the gas and ice phases. In this review, we unify aspects of the chemistry driven by X-ray radiation and energetic particles into a ``high-energy astrochemistry'', defining this term and reviewing the underlying chemical processes. We conclude by examining various laboratories where high-energy astrochemistry is at play and identify future issues to be tackled.</description>

      <title>Graviton-Photon Mixing by a Kerr-Newman Black Hole with Worldline EFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00980v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In black hole perturbation theory, the difficulty in separating electromagnetic and gravitational sectors of the coupled Teukolsky equations has prevented a general treatment of scattering processes involving both electromagnetic waves and gravitational waves in presence of a Kerr-Newman black hole. We present the first computation of the gauge-invariant, low-frequency scattering amplitude for graviton photoproduction by a Kerr-Newman black hole at tree level up to $\mathcal{O}\big((\omega/m)^2\big)$ or $\mathcal{O}(S^2)$ and linear in $\kappa$, using the worldline effective field theory. The relevant Wilson coefficients are determined by matching the graviton and photon one-point functions to the Kerr-Newman solution. We obtain the full angular dependence of the conversion cross section in the presence of spin and comment on the factorization relation between the graviton photoproduction amplitude and the photon Compton amplitude for a classical spinning source. The result provides a benchmark for future analyses of coupled gravitoelectromagnetic scattering in spinning charged compact object backgrounds.</description>
