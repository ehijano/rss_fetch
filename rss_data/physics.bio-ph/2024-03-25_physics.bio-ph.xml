      <title>Incorporating Heterogeneous Interactions for Ecological Biodiversity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the behaviors of ecological systems is challenging given their multi-faceted complexity. To proceed, theoretical models such as Lotka-Volterra dynamics with random interactions have been investigated by the dynamical mean-field theory to provide insights into underlying principles such as how biodiversity and stability depend on the randomness in interaction strength. Yet the fully-connected structure assumed in these previous studies is not realistic as revealed by a vast amount of empirical data. We derive a generic formula for the abundance distribution under an arbitrary distribution of degree, the number of interacting neighbors, which leads to degree-dependent abundance patterns of species. Notably, in contrast to the well-mixed system, the number of surviving species can be reduced as the community becomes cooperative in heterogeneous interaction structures. Our study, therefore, demonstrates that properly taking into account heterogeneity in the interspecific interaction structure is indispensable to understanding the diversity in large ecosystems, and our general theoretical framework can apply to a much wider range of interacting many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Cell-level modelling of homeostasis in confined epithelial monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tissue homeostasis, the biological process of maintaining a steady state in tissue via control of cell proliferation, death, and metabolic function, is essential for the development, growth, maintenance, and proper function of living organisms. Disruptions to this process can lead to serious diseases and even death. In this study, we use the vertex model for the cell-level description of tissue mechanics to investigate the impact of the tissue microenvironment and local mechanical properties of cells on homeostasis in confined epithelial tissues. We find a dynamic steady state, where the balance between cell divisions and removals sustains homeostasis. By characterising homeostasis in terms of cell count, tissue area, and the cells' neighbour count distribution, we identify the factors that govern regulated and ordered tissue growth. This work, therefore, sheds light on the mechanisms underlying tissue homeostasis and highlights the importance of mechanics in the control of biological processes such as tissue development and disease pathology.</description>

      <title>Isoleucine gate blocks K+ conduction in C-type inactivation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels display a time-dependent phenomenon called C-type inactivation, whereby prolonged activation by voltage leads to the inhibition of ionic conduction, a process that involves a conformational change at the selectivity filter toward a non-conductive state. Recently, a high-resolution structure of a strongly inactivating triple-mutant channel kv1.2-kv2.1-3m revealed a novel conformation of the selectivity filter that is dilated at its outer end, distinct from the well-characterized conductive state. While the experimental structure was interpreted as the elusive non-conductive state, molecular dynamics simulations and electrophysiology measurements demonstrate that the dilated filter of kv1.2-kv2.1-3m, however, is conductive and, as such, cannot completely account for the inactivation of the channel observed in functional experiments. An additional conformational change implicating isoleucine residues at position 398 along the pore lining segment S6 is required to effectively block ion conduction. It is shown that the I398 residues from the four subunits act as a state-dependent hydrophobic gate located immediately beneath the selectivity filter. As a critical piece of the C-type inactivation machinery, this structural feature is the potential target of a broad class of QA blockers and negatively charged activators thus opening new research directions towards the development of drugs that specifically modulate gating-states of Kv channels.</description>

      <title>On machine learning analysis of atomic force microscopy images for image classification, sample surface recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomic force microscopy (AFM or SPM) imaging is one of the best matches with machine learning (ML) analysis among microscopy techniques. The digital format of AFM images allows for direct utilization in ML algorithms without the need for additional processing. Additionally, AFM enables the simultaneous imaging of distributions of over a dozen different physicochemical properties of sample surfaces, a process known as multidimensional imaging. While this wealth of information can be challenging to analyze using traditional methods, ML provides a seamless approach to this task. However, the relatively slow speed of AFM imaging poses a challenge in applying deep learning methods broadly used in image recognition. This Prospective is focused on ML recognition/classification when using a relatively small number of AFM images, small database. We discuss ML methods other than popular deep-learning neural networks. The described approach has already been successfully used to analyze and classify the surfaces of biological cells. It can be applied to recognize medical images, specific material processing, in forensic studies, even to identify the authenticity of arts. A general template for ML analysis specific to AFM is suggested, with a specific example of the identification of cell phenotype. Special attention is given to the analysis of the statistical significance of the obtained results, an important feature that is often overlooked in papers dealing with machine learning. A simple method for finding statistical significance is also described.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic approaches for studies of site-specific DNA base and backbone "breathing" using exciton-coupled dimer-labeled DNA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: DNA regulation and repair processes require direct interactions between proteins and DNA at specific sites. Local fluctuations of the sugar-phosphate backbones and bases of DNA (a form of DNA "breathing") play a central role in such processes. Here we review the development and application of novel spectroscopic methods and analyses - both at the ensemble and single-molecule levels - to study structural and dynamic properties of exciton-coupled cyanine and fluorescent nucleobase analogue dimer-labeled DNA constructs at key positions involved in protein-DNA complex assembly and function. The exciton-coupled dimer probes act as "sensors" of the local conformations adopted by the sugar-phosphate backbones and bases immediately surrounding the dimer probes. These methods can be used to study the mechanisms of protein binding and function at these sites.</description>

      <title>Amino Acids and Their Biological Derivatives Modulate Protein-Protein Interactions In an Additive Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protein-protein interactions (PPI) differ when measured in test tubes and cells due to the complexity of the intracellular environment. Free amino acids (AAs) and their derivatives constitute a significant fraction of the intracellular volume and mass. Recently, we have found that AAs have a general property of rendering protein dispersions more stable by reducing the net attractive part of PPI. Here, we study the effects on PPI of different AA derivatives, AA mixtures, and short peptides. We find that all the tested AA derivatives modulate PPI in solution as well as AAs. Furthermore, we show that the modulation effect is additive when AAs form mixtures or are bound into short peptides. Therefore, this study demonstrates the universal effect of a class of small molecules (i.e. AAs and their biological derivatives) on the modulation of PPI and provides insights into rationally designing biocompatible molecules for stabilizing protein interactions and consequently tuning protein functions.</description>

      <title>Enhanced extracellular matrix remodeling due to embedded spheroid fluidization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tumor spheroids are in vitro three-dimensional, cellular collectives consisting of cancerous cells. Embedding these spheroids in an in vitro fibrous environment, such as a collagen network, to mimic the extracellular matrix (ECM) provides an essential platform to quantitatively investigate the biophysical mechanisms leading to tumor invasion of the ECM. To understand the mechanical interplay between tumor spheroids and the ECM, we computationally construct and study a three-dimensional vertex model for a tumor spheroid that is mechanically coupled to a cross-linked network of fibers. In such a vertex model, cells are represented as deformable polyhedrons that share faces. Some fraction of the boundary faces of the tumor spheroid contain linker springs connecting the center of the boundary face to the nearest node in the fiber network. As these linker springs actively contract, the fiber network remodels. By toggling between fluid-like and solid-like spheroids via changing the dimensionless cell shape index, we find that the spheroid rheology affects the remodeling of the fiber network. More precisely, fluid-like spheroids displace the fiber network more on average near the vicinity of the spheroid than solid-like spheroids. We also find more densification of the fiber network near the spheroid for the fluid-like spheroids. These spheroid rheology-dependent effects are the result of cellular motility due to active cellular rearrangements that emerge over time in the fluid-like spheroids to generate spheroid shape fluctuations. Our results uncover intricate morphological-mechanical interplay between an embedded spheroid and its surrounding fiber network with both spheroid contractile strength and spheroid shape fluctuations playing important roles in the pre-invasion stages of tumor invasion.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium relaxation inequality on short timescales</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An integral relation is derived from the Fokker-Planck equation which connects the steady-state probability currents with the dynamics of relaxation on short timescales in the limit of small perturbation fields. As a consequence of this integral relation, a lower bound on the steady-state entropy production is obtained. For the particular case of an ensemble of random perturbation fields of weak spatial gradient, a simpler bound is derived from the integral relation which provides a feasible method to estimate entropy production from relaxation experiments.</description>

      <title>The effect of inter-track coupling on H$_2$O$_2$ productions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background: Lower production of H$_2$O$_2$ in water is a hallmark of ultra-high dose rate (UHDR) compared to the conventional dose rate (CDR). However, the current computational models based on the predicted yield of H$_2$O$_2$ are in opposite of the experimental data. Methods: We construct an analytical model for the rate equation in the production of H$_2$O$_2$ from \ce{^{.}OH}-radicals and use it as a guide to propose a hypothetical geometrical inhomogeneity in the configuration of particles in the FLASH-UHDR beams. We perform a series of Monte Carlo (MC) simulations of the track structures for a system of charged particles impinging the medium in the form of clusters and/or bunches. Results: We demonstrate the interplay of diffusion, reaction rates, and overlaps in track-spacing attribute to a lower yield of H$_2$O$_2$ at FLASH-UHDR vs. CDR. This trend is reversed if spacing among the tracks becomes larger than a critical value, with a length scale that is proportional to the diffusion length of \ce{^{.}OH}-radicals modulated by a rate of decay due to recombination with other species, available within a track, and the space among the tracks. The latter is substantial on the suppressing of the H$_2$O$_2$ population at FLASH-UHDR relative to CDR. Conclusions: Based on our analysis of the present work, at FLASH-UHDR, the lower yield in H$_2$O$_2$ can be interpreted as a signature of bunching the particles in beams of ionizing radiation. The beams enter the medium in closely packed clusters and form inhomogeneities in the track-structure distribution. Thus the MC simulations based on the assumption of uniformly distributed tracks are unable to explain the experimental data.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear spontaneous flow instability in active nematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active nematics exhibit spontaneous flows through a well-known linear instability of the uniformly-aligned quiescent state. Here we show that even a linearly stable uniform state can experience a nonlinear instability, resulting in a discontinuous transition to spontaneous flows. In this case, quiescent and flowing states may coexist. Through a weakly nonlinear analysis and a numerical study, we trace the bifurcation diagram of striped patterns and show that the underlying pitchfork bifurcation switches from supercritical (continuous) to subcritical (discontinuous) by varying the flow-alignment parameter. We predict that the discontinuous spontaneous flow transition occurs for a wide range of parameters, including systems of contractile flow-aligning rods. Our predictions are relevant to active nematic turbulence and can potentially be tested in experiments on either cell layers or active cytoskeletal suspensions.</description>

      <title>Multi-Convergence-Angle Ptychography with Simultaneous Strong Contrast and High Resolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advances in bioimaging methods and hardware facilities have revolutionised the determination of numerous biological structures at atomic or near-atomic resolution. Among these developments, electron ptychography has recently attracted considerable attention because of its superior resolution, remarkable sensitivity to light elements, and high electron dose efficiency. Here, we introduce an innovative approach called multi-convergence-angle (MCA) ptychography, which can simultaneously enhance both contrast and resolution with continuous information transfer across a wide spectrum of spatial frequency. Our work provides feasibility of future applications of MCA-ptychography in providing high-quality two-dimensional images as input to three-dimensional reconstruction methods, thereby facilitating more accurate determination of biological structures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02169v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A simple method to compute the controllable set of chemical reaction systems with enzyme concentrations as the control parameters is presented. The method features the fact that the catalyst enhances the reaction rate while not changing the equilibrium, and it enables the efficient computation of the global controllability of linear- and nonlinear models. The method is applied to the reversible Brusselator and the toy model of cellular metabolism. With the metabolism model, we show that the stoichiometric rays is a powerful tool for quantifying the ``life-death boundary" of the cell model.</description>

      <title>Tuning upstream swimming of micro-robots by shape and cargo size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.05694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2004.05694v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The navigation of micro-robots in complex flow environments is controlled by rheotaxis, the reorientation with respect to flow gradients. Here we demonstrate how payloads can be exploited to enhance the motion against flows. Using fully resolved hydrodynamic simulations, the mechanisms are described that allow micro-robots of different shapes to reorient upstream. We find that cargo pullers are the fastest at most flow strengths, but pushers feature a non-trivial optimum as a function of the counter flow strength. Moreover, the rheotactic performance can be maximised by tuning the micro-robot shape or cargo size. These results may be used to control micro-swimmer navigation, but they also apply to rheotaxis in microbial ecology and the prevention of bacterial contamination dynamics.</description>

      <title>Density Estimation via Measure Transport: Outlook for Applications in the Biological Sciences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15366v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One among several advantages of measure transport methods is that they allow for a unified framework for processing and analysis of data distributed according to a wide class of probability measures. Within this context, we present results from computational studies aimed at assessing the potential of measure transport techniques, specifically, the use of triangular transport maps, as part of a workflow intended to support research in the biological sciences. Scenarios characterized by the availability of limited amount of sample data, which are common in domains such as radiation biology, are of particular interest. We find that when estimating a distribution density function given limited amount of sample data, adaptive transport maps are advantageous. In particular, statistics gathered from computing series of adaptive transport maps, trained on a series of randomly chosen subsets of the set of available data samples, leads to uncovering information hidden in the data. As a result, in the radiation biology application considered here, this approach provides a tool for generating hypotheses about gene relationships and their dynamics under radiation exposure.</description>

      <title>The neuron as a temporal electroacoustic medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13745v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The human brain is one of the most complex and intriguing scientific topics. The most established theory on neuronal communication is a pure electrical model based on the propagation of intracell cationic charges along the neurons. Here we propose a complementary model based on two properties of brain communication: A) The Coulomb interaction associated to the Action Potential (AP) pulse induces a deformation of the neuron membrane which travels as an acoustic signal, i.e.: The ions play an essential role and the electric and acoustic signals, composing the AP, are strongly correlated. B) As brain communication is stablished through a periodic train of AP pulses it induces a time periodic modulation of the acoustic parameters. In this framework we propose envisaging the neuron as a temporal electro-acoustic medium. The temporal varying media framework could help understanding brain conundrums such as propagation routes involved in the neuronal plasticity in the consolidation of the memory, as well as on the generation of the signals associated to the brain field theory.</description>
