      <title>Van der Waals-Driven Network Restructuring Explains Time-Dependent Piezoresistivity in Soft Nanocomposites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Carbon-elastomer composites exhibit complex piezoresistive behaviour that cannot be fully explained by existing macroscopic or microstructural models. In this work, we introduce a network-based modelling methodology to explore the hypothesis that van der Waals interactions between carbon particles contribute to the formation of a conductivity-promoting network structure prior to curing. We combine a discrete aggregate-based representation of filler with a mesh-free, quasi-static viscoelastic model adapted from bond-based peridynamics, resolving equilibrium states through energy minimization. The resulting particle networks are analysed using graph-theoretic measures of connectivity and conductivity. Our simulations reproduce several unexplained experimental phenomena, including long-timescale resistivity decay, non-monotonic secondary peaks upon strain release, and the increasing prominence of these features with higher filler density. Crucially, these behaviours emerge from the interplay between viscoelastic stresses and van der Waals interactions. We show that the resistance response of the network operates over different characteristic timescales to the viscoelastic stress response. The approach has potential for understanding and predicting emergent behaviour in composite materials more broadly, where material characteristics often depend on percolating network structure.</description>

      <title>A Robust Synthesis of Fluorosurfactants with Tunable Functions via a Two-Step Reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluorosurfactant-stabilized microdroplets hold significant promise for a wide range of applications, owing to their biological and chemical inertness. However, conventional synthetic routes for fluorosurfactants typically require multiple reaction steps and stringent conditions, such as high temperatures and anaerobic environments. This complexity poses a significant limitation to the development of fluorosurfactant synthesis and their subsequent applications in droplet-based systems. In this work, we present a robust two-step synthesis of fluorosurfactants with tunable functionalities. Microdroplets stabilized by these fluorosurfactants exhibit enhanced stability and biocompatibility. Notably, these fluorosurfactants facilitate the formation of nanodroplets that efficiently transport and concentrate fluorophores with high selectivity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that colloidal self-assemblies with tunable morphologies can be engineered by modulating interactions between the fluorosurfactants and colloidal particles. Our synthetic approach provides a strategy for the rapid production of functional fluorosurfactants under mild conditions, enabling droplet-based microfluidic techniques with applications in biology and material science.</description>

      <title>The role of confined water in the emergence of electrostatic strong coupling as revealed by nanoseparated charged lipid layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the interplay between Strong Coupling (SC) attraction and hydration repulsion in nanoconfined water between like-charged phospholipid layers. It challenges the assumption that SC attraction requires multivalent counterions by showing that hydration water can enhance electrostatic interactions. We combine reflectivities with numerical simulations to analyze supported phospholipid layers under different relative humidity and surface charge densities. X-ray fluorescence demonstrates that we can control the valence of the associated counterions. Experimental measurement of the water thickness, combined with precise determination of charged surface positions by numerical simulations, enable us to compare our experiments with a theoretical model. It shows that charge-screening by hydration water induces SC attraction, even at moderate surface charge densities with monovalent counterions. Furthermore, hydration repulsion is stronger for DPPS compared to DPPC. These findings offer insights into the forces that control interactions between phospholipid layers and have important implications for biological and colloidal systems.</description>

      <title>Mid infrared imaging of mass transport in polymer electrolyte membranes of an operating microfluidic water electrolyzer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates water transport in a polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) electrolyzer using operando infrared spectroscopic imaging. By testing different H2SO4 anolyte concentrations, it examines electrochemical performance, water diffusion, and membrane hydration. Higher anolyte concentrations increased standard deviations in current densities and led to water diffusion gradients revealed by infrared imaging and confirming localized water transport variations. The study highlights the need for improved water management and optimized electrolyzer design for stable and efficient PEM electrolysis in industrial applications.</description>

      <title>Measuring the mechanical properties of asymmetric membranes in computer simulations -- new methods and insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Monte Carlo simulations of an ultra coarse-grained lipid bilayer with different number of lipids on both leaflets. In the simulations, we employ a new method for measuring the elastic parameters of the membrane, including the area per lipid, area elasticity modulus, and bending rigidity. The method also allows to measure the spontaneous curvature and non-local bending modulus, which are not accessible by standard computer simulations with periodic boundary conditions. For membranes with lipid densities much smaller than the liquid to gel transition density, $\rho_g$, we find a very good agreement between the simulation results and the theory expressing the bilayer elastic free energy as the sum of quadratic free energies in the strains associated with the area density and the local curvature of the monolayers. The theory fails when the lipid area density (in the symmetric reference case) is only slightly smaller than $\rho_g$. Increasing the degree of asymmetry and changing the density of the condensed leaflet to a value larger than $\rho_g$, causes the layer to phase separate between regions with distinct densities which, in turn, may also induce density variations in the dilated liquid layer. Moreover, the phase separation may also trigger local curvature variations along the membrane, which can be attributed to the disparity between the values of the elastic parameters of the coexisting bilayer segments that are mechanically coupled. This mechanism leading to density-curvature variations and instabilities may play a role in cellular processes occurring in liquid-ordered raft domains that are surrounded by the disordered liquid matrix of the cell.</description>

      <title>Dislocation Glides in Monolayered Granular Media: Effect of Lattice Constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recent study demonstrated that granular crystals containing a single dislocation exhibit dislocation glide analogous to that observed in atomic-scale crystals, resulting in plastic deformation at yield stresses several orders of magnitude lower than those of dislocation-free crystals. The yielding behavior strongly depends on the interparticle friction coefficient $\mu$: dislocation glide occurs for friction coefficients below a critical value $\mu_c$, while crystalline order deteriorates above $\mu_c$. In this work, we use discrete element method simulations to systematically investigate how the lattice constant, which determines the interparticle spacing and is a fundamental parameter in microscopic crystalline solids, and the friction coefficient $\mu$ influence the yielding behavior in monolayered granular crystals with dislocation. By decreasing the lattice constant, we find an increase in the critical friction coefficient $\mu_c$, allowing dislocation glide to persist at higher friction values. Furthermore, we observe a linear scaling of yield stress with normal stress, except at extremely low friction coefficients.</description>

      <title>Preventing clustering of active particles in microchannels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The trajectories of microswimmers moving in narrow channels of widths comparable to their sizes are significantly altered when they encounter another microswimmer moving in the opposite direction. The consequence of these encounters is a delay in the progress of both swimmers, which can be conceptualized as an instantaneous effective backward displacement. Similarly, the modeling of tumble events in bacteria, which occur over a finite time, can be represented as an instantaneous effective displacement in addition to a change in direction. Such effective displacements can be incorporated directly into a kinetic theory for the partial densities of swimmers moving in the channel. The linear analysis of the resulting equation yields the critical density at which clusters emerge. The methodology is then applied to the case of soil bacteria moving in long channels of cross-section 1.8~${\mu}$m $\times$ 1.8~${\mu}$m. The tracking of the swimmers permits the straightforward acquisition of the effective displacements, which in turn allows the critical density (${\rho}_{\text{crit}}\simeq$ 0.10 bact/${\mu}$m) to be predicted prior to cluster formation. The advantage of this proposed approach is that it does not necessitate the determination of an effective density-dependent speed, which is a requisite of the standard motility-induced phase separation theory.</description>

      <title>Polymer (imperfect) single-file diffusion: A phase diagram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use Langevin dynamics (LD) simulations to investigate single-file diffusion (SFD) in a dilute solution of flexible linear polymers inside a narrow tube with periodic boundary conditions (a torus). The transition from SFD, where the time (t) dependence of the mean-square displacement scales like $\langle x^2\rangle \sim t^{1/2}$, to normal diffusion with $\langle x^2 \rangle \sim t$, is studied as a function of the system parameters, such as the size and concentration of the polymer chains and the width of the tube. We propose a phase diagram describing different diffusion regimes. In particular, we highlight the fact that there are two different pathways to normal long-time diffusion. We also map this problem onto a one-dimensional Lattice Monte Carlo model where the diffusing object represents the polymer center of mass. Possible extensions of this work to polydisperse polymer solutions, one-dimensional electrophoresis and DNA mapping are discussed.</description>

      <title>Reentrant Rigidity Transition in Planar Epithelia with Volume- and Area Elasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We recover a rigidity transition in 3D epithelial monolayers, described by cell Volume- and Area Elasticity (VAE). An in-plane isotropic strain drives a reentrant columnar-to-sqamous rigidity transition, with a critical point near the unit cell aspect ratio. In addition to the vanishing shear modulus, the phase diagram also features floppy states with zero in-plane bulk modulus and a discontinuous columnar-squamous transition, controlled by the lateral tension. Our results provide a 3D context to the rigidity transition of the well-studied 2D Area- and Perimeter-Elasticity (APE) model of epithelia, offering a resolution to a counterintuitive compression-induced tissue softening predicted by the 2D model.</description>

      <title>Characterization of phospholipid-cholesterol bilayers as self-assembled amphiphile block polymers that contain headgroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cholesterol is known to modulate the structure and function of biological membranes. In this study, we use self-consistent field theory (SCFT) to investigate phospholipid/cholesterol bilayer membranes modeled with two types of diblock copolymers. These copolymer-based bilayers serve as biomimetic platforms with applications in areas such as drug delivery. Our simulations identify a minimum free energy configuration characterized by phospholipid tails tilted relative to the membrane normal. The model quantitatively captures the well-known area condensation effect as cholesterol concentration increases, along with membrane thickening and reduced tilt angle. Thermodynamically, we observe a linear dependence between cholesterol's chemical potential and its concentration within the 37-50% range, consistent with experimental results. Additionally, we analyze the effects of block copolymer length and headgroup interactions on bilayer structure. Interactions between phospholipid headgroups and the solvent emerge as the most influential. This work provides a theoretical framework for understanding cholesterol's regulatory role in membrane structure and mechanics.</description>

      <title>Numerical Investigation on the Compressive Behavior of Hierarchical Granular Piles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hierarchical granular piles composed of aggregates are key structural features in both geoscience and planetary science, from fault gouge in seismic zones to the internal structures of comets. Although experimental studies have suggested a multi-step evolution in their packing structure, this hypothesis has lacked numerical validation. In this study, we performed large-scale numerical simulations using the discrete element method to investigate the compressive behavior of hierarchical granular piles. We successfully reproduced and confirmed a three-stage evolution process: (i) rearrangement of the aggregate packing structure, (ii) plastic deformation of small aggregates, and (iii) elastic deformation of constituent particles. Additionally, we developed a semi-analytical model for the compression curve, offering insights into the compressive stages and structural dynamics. Our findings have applications in modeling the internal density profiles of comets and in understanding the early thermal evolution of small icy bodies.</description>

      <title>Hydrogen Bond Topology Reveals Layering of LDL-like and HDL-like Water at its Liquid/Vapor Interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of high-density liquid (HDL) and low-density liquid (LDL) water has been a major success of molecular simulations, yet extending this analysis to interfacial water is challenging due to conventional order parameters assuming local homogeneity. This limitation previously prevented resolving the composition of the surface layer of the liquid/vapour interface. Here, we apply a recently introduced topological order parameter [R. Foffi and F. Sciortino, J. Phys. Chem. B 127, 378-386 (2022)] to analyze the composition of the water/vapor interface across a broad temperature range. Our results reveal that LDL-like water dominates the outermost region at all temperatures, while HDL-like water accumulates beneath it, presenting a clear layering roughly below the temperature of maximum density. This structured stratification, previously inaccessible, highlights the power of the topological order parameter in resolving interfacial molecular heterogeneity and provides new insights into the structural properties of water at interfaces.</description>

      <title>Energy Dissipation in Cyclic Strain of Amorphous Solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of the response of amorphous materials to oscillatory strain is traditionally performed with many repeated cycles. We argue that it pays to consider carefully just one cycle (and may be a second), to reveal the rich physics that characterizes cyclic strain. The response can be conservative or dissipative, with a sharp transition between these options as a function of preparation parameters, accompanied by symmetry breaking and the onset of screening. We choose an example for which the mesoscopic theory can be solved exactly, and the microscopic physics can be revealed by numerical simulations. The mechanism of energy dissipation (when it exists) is explored in detail, shedding light on the reason why repeated cycles exhibit ever decreasing dissipation per cycle, which is often consistent with a universal law.</description>

      <title>Entropy production rate in thermodynamically consistent flocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the entropy production rate (EPR) of aligning self-propelled particles which undergo a flocking transition towards a polarized collective motion. In our thermodynamically consistent lattice model, individual self-propulsion is the exclusive source of irreversibility. We derive the fluctuating hydrodynamics for large system sizes using a controlled coarse-graining: our procedure entails an exact correspondence between the EPR evaluated at the hydrodynamic and particle-based levels. We reveal that EPR is maximal when the system adopts a homogeneous configuration, either apolar or polar, and reduced in the non-homogeneous state where a polar band travels in a apolar background due to strong spatial EPR modulations. By analyzing the latter we also show that asymmetric energetic exchanges occur at the trailing and leading edges, which we map into a thermodynamic cycle in density-polarization space. Finally, we demonstrate that the regime of weak self-propulsion features a singular scaling of EPR, and a non-analyticity of the travelling band profiles.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Bayesian Optimal Experimental Design via Local Radial Basis Functions: Application to Soft Material Characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a computational approach that significantly improves the efficiency of Bayesian optimal experimental design (BOED) using local radial basis functions (RBFs). The presented RBF--BOED method uses the intrinsic ability of RBFs to handle scattered parameter points, a property that aligns naturally with the probabilistic sampling inherent in Bayesian methods. By constructing accurate deterministic surrogates from local neighborhood information, the method enables high-order approximations with reduced computational overhead. As a result, computing the expected information gain (EIG) requires evaluating only a small uniformly sampled subset of prior parameter values, greatly reducing the number of expensive forward-model simulations needed. For demonstration, we apply RBF--BOED to optimize a laser-induced cavitation (LIC) experimental setup, where forward simulations follow from inertial microcavitation rheometry (IMR) and characterize the viscoelastic properties of hydrogels. Two experimental design scenarios, single- and multi-constitutive-model problems, are explored. Results show that EIG estimates can be obtained at just 8% of the full computational cost in a five-model problem within a two-dimensional design space. This advance offers a scalable path toward optimal experimental design in soft and biological materials.</description>

      <title>Boundary geometry controls a topological defect transition that determines lumen nucleation in embryonic development</title>

Abstract: Topological defects determine the collective properties of anisotropic materials. How their configurations are controlled is not well understood however, especially in 3D. In living matter moreover, 2D defects have been linked to biological functions, but the role of 3D polar defects is unclear. Combining computational and experimental approaches, we investigate how confinement geometry controls surface-aligned polar fluids, and what biological role 3D polar defects play in tissues interacting with extracellular boundaries. We discover a charge-preserving transition between 3D defect configurations driven by boundary geometry and independent of material parameters, and show that defect positions predict the locations where fluid-filled lumina -- structures essential for development -- form within the confined polar tissue of the mouse embryo. Experimentally perturbing embryo shape beyond the transition point, we moreover create additional lumina at predicted defect locations. Our work reveals how boundary geometry controls polar defects, and how embryos use this mechanism for shape-dependent lumen formation. We expect this defect control principle to apply broadly to systems with orientational order.</description>

      <title>Active nematic pumps</title>

Abstract: Microfluidics involves the manipulation of flows at the microscale, typically requiring external power sources to generate pressure gradients. Alternatively, harnessing flows from active fluids, which are usually chaotic, has been proposed as a paradigm for the development of micro-machines. Here, by combining experimental realizations and simulations, we demonstrate that the addition of triangular-shaped inclusions into an active nematic gel can locally break the fore-aft symmetry of active turbulence and stabilize flow fields with self-pumping capabilities. The proposed strategy has enabled us to generate wall-free and self-powered microfluidic systems capable of both cargo transport and mixing along with the downstream flow. We analyze the performance of these active pumps, both isolated and within cooperative ensembles in terms of their output velocity and hydrostatic pressure buildup. Finally, we demonstrate strategies to incorporate them into specifically designed microfluidic platforms to advantageously tailor the geometry of active flows. Our results reveal new possibilities for leveraging the self-organized mechanodynamics of active fluids.</description>

      <title>Vibrational similarities in jamming-unjamming of polycrystalline and disordered granular packings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03030v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the vibrational properties of polycrystalline monodisperse and disordered bidisperse granular packings during jamming and unjamming using discrete element method simulations. Both systems deviate from Debye scaling at low frequencies $(\omega)$, but only bidisperse packings exhibit a low-$\omega$ plateau. The low $\omega$ exponent ($\alpha$) in bidisperse packings evolves smoothly from zero (plateau) to near one (Debye scaling) with increasing packing fraction, whereas in polycrystalline packings, it changes discontinuously near jamming/unjamming, due to the nature of the contact network rearrangements. Despite structural modifications during the compression-decompression cycle, the exponent remains unchanged at the same distance from jamming density, regardless of the history. Nonaffine displacements and contact orientational order further confirm that structural features that impact low-$\omega$ vibrational states and, hence, mechanical properties are largely restored upon decompression, reinforcing vibrational similarities between jamming and unjamming states.</description>

      <title>Trypanosoma brucei moving in microchannels and through constrictions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17673v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Trypanosoma brucei (T. brucei), a single-celled parasite and natural microswimmer, is responsible for fatal sleeping sickness in infected mammals, including humans. Understanding how T. brucei interacts with fluid environments and navigates through confining spaces is crucial not only for medical and clinical applications but also for a fundamental understanding of how life organizes in a confined microscopic world. Using a hybrid multi-particle collision dynamics (MPCD)--molecular dynamics (MD) approach, we present our investigations on the locomotion of an in silico T. brucei in three types of fluid environments: bulk fluid, straight cylindrical microchannels, and microchannels with constrictions. We observe that the helical swimming trajectory of the in silico T. brucei becomes rectified in straight cylindrical channels compared to bulk fluid. The swimming speed for different channel widths is governed by the diameter of the helical trajectory. The speed first slightly increases as the channel narrows and then decreases when the helix diameter is compressed. An optimal swimming speed is achieved, when the channel width is approximately twice the bulk helix diameter. It results from an interplay of the trypanosome's hydrodynamic interactions with the cylindrical channel walls and the high deformability of the parasite. In microchannels with constrictions, the motions of the anterior and posterior ends, the end-to-end distance, and the log-rolling motion of the cell body are characterized and show salient differences compared to the straight-channel case. Depending on the constriction length and width, we observe characteristic slip, stuck, and stuck-slip motions of the model T. brucei within the constriction. Our findings may provide some mechanical insights into how T. brucei moves through blood vessels and tissues, and across the blood-brain barrier.</description>

      <title>Simulations of Three-dimensional Nematic Guidance of Microswimmers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07816v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been shown that an anisotropic liquid crystalline (LC) environment can be used to guide the self-propulsion dynamics of dispersed microswimmers, such as bacteria. This type of composite system is named "living nematic" (LN). In the dilute limit, bacteria are found to mainly follow the local director field. Beyond the dilute limit, however, they exhibit novel dynamical behaviors, from swirling around a spiral +1 defect pattern to forming undulating waves, and to active turbulence. Our current knowledge of how these different behaviors emerge at different population densities remains limited. Here we develop a hybrid method to simulate the dynamics of microswimmers dispersed in a nematic LC. Specifically, we model the microswimmers using active Brownian dynamics method, which is coupled to a hydrodynamic model of nematic LCs to describe the evolution of the flow field and the LC structure. Our method is validated by comparing to existing quasi-two-dimensional (2D) experiments, including undulated swirling around a spiral pattern and stabilized undulated jets on a periodic C-pattern. We further extend our method to three-dimensional (3D) systems by examining loop-defect dynamics. We find that the morphodynamics and destiny of a loop defect not only depend on the activity (self-propulsion velocity), effective size, and the initial distribution of the swimmers, but also rely on its winding profile. Specifically, +1/2 wedge and radial twist winding can dictate the dynamics of loop defects. By varying the characteristic reversal time, we predict that microswimmers not necessarily accumulate in splay regions. Taken together, our hybrid method provides a faithful tool to explain and guide the experiments of LNs in both 2D and 3D, sheds light on the interplay between microswimmer distribution and defect dynamics, and unravels the design principles of using LCs to control active matter.</description>

      <title>Additional jamming transition in 2D bidisperse granular packings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17266v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a jamming diagram for 2D bidisperse granular systems, capturing two distinct jamming transitions. The first occurs as large particles form a jammed structure, while the second, emerging at a critical small-particle concentration, $X_{\mathrm{S}}^{*} \approx 0.21$, and size ratio, $\delta^{*} \approx 0.25$, involves small particles jamming into the voids of the existing large-particle structure upon further compression. Below this threshold, small particles fill voids within the large-particle network, increasing packing density. Beyond this point, excess small particles disrupt efficient packing, resulting in looser structures. \jp{These results, consistent with previous 3D studies, demonstrate that the second transition occurs at a well-defined point in the $(X_{\mathrm{S}}, \delta)$ plane, independent of dimensionality, likely driven by the geometric saturation of available space around particles, void closure, and structural arrangement.</description>

      <title>Microscopic description of the liquid-gas coexistence curve for Morse fluids in the immediate vicinity of the critical point</title>

Abstract: The present work is aimed at investigating the behavior of Morse fluids in the immediate vicinity of the critical point within the framework of a cell model. This region is of both fundamental and practical importance, yet presents analytical challenges due to the significant influence of order parameter fluctuations. An analytical procedure is developed to construct the upper part of the liquid-gas coexistence curve and calculate its diameter, incorporating the non-Gaussian (quartic) distribution of fluctuations. An explicit expression is derived for the temperature-dependent analytical term appearing in the expression for the rectilinear diameter. The numerical evaluation of the relevant quantities is carried out using Morse potential parameters representative of sodium. The coexistence curve is constructed both with and without the inclusion of the analytical temperature-dependent term in the calculation. A specific condition is identified under which the agreement between the presented binodal branches and Monte Carlo simulation data from other study, extrapolated to the immediate vicinity of the critical point, is improved. It is shown that better agreement is achieved when the analytical term is included in the calculation of the liquid branch and omitted in the gas branch. The proposed analytical approach may provide useful insight for the theoretical study of critical phenomena in more complex fluid systems.</description>
