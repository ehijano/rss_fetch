      <title>Towards Human-centered Proactive Conversational Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent research on proactive conversational agents (PCAs) mainly focuses on improving the system's capabilities in anticipating and planning action sequences to accomplish tasks and achieve goals before users articulate their requests. This perspectives paper highlights the importance of moving towards building human-centered PCAs that emphasize human needs and expectations, and that considers ethical and social implications of these agents, rather than solely focusing on technological capabilities. The distinction between a proactive and a reactive system lies in the proactive system's initiative-taking nature. Without thoughtful design, proactive systems risk being perceived as intrusive by human users. We address the issue by establishing a new taxonomy concerning three key dimensions of human-centered PCAs, namely Intelligence, Adaptivity, and Civility. We discuss potential research opportunities and challenges based on this new taxonomy upon the five stages of PCA system construction. This perspectives paper lays a foundation for the emerging area of conversational information retrieval research and paves the way towards advancing human-centered proactive conversational systems.</description>

      <title>Disentangling ID and Modality Effects for Session-based Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Session-based recommendation aims to predict intents of anonymous users based on their limited behaviors. Modeling user behaviors involves two distinct rationales: co-occurrence patterns reflected by item IDs, and fine-grained preferences represented by item modalities (e.g., text and images). However, existing methods typically entangle these causes, leading to their failure in achieving accurate and explainable recommendations. To this end, we propose a novel framework DIMO to disentangle the effects of ID and modality in the task. At the item level, we introduce a co-occurrence representation schema to explicitly incorporate cooccurrence patterns into ID representations. Simultaneously, DIMO aligns different modalities into a unified semantic space to represent them uniformly. At the session level, we present a multi-view self-supervised disentanglement, including proxy mechanism and counterfactual inference, to disentangle ID and modality effects without supervised signals. Leveraging these disentangled causes, DIMO provides recommendations via causal inference and further creates two templates for generating explanations. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate the consistent superiority of DIMO over existing methods. Further analysis also confirms DIMO's effectiveness in generating explanations.</description>

      <title>FineRec:Exploring Fine-grained Sequential Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sequential recommendation is dedicated to offering items of interest for users based on their history behaviors. The attribute-opinion pairs, expressed by users in their reviews for items, provide the potentials to capture user preferences and item characteristics at a fine-grained level. To this end, we propose a novel framework FineRec that explores the attribute-opinion pairs of reviews to finely handle sequential recommendation. Specifically, we utilize a large language model to extract attribute-opinion pairs from reviews. For each attribute, a unique attribute-specific user-opinion-item graph is created, where corresponding opinions serve as the edges linking heterogeneous user and item nodes. To tackle the diversity of opinions, we devise a diversity-aware convolution operation to aggregate information within the graphs, enabling attribute-specific user and item representation learning. Ultimately, we present an interaction-driven fusion mechanism to integrate attribute-specific user/item representations across all attributes for generating recommendations. Extensive experiments conducted on several realworld datasets demonstrate the superiority of our FineRec over existing state-of-the-art methods. Further analysis also verifies the effectiveness of our fine-grained manner in handling the task.</description>

      <title>Rethinking the Evaluation of Dialogue Systems: Effects of User Feedback on Crowdworkers and LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In ad-hoc retrieval, evaluation relies heavily on user actions, including implicit feedback. In a conversational setting such signals are usually unavailable due to the nature of the interactions, and, instead, the evaluation often relies on crowdsourced evaluation labels. The role of user feedback in annotators' assessment of turns in a conversational perception has been little studied. We focus on how the evaluation of task-oriented dialogue systems (TDSs), is affected by considering user feedback, explicit or implicit, as provided through the follow-up utterance of a turn being evaluated. We explore and compare two methodologies for assessing TDSs: one includes the user's follow-up utterance and one without. We use both crowdworkers and large language models (LLMs) as annotators to assess system responses across four aspects: relevance, usefulness, interestingness, and explanation quality. Our findings indicate that there is a distinct difference in ratings assigned by both annotator groups in the two setups, indicating user feedback does influence system evaluation. Workers are more susceptible to user feedback on usefulness and interestingness compared to LLMs on interestingness and relevance. User feedback leads to a more personalized assessment of usefulness by workers, aligning closely with the user's explicit feedback. Additionally, in cases of ambiguous or complex user requests, user feedback improves agreement among crowdworkers. These findings emphasize the significance of user feedback in refining system evaluations and suggest the potential for automated feedback integration in future research. We publicly release the annotated data to foster research in this area.</description>

      <title>Adapting Large Language Models by Integrating Collaborative Semantics for Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09049v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential in recommender systems, either improving existing recommendation models or serving as the backbone. However, there exists a large semantic gap between LLMs and recommender systems, since items to be recommended are often indexed by discrete identifiers (item ID) out of the LLM's vocabulary. In essence, LLMs capture language semantics while recommender systems imply collaborative semantics, making it difficult to sufficiently leverage the model capacity of LLMs for recommendation. To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose a new LLM-based recommendation model called LC-Rec, which can better integrate language and collaborative semantics for recommender systems. Our approach can directly generate items from the entire item set for recommendation, without relying on candidate items. Specifically, we make two major contributions in our approach. For item indexing, we design a learning-based vector quantization method with uniform semantic mapping, which can assign meaningful and non-conflicting IDs (called item indices) for items. For alignment tuning, we propose a series of specially designed tuning tasks to enhance the integration of collaborative semantics in LLMs. Our fine-tuning tasks enforce LLMs to deeply integrate language and collaborative semantics (characterized by the learned item indices), so as to achieve an effective adaptation to recommender systems. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, showing that our approach can outperform a number of competitive baselines including traditional recommenders and existing LLM-based recommenders.

      <title>High-Frequency-aware Hierarchical Contrastive Selective Coding for Representation Learning on Text-attributed Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16240v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate node representation learning on text-attributed graphs (TAGs), where nodes are associated with text information. Although recent studies on graph neural networks (GNNs) and pretrained language models (PLMs) have exhibited their power in encoding network and text signals, respectively, less attention has been paid to delicately coupling these two types of models on TAGs. Specifically, existing GNNs rarely model text in each node in a contextualized way; existing PLMs can hardly be applied to characterize graph structures due to their sequence architecture. To address these challenges, we propose HASH-CODE, a High-frequency Aware Spectral Hierarchical Contrastive Selective Coding method that integrates GNNs and PLMs into a unified model. Different from previous "cascaded architectures" that directly add GNN layers upon a PLM, our HASH-CODE relies on five self-supervised optimization objectives to facilitate thorough mutual enhancement between network and text signals in diverse granularities. Moreover, we show that existing contrastive objective learns the low-frequency component of the augmentation graph and propose a high-frequency component (HFC)-aware contrastive learning objective that makes the learned embeddings more distinctive. Extensive experiments on six real-world benchmarks substantiate the efficacy of our proposed approach. In addition, theoretical analysis and item embedding visualization provide insights into our model interoperability.</description>

      <title>De-DSI: Decentralised Differentiable Search Index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12237v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study introduces De-DSI, a novel framework that fuses large language models (LLMs) with genuine decentralization for information retrieval, particularly employing the differentiable search index (DSI) concept in a decentralized setting. Focused on efficiently connecting novel user queries with document identifiers without direct document access, De-DSI operates solely on query-docid pairs. To enhance scalability, an ensemble of DSI models is introduced, where the dataset is partitioned into smaller shards for individual model training. This approach not only maintains accuracy by reducing the number of data each model needs to handle but also facilitates scalability by aggregating outcomes from multiple models. This aggregation uses a beam search to identify top docids and applies a softmax function for score normalization, selecting documents with the highest scores for retrieval. The decentralized implementation demonstrates that retrieval success is comparable to centralized methods, with the added benefit of the possibility of distributing computational complexity across the network. This setup also allows for the retrieval of multimedia items through magnet links, eliminating the need for platforms or intermediaries.</description>

      <title>Interactive Question Answering Systems: Literature Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.01621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.01621v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Question answering systems are recognized as popular and frequently effective means of information seeking on the web. In such systems, information seekers can receive a concise response to their query by presenting their questions in natural language. Interactive question answering is a recently proposed and increasingly popular solution that resides at the intersection of question answering and dialogue systems. On the one hand, the user can ask questions in normal language and locate the actual response to her inquiry; on the other hand, the system can prolong the question-answering session into a dialogue if there are multiple probable replies, very few, or ambiguities in the initial request. By permitting the user to ask more questions, interactive question answering enables users to dynamically interact with the system and receive more precise results. This survey offers a detailed overview of the interactive question-answering methods that are prevalent in current literature. It begins by explaining the foundational principles of question-answering systems, hence defining new notations and taxonomies to combine all identified works inside a unified framework. The reviewed published work on interactive question-answering systems is then presented and examined in terms of its proposed methodology, evaluation approaches, and dataset/application domain. We also describe trends surrounding specific tasks and issues raised by the community, so shedding light on the future interests of scholars. Our work is further supported by a GitHub page with a synthesis of all the major topics covered in this literature study. https://sisinflab.github.io/interactive-question-answering-systems-survey/</description>

      <title>Self-supervised Learning of Rotation-invariant 3D Point Set Features using Transformer and its Self-distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.04725v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Invariance against rotations of 3D objects is an important property in analyzing 3D point set data. Conventional 3D point set DNNs having rotation invariance typically obtain accurate 3D shape features via supervised learning by using labeled 3D point sets as training samples. However, due to the rapid increase in 3D point set data and the high cost of labeling, a framework to learn rotation-invariant 3D shape features from numerous unlabeled 3D point sets is required. This paper proposes a novel self-supervised learning framework for acquiring accurate and rotation-invariant 3D point set features at object-level. Our proposed lightweight DNN architecture decomposes an input 3D point set into multiple global-scale regions, called tokens, that preserve the spatial layout of partial shapes composing the 3D object. We employ a self-attention mechanism to refine the tokens and aggregate them into an expressive rotation-invariant feature per 3D point set. Our DNN is effectively trained by using pseudo-labels generated by a self-distillation framework. To facilitate the learning of accurate features, we propose to combine multi-crop and cut-mix data augmentation techniques to diversify 3D point sets for training. Through a comprehensive evaluation, we empirically demonstrate that, (1) existing rotation-invariant DNN architectures designed for supervised learning do not necessarily learn accurate 3D shape features under a self-supervised learning scenario, and (2) our proposed algorithm learns rotation-invariant 3D point set features that are more accurate than those learned by existing algorithms.

      <title>A Fast Maximum Clique Algorithm Based on Network Decomposition for Large Sparse Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11862v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finding maximum cliques in large networks is a challenging combinatorial problem with many real-world applications. We present a fast algorithm to achieve the exact solution for the maximum clique problem in large sparse networks based on efficient graph decomposition. A bunch of effective techniques is being used to greatly prune the graph and a novel concept called Complete-Upper-Bound-Induced Subgraph (CUBIS) is proposed to ensure that the structures with the potential to form the maximum clique are retained in the process of graph decomposition. Our algorithm first pre-prunes peripheral nodes, subsequently, one or two small-scale CUBISs are constructed guided by the core number and current maximum clique size. Bron-Kerbosch search is performed on each CUBIS to find the maximum clique. Experiments on 50 empirical networks with a scale of up to 20 million show the CUBIS scales are largely independent of the original network scale. This enables an approximately linear runtime, making our algorithm amenable for large networks. Our work provides a new framework for effectively solving maximum clique problems on massive sparse graphs, which not only makes the graph scale no longer the bottleneck but also shows some light on solving other clique-related problems.</description>
