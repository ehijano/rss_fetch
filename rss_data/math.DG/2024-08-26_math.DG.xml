      <title>Singularity Types for Long-Time Chern-Ricci Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend some results known for the K\"ahler-Ricci flow to the Chern-Ricci flow regarding the independence of singularity types for long-time solutions. Specifically, we show that if a solution to the Chern-Ricci flow exists with uniformly bounded torsion and curvature, then any other solution starting from an initial metric of the same $\partial \bar{\partial}$ class will also exhibit uniform bounds on torsion and curvature.</description>

      <title>Harmonic maps of finite uniton number into inner symmetric spaces via based normalized extended frames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a loop group description of harmonic maps $\mathcal{F}: M \rightarrow G/K$ of finite uniton number, from a Riemann surface $M,$ compact or non-compact, into inner symmetric spaces of compact or non-compact type. As a main result we show that the theory of [Burstall-Guest, Math Ann, 97], largely based on Bruhat cells, can be transformed into the DPW theory which is mainly based on Birkhoff cells. Moreover, it turns out that the potentials constructed in [Burstall-Guest, Math Ann, 97], mainly see section 5, can be used to carry out the DPW procedure which uses essentially the fixed initial condition $e$ at a fixed base point $z_0$. This extends work of Uhlenbeck, Segal, and Burstall-Guest to non-compact inner symmetric spaces as target spaces (as a consequence of a "Duality Theorem"). It also permits to say that there is a 1-1-relation between finite uniton number harmonic maps and normalized potentials of a very specific and very controllable type. In particular, we prove that every harmonic map of finite uniton type from any (compact or non-compact) Riemann surface into any {compact or non-compact} inner symmetric space has a normalized potential taking values in some nilpotent Lie subalgebra, as well as a normalized frame with initial condition identity. This provides a straightforward way to construct all such harmonic maps. We also illustrate the above results exclusively by Willmore surfaces, since this problem is motivated by the study of Willmore two--spheres in spheres.</description>

      <title>Glued spaces and lower curvature bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this short note we survey theorems and provide conjectures on gluing constructions under lower curvature bounds in smooth and non-smooth context. Focusing on synthetic lower Ricci curvature bounds we consider Riemannian manifolds, weighted Riemannian manifolds, Alexandrov spaces, collapsed and non-collapsed $RCD$ spaces, and sub-Riemannian spaces.</description>

      <title>Flow lines on the moduli space of rank $2$ twisted Higgs bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the gradient flow lines for the $L^2$ norm square of the Higgs field defined on the moduli space of semistable rank $2$ Higgs bundles twisted by a line bundle of positive degree over a compact Riemann surface $X$. The main result is that these spaces of flow lines have an algebro-geometric classification in terms of secant varieties for different embeddings of $X$ into the projectivisation of the negative eigenspace of the Hessian at a critical point. The compactification of spaces of flow lines given by adding broken flow lines then has a natural interpretation via a projection to Bertram's resolution of secant varieties.</description>

      <title>A duality theorem for harmonic maps into inner symmetric spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:1903.00885v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note, we show that for any harmonic map into a non-compact symmetric space one can find naturally a "dual" harmonic map into a compact symmetric space which can be constructed from the same basic data (called "potentials" in the loop group formalism). Locally also the inverse/converse duality theorem holds.</description>

      <title>Regularized integrals and manifolds with log corners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17720v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a natural geometric framework for the study of logarithmically divergent integrals on manifolds with corners and algebraic varieties, using the techniques of logarithmic geometry. Key to the construction is a new notion of morphism in logarithmic geometry itself, introduced by Howell, which allows us to interpret the ubiquitous rule of thumb ``$\lim_{\epsilon\to 0} \log \epsilon := 0$'' as the restriction to a submanifold. Via a version of de Rham's theorem with logarithmic divergences, we obtain a functorial characterization of the classical theory of ``regularized integration'': it is the unique way to extend the ordinary integral to the logarithmically divergent context while respecting the basic laws of calculus (change of variables, Fubini's theorem, and Stokes' formula.)</description>

      <title>Geometric signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15978v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In signal processing, a signal is a function. Conceptually, replacing a function by its graph, and extending this approach to a more abstract setting, we define a signal as a submanifold M of a Riemannian manifold (with corners) that satisfies additional conditions. In particular, it is a relative cobordism between two manifolds with boundaries. We define energy as the integral of the distance function to the first of these boundary manifolds. Composition of signals is composition of cobordisms. A "time variable" can appear explicitly if it is explictly given (for example, if the manifold is of the form $\Sigma\times [0,1]$). Otherwise, there is no designated "time dimension", although the cobordism may implicitly indicate the presence of dynamics. We interpret a local deformation of the metric as noise. The assumptions on M allow to define a map $M\to M$ that we call a Fourier transform. We prove inequalities that illustrate the properties of energy of signals in this setting.</description>

      <title>Minimal surfaces and alternating multiple zetas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07130v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we show for every sufficiently large integer $g$ the existence of a complete family of closed and embedded constant mean curvature (CMC) surfaces deforming the Lawson surfaces $\xi_{1,g}$ parametrized by their conformal type. When specializing to the minimal case, we discover a pattern resulting in the coefficients of the involved expansions being alternating multiple zeta values (MZVs), which generalizes the notion of Riemann's zeta values to multiple integer variables. This allows us to extend a new existence proof of the Lawson surfaces $\xi_{1,g}$ to all $g\geq 3$ using complex analytic methods and to give closed form expressions of their area expansion up to order $7$. For example, the third order coefficient is $\tfrac{9}{4}\zeta(3)$ (the first and second order term were shown to be $\log(2)$ and $0$ respectively in \cite{HHT}). As a corollary, we obtain that the area of $\xi_{1,g}$ is monotonically increasing in their genus $g$ for all $g\geq 0.$</description>

Abstract: In this paper we analyze the shape of a droplet inside a smooth container. To characterize their shape in the capillarity regime, we obtain a new form of the Heintze-Karcher inequality for mean convex hypersurfaces with boundary lying on curved substrates.</description>
