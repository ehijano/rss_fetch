      <title>Stochastic Quantum Dynamics Stabilization: A Lyapunov-Based Control Approach with Homodyne-Mediated Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient control of stochastic dynamics in quantum systems is pivotal for various applications, including quantum information processing and metrology. This paper introduces a Lyapunov-based control approach with homodyne-mediated filtering. We employ a modified extended Kalman filtering method to directly estimate the evolution of the quantum density operator $\rho$, considering sequential homodyne current measurements. Our method explicitly addresses the dynamics of a stochastic master equation with correlated noise, ensuring by construction the quantum properties of the estimated state variable $\hat\rho$. Moreover, our proposed switching based Lyapunov control scheme that is fed with $\hat\rho$, guarantees noise-to-state practically stable in probability of the desired quantum stationary target set with respect to the estimation error variance. We demonstrate our approach's efficacy in stabilizing a qubit coupled to a leaky cavity under homodyne detection.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Quantum Variational Algorithms with Zero Noise Extrapolation via Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the emergent realm of quantum computing, the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) stands out as a promising algorithm for solving complex quantum problems, especially in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era. However, the ubiquitous presence of noise in quantum devices often limits the accuracy and reliability of VQE outcomes. This research introduces a novel approach to ameliorate this challenge by utilizing neural networks for zero noise extrapolation (ZNE) in VQE computations. By employing the Qiskit framework, we crafted parameterized quantum circuits using the RY-RZ ansatz and examined their behavior under varying levels of depolarizing noise. Our investigations spanned from determining the expectation values of a Hamiltonian, defined as a tensor product of Z operators, under different noise intensities to extracting the ground state energy. To bridge the observed outcomes under noise with the ideal noise-free scenario, we trained a Feed Forward Neural Network on the error probabilities and their associated expectation values. Remarkably, our model proficiently predicted the VQE outcome under hypothetical noise-free conditions. By juxtaposing the simulation results with real quantum device executions, we unveiled the discrepancies induced by noise and showcased the efficacy of our neural network-based ZNE technique in rectifying them. This integrative approach not only paves the way for enhanced accuracy in VQE computations on NISQ devices but also underlines the immense potential of hybrid quantum-classical paradigms in circumventing the challenges posed by quantum noise. Through this research, we envision a future where quantum algorithms can be reliably executed on noisy devices, bringing us one step closer to realizing the full potential of quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Better than classical? The subtle art of benchmarking quantum machine learning models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Benchmarking models via classical simulations is one of the main ways to judge ideas in quantum machine learning before noise-free hardware is available. However, the huge impact of the experimental design on the results, the small scales within reach today, as well as narratives influenced by the commercialisation of quantum technologies make it difficult to gain robust insights. To facilitate better decision-making we develop an open-source package based on the PennyLane software framework and use it to conduct a large-scale study that systematically tests 12 popular quantum machine learning models on 6 binary classification tasks used to create 160 individual datasets. We find that overall, out-of-the-box classical machine learning models outperform the quantum classifiers. Moreover, removing entanglement from a quantum model often results in as good or better performance, suggesting that "quantumness" may not be the crucial ingredient for the small learning tasks considered here. Our benchmarks also unlock investigations beyond simplistic leaderboard comparisons, and we identify five important questions for quantum model design that follow from our results.</description>

      <title>Simulating Meson Scattering on Spin Quantum Simulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studying high-energy collisions of composite particles, such as hadrons and nuclei, is an outstanding goal for quantum simulators. However, preparation of hadronic wave packets has posed a significant challenge, due to the complexity of hadrons and the precise structure of wave packets. This has limited demonstrations of hadron scattering on quantum simulators to date. Observations of confinement and composite excitations in quantum spin systems have opened up the possibility to explore scattering dynamics in spin models. In this article, we develop two methods to create entangled spin states corresponding to wave packets of composite particles in analog quantum simulators of Ising spin Hamiltonians. One wave-packet preparation method uses the blockade effect enabled by beyond-nearest-neighbor Ising spin interactions. The other method utilizes a quantum-bus-mediated exchange, such as the native spin-phonon coupling in trapped-ion arrays. With a focus on trapped-ion simulators, we numerically benchmark both methods and show that high-fidelity wave packets can be achieved in near-term experiments. We numerically study scattering of wave packets for experimentally realizable parameters in the Ising model and find inelastic-scattering regimes, corresponding to particle production in the scattering event, with prominent and distinct experimental signals. Our proposal, therefore, demonstrates the potential of observing inelastic scattering in near-term quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Multiset tomography: Optimizing quantum measurements by partitioning multisets of observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum tomography approaches typically consider a set of observables which we wish to measure, design a measurement scheme which measures each of the observables and then repeats the measurements as many times as necessary. We show that instead of considering only the simple set of observables, one should consider a multiset of the observables taking into account the required repetitions, to minimize the number of measurements. This leads to a graph theoretic multicolouring problem. We show that multiset tomography offers at most quadratic improvement but it is achievable. Furthermore, despite the NP-hard optimal colouring problem, the multiset approach with greedy colouring algorithms already offers asymptotically quadratic improvement in test cases.</description>

      <title>Equivariant Variational Quantum Eigensolver to detect Phase Transitions through Energy Level Crossings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Level spectroscopy stands as a powerful method for identifying the transition point that delineates distinct quantum phases. Since each quantum phase exhibits a characteristic sequence of excited states, the crossing of energy levels between low-lying excited states offers a reliable mean to estimate the phase transition point. While approaches like the Variational Quantum Eigensolver are useful for approximating ground states of interacting systems using quantum computing, capturing low-energy excitations remains challenging. In our study, we introduce an equivariant quantum circuit that preserves the total spin and the translational symmetry to accurately describe singlet and triplet excited states in the $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg model on a chain, which are crucial for characterizing its transition point. Additionally, we assess the impact of noise on the variational state, showing that conventional mitigation techniques like Zero Noise Extrapolation reliably restore its physical properties.</description>

      <title>Dimension matters: precision and incompatibility in multi-parameter quantum estimation models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the role of probe dimension in determining the bounds of precision and the level of incompatibility in multi-parameter quantum estimation problems. In particular, we focus on the paradigmatic case of unitary encoding generated by $\mathfrak{su}(2)$ and compare precision and incompatibility in the estimation of the same parameters across representations of different dimensions. For two- and three-parameter unitary models, we prove that if the dimension of the probe is smaller than the number of parameters, then simultaneous estimation is not possible (the quantum Fisher matrix is singular). If the dimension is equal to the number of parameters, estimation is possible but the model exhibits maximal (asymptotic) incompatibility. However, for larger dimensions, there is always a state for which the incompatibility vanishes, and the symmetric Cram\'er-Rao bound is achievable. We also critically examine the performance of the so-called asymptotic incompatibility (AI) in characterizing the difference between the Holevo-Cram\'er-Rao bound and the Symmetric Logarithmic Derivative (SLD) one, showing that the AI measure alone may fail to adequately quantify this gap. Assessing the determinant of the Quantum Fisher Information Matrix (QFIM) is crucial for a precise characterization of the model's nature. Nonetheless, the AI measure still plays a relevant role since it encapsulates the non-classicality of the model in one scalar quantity rather than in a matrix form (i.e., the Uhlmann curvature).</description>

      <title>Multimode-cavity picture of non-Markovian waveguide QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a picture to describe and intrepret waveguide-QED problems in the non-Markovian regime of long photonic retardation times resulting in delayed coherent feedback. The framework is based on an intuitive spatial decomposition of the waveguide into blocks. Among these, the block directly coupled to the atoms embodies an effective lossy multimode cavity leaking into the rest of the waveguide, in turn embodying an effective white-noise bath. The dynamics can be approximated by retaining only a finite number of cavity modes that yet eventually grows with the time delay. This description captures the atomic as well as the field's dynamics, even with many excitations, in both emission and scattering processes. As an application, we show that the recently identified non-Markovian steady states can be understood by retaining very few or even only one cavity modes.</description>

      <title>Two novel pure-state coherence measures in quantifying coherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the resource theory of coherence, the quantification of quantum-state coherence is an important task. In this regard, the key ingredients are the various coherence monotones (or measures). There are few coherence-monotone classes that solely depend on other coherence measures defined for all the pure states; in other words, they rely on the pure state coherence measures (PSCM). Here, we set forth two such novel PSCMs, and validate each of them through the fulfillment of all four necessary conditions. In addition, we delve into the most recent (as per our knowledge) coherence-monotone class based on the innovative idea of quantifying coherence in terms of pure-state coherence, further redefine it, and, through the study of convexity under mixing, justify why this coherence monotone class cannot be treated as a coherence-measure class in general.</description>

      <title>Phononic bright and dark states: Investigating multi-mode light-matter interactions with a single trapped ion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interference underpins some of the most practical and impactful properties of both the classical and quantum worlds. In this work we experimentally investigate a new formalism to describe interference effects, based on collective states which have enhanced or suppressed coupling to a two-level system. We employ a single trapped ion, whose electronic state is coupled to two of the ion's motional modes in order to simulate a multi-mode light-matter interaction. We observe the emergence of phononic bright and dark states for both a single phonon and a superposition of coherent states and demonstrate that a view of interference which is based solely on their decomposition in the collective basis is able to intuitively describe their coupling to a single atom. This work also marks the first time that multi-mode bright and dark states have been formed with the bounded motion of a single trapped ion and we highlight the potential of the methods discussed here for use in quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Simulating Quantum Circuits by Model Counting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum circuit compilation comprises many computationally hard reasoning tasks that nonetheless lie inside #$\mathbf{P}$ and its decision counterpart in $\mathbf{PP}$. The classical simulation of general quantum circuits is a core example. We show for the first time that a strong simulation of universal quantum circuits can be efficiently tackled through weighted model counting by providing a linear encoding of Clifford+T circuits. To achieve this, we exploit the stabilizer formalism by Knill, Gottesmann, and Aaronson and the fact that stabilizer states form a basis for density operators. With an open-source simulator implementation, we demonstrate empirically that model counting often outperforms state-of-the-art simulation techniques based on the ZX calculus and decision diagrams. Our work paves the way to apply the existing array of powerful classical reasoning tools to realize efficient quantum circuit compilation; one of the obstacles on the road towards quantum supremacy.</description>

      <title>Exploring Multiscale Quantum Media: High-Precision Efficient Numerical Solution of the Fractional Schr\"odinger equation, Eigenfunctions with Physical Potentials, and Fractionally-Enhanced Quantum Tunneling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fractional evolution equations lack generally accessible and well-converged codes excepting anomalous diffusion. A particular equation of strong interest to the growing intersection of applied mathematics and quantum information science and technology is the fractional Schr\"odinger equation, which describes sub-and super-dispersive behavior of quantum wavefunctions induced by multiscale media. We derive a computationally efficient sixth-order split-step numerical method to converge the eigenfunctions of the FSE to arbitrary numerical precision for arbitrary fractional order derivative. We demonstrate applications of this code to machine precision for classic quantum problems such as the finite well and harmonic oscillator, which take surprising twists due to the non-local nature of the fractional derivative. For example, the evanescent wave tails in the finite well take a Mittag-Leffer-like form which decay much slower than the well-known exponential from integer-order derivative wave theories, enhancing penetration into the barrier and therefore quantum tunneling rates. We call this effect \emph{fractionally enhanced quantum tunneling}. This work includes an open source code for communities from quantum experimentalists to applied mathematicians to easily and efficiently explore the solutions of the fractional Schr\"odinger equation in a wide variety of practical potentials for potential realization in quantum tunneling enhancement and other quantum applications.</description>

      <title>Designing high-fidelity two-qubit gates between fluxonium qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We take a bottom-up, first-principles approach to design a two-qubit gate between fluxonium qubits for minimal error, speed, and control simplicity. Our proposed architecture consists of two fluxoniums coupled via a linear resonator. Using a linear coupler introduces the possibility of material optimization for suppressing its loss, enables efficient driving of state-selective transitions through its large charge zero point fluctuation, reduces sensitivity to junction aging, and partially mitigates coherent coupling to two-level systems. Crucially, a resonator-as-coupler approach also suggests a clear path to increased connectivity between fluxonium qubits, by reducing capacitive loading when the coupler has a high impedance. After performing analytic and numeric analyses of the circuit Hamiltonian and gate dynamics, we tune circuit parameters to destructively interfere sources of coherent error, revealing an efficient, fourth-order scaling of coherent error with gate duration. For component properties from the literature, we predict an open-system average CZ gate infidelity of $1.86 \times 10^{-4}$ in 70ns.</description>

      <title>An Effective Way to Determine the Separability of Quantum State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose in this work a practical approach, by virtue of correlation matrices of the generic observables, to study the long lasting tough issue of quantum separability. Some general separability conditions are set up through constructing a measurement-induced Bloch space. In essence, these conditions are established due to the self constraint in the space of quantum states. The new approach can not only reproduce many of the prevailing entanglement criteria, but also lead to even stronger results and manifest superiority for some bound entangled states. Moreover, as a by product, the new criteria are found directly transformable to the entanglement witness operators.</description>

      <title>Real-time observation of picosecond-timescale optical quantum entanglement toward ultrafast quantum information processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement is a fundamental resource of various optical quantum-information-processing (QIP) applications. Towards high-speed QIP system, entanglement should be encoded in short wavepackets. We report real-time observation of ultrafast optical Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) correlation at a picosecond timescale in a continuous-wave (CW) system. Optical phase-sensitive amplification using 6-THz-bandwidth waveguide-optical-parametric amplifier enhances the effective efficiency of 70-GHz-bandwidth homodyne detectors, mainly used in 5th-generation telecommunication, enabling its use in real-time quantum-state measurement. While power measurement using frequency scanning, i.e., optical spectrum analyzer, is not performed in real-time, our observation is demonstrated through real-time amplitude measurement and can be directly employed in QIP applications. Observed EPR states show quantum correlation of 4.5 dB below shotnoise level encoded in wavepackets with 40-ps period, equivalent to 25-GHz repetition -- ${10^3}$ times faster than previous entanglement observation in CW system. The quantum correlation of 4.5 dB is already sufficient for several QIP applications, and our system can be readily extended to large-scale entanglement. Moreover, our scheme has high compatibility with optical communication technology such as wavelength-division multiplexing, and femtosecond-timescale observation is also feasible. Our demonstration is paradigm shift in accelerating accessible quantum correlation, the foundational resource of all quantum applications, from the nanosecond to picosecond timescale, enabling ultra-fast optical QIP.</description>

      <title>Cabello's nonlocality argument for multisetting high-dimensional systems and its experimental test</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements have expanded Hardy's nonlocality arguments into multisetting and multidimensional systems to enhance quantum correlations. In comparison with Hardy's nonlocal argument, Cabello's nonlocal argument (CNA) emerges as a superior choice for illustrating nonlocal features. An open question persists regarding the potential extension of CNA to arbitrary (k, d) scenarios. Here, we answer this question both in theory and experiment. Theoretically, by utilizing compatibility graphs, we construct a new logical framework for multisetting and multidimensional CNA, demonstrating an increase in the maximum successful probability with setting k and dimension d. Experimentally, by employing controllable photonic orbital angular momentum entanglement, we exhibit nonlocality with an experimentally recorded probability of 20.29% in the (2, 4) scenario and 28.72% in the (6, 2) scenario. Our work showcases a sharper contradiction between quantum mechanics and classical theory, surpassing the bound limited by the original version.</description>

      <title>Compressed-sensing Lindbladian quantum tomography with trapped ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characterizing the dynamics of quantum systems is a central task for the development of quantum information processors (QIPs). It serves to benchmark different devices, learn about their specific noise, and plan the next hardware upgrades. However, this task is also very challenging, for it requires a large number of measurements and time-consuming classical processing. Moreover, when interested in the time dependence of the noise, there is an additional overhead since the characterization must be performed repeatedly within the time interval of interest. To overcome this limitation while, at the same time, ordering the learned sources of noise by their relevance, we focus on the inference of the dynamical generators of the noisy dynamics using Lindbladian quantum tomography (LQT). We propose two different improvements of LQT that alleviate previous shortcomings. In the weak-noise regime of current QIPs, we manage to linearize the maximum likelihood estimation of LQT, turning the constrained optimization into a convex problem to reduce the classical computation cost and to improve its robustness. Moreover, by introducing compressed sensing techniques, we reduce the number of required measurements without sacrificing accuracy. To illustrate these improvements, we apply our LQT tools to trapped-ion experiments of single- and two-qubit gates, advancing in this way the previous state of the art.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a quantum oscillator interacting and back-reacting on a classical oscillator. This can be done consistently provided the quantum system decoheres, while the backreaction has a stochastic component which causes the classical system to undergo diffusion. Nonetheless the state of the quantum oscillator can remain pure conditioned on the trajectory of the classical oscillator. We solve the system using the classical-quantum path integral formulation, and investigate slow moving regimes of either the classical or quantum oscillator. Lastly, we study the correlators of this classicalquantum setup. We are able to identify the free correlators of the theory and compute the full partition function perturbatively up to second order. This serves as a toy model for a number of other systems in which one system can be treated as effectively classical, such as a scalar quantum field interacting with another field undergoing decoherence, or a system emitting radiation, one of which is treated classically.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gauging involves introducing new degrees of freedom, known as gauge fields, to localize an existing global symmetry. It is known that, following this process, the gauge fields exhibit a dual global symmetry. Subsequently, one can gauge this emergent global symmetry by creating new gauge fields that once again exhibit a global symmetry. We investigate this iterative process, wherein new degrees of freedom are created and entangled with the previous ones through local symmetries. We focus on gauging spin chains with Abelian group symmetries and arranging the new spins on a 2D lattice. The local symmetries of the emergent 2D state, which are modified by the concatenation of the following gauging maps surprisingly correspond to the stabilizer terms of the $XZZX$-code generalized to any Abelian group. We encode our construction in the family of tensor network states that we dub ``projected entangled pair emergent states'' (PEPES). By utilizing this representation and by considering the local symmetries as stabilizer Hamiltonian terms, we establish a connection between the condensable anyons at the boundary and the quantum phase of the initial symmetric state before the gauging process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Suppose Alice has access to $n$ remote quantum computing nodes capable of universal quantum computation, connected to her by a quantum channel. She wants to use these remote nodes jointly to make computations and store her quantum states such that the actual computation is hidden from these remote nodes. We describe a protocol to help Alice carry out her computation using these remote nodes and store her computation results. We also make sure these nodes can handle noise themselves in case of any error on these nodes. More precisely, we develop an architecture for distributed quantum computation and storage, addressing key challenges in quantum processing across remote nodes. Additionally, we enhance the robustness of each node against noise by developing quantum error-correcting methods suitable for each node.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce protocols to prepare many-body quantum states with quantum circuits assisted by local operations and classical communication. First, we show that by lifting the requirement of exact preparation, one can substantially save resources. In particular, the so-called $W$ and, more generally, Dicke states require a circuit depth and number of ancillas that are independent of the system size. We also show how one can save resources in the preparation of eigenstates of well-known spin models, both free and interacting. As a biproduct of our work, we introduce an efficient scheme to implement certain non-local, non-Clifford unitary operators.</description>

      <title>Broadcasting Quantum Information using Finite Resources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measurements can be viewed as interactions between systems and specifically prepared pointers. Ideally, these interactions create accurate copies of the information corresponding to the diagonal of the system's density operator with respect to the measurement basis. However, establishing measurement outcomes as objective facts requires redundancy. We therefore consider the problem of unitarily distributing this information to several quantum memories. We show that the accuracy of this broadcasting process is limited by thermodynamic restrictions on preparing the memories in pure states: ideal broadcasting is impossible using finite resources. For finite-temperature memories we put forward a lower bound on the entropy production of the broadcasting process. This Holevo-Landauer bound demonstrates that the mixedness of the initial memory limits the ability to accurately broadcast information to more than one memory component, thus fundamentally restricting the creation of redundancies while maintaining the integrity of the original information. Finally, we show how the full information can be recovered in the classical limit -- via coarse-graining or asymptotically as the number of subsystems of each memory component increases -- thus elucidating how objective properties can emerge despite inherent imperfections.</description>

      <title>Three statistical descriptions of classical systems and their extensions to hybrid quantum-classical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present three statistical descriptions for systems of classical particles and consider their extension to hybrid quantum-classical systems. The classical descriptions are ensembles on configuration space, ensembles on phase space, and a Hilbert space approach using van Hove operators which provides an alternative to the Koopman-von Neumann formulation. In all cases, there is a natural way to define classical observables and a corresponding Lie algebra that is isomorphic to the usual Poisson algebra in phase space. We show that in the case of classical particles, the three descriptions are equivalent and indicate how they are related. We then modify and extend these descriptions to introduce hybrid models where a classical particle interacts with a quantum particle. The approach of ensembles on phase space and the Hilbert space approach, which are novel, lead to equivalent hybrid models, while they are not equivalent to the hybrid model of the approach of ensembles on configuration space. Thus, we end up identifying two inequivalent types of hybrid systems, making different predictions, especially when it comes to entanglement. These results are of interest regarding ``no-go'' theorems about quantum systems interacting via a classical mediator which address the issue of whether gravity must be quantized. Such theorems typically require assumptions that make them model dependent. The hybrid systems that we discuss provide concrete examples of inequivalent models that can be used to compute simple examples to test the assumptions of the ``no-go'' theorems and their applicability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dissipation engineering offers a powerful tool for quantum technologies. Recently, new superconducting devices demonstrated an engineered two-photon dissipation rate exceeding all other relevant timescales. In particular, they have proven most useful to prevent transitions between the logical states $|\pm\alpha\rangle$ of a cat qubit. Here, we present three key applications of strong two-photon dissipation for quantum measurement and control, beyond cat qubit stabilization. Firstly, we demonstrate its efficacy in overcoming limitations encountered in Wigner tomography at high photon numbers. Secondly, we showcase its potential for realizing universal gates on cat qubits, exploiting the coherent mapping between cat qubit states and superpositions of 0 and 1 photons. Finally, we harness the transient dynamics of a cat state under two-photon dissipation to prepare squeezed cat states with a squeezing factor exceeding 3.8 dB.</description>

      <title>Syncopated Dynamical Decoupling for Suppressing Crosstalk in Quantum Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Theoretically understanding and experimentally characterizing and modifying the underlying Hamiltonian of a quantum system is of utmost importance in achieving high-fidelity quantum gates for quantum computing. In this work, we explore the use of dynamical decoupling (DD) in characterizing undesired two-qubit couplings as well as the underlying single-qubit decoherence, and in suppressing them. We develop a syncopated dynamical decoupling technique which protects against decoherence and selectively targets unwanted two-qubit interactions, overcoming both significant hurdles to achieving precise quantum control and realizing quantum computing on many hardware prototypes. On a transmon-qubit-based superconducting quantum device, we identify separate white and $1/f$ noise components underlying the single-qubit decoherence and a static ZZ coupling between pairs of qubits. We suppress these errors using syncopated dynamical decoupling in two-qubit benchmarking experiments and significantly boost performance in a realistic algorithmic quantum circuit.</description>

Abstract: Quantum emitters, such as the negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond, are attractive for quantum technologies such as nano-sensing, quantum information processing, and as a non-classical light source. However, it is still challenging to position individual emitters in photonic structures whilst preserving the spin coherence properties of the defect. In this paper, we investigate single and ensemble waveguide-integrated nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond fabricated by femtosecond laser writing followed by thermal annealing. Their spin coherence properties are systematically investigated and are shown to be comparable to native nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond. This method paves the way for the fabrication of coherent spins integrated within photonic devices.</description>

      <title>Dissipation-induced first-order decoherence phase transition in a non-interacting fermionic system</title>

      <description>arXiv:1409.1625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a dissipative tight-binding chain. The dissipation manifests as tunneling into/out of the chain from/to a memoryless environment. The evolution of the system is described by the Lindblad equation. Already infinitesimally small dissipation along the chain induces a quantum phase transition (QPT). This is a decoherence QPT: the reduced density matrix of a subsystem (far from the ends of the chain) can be represented as the tensor product of single-site density matrices. We analyze the QPT in the thermodynamic limit by looking at the entropy and the response function in the bulk. We also explore the properties of the boundaries of the chain close to the transition point and observe that the boundaries behave as if they undergo a second-order phase transition with power-law divergence of the correlation functions and response function. Disorder is known to localize one-dimensional systems, but the coupling to the memoryless environment pushes the system back into the delocalized state even in the presence of disorder.</description>

      <title>Quantum criticality in photorefractive optics: vortices in laser beams and antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.03451</link>
      <description>arXiv:1701.03451v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study vortex patterns in a prototype nonlinear optical system: counterpropagating laser beams in a photorefractive crystal, with or without the background photonic lattice. The vortices are effectively planar and described by the winding number and the "flavor" index, stemming from the fact that we have two parallel beams propagating in opposite directions. The problem is amenable to the methods of statistical field theory and generalizes the Berezinsky-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition of the XY model to the "two-flavor" case. In addition to the familiar conductor and insulator phases, we also have the perfect conductor (vortex proliferation in both beams/"flavors") and the frustrated insulator (energy costs of vortex proliferation and vortex annihilation balance each other). In the presence of disorder in the background lattice, a novel phase appears which shows long-range correlations and absence of long-range order, thus being analogous to spin glasses. An important benefit of this approach is that qualitative behavior of patterns can be known without intensive numerical work over large areas of the parameter space. More generally, we would like to draw attention to connections between the (classical) pattern-forming systems in photorefractive optics and the methods of (quantum) condensed matter and field theory: on one hand, we use the field-theoretical methods (renormalization group, replica formalism) to analyze the patterns; on the other hand, the observed phases are analogous to those seen in magnetic systems, and make photorefractive optics a fruitful testing ground for condensed matter systems. As an example, we map our system to a doped $O(3)$ antiferromagnet with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ defects, which has the same structure of the phase diagram.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous isotropy breaking for vortices in nonlinear left-handed metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.08805</link>
      <description>arXiv:1812.08805v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore numerically and analytically the pattern formation and symmetry breaking of beams propagating through left-handed (negative) nonlinear metamaterials. When the input beam is a vortex with topological charge (winding number) $Q$, the initially circular (isotropic) beam acquires the symmetry of a polygon with $Q$, $2Q$ or $3Q$ sides, depending on the details of the response functions of the material. Within an effective field-theory model, this phenomenon turns out to be a case of spontaneous dynamical symmetry breaking described by a Landau-Ginzburg functional. Complex nonlinear dependence of the magnetic permittivity on the magnetic field of the beam plays a central role, as it introduces branch cuts in the mean-field solution, and permutations among different branches give rise to discrete symmetries of the patterns. By considering loop corrections in the effective Landau-Ginzburg field theory we obtain reasonably accurate predictions of the numerical results.</description>

      <title>Gravitational back-reaction is the Holographic Dual of Magic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study interplay between magic and entanglement in quantum many-body systems. We show that non-local magic which is supported by the quantum correlations is lower bounded by the flatness of entanglement spectrum and upper bounded by the amount of entanglement in the system. We then argue that a smoothed version of non-local magic bounds the hardness of classical simulations for incompressible states. In conformal field theories, we conjecture that the non-local magic should scale linearly with entanglement entropy but sublinearly when an approximation of the state is allowed. We support the conjectures using both analytical arguments based on unitary distillation and numerical data from an Ising CFT. If the CFT has a holographic dual, then we prove that the non-local magic vanishes if and only if there is no gravitational back-reaction. Furthermore, we show that non-local magic approximately equals the rate of change of minimal surface area in response to the change of the tension of cosmic branes in the bulk.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum Hall effect under the influence of gravity and inertia is studied in a unified way. We make use of an algebraic approach, as opposed to an analytic approach. We examine how both the integer and the fractional quantum Hall effects behave under a combined influence of gravity and inertia using a unified Hamiltonian. For that purpose, we first re-derive, using the purely algebraic method, the energy spectrum of charged particles moving in a plane perpendicular to a constant and uniform magnetic field either (i) under the influence of a nonlinear gravitational potential or (ii) under the influence of a constant rotation. The general Hamiltonian for describing the combined effect of gravity, rotation and inertia on the electrons of a Hall sample is then built and the eigenstates are obtained. The electrons mutual Coulomb interaction that gives rise to the familiar fractional quantum Hall effect is also discussed within a such a combination.</description>

      <title>Is the effective potential, effective for dynamics?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We critically examine the applicability of the effective potential within dynamical situations and find, in short, that the answer is negative. An important caveat of the use of an effective potential in dynamical equations of motion is an explicit violation of energy conservation.
  An \emph{adiabatic} effective potential is introduced in a consistent quasi-static approximation, and its narrow regime of validity is discussed. Two ubiquitous instances in which even the adiabatic effective potential is not valid in dynamics are studied in detail: parametric amplification in the case of oscillating mean fields, and spinodal instabilities associated with spontaneous symmetry breaking. In both cases profuse particle production is directly linked to the failure of the effective potential to describe the dynamics. We introduce a consistent, renormalized, energy conserving dynamical framework that is amenable to numerical implementation. Energy conservation leads to the emergence of asymptotic highly excited, entangled stationary states from the dynamical evolution. As a corollary, decoherence via dephasing of the density matrix in the adiabatic basis is argued to lead to an emergent entropy, formally equivalent to the entanglement entropy. The results suggest novel characterization of asymptotic equilibrium states in terms of order parameter vs. energy density.</description>

      <title>Many-Body Localization in the Age of Classical Computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Statistical mechanics provides a framework for describing the physics of large, complex many-body systems using only a few macroscopic parameters to determine the state of the system. For isolated quantum many-body systems, such a description is achieved via the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), which links thermalization, ergodicity and quantum chaotic behavior. However, tendency towards thermalization is not observed at finite system sizes and evolution times in a robust many-body localization (MBL) regime found numerically and experimentally in the dynamics of interacting many-body systems at strong disorder. Although the phenomenology of the MBL regime is well-established, the central question remains unanswered: under what conditions does the MBL regime give rise to an MBL phase in which the thermalization does not occur even in the asymptotic limit of infinite system size and evolution time?
  This review focuses on recent numerical investigations aiming to clarify the status of the MBL phase, and it establishes the critical open questions about the dynamics of disordered many-body systems. Persistent finite size drifts towards ergodicity consistently emerge in spectral properties of disordered many-body systems, excluding naive single-parameter scaling hypothesis and preventing comprehension of the status of the MBL phase. The drifts are related to tendencies towards thermalization and non-vanishing transport observed in the dynamics of many-body systems, even at strong disorder. These phenomena impede understanding of microscopic processes at the ETH-MBL crossover. Nevertheless, the abrupt slowdown of dynamics with increasing disorder strength suggests the proximity of the MBL phase. This review concludes that the questions about thermalization and its failure in disordered many-body systems remain a captivating area open for further explorations.</description>

      <title>Operator size growth in Lindbladian SYK</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the growth of operator size in the Lindbladian SYK model with $q$-body interaction terms and linear jump terms at finite dissipation strength. We compute the operator size as well as its distribution numerically at finite $q$ and analytically at large $q$. With dissipative (productive) jump terms, the size converges to a value smaller (larger) than half the number of Majorana fermions. At weak dissipation, the evolution of operator size displays a quadratic-exponential-plateau behavior. The plateau value is determined by the ratios between the coupling of the interaction and the linear jump term in the large $q$ limit. The operator size distribution remains localized in the finite size region even at late times, contrasting with the unitary case. Moreover, we also derived the time-independent orthogonal basis for operator expansion which exhibits the ``operator size concentration'' at finite dissipation. Finally, we observe that the uncertainty relation for operator size growth is saturated at large $q$, leading to a classical dynamics of the operator size growth with dissipation.</description>

This sheds new light on the admissible path-wise description of the relaxation to equilibrium for conditioned Brownian motions, and diffusion processes with absorbing boundaries, where Feynman-Kac kernels appear as the building blocks of inferred transition probability density functions.</description>

      <title>Spin-orbit coupling in symmetric and mixed spin-symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synthetically spin-orbit coupling in cold atoms couples the pseudo-spin and spatial degrees of freedom, and therefore the inherent spin symmetry of the system plays an important role. In systems of two pseudo-spin degrees, two particles configure symmetric states and anti-symmetric states, but the spin symmetry can be mixed for more particles. We study the role of mixed spin symmetry in the presence of spin-orbit coupling and consider the system of three bosons with two hyper-fine states trapped in a harmonic potential. We investigate the ground state and the energy spectrum by implementing exact diagonalization. It is found that the interplay between spin-orbit coupling and repulsive interactions between anti-aligned pseudo-spins increases the population of the unaligned spin components in the ground state. The emergence of the mixed spin symmetric states compensates for the rise of the interaction energy. With the aligned interaction on, the avoided crossing between the ground state and the first excited state is observed only for small interaction, and this causes shape changes in the spin populations. Furthermore, we find that the pair correlation of the ground state shows similarly to that of Tonks-Girardeau gas even for relatively small contact interactions and such strong interaction feature is enhanced by the spin-orbit coupling.</description>

      <title>Anomalous magnetic flux via junction twist-angle in a triplet-superconducting transmon qubit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconducting transmon qubits with strong anharmonicity and insensitivity to offset charge are highly desirable for low-error implementation. In this work we propose a c-axis junction, comprising triplet superconductors, and set at a relative twist angle. Invoking spin-orbit coupling and spin polarization, which are known to occur in the material platform of choice, we examine the resulting transmon Hamiltonian. This junction allows for direct control of the single and double Cooper pair tunneling strength, and most remarkably, an anomalous magnetic flux -- i.e. a phase offset equivalent to magnetic flux, yet in zero magnetic field. Having control over these three parameters -- single and double pair tunneling and anomalous flux -- allows for optimal design of the transmon qubit. Interestingly, in this architecture, the anomalous flux is determined by the twist angle of the junction, thereby offering a novel zero-field functionality. Our key results rely on symmetry arguments, for concreteness we demonstrate the implementation of our concept using a model of moir\'e graphene-based c-axis junctions.</description>

Abstract: We prove that a unital completely positive map between finite-dimensional C*-algebras is a homomorphism if and only if it is completely entropy-nonincreasing, where the relevant notion of entropy is a variant of von Neumann entropy. As an intermediate step, we prove that a unital completely positive map between finite-dimensional C*-algebras is a homomorphism if and only if its adjusted Choi operator is a projection. Both equivalences generalize familiar facts about stochastic maps between finite sets.</description>

Abstract: Describing the dynamics of many-electron quantum systems is crucial for applications such as predicting electronic structures in quantum chemistry, the properties of condensed matter systems, and the behaviors of complex materials. However, the real-time evolution of non-equilibrium quantum electronic systems poses a significant challenge for theoretical and computational approaches, due to the system's exploration of a vast configuration space. This work introduces a variational approach for fermionic time-dependent wave functions, surpassing mean-field approximations by capturing many-body correlations. The proposed methodology involves parameterizing the time-evolving quantum state, enabling the approximation of the state's evolution. To account for electron correlations, we employ time-dependent Jastrow factors and backflow transformations. We also show that we can incorporate neural networks to parameterize these functions. The time-dependent variational Monte Carlo technique is employed to efficiently compute the optimal time-dependent parameters. The approach is demonstrated in three distinct systems: the solvable harmonic interaction model, the dynamics of a diatomic molecule in intense laser fields, and a quenched quantum dot. In all cases, we show clear signatures of many-body correlations in the dynamics not captured by mean-field methods. The results showcase the ability of our variational approach to accurately capture the time evolution of quantum states, providing insight into the quantum dynamics of interacting electronic systems, beyond the capabilities of mean-field.</description>

For anions $\mathrm{He}^-, \mathrm{Be}^-, \mathrm{N}^-, \mathrm{Ne}^-$, etc., many numerical results give strong evidence of the condition $E(N, Z)= E(N-1, Z)$.</description>

      <title>Directionally Tunable Co- and Counter-Propagating Photon Pairs from a Nonlinear Metasurface</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear metasurfaces have recently been established as a new platform for generating photon pairs via spontaneous parametric down-conversion. While for classical harmonic generation in metasurfaces a high level of control over all degrees of freedom of light has been reached, this capability is yet to be developed for photon pair generation. In this work, we theoretically and experimentally demonstrate for the first time precise control of the emission angle of photon pairs generated from a nonlinear metasurface. Our measurements show angularly tunable pair-generation with high coincidence-to-accidental ratio for both co- and counter-propagating emission. The underlying principle is the transverse phase-matching of guided-mode resonances with strong angular dispersion in a nonlinear lithium niobate metagrating. We provide a straightforward design strategy for photon pair generation in such a device and find very good agreement between the calculations and experimental results. Here we use all-optical emission angle tuning by means of the pump wavelength, however the principle could be extended to modulation via the electro-optic effect in lithium niobate. In sum, this work provides an important addition to the toolset of sub-wavelength thickness photon pair sources.</description>

Abstract: This study addresses the urgent need for improved prostate cancer detection methods by harnessing the power of advanced technological solutions. We introduce the application of Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM) to this critical healthcare challenge, showcasing an enhancement in diagnostic performance over the classical Support Vector Machine (SVM) approach. Our study not only outlines the remarkable improvements in diagnostic performance made by QSVM over the classic SVM technique, but it delves into the advancements brought about by the quantum feature map architecture, which has been carefully identified and evaluated, ensuring it aligns seamlessly with the unique characteristics of our prostate cancer dataset. This architecture succeded in creating a distinct feature space, enabling the detection of complex, non-linear patterns in the data. The findings reveal not only a comparable accuracy with classical SVM ($92\%$) but also a $7.14\%$ increase in sensitivity and a notably high F1-Score ($93.33\%$). This study's important combination of quantum computing in medical diagnostics marks a pivotal step forward in cancer detection, offering promising implications for the future of healthcare technology.</description>

Abstract: Building on parallels between geometric quantum mechanics and classical mechanics, we explore an alternative basis for quantum thermodynamics that exploits the differential geometry of the underlying state space. We develop both microcanonical and canonical ensembles, introducing continuous mixed states as distributions on the manifold of quantum states. We call out the experimental consequences for a gas of qudits. We define quantum heat and work in an intrinsic way, including single-trajectory work, and reformulate thermodynamic entropy in a way that accords with classical, quantum, and information-theoretic entropies. We give both the First and Second Laws of Thermodynamics and Jarzynki's Fluctuation Theorem. The result is a more transparent physics, than conventionally available, in which the mathematical structure and physical intuitions underlying classical and quantum dynamics are seen to be closely aligned.</description>

Abstract: Geometric quantum mechanics, through its differential-geometric underpinning, provides additional tools of analysis and interpretation that bring quantum mechanics closer to classical mechanics: state spaces in both are equipped with symplectic geometry. This opens the door to revisiting foundational questions and issues, such as the nature of quantum entropy, from a geometric perspective. Central to this is the concept of geometric quantum state -- the probability measure on a system's space of pure states. This space's continuity leads us to introduce two analysis tools, inspired by Renyi's information theory, to characterize and quantify fundamental properties of geometric quantum states: the quantum information dimension that is the rate of geometric quantum state compression and the dimensional geometric entropy that monitors information stored in quantum states. We recount their classical definitions, information-theoretic meanings, and physical interpretations, and adapt them to quantum systems via the geometric approach. We then explicitly compute them in various examples and classes of quantum system. We conclude commenting on future directions for information in geometric quantum mechanics.</description>

Abstract: Classical theory asserts that several electromagnetic waves cannot interact with matter if they interfere destructively to zero, whereas quantum mechanics predicts a nontrivial light-matter dynamics even when the average electric field vanishes. Here we show that in quantum optics classical interference emerges from collective bright and dark states of light, \textit{i.e.}, entangled superpositions of multi-mode photon-number states. This makes it possible to explain wave interference using the particle description of light and the superposition principle for linear systems.</description>

Abstract: Switching controlled dynamics allows for fast, flexible control design methods for quantum stabilization of pure states and subspaces, which naturally include both Hamiltonian and dissipative control actions. A novel approach to measurement-based, dissipative feedback design is introduced, and extends the applicability of switching techniques with respect to previously proposed ones, as it does not need stringent invariance assumptions, while it still avoids undesired chattering or Zeno effects by modulating the control intensity. When the switching dynamics do leave the target invariant, on the other hand, we show that exponential convergence to the target can be enforced without modulation, and switching times that can be either fixed or stochastic with hysteresis to avoid chattering. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is illustrated via numerical simulations of simple yet paradigmatic examples, demonstrating how switching strategies converge faster than open-loop engineered dissipation.</description>

      <title>Diagnostics of mixed-state topological order and breakdown of quantum memory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.05689v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological quantum memory can protect information against local errors up to finite error thresholds. Such thresholds are usually determined based on the success of decoding algorithms rather than the intrinsic properties of the mixed states describing corrupted memories. Here we provide an intrinsic characterization of the breakdown of topological quantum memory, which both gives a bound on the performance of decoding algorithms and provides examples of topologically distinct mixed states. We employ three information-theoretical quantities that can be regarded as generalizations of the diagnostics of ground-state topological order, and serve as a definition for topological order in error-corrupted mixed states. We consider the topological contribution to entanglement negativity and two other metrics based on quantum relative entropy and coherent information. In the concrete example of the 2D Toric code with local bit-flip and phase errors, we map three quantities to observables in 2D classical spin models and analytically show they all undergo a transition at the same error threshold. This threshold is an upper bound on that achieved in any decoding algorithm and is indeed saturated by that in the optimal decoding algorithm for the Toric code.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.12330v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The density of quasiparticles typically observed in superconducting qubits exceeds the value expected in equilibrium by many orders of magnitude. Can this out-of-equilibrium quasiparticle density still possess an energy distribution in equilibrium with the phonon bath? Here, we answer this question affirmatively by measuring the thermal activation of charge-parity switching in a transmon qubit with a difference in superconducting gap on the two sides of the Josephson junction. We then demonstrate how the gap asymmetry of the device can be exploited to manipulate its parity.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial NLTS From the Overlap Gap Property</title>

Abstract: In an important recent development, Anshu, Breuckmann, and Nirkhe [ABN22] resolved positively the so-called No Low-Energy Trivial State (NLTS) conjecture by Freedman and Hastings. The conjecture postulated the existence of linear-size local Hamiltonians on n qubit systems for which no near-ground state can be prepared by a shallow (sublogarithmic depth) circuit. The construction in [ABN22] is based on recently developed good quantum codes. Earlier results in this direction included the constructions of the so-called Combinatorial NLTS -- a weaker version of NLTS -- where a state is defined to have low energy if it violates at most a vanishing fraction of the Hamiltonian terms [AB22]. These constructions were also based on codes.
  In this paper we provide a "non-code" construction of a class of Hamiltonians satisfying the Combinatorial NLTS. The construction is inspired by one in [AB22], but our proof uses the complex solution space geometry of random K-SAT instead of properties of codes. Specifically, it is known that above a certain clause-to-variables density the set of satisfying assignments of random K-SAT exhibits an overlap gap property, which implies that it can be partitioned into exponentially many clusters each constituting at most an exponentially small fraction of the total set of satisfying solutions. We establish a certain robust version of this clustering property for the space of near-satisfying assignments and show that for our constructed Hamiltonians every combinatorial near-ground state induces a near-uniform distribution supported by this set. Standard arguments then are used to show that such distributions cannot be prepared by quantum circuits with depth o(log n). Since the clustering property is exhibited by many random structures, including proper coloring and maximum cut, we anticipate that our approach is extendable to these models as well.</description>

      <title>Algebraic discrete quantum harmonic oscillator with dynamic resolution scaling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.01486v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop an algebraic formulation for the discrete quantum harmonic oscillator (DQHO) with a finite, equally-spaced energy spectrum and energy eigenfunctions defined on a discrete domain, which is known as the su(2) or Kravchuk oscillator. Unlike previous approaches, ours does not depend on the discretization of the Schr\"odinger equation and recurrence relations of special functions. This algebraic formulation is endowed with a natural su(2) algebra, each finite dimensional irreducible representation of which defines a distinct DQHO labeled by its resolution. In addition to energy ladder operators, the formulation allows for resolution ladder operators connecting all DQHOs with different resolutions. The resolution ladder operators thus enable the dynamic scaling of the resolution of finite degree-of-freedom quantum simulations. Using the algebraic DQHO formalism, we are able to rigorously derive the energy eigenstate wave functions of the QHO in a purely algebraic manner without using differential equations or differential operators, which is impossible in the continuous or infinite discrete setting. The coherent state of the DQHO is constructed, and its expected position is proven to oscillate as a classical harmonic oscillator. The DQHO coherent state recovers that of the quantum harmonic oscillator at large resolution. The algebraic formulation also predicts the existence of an inverse DQHO that has no known continuous counterpart.</description>

      <title>Isometric tensor network optimization for extensive Hamiltonians is free of barren plateaus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.14320v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explain why and numerically confirm that there are no barren plateaus in the energy optimization of isometric tensor network states (TNS) for extensive Hamiltonians with finite-range interactions which are, for example, typical in condensed matter physics. Specifically, we consider matrix product states (MPS) with open boundary conditions, tree tensor network states (TTNS), and the multiscale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA). MERA are isometric by construction and, for the MPS and TTNS, the tensor network gauge freedom allows us to choose all tensors as partial isometries. The variance of the energy gradient, evaluated by taking the Haar average over the TNS tensors, has a leading system-size independent term and decreases according to a power law in the bond dimension. For a hierarchical TNS (TTNS and MERA) with branching ratio $b$, the variance of the gradient with respect to a tensor in layer $\tau$ scales as $(b\eta)^\tau$, where $\eta$ is the second largest eigenvalue of a Haar-average doubled layer-transition channel and decreases algebraically with increasing bond dimension. The absence of barren plateaus substantiates that isometric TNS are a promising route for an efficient quantum-computation-based investigation of strongly-correlated quantum matter. The observed scaling properties of the gradient amplitudes bear implications for efficient TNS initialization procedures.</description>

      <title>A Solvable Model of Quantum Darwinism-Encoding Transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.03694v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a solvable model of Quantum Darwinism to encoding transitions -- abrupt changes in how quantum information spreads in a many-body system under unitary dynamics. We consider a random Clifford circuit on an expanding tree, whose input qubit is entangled with a reference. The model has a Quantum Darwinism phase, where one classical bit of information about the reference can be retrieved from an arbitrarily small fraction of the output qubits, and an encoding phase where such retrieval is impossible. The two phases are separated by a mixed phase and two continuous transitions. We compare the exact result to a two-replica calculation. The latter yields a similar ``annealed'' phase diagram, which applies also to a model with Haar random unitaries. We relate our approach to measurement induced phase transitions (MIPTs), by solving a modified model where an environment eavesdrops on an encoding system. It has a sharp MIPT only with full access to the environment.</description>

Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) is known to be unconditionally secure in principle, but quantifying the security of QKD protocols from a practical standpoint continues to remain an important challenge. Here, we focus on phase-based QKD protocols and characterize the security of the 3 and n-pulse Differential Phase Shift Quantum Key Distribution (DPS QKD) protocols against individual attacks. In particular, we focus on the minimum error discrimination (MED) and cloning attacks and obtain the corresponding shrinking factor by which the sifted key needs to be shrunk in order to get a secure key. We compare the secure key rates thus obtained with the known lower bounds under a general individual attack. In a departure from the theoretical lower bounds, which have no explicit attack strategies, our work provides a practical assessment of the security of phase-based protocols based on attacks with known implementations.</description>

      <title>Atomic clock locking via Bayesian frequency estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.06608v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Atomic clocks play a vital role in fundamental science and practical technology. However, their sensitivity is typically limited by the standard quantum limit, which is determined by parallel measurements with individual particles or repeated measurements with a single particle. Overcoming this limitation requires exploiting correlations between particles or interrogation times. While it has been demonstrated that sensitivity can be improved to the Heisenberg limit by utilizing quantum entanglement, it remains unclear whether the scaling of sensitivity with respect to total interrogation time can achieve the Heisenberg scaling. Here, we develop an adaptive Bayesian frequency estimation protocol that approaches the Heisenberg scaling and experimentally demonstrate its validity with a cold-atom coherent-population-trapping clock. In further, we achieve robust closed-loop locking of the atomic clock by utilizing our Bayesian frequency estimation protocol. In comparison with the conventional clock locking, our Bayesian clock locking yields an improvement of 5.1(4) dB in fractional frequency stability. Our findings not only provide an alternative approach to locking atomic clocks but also hold promising applications in other quantum sensors, such as quantum magnetometers and atomic interferometers.</description>

      <title>Multilevel leapfrogging initialization for quantum approximate optimization algorithm</title>

Abstract: Recently, Zhou et al. have proposed a novel Interpolation-based (INTERP) strategy to generate the initial parameters for the Parameterized Quantum Circuit (PQC) in Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). INTERP produces the guess of the initial parameters at level $i+1$ by applying linear interpolation to the optimized parameters at level $i$, achieving better performance than random initialization (RI). Nevertheless, INTERP consumes extensive running costs for deep QAOA because it necessitates optimization at each level of the PQC. To address this problem, a Multilevel Leapfrogging Interpolation (MLI) strategy is proposed. MLI can produce the guess of the initial parameters from level $i+1$ to $i+l$ ($l&gt;1$) at level $i$, omitting the optimization rounds from level $i+1$ to $(i+l-1)$. The final result is that MLI executes optimization at few levels rather than each level, and this operation is referred to as Multilevel Leapfrogging optimization (M-Leap). The performance of MLI is investigated on the Maxcut problem. Compared with INTERP, MLI reduces most optimization rounds. Remarkably, the simulation results demonstrate that MLI can achieve the same quasi-optima as INTERP while consuming only 1/2 of the running costs required by INTERP. In addition, for MLI, where there is no RI except for level $1$, the greedy-MLI strategy is presented. The simulation results suggest that greedy-MLI has better stability (i.e., a higher average approximation ratio) than INTERP and MLI beyond obtaining the same quasi-optima as INTERP. According to the efficiency of finding the quasi-optima, the idea of M-Leap might be extended to other training tasks, especially those requiring numerous optimizations, such as training adaptive quantum circuits.</description>

Abstract: Control and learning are key to technological advancement, both in the classical and quantum domains, yet their interrelationship is insufficiently clear in the literature, especially between classical and quantum definitions of control and learning. We construct a framework that formally relates learning and control, both classical and quantum, to each other, with this formalism showing how learning can aid control. Furthermore, our framework helps to identify interesting unsolved problems in the nexus of classical and quantum control and learning and help in choosing tools to solve problems. As a use case, we cast the well-studied problem of adaptive quantum-enhanced interferometric-phase estimation as a supervised learning problem for devising feasible control policies. Our unification of these fields relies on diagrammatically representing the state of knowledge, which elegantly summarizes existing knowledge and exposes knowledge gaps.</description>

      <title>Efficient quantum amplitude encoding of polynomial functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.10917v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Loading functions into quantum computers represents an essential step in several quantum algorithms, such as quantum partial differential equation solvers. Therefore, the inefficiency of this process leads to a major bottleneck for the application of these algorithms. Here, we present and compare two efficient methods for the amplitude encoding of real polynomial functions on $n$ qubits. This case holds special relevance, as any continuous function on a closed interval can be uniformly approximated with arbitrary precision by a polynomial function. The first approach relies on the matrix product state representation. We study and benchmark the approximations of the target state when the bond dimension is assumed to be small. The second algorithm combines two subroutines. Initially we encode the linear function into the quantum registers with a swallow sequence of multi-controlled gates that loads the linear function's Hadamard-Walsh series, exploring how truncating the Hadamard-Walsh series of the linear function affects the final fidelity. Applying the inverse discrete Hadamard-Walsh transform transforms the series coefficients into an amplitude encoding of the linear function. Then, we use this construction as a building block to achieve a block encoding of the amplitudes corresponding to the linear function on $k_0$ qubits and apply the quantum singular value transformation that implements a polynomial transformation to the block encoding of the amplitudes. This unitary together with the Amplitude Amplification algorithm will enable us to prepare the quantum state that encodes the polynomial function on $k_0$ qubits. Finally we pad $n-k_0$ qubits to generate an approximated encoding of the polynomial on $n$ qubits, analyzing the error depending on $k_0$. In this regard, our methodology proposes a method to improve the state-of-the-art complexity by introducing controllable errors.</description>

Abstract: Spectral densities encode the relevant information characterising the system-environment interaction in an open-quantum system problem. Such information is key to determining the system's dynamics. In this work, we leverage the potential of machine learning techniques to reconstruct the features of the environment. Specifically, we show that the time evolution of a system observable can be used by an artificial neural network to infer the main features of the spectral density. In particular, for relevant examples of spin-boson models, we can classify with high accuracy the Ohmicity parameter of the environment as either Ohmic, sub-Ohmic or super-Ohmic, thereby distinguishing between different forms of dissipation.</description>

Abstract: Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) is commonly used in simulations for Quantum Annealing (QA), but QMC as a heuristic approach has great difficulty in that it takes much time to find minimum energy. It mainly depends on the existence of a trotter layer derived from Suzuki-Trotter decomposition. In this paper, I propose a new approach to calculate it in short time, although it isn't rigorous mathematically. Its validity and advantageous points are also discussed, in comparison with conventional QMC methods.</description>

Abstract: The problem of Fleet Conversion aims to reduce the carbon emissions and cost of operating a fleet of vehicles for a given set of tours. It can be modelled as a column generation scheme with the Maximum Weighted Independent Set (MWIS) problem as the slave. Quantum variational algorithms have gained significant interest in the past several years. Recently, a method to represent Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems using logarithmically fewer qubits was proposed. Here we use this method to solve the MWIS Slaves and demonstrate how quantum and classical solvers can be used together to approach an industrial-sized use-case (up to 64 tours).</description>

Abstract: Quantum random access memory (QRAM) is a common architecture resource for algorithms with many proposed applications, including quantum chemistry, windowed quantum arithmetic, unstructured search, machine learning, and quantum cryptography. Here we propose two bucket-brigade QRAM architectures based on high-coherence superconducting resonators, which differ in their realizations of the conditional-routing operations. In the first, we directly construct controlled-$\mathsf{SWAP}$ ($\textsf{CSWAP}$) operations, while in the second we utilize the properties of giant-unidirectional emitters (GUEs). For both architectures we analyze single-rail and dual-rail implementations of a bosonic qubit. In the single-rail encoding we can detect first-order ancilla errors, while the dual-rail encoding additionally allows for the detection of photon losses. For parameter regimes of interest the post-selected infidelity of a QRAM query in a dual-rail architecture is nearly an order of magnitude below that of a corresponding query in a single-rail architecture. These findings suggest that dual-rail encodings are particularly attractive as architectures for QRAM devices in the era before fault tolerance.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by the great success of classical generative models in machine learning, enthusiastic exploration of their quantum version has recently started. To depart on this journey, it is important to develop a relevant metric to evaluate the quality of quantum generative models; in the classical case, one such example is the inception score. In this paper, we propose the quantum inception score, which relates the quality to the Holevo information of the quantum channel that classifies a given dataset. We prove that, under this proposed measure, the quantum generative models provide better quality than their classical counterparts because of the presence of quantum coherence, characterized by the resource theory of asymmetry, and entanglement. Furthermore, we harness the quantum fluctuation theorem to characterize the physical limitation of the quality of quantum generative models. Finally, we apply the quantum inception score to assess the quality of the one-dimensional spin chain model as a quantum generative model, with the quantum convolutional neural network as a quantum classifier, for the phase classification problem in the quantum many-body physics.</description>

      <title>Alternative robust ways of witnessing nonclassicality in the simplest scenario</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.13474v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we relate notions of nonclassicality in the simplest nontrivial scenario (a prepare and measure scenario composed of four preparations and two binary-outcome tomographically complete measurements). Specifically, we relate the established method developed in [Pusey, PRA 98,022112(2018)] to witness a violation of preparation noncontextuality, that is not suitable in experiments where the operational equivalences to be tested are specified in advance, with an approach based on the notion of bounded ontological distinctness for preparations, defined in [Chaturvedi and Saha, Quantum 4, 345 (2020)]. In our approach, we test bounded ontological distinctness for two particular preparations that are relevant in certain information processing tasks in that they are associated with the even- and odd-parity of the bits to communicate. When there exists an ontological model where this distance is preserved we talk of parity preservation. Our main result provides a noise threshold under which violating parity preservation (and so bounded ontological distinctness) agrees with the established method for witnessing preparation contextuality in the simplest nontrivial scenario. This is achieved by first relating the violation of parity preservation to the quantification of contextuality in terms of inaccessible information as developed in [Marvian, arXiv:2003.05984(2020)], that we also show, given the way we quantify noise, to be more robust in witnessing contextuality than Pusey's noncontextuality inequality. As an application of our findings, we treat the case of two-bit parity-oblivious multiplexing in the presence of noise. In particular, we provide a condition for which the result establishing preparation contextuality as a resource for the quantum advantage of the protocol in the noiseless case still holds in the noisy case.</description>

      <title>Quantum Darwinism-encoding transitions on expanding trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04284v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum Darwinism (QD) proposes that classical objectivity emerges from the broadcast of information about a microscopic degree of freedom into multiple fractions of a many-body environment. Such a broadcast of information is in sharp contrast with its scrambling under strong interaction. It was recently shown that quantum dynamics interpolating between broadcasting and scrambling may display sharp phase transitions of information propagation, named QD-encoding transitions. Here, we initiate their systematic study in generic, non-Clifford settings. First, in a general theoretical setup where the information propagation is modeled as an isometry, whose input qudit is entangled with a reference, we propose a probe of the transitions -- the distribution of the density matrix of the reference after measuring an environment fraction. This probe measures the classical correlation between the fraction and the injected information. We then apply the framework to two similar models defined by a tensor network on an expanding tree, modeling a noisy apparatus that attempts to broadcast the $z$ component of a spin-half. We derive an exact recursion relation of the density matrix distribution, which we analyze analytically and numerically. As a result we find three phases: QD, intermediate and encoding, and two continuous transitions. The encoding-intermediate transition describes the establishment of nonzero correlation between the reference and a small environment fraction, and can be probed by a ``coarse-grained'' measure of the total spin-$z$ of the fraction, which becomes non-Gaussian and symmetry breaking in the intermediate space. The QD-intermediate transition is about whether the correlation is perfect. It must be probed by fined-grained measures, and corresponds to a more subtle symmetry breaking in the replica space.</description>

      <title>Krylov complexity for non-local spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11677v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Building upon recent research in spin systems with non-local interactions, this study investigates operator growth using the Krylov complexity in different non-local versions of the Ising model. We find that the non-locality results in a faster scrambling of the operator to all sites. While the saturation value of Krylov complexity of local integrable and local chaotic theories differ by a significant margin, this difference is much suppressed when non-local terms are introduced in both regimes. This results from the faster scrambling of information in the presence of non-locality. In addition, we investigate the behavior of level statistics and spectral form factor as probes of quantum chaos to study the integrability breaking due to non-local interactions. Our numerics indicate that in the non-local case, late time saturation of Krylov complexity distinguishes between different underlying theories, while the early time complexity growth distinguishes different degrees of non-locality.</description>

      <title>A fixed-point algorithm for matrix projections with applications in quantum information</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14615v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a simple fixed-point iterative algorithm that computes the matrix projection with respect to the Bures distance on the set of positive definite matrices that are invariant under some symmetry. We prove that the fixed-point iteration algorithm converges exponentially fast to the optimal solution in the number of iterations. Moreover, it numerically shows fast convergence compared to the off-the-shelf semidefinite program solvers. Our algorithm, for the specific case of matrix barycenters, recovers the fixed-point iterative algorithm originally introduced in (\'Alvarez-Esteban et al., 2016). Compared to previous works, our proof is more general and direct as it is based only on simple matrix inequalities. Finally, we discuss several applications of our algorithm in quantum resource theories and quantum Shannon theory.</description>

      <title>Generation of complete graph states in a spin-$1/2$ Heisenberg chain with a globally optimized magnetic field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01986v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph states possess significant practical value in measurement-based quantum computation, with complete graph states that exhibit exceptional performance in quantum metrology. In this work, we introduce a method for generating multiparticle complete graph states using a spin-$1/2$ Heisenberg $XX$ chain subjected to a time-varying magnetic field, which applies to a wide range of systems. Our scheme relies exclusively on nearest-neighbor interactions between atoms, with real-time magnetic field formation facilitated by quantum optimal control theory. We focus specifically on neutral-atom systems, finding that multiparticle complete graph states with $N=3\sim6$ can be achieved in less than $0.25~\mu{\rm s}$, utilizing a hopping amplitude of ${J}/{(2\pi)} = -2.443~{\rm MHz}$. This assumes an initial state provided by an equal-weight superposition of all spin states that are encoded by the dipolar interacting Rydberg states. Additionally, we thoroughly address various experimental imperfections and showcase the robustness of our approach against atomic vibrations, fluctuations in pulse amplitude, and spontaneous emission of Rydberg states. Considering the common occurrence of disturbances in experimental setups of neutral-atom systems, our one-step strategy for achieving such graph states emerges as a more empirically viable alternative to techniques based on controlled-Z gates.</description>

      <title>Efficient near-optimal decoding of the surface code through ensembling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12434v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce harmonization, an ensembling method that combines several "noisy" decoders to generate highly accurate decoding predictions. Harmonized ensembles of MWPM-based decoders achieve lower logical error rates than their individual counterparts on repetition and surface code benchmarks, approaching maximum-likelihood accuracy at large ensemble sizes. We can use the degree of consensus among the ensemble as a confidence measure for a layered decoding scheme, in which a small ensemble flags high-risk cases to be checked by a larger, more accurate ensemble. This layered scheme can realize the accuracy improvements of large ensembles with a relatively small constant factor of computational overhead. We conclude that harmonization provides a viable path towards highly accurate real-time decoding.</description>

      <title>Early Exploration of a Flexible Framework for Efficient Quantum Linear Solvers in Power Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08136v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid integration of renewable energy resources presents formidable challenges in managing power grids. While advanced computing and machine learning techniques offer some solutions for accelerating grid modeling and simulation, there remain complex problems that classical computers cannot effectively address. Quantum computing, a promising technology, has the potential to fundamentally transform how we manage power systems, especially in scenarios with a higher proportion of renewable energy sources. One critical aspect is solving large-scale linear systems of equations, crucial for power system applications like power flow analysis, for which the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) algorithm is a well-known quantum solution. However, HHL quantum circuits often exhibit excessive depth, making them impractical for current Noisy-Intermediate-Scale-Quantum (NISQ) devices. In this paper, we introduce a versatile framework, powered by NWQSim, that bridges the gap between power system applications and quantum linear solvers available in Qiskit. This framework empowers researchers to efficiently explore power system applications using quantum linear solvers. Through innovative gate fusion strategies, reduced circuit depth, and GPU acceleration, our simulator significantly enhances resource efficiency. Power flow case studies have demonstrated up to a eight-fold speedup compared to Qiskit Aer, all while maintaining comparable levels of accuracy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04653v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Adaptive Variational Quantum Dynamics (AVQD) algorithms offer a promising approach to providing quantum-enabled solutions for systems treated within the purview of open quantum dynamical evolution. In this study, we employ the unrestricted vectorization variant of AVQD to simulate and benchmark various non-unitarily evolving systems. We exemplify how construction of an expressible ansatz unitary and the associated operator pool can be implemented to analyze examples such as the Fenna Matthews Olson complex (FMO) and even the permutational invariant Dicke model of quantum optics. We furthermore show an efficient decomposition scheme for the ansatz used, which can extend its applications to a wide range of other open quantum system scenarios in near future. In all cases the results obtained are in excellent agreement with exact numerical computations which bolsters the effectiveness of this technique. Our successful demonstrations pave the way for utilizing this adaptive variational technique to study complex systems in chemistry and physics, like light harvesting devices, thermal, and opto mechanical switches, to name a few.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium symmetry-protected topological order: emergence of semilocal Gibbs ensembles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.02221v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider nonequilibrium time evolution in quantum spin chains after a global quench. Usually a nonequilibium quantum many-body system locally relaxes to a (generalised) Gibbs ensemble built from conserved operators with quasilocal densities. Here we exhibit explicit examples of local Hamiltonians that possess conservation laws with densities that are not quasilocal but act as such in the symmetry-restricted space where time evolution occurs. Because of them, the stationary state emerging at infinite time can exhibit exceptional features. We focus on a specific example with a spin-flip symmetry, which is the commonest global symmetry encountered in spin-$1/2$ chains. Among the exceptional properties, we find that, at late times, the excess of entropy of a spin block triggered by a local perturbation in the initial state grows logarithmically with the subsystem's length. We establish a connection with symmetry-protected topological order in equilibrium at zero temperature and study the melting of the order induced either by a (symmetry-breaking) rotation of the initial state or by an increase of the temperature.</description>

Abstract: Machine learning has blossomed in recent decades and has become essential in many fields. It significantly solved some problems in particle physics -- particle reconstruction, event classification, etc. However, it is now time to break the limitation of conventional machine learning with quantum computing. A support-vector machine algorithm with a quantum kernel estimator (QSVM-Kernel) leverages high-dimensional quantum state space to identify a signal from backgrounds. In this study, we have pioneered employing this quantum machine learning algorithm to study the $e^{+}e^{-} \rightarrow ZH$ process at the Circular Electron-Positron Collider (CEPC), a proposed Higgs factory to study electroweak symmetry breaking of particle physics. Using 6 qubits on quantum computer simulators, we optimised the QSVM-Kernel algorithm and obtained a classification performance similar to the classical support-vector machine algorithm. Furthermore, we have validated the QSVM-Kernel algorithm using 6-qubits on quantum computer hardware from both IBM and Origin Quantum: the classification performances of both are approaching noiseless quantum computer simulators. In addition, the Origin Quantum hardware results are similar to the IBM Quantum hardware within the uncertainties in our study. Our study shows that state-of-the-art quantum computing technologies could be utilised by particle physics, a branch of fundamental science that relies on big experimental data.</description>

      <title>Quantum Control Machine: The Limits of Control Flow in Quantum Programming</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.15000v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum algorithms for tasks such as factorization, search, and simulation rely on control flow such as branching and iteration that depends on the value of data in superposition. High-level programming abstractions for control flow, such as switches, loops, and higher-order functions, are ubiquitous in classical languages. By contrast, many quantum languages do not provide high-level abstractions for control flow in superposition, and instead require the use of hardware-level logic gates to implement such control flow.
  The reason for this gap is that whereas a classical computer supports control flow using a program counter that can depend on data, the typical architecture of a quantum computer does not provide a program counter that can depend on data in superposition. As a result, the complete set of control flow abstractions that can be correctly realized on a quantum computer has not yet been established.
  In this work, we provide a complete characterization of the properties of control flow abstractions that are correctly realizable on a quantum computer. First, we prove that even on a quantum computer whose program counter exists in superposition, one cannot correctly realize control flow in quantum algorithms by lifting the classical conditional jump instruction to work in superposition. This theorem denies the ability to directly lift general abstractions for control flow such as the $\lambda$-calculus from classical to quantum programming.
  In response, we present the necessary and sufficient conditions for control flow to be correctly realizable on a quantum computer. We introduce the quantum control machine, an instruction set architecture featuring a conditional jump that is restricted to satisfy these conditions. We show how this design enables a developer to correctly express control flow in quantum algorithms using a program counter in place of logic gates.</description>

Abstract: Semiconductor quantum dots operated dynamically are the basis of many quantum technologies such as quantum sensors and computers. Hence, modelling their electrical properties at microwave frequencies becomes essential to simulate their performance in larger electronic circuits. Here, we develop a self-consistent quantum master equation formalism to obtain the admittance of a quantum dot tunnel-coupled to a charge reservoir under the effect of a coherent photon bath. We find a general expression for the admittance that captures the well-known semiclassical (thermal) limit, along with the transition to lifetime and power broadening regimes due to the increased coupling to the reservoir and amplitude of the photonic drive, respectively. Furthermore, we describe two new photon-mediated regimes: Floquet broadening, determined by the dressing of the QD states, and broadening determined by photon loss in the system. Our results provide a method to simulate the high-frequency behaviour of QDs in a wide range of limits, describe past experiments, and propose novel explorations of QD-photon interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.02170v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Out of thermal equilibrium, bosonic quantum systems can Bose-condense away from the ground state, featuring a macroscopic occupation of an excited state or even of multiple states in the so-called Bose-selection scenario. In previous work, a theory was developed that predicts, in which states a driven-dissipative ideal Bose gas condenses. Here, we address the inverse problem: Given a target state with desired condensate fractions in certain single-particle states, how can this configuration be achieved by tuning available control parameters? Which type of experimental setup allows for flexible condensation control? We solve these problems, on the one hand, by developing a theory to solve the inverse problem based on linear programming methods. On the other, we propose a Bose `condenser', experimentally implementable in a superconducting circuit, where targeted Bose condensation into eigenstates of a chain of resonators is driven through the coupling to artificial quantum baths, realized via auxiliary two-level systems. We further discuss the engineering of transition points between different Bose condensation configurations, which may find application for amplification, heat-flow control, and the design of highly-structured quantum baths.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.04631v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum information transfer is fundamental for scalable quantum computing in any potential platform and architecture. Hole spin qubits, owing to their intrinsic spin-orbit interaction (SOI), promise fast quantum operations which are fundamental for the implementation of quantum gates. Yet, the influence of SOI in quantum transfer protocols remains an open question. Here, we investigate hole flying qubits using shortcuts to adiabaticity protocols, i.e., the long-range transfer of hole spin states and the quantum distribution of entangled pairs in semiconductor quantum dot arrays. We show that electric field manipulation allows dynamical control of the SOI, enabling simultaneously the implementation of quantum gates during the transfer, with the potential to significantly accelerate quantum algorithms. By harnessing the ability to perform quantum gates in parallel with the transfer, we employ dynamical decoupling schemes to focus and preserve the spin state, leading to higher transfer fidelity.</description>

Abstract: DFT calculations yield useful ground-state energies and densities, while Green's function techniques (such as $GW$) are mostly used to produce spectral functions. From the Galitskii-Migdal formula, we extract the exchange-correlation of DFT directly from a Green's function. This spectral representation provides an alternative to the fluctuation-dissipation theorem of DFT, identifying distinct single-particle and many-particle contributions. Results are illustrated on the uniform electron gas and the two-site Hubbard model.</description>

Abstract: Machine learning, particularly deep neural networks, has been widely utilized in high energy physics and has shown remarkable results in various applications. Moreover, the concept of machine learning has been extended to quantum computers, giving rise to a new research area known as quantum machine learning. In this paper, we propose a novel variational quantum circuit model, Quantum Complete Graph Neural Network (QCGNN), designed for learning complete graphs. We argue that QCGNN has a polynomial speedup against its classical counterpart, due to the property of quantum parallelism. In this paper, we study the application of QCGNN through the challenging jet discrimination, where the jets are represented with complete graphs. Subsequently, we conduct a comparative analysis with classical graph neural networks to establish a benchmark.</description>

Abstract: For an $n$-qubit system, a rational function on the space of mixed states which is invariant with respect to the action of the group of local symmetries may be viewed as a detailed measure of entanglement. We show that the field of all such invariant rational functions is purely transcendental over the complex numbers and has transcendence degree $4^n - 2n-1$. An explicit transcendence basis is also exhibited.</description>
