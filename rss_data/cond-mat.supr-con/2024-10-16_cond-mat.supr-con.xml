      <title>Feasibility of the Josephson voltage and current standards on a single chip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum Josephson voltage standard is well established across the metrology community for many years. It relies on the synchronisation of the flux tunneling in the S/I/S Josepson junctions (JJ) with the microwave radiation (MW). The phenomenon is called the Shapiro steps. Together with the Quantum Hall resistance standard, the voltage standard forms the foundation of electrostatic metrology. The current is then defined as the ratio of the voltage and resistance. Realisation of the quantum current standard, would close the electrostatic metrological triangle of voltage-resistance-current. The current quantisation, the inverse Shapiro steps, was recently shown using the superconducting nanowires and small JJ. The effect is a synchronization of the MW with the Cooper pair tunnelling. This paves the way to combine the JJ voltage and current standards on the same chip and demonstrate feasibility of the multi-standard operation. We show the voltage and current quantization on the same chip up to frequency of 10 GHz, corresponding to the amplitudes 0.021 mV and 3.23 nA respectively. The accuracy of the voltage and current quantisation, however, is relatively low, 35 ppk and 100 ppk respectively. We discuss measures to optimise the JJs, circuit and environment to boost the amplitude and accuracy of the standards.</description>

      <title>Solving the Transient Dyson Equation with Quasilinear Complexity via Matrix Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a numerical strategy to efficiently solve the out-of-equilibrium Dyson equation in the transient regime. By discretizing the equation into a compact matrix form and applying state-of-the-art matrix compression techniques, we achieve significant improvements in computational efficiency, which result in quasi-linear scaling of both time and space complexity with propagation time. This enables to compute accurate solutions even for systems with multiple and disparate time scales. We benchmark our solver by simulating a voltage-biased Josephson junction formed by a quantum dot connected to two superconducting leads.</description>

      <title>Doping-induced evolution of the intrinsic hump and dip energies dependent on the sample fabrication conditions in Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In oxygen-doped Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$, the spectra, as observed by tunneling spectroscopy or photoemission measurements, depend on the sample fabrication conditions, such as the temperature and pressure for fabricating the junction or surface. This implies that the hump and dip energies extracted from the spectra depend on the sample fabrication conditions. When the samples were fabricated at 4.2 K and/or under ultrahigh vacuum (UHV), the hump energy exhibited a step-like doping dependence and the dip energy followed the upper pseudo-gap line. As the fabrication conditions deteriorated, the hump and dip energies reproduced the previous results, in that the dip energy was significantly dependent on the sample, whereas the hump energy exhibited a smooth hump doping dependence. It can be concluded that the observations for the samples fabricated at 4.2 K and/or under UHV reflect the intrinsic bulk properties, whereas those for the samples fabricated under deteriorated conditions reflect degraded surface properties.</description>

      <title>Evolution and Instability of Bogoliubov Fermi Surfaces under Zeeman Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution and instability of Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces (BFSs) in the spherical $j=3/2$ model under the Zeeman field have been theoretically studied. The Zeeman field induces a pronounced expansion of the BFSs, especially for those with a predominant $j_z = \pm 3/2$ component. This expansion can be detected through spectroscopic techniques such as angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). Furthermore, calculations of bogolon correlation functions suggest that if an additional phase transition occurs within the superconducting phase, it is likely to result in a chiral $p$-wave pairing state of bogolons, rather than a density-wave-type transition. This chiral $p$-wave state, which coexists with the chiral $d$-wave superconducting state, is characterized by spontaneous inversion symmetry breaking and the disappearance of the torus-shaped BFS structure.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Delamination strength of REBCO is very important for its applications in large magnet projects. This work presented the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) investigation of the microstructures of the REBCO coated conductor to understand its delamination property. We found that the low delamination strength is associated with nano-voids formed at the IBAD MgO/Y2O3 interface.</description>

      <title>Supercurrent Multiplexing with Solid-State Integrated Hybrid Superconducting Electronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) of cryogenic signal lines is a promising technique that can significantly reduce the required space, minimize the cooldown time, and increase the number of measurable quantum devices per cooldown. Here, we report the TDM of supercurrent with a 1-input-8-outputs voltage-actuated hybrid superconducting demultiplexer for the first time. The device comprises 14 ON/OFF InAsOI-based superconducting Josephson Field Effect Transistors (JoFETs) routed with Al traces. Each JoFET features Al as a superconductor and HfO2 as a gate insulator, and it can entirely suppress the switching current and increase the normal-state resistance by 20 times with a gate voltage of -4.5 V. The superconducting demultiplexer operates up to 100 MHz at 50 mK, features an insertion loss of ~ 0 dB in the superconducting state, and an OFF/ON ratio of ~ 17.5 dB in a 50-Ohm-matched cryogenic measurement setup. The frequency operation range can be extended by designing the demultiplexer with a proper microwave signal transport layout minimizing, at the same time, the impact of the parasitic electrical elements. These achievements open up the practical implementation of superconducting TDM as a key to drastically reducing I/O lines, costs, and space occupation in a cryostat, enabling the scalability of superconducting electronics.</description>

      <title>Unconventional pairing in Ising superconductors: Application to monolayer NbSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00409v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The presence of a non-centrosymmetric crystal structure and in-plane mirror symmetry allows an Ising spin-orbit coupling to form in some two-dimensional materials. Examples include transition metal dichalcogenide superconductors like monolayer NbSe$_2$, MoS$_2$, TaS$_2$, and PbTe$_2$, where a nontrivial nature of the superconducting state is currently being explored. In this study, we develop a microscopic formalism for Ising superconductors that captures the superconducting instability arising from a momentum-dependent spin- and charge-fluctuation-mediated pairing interaction. We apply our pairing model to the electronic structure of monolayer NbSe$_2$, where first-principles calculations reveal the presence of strong paramagnetic fluctuations. Our calculations provide a quantitative measure of the mixing between the even- and odd-parity superconducting states and its variation with Coulomb interaction. Further, numerical analysis in the presence of an external Zeeman field reveals the role of Ising spin-orbit coupling and mixing of odd-parity superconducting state in influencing the low-temperature enhancement of the critical magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Majorana multipole response with magnetic point group symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01924v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Majorana fermions (MFs) in a topological superconductor exhibit anisotropic electromagnetic responses, called Majorana multipole responses, when MFs are degenerate under time-reversal and crystalline symmetries. In time-reversal symmetric systems, the Majorana multipole response relates to Cooper pair symmetry in the underlying superconducting material, which provides a way to identify pairing symmetries through surface-spin-sensitive measurements. Here, we extend the concept of Majorana multipole response to systems with magnetic point group symmetry that break time-reversal symmetry and clarify how the response of MFs includes information about underlying superconductors. From a topological classification of symmetry-protected MFs and an effective surface theory, we classify possible magnetic and electric responses for MFs, which manifests a direct connection to Cooper pair symmetry for a symmetry-enforced pair of MFs. Additionally, we find several time-reversal-even higher-order multipole responses, such as the quadrupole response, which are forbidden in time-reversal symmetric systems, whereby indicating breaking of time-reversal symmetry. The theory is applied to the odd-parity chiral superconductor UTe$_2$ and the ferromagnetic superconductor UCoGe, demonstrating the appearance of a magnetic quadrupole response on a surface.</description>

      <title>Tunable second-order Josephson response in altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19413v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the influence of external electric and Zeeman fields on the Josephson response in a planar superconductor/altermagnet/superconductor junction. Remarkably, we discover that the current-phase relation can be forward- or backward-skewed due to significant second-order Josephson response. It decisively depends on the altermagnetic field strength. Such a second-order Josephson response can be measured directly by double SQUID devices. Additionally, the skewness can be effectively manipulated by electric gating. Furthermore, we reveal two additional impacts of external fields on the Josephson current: (i) Fields can induce 0-$\pi$ transitions. (ii) Fields can substantially enhance the critical current. Our study opens a new avenue for exploring the second-order Josephson response in altermagnets.</description>

      <title>Neutron-superfluid vortices and proton-superconductor flux tubes: Development of a minimal model for pulsar glitches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12127v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a theoretical framework that allows us to explore the coupled motion of neutron-superfluid vortices and proton-superconductor flux tubes in a gravitationally collapsed condensate, which describe neutron stars that form pulsars. Our framework uses the 3D Gross-Pitaevskii-Poisson-Equation (GPPE) for neutron Cooper pairs, the Real-Time-Ginzburg-Landau equation (RTGLE) for proton Cooper pairs, the Maxwell equations for the vector potential ${\bf A}$, and Newtonian gravity and interactions, both direct and induced by the Poisson equation, between the neutron and proton subsystems. For a pulsar we include a crust potential, characterized by an angle $\theta$, and frictional drag. By carrying out extensive direct numerical simulations, we obtain a variety of interesting results. We show that a rotating proton superconductor generates a uniform London magnetic field, which changes the field distribution inside flux tubes. In the absence of any direct interaction between the two species, they interact through the gravitational Poisson equation. The presence of attractive (repulsive) density-density interaction leads to the attraction (repulsion) between neutron vortices and proton flux tubes. The inclusion of the current-current interaction and the complete Maxwell equations allows us to quantify the entrainment effect that leads to induced magnetization of neutron vortices. We show that, with a strong external magnetic field ${\bf B}_{\rm ext}$, proton flux tubes are anchored to the crust, whereas neutron vortices leave the condensate and lead to abrupt changes of the crust angular momentum ${\rm J}_c$. The frictional term in the dynamical equation for $\theta$ yields stick-slip dynamics that leads, in turn, to glitches in the time series of ${\rm J}_c$. By calculating various statistical properties of this time series, we demonstrate that they display self-organised criticality(SOC).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16520v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In designing material functionalities for transition metal oxides, lattice structure and d-orbital occupancy are key determinants. However, the modulation of these two factors is inherently limited by the need to balance thermodynamic stability, growth kinetics, and stoichiometry precision, particularly for metastable phases. We introduce a methodology, namely the gigantic-oxidative atomic-layer-by-layer epitaxy (GOALL-Epitaxy), enhancing oxidation power 3-4 orders of magnitude beyond oxide molecular beam epitaxy (OMBE) and pulsed laser deposition (PLD), while ensuring atomic-layer-by-layer growth of designed complex structures. Thermodynamic stability is markedly augmented with stronger oxidation at elevated temperatures, whereas growth kinetics is sustained by laser ablation at lower temperatures. We demonstrate the accurate growth of complex nickelates and cuprates, especially an artificially designed structure with alternating single and double NiO2 layers possessing distinct nominal d-orbital occupancy, as a parent of high-temperature superconductor. The GOALL-Epitaxy enables material discovery within the vastly broadened growth parameter space.</description>

      <title>Microwave radiation at criticality in a hybrid Josephson array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09835v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Anomalous metallic behavior is often observed near superconductor-insulator quantum critical points and, if persistent to zero temperature, poses a challenge to current theories of metals. One explanation for this behavior could be incomplete thermal equilibrium between the sample and the cryostat. However, despite decades of study, the temperature of an anomalous metal has not yet been measured. We introduce a new experimental probe by capturing microwave radiation emitted from the anomalous metal, using a two-dimensional array of superconductor-semiconductor hybrid Josephson junctions as a model system. The total emitted radiation exceeds the limits of thermodynamic equilibrium, and is well described by an elevated sample temperature. The extracted sample temperature matches the onset of anomalous metallic behavior. Additionally, we discover scaling behavior of radiative noise in the presence of an applied bias. Elements of our noise-scaling observations were predicted based on nonlinear critical field theories and gauge-gravity duality between current noise and Hawking radiation from a black hole. This work shows that, in a prominent model system, anomalous metallic behavior is a non-equilibrium effect, and opens a new frontier in the study of universal, non-equilibrium phenomena near quantum criticality.</description>
