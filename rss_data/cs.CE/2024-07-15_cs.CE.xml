      <title>On a High-Frequency Analysis of Some Relevant Integral Equations in Electromagnetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this contribution we analyze the spectral properties of some commonly used boundary integral operators in computational electromagnetics and of their discrete counterparts, highlighting peculiar features of their spectra. In particular, a comparison with the eigenvalues of the continuous operators will be presented that highlights deviations in the high frequency regime and impacts, in a peculiar way, the accuracy of the numerical solutions of each formulation. A study and a proactive analysis of numerical results from standard boundary element solvers and the predictions from the theoretical analysis will corroborate the analytical framework employed and the validity of our observations.</description>

      <title>Computational co-design of structure and feedback controller for locomoting soft robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soft robots have gained significant attention due to their flexibility and safety, particularly in human-centric applications. The co-design of structure and controller in soft robotics has presented a longstanding challenge owing to the complexity of the dynamics involved. Despite some pioneering work dealing with the co-design of soft robot structures and actuation, design freedom has been limited by stochastic design search approaches. This study proposes the simultaneous optimization of structure and controller for soft robots in locomotion tasks, integrating topology optimization-based structural design with neural network-based feedback controller design. Here, the feedback controller receives information about the surrounding terrain and outputs actuation signals that induce the expansion and contraction of the material. We formulate the simultaneous optimization problem under uncertainty in terrains and construct an optimization algorithm that utilizes automatic differentiation within topology optimization and neural networks. We present numerical experiments to demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of our proposed method.</description>

      <title>A Perspective on Foundation Models for the Electric Power Grid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) currently dominate news headlines. They employ advanced deep learning architectures to extract structural information autonomously from vast datasets through self-supervision. The resulting rich representations of complex systems and dynamics can be applied to many downstream applications. Therefore, FMs can find uses in electric power grids, challenged by the energy transition and climate change. In this paper, we call for the development of, and state why we believe in, the potential of FMs for electric grids. We highlight their strengths and weaknesses amidst the challenges of a changing grid. We argue that an FM learning from diverse grid data and topologies could unlock transformative capabilities, pioneering a new approach in leveraging AI to redefine how we manage complexity and uncertainty in the electric grid. Finally, we discuss a power grid FM concept, namely GridFM, based on graph neural networks and show how different downstream tasks benefit.</description>

      <title>Improved accuracy of continuum surface flux models for metal additive manufacturing melt pool simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12114v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computational modeling of the melt pool dynamics in laser-based powder bed fusion metal additive manufacturing (PBF-LB/M) promises to shed light on fundamental mechanisms of defect generation. These processes are accompanied by rapid evaporation so that the evaporation-induced recoil pressure and cooling arise as major driving forces for fluid dynamics and temperature evolution. The magnitude of these interface fluxes depends exponentially on the melt pool surface temperature, which, therefore, has to be predicted with high accuracy. The present work utilizes a diffuse interface finite element model based on a continuum surface flux (CSF) description of interface fluxes to study dimensionally reduced thermal two-phase problems representative for PBF-LB/M in a finite element framework. It is demonstrated that the extreme temperature gradients combined with the high ratios of material properties between metal and ambient gas lead to significant errors in the interface temperatures and fluxes when classical CSF approaches, along with typical interface thicknesses and discretizations, are applied. It is expected that this finding is also relevant for other types of diffuse interface PBF-LB/M melt pool models. A novel parameter-scaled CSF approach is proposed, which is constructed to yield a smoother temperature field in the diffuse interface region, significantly increasing the solution accuracy. The interface thickness required to predict the temperature field with a given level of accuracy is less restrictive by at least one order of magnitude for the proposed parameter-scaled approach compared to classical CSF, drastically reducing computational costs. Finally, we showcase the general applicability of the parameter-scaled CSF to a 3D simulation of stationary laser melting of PBF-LB/M considering the fully coupled thermo-hydrodynamic multi-phase problem, including phase change.</description>

      <title>Internet sentiment exacerbates intraday overtrading, evidence from A-Share market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12001v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Market fluctuations caused by overtrading are important components of systemic market risk. This study examines the effect of investor sentiment on intraday overtrading activities in the Chinese A-share market. Employing high-frequency sentiment indices inferred from social media posts on the Eastmoney forum Guba, the research focuses on constituents of the CSI 300 and CSI 500 indices over a period from 01/01/2018, to 12/30/2022. The empirical analysis indicates that investor sentiment exerts a significantly positive impact on intraday overtrading, with the influence being more pronounced among institutional investors relative to individual traders. Moreover, sentiment-driven overtrading is found to be more prevalent during bull markets as opposed to bear markets. Additionally, the effect of sentiment on overtrading is observed to be more pronounced among individual investors in large-cap stocks compared to small- and mid-cap stocks.</description>
