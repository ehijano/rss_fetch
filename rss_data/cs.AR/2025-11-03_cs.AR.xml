      <title>Choreographer: A Full-System Framework for Fine-Grained Tasks in Cache Hierarchies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Choreographer, a simulation framework that enables a holistic system-level evaluation of fine-grained accelerators designed for latency-sensitive tasks. Unlike existing frameworks, Choreographer captures all hardware and software overheads in core-accelerator and cache-accelerator interactions, integrating a detailed gem5-based hardware stack featuring an AMBA coherent hub interface (CHI) mesh network and a complete Linux-based software stack. To facilitate rapid prototyping, it offers a C++ application programming interface and modular configuration options. Our detailed cache model provides accurate insights into performance variations caused by cache configurations, which are not captured by other frameworks. The framework is demonstrated through two case studies: a data-aware prefetcher for graph analytics workloads, and a quicksort accelerator. Our evaluation shows that the prefetcher achieves speedups between 1.08x and 1.88x by reducing memory access latency, while the quicksort accelerator delivers more than 2x speedup with minimal address translation overhead. These findings underscore the ability of Choreographer to model complex hardware-software interactions and optimize performance in small task offloading scenarios.</description>

      <title>Practical Timing Closure in FPGA and ASIC Designs: Methods, Challenges, and Case Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an in-depth analysis of timing closure challenges and constraints in Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) and Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs). We examine core timing principles, architectural distinctions, and design methodologies influencing timing behavior in both technologies. A case study comparing the Xilinx Kintex UltraScale+ FPGA (XCKU040) with a 7nm ASIC highlights practical timing analysis and performance trade-offs. Experimental results show ASICs achieve superior timing of 45ps setup and 35ps hold, while modern FPGAs remain competitive with 180ps setup and 120ps hold times, validating their suitability for high-performance designs.</description>

      <title>Descriptor-Based Object-Aware Memory Systems: A Comprehensive Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The security and efficiency of modern computing systems are fundamentally undermined by the absence of a native architectural mechanism to propagate high-level program semantics, such as object identity, bounds, and lifetime, across the hardware/software interface. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the architectural paradigm designed to bridge this semantic gap: descriptor-based, object-aware memory systems. By elevating the descriptor to a first-class architectural abstraction, this paradigm enables hardware to dynamically acquire and enforce the rich semantics of software-defined objects. This survey systematically charts the evolution and current landscape of this approach. We establish the foundational concepts of memory objects and descriptors and introduce a novel taxonomy of descriptor addressing modes, providing a structured framework for analyzing and comparing diverse implementations. Our unified analysis reveals how this paradigm holistically addresses the intertwined challenges of memory protection, management, and processing. As a culminating case study, we re-examine the CentroID model, demonstrating how its hybrid tagged-pointer encoding and descriptor processing mechanisms embody the path toward practical and efficient object-aware designs. Finally, we outline how the explicit cross-layer communication of object semantics provides a foundational research direction for next-generation cache hierarchies, unified virtual memory, and even 128-bit architectures.</description>

      <title>A Memory-Efficient Retrieval Architecture for RAG-Enabled Wearable Medical LLMs-Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With powerful and integrative large language models (LLMs), medical AI agents have demonstrated unique advantages in providing personalized medical consultations, continuous health monitoring, and precise treatment plans. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) integrates personal medical documents into LLMs by an external retrievable database to address the costly retraining or fine-tuning issues in deploying customized agents. While deploying medical agents in edge devices ensures privacy protection, RAG implementations impose substantial memory access and energy consumption during the retrieval stage. This paper presents a hierarchical retrieval architecture for edge RAG, leveraging a two-stage retrieval scheme that combines approximate retrieval for candidate set generation, followed by high-precision retrieval on pre-selected document embeddings. The proposed architecture significantly reduces energy consumption and external memory access while maintaining retrieval accuracy. Simulation results show that, under TSMC 28nm technology, the proposed hierarchical retrieval architecture has reduced the overall memory access by nearly 50% and the computation by 75% compared to pure INT8 retrieval, and the total energy consumption for 1 MB data retrieval is 177.76 {\mu}J/query.</description>

      <title>HPIM: Heterogeneous Processing-In-Memory-based Accelerator for Large Language Models Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12993v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The deployment of large language models (LLMs) presents significant challenges due to their enormous memory footprints, low arithmetic intensity, and stringent latency requirements, particularly during the autoregressive decoding stage. Traditional compute-centric accelerators, such as GPUs, suffer from severe resource underutilization and memory bandwidth bottlenecks in these memory-bound workloads. To overcome these fundamental limitations, we propose HPIM, the first memory-centric heterogeneous Processing-In-Memory (PIM) accelerator that integrates SRAM-PIM and HBM-PIM subsystems designed specifically for LLM inference. HPIM employs a software-hardware co-design approach that combines a specialized compiler framework with a heterogeneous hardware architecture. It intelligently partitions workloads based on their characteristics: latency-critical attention operations are mapped to the SRAM-PIM subsystem to exploit its ultra-low latency and high computational flexibility, while weight-intensive GEMV computations are assigned to the HBM-PIM subsystem to leverage its high internal bandwidth and large storage capacity. Furthermore, HPIM introduces a tightly coupled pipeline strategy across SRAM-PIM and HBM-PIM subsystems to maximize intra-token parallelism, thereby significantly mitigating serial dependency of the autoregressive decoding stage. Comprehensive evaluations using a cycle-accurate simulator demonstrate that HPIM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art accelerators, achieving a peak speedup of up to 22.8x compared to the NVIDIA A100 GPU. Moreover, HPIM exhibits superior performance over contemporary PIM-based accelerators, highlighting its potential as a highly practical and scalable solution for accelerating large-scale LLM inference.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Ultra-Low-Power $\mu$NPUs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22567v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficient on-device neural network (NN) inference offers predictable latency, improved privacy and reliability, and lower operating costs for vendors than cloud-based inference. This has sparked recent development of microcontroller-scale NN accelerators, also known as neural processing units ($\mu$NPUs), designed specifically for ultra-low-power applications. We present the first comparative evaluation of a number of commercially-available $\mu$NPUs, including the first independent benchmarks for multiple platforms. To ensure fairness, we develop and open-source a model compilation pipeline supporting consistent benchmarking of quantized models across diverse microcontroller hardware. Our resulting analysis uncovers both expected performance trends as well as surprising disparities between hardware specifications and actual performance, including certain $\mu$NPUs exhibiting unexpected scaling behaviors with model complexity. This work provides a foundation for ongoing evaluation of $\mu$NPU platforms, alongside offering practical insights for both hardware and software developers in this rapidly evolving space.</description>

      <title>SageAttention3: Microscaling FP4 Attention for Inference and An Exploration of 8-Bit Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11594v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The efficiency of attention is important due to its quadratic time complexity. We enhance the efficiency of attention through two key contributions: First, we leverage the new FP4 Tensor Cores in Blackwell GPUs to accelerate attention computation. Our implementation achieves 1038 TOPS on RTX5090, which is a 5x speedup over the fastest FlashAttention on RTX5090. Experiments show that our FP4 attention can accelerate inference of various models in a plug-and-play way. Second, we pioneer low-bit attention to training tasks. Existing low-bit attention works like FlashAttention3 and SageAttention focus only on inference. However, the efficiency of training large models is also important. To explore whether low-bit attention can be effectively applied to training tasks, we design an accurate and efficient 8-bit attention for both forward and backward propagation. Experiments indicate that 8-bit attention achieves lossless performance in fine-tuning tasks but exhibits slower convergence in pretraining tasks. The code is available at https://github.com/thu-ml/SageAttention.</description>

      <title>Detecting Anomalies in Machine Learning Infrastructure via Hardware Telemetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26008v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern machine learning (ML) has grown into a tightly coupled, full-stack ecosystem that combines hardware, software, network, and applications. Many users rely on cloud providers for elastic, isolated, and cost-efficient resources. Unfortunately, these platforms as a service use virtualization, which means operators have little insight into the users' workloads. This hinders resource optimizations by the operator, which is essential to ensure cost efficiency and minimize execution time. In this paper, we argue that workload knowledge is unnecessary for system-level optimization. We propose Reveal, which takes a hardware-centric approach, relying only on hardware signals - fully accessible by operators. Using low-level signals collected from the system, Reveal detects anomalies through an unsupervised learning pipeline. The pipeline is developed by analyzing over 30 popular ML models on various hardware platforms, ensuring adaptability to emerging workloads and unknown deployment patterns. Using Reveal, we successfully identified both network and system configuration issues, accelerating the DeepSeek model by 5.97%.</description>
