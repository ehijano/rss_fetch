      <title>Bottlenecking in graphs and a coarse Menger-type conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We expand upon the notion of bottlenecking introduced in our earlier work, characterizing a spectrum of graphs and showing this naturally extends to the concept of coarse bottlenecking. We examine how bottlenecking differs from other notions of connectedness. Notably we show how the notion of bottlenecking gives a natural coarse Menger-type conjecture, which is weaker than the Coarse Menger Conjecture of Georgakopoulos and Papasoglu that has recently been disproved by a counter example.</description>

      <title>On Constructions of Fractal Spaces Using Replacement and the Combinatorial Loewner Property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The combinatorial Loewner property was introduced by Bourdon and Kleiner as a quasismmetrically invariant substitute for the Loewner property for general fractals and boundaries of hyperbolic groups. While the Loewner property is somewhat restrictive, the combinatorial Loewner property is very generic -- Bourdon and Kleiner showed that many familiar fractals and group boundaries satisfy it. If $X$ is quasisymmetric to a Loewner space, it has the combinatorial Loewner property. Kleiner conjectured in 2006 that the converse to this holds for self-similar fractals -- the hope being that this would lead to the existence of many exotic Loewner spaces. We disprove this conjecture and give the first examples of spaces which are self-similar and combinatorially Loewner and which are not quasisymmetric to Loewner spaces.
  In the process we introduce a self-similar replacement rule, called a linear replacement rule, which is inspired by the work of Laakso. This produces a new rich class of fractal spaces, where closed form computations of potentials and their conformal dimensions are possible. These spaces exhibit a rich class of behaviors from analysis on fractals in regards to diffusions, Sobolev spaces, energy measures and conformal dimensions. These behaviors expand on the known examples of Cantor sets, gaskets, Vicsek sets, and the often too difficult carpet-like spaces. Especially the counter examples to Kleiner's conjecture that arise from this construction are interesting, since they open up the possibility to study the new realm of combinatorially Loewner spaces that are not quasisymmetric to Loewner spaces.</description>

      <title>Universal Differentiability Sets in Laakso Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that there exists a family of mutually singular doubling measures on Laakso space with respect to which real-valued Lipschitz functions are almost everywhere differentiable. This implies that there exists a measure zero universal differentiability set in Laakso space. Additionally, we show that each of the measures constructed supports a Poincar\'e inequality.</description>

      <title>The $L^1$-$L^\infty$-geometry of Teichm\"uller space -- Second order infinitesimal structures --</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $L^1$-$L^\infty$ geometry is the Finsler geometry of the Teichm\"uller space by the Teichm\"uller metric and the $L^1$-norm function of holomorphic quadratic differentials. In this paper, aiming to develop the $L^1$-$L^\infty$-geometry and the differential geometry on the Teichm\"uller space, we formulate the second order infinitesimal structures (the infinitesimal structures on the (co)tangent bundles) over the Teichm\"uller space. We will give model spaces of the second order infinitesimal spaces.
  By applying our formulation, we give affirmative answers to two folklore. We first show that the map from the space of holomorphic quadratic differentials to the tangent bundle defined by Teichm\"uller Beltrami differentials is a real-analytic diffeomorphism on every stratum in the space of holomorphic quadratic differentials. Second, we show that the Teichm\"uller metric is real-analytic on the image of each stratum. We also observe a new duality between the Teichm\"uller metric and the $L^1$-norm function at the infinitesimal level.</description>

      <title>Cycles in spherical Deligne complexes and application to $K(\pi,1)$-conjecture for Artin groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12068v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show the $K(\pi,1)$-conjecture holds for Artin groups whose Dynkin diagrams are complete bipartite (edge labels are allowed to be arbitrary), answering a question of J. McCammond. Along the way, we treat several related families of hyperbolic type Artin groups, namely the $K(\pi,1)$-conjecture holds for all 3-dimensional hyperbolic type Artin groups, except one single example with Dynkin diagram $[3,5,3]$; and the conjecture holds for all quasi-Lann\'er hyperbolic type Artin groups up to dimension 4. We also treat several higher dimensional families.
  Most of the article is about developing new methods of understanding combinatorial minimal fillings of certain types of cycles in spherical Deligne complexes or relative Artin complexes, via non-positive curvature geometry. Then we combine this with an approached to the $K(\pi,1)$-conjecture introduced by a previous article of the author to settle new cases of $K(\pi,1)$-conjecture.
  In the appendix we list some related open questions and conjectures.</description>

      <title>Ricci curvature bounds and rigidity for non-smooth Riemannian and semi-Riemannian metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06762v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study rigidity problems for Riemannian and semi-Riemannian manifolds with metrics of low regularity. Specifically, we prove a version of the Cheeger-Gromoll splitting theorem \cite{CheegerGromoll72splitting} for Riemannian metrics and the flatness criterion for semi-Riemannian metrics of regularity $C^1$. With our proof of the splitting theorem, we are able to obtain an isometry of higher regularity than the Lipschitz regularity guaranteed by the $\mathsf{RCD}$-splitting theorem \cite{gigli2013splitting, gigli2014splitoverview}. Along the way, we establish a Bochner-Weitzenb\"ock identity which permits both the non-smoothness of the metric and of the vector fields, complementing a recent similar result in \cite{mondino2024equivalence}. The last section of the article is dedicated to the discussion of various notions of Sobolev spaces in low regularity, as well as an alternative proof of the equivalence (see \cite{mondino2024equivalence}) between distributional Ricci curvature bounds and $\mathsf{RCD}$-type bounds, using in part the stability of the variable $\mathsf{CD}$-condition under suitable limits \cite{ketterer2017variableCD}.</description>
