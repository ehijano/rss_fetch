      <title>Some Applications and Limitations of Convex Optimization Hierarchies for Discrete and Continuous Optimization Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This thesis explores algorithmic applications and limitations of convex relaxation hierarchies for approximating some discrete and continuous optimization problems.
  - We show a dichotomy of approximability of constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) by linear programming (LP) relaxations: for every CSP, the approximation obtained by a basic LP relaxation, is no weaker than the approximation obtained using relaxations given by super-constant levels of the Sherali-Adams hierarchy on instances of size $n$.
  - For the problem of approximating the absolute maximum of an n-variate degree-d homogeneous polynomial f with real coefficients over the unit sphere, we analyze the optimum value of the level-t sum-of-squares (SoS) SDP relaxation of the problem. Our results offer a trade-off between the approximation ratio and running time, which can take advantage of additional structure in the polynomial, such as non-negativity or sparsity of the coefficients.
  - We study the problem of approximating the $p \to q$-norm of a matrix $A$, and prove the first NP-hardness result for approximating norms in the hypercontractive case $1&lt; p &lt; q &lt; \infty$. We also prove almost tight algorithmic results for the case when $p \geq q$ (with $2 \in [q,p]$) where constant factor approximations for the matrix norms are possible.
  A common theme for these results is their connection to geometry. For the discrete optimization problem of CSP, geometry appears as a crucial tool for our lower bound proof. For the problem of polynomial optimization, we show that SDPs capture and extend earlier algorithms based on diameter estimation for convex bodies. For the matrix (operator) norm problem, the definition itself is geometric in nature and embedding theorems play a crucial role in our proofs.</description>

      <title>Envy-Free Cake-Cutting for Four Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02075v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the envy-free cake-cutting problem we are given a resource, usually called a cake and represented as the $[0,1]$ interval, and a set of $n$ agents with heterogeneous preferences over pieces of the cake. The goal is to divide the cake among the $n$ agents such that no agent is envious of any other agent. Even under a very general preferences model, this fundamental fair division problem is known to always admit an exact solution where each agent obtains a connected piece of the cake; we study the complexity of finding an approximate solution, i.e., a connected $\varepsilon$-envy-free allocation.
  For monotone valuations of cake pieces, Deng, Qi, and Saberi (2012) gave an efficient ($\textsf{poly}(\log(1/\varepsilon))$ queries) algorithm for three agents and posed the open problem of four (or more) monotone agents. Even for the special case of additive valuations, Br\^anzei and Nisan (2022) conjectured an $\Omega(1/\varepsilon)$ lower bound on the number of queries for four agents. We provide the first efficient algorithm for finding a connected $\varepsilon$-envy-free allocation with four monotone agents.
  We also prove that as soon as valuations are allowed to be non-monotone, the problem becomes hard: it becomes PPAD-hard, requires $\textsf{poly}(1/\varepsilon)$ queries in the black-box model, and even $\textsf{poly}(1/\varepsilon)$ communication complexity. This constitutes, to the best of our knowledge, the first intractability result for any version of the cake-cutting problem in the communication complexity model.</description>

      <title>Symmetric powers: structure, smoothability, and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02754v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate border ranks of twisted powers of polynomials and smoothability of symmetric powers of algebras. We prove that the latter are smoothable. For the former, we obtain upper bounds for the border rank in general and prove that they are optimal under mild conditions. We give applications to complexity theory. Many of the results rest on the notion of an encompassing polynomial, which we introduce.</description>

      <title>Gap-preserving reductions and RE-completeness of independent set games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05253v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In complexity theory, gap-preserving reductions play a crucial role in studying hardness of approximation and in analyzing the relative complexity of multiprover interactive proof systems. In the quantum setting, multiprover interactive proof systems with entangled provers correspond to gapped promise problems for nonlocal games, and the recent result MIP$^*$=RE \cite{ji2020mipre} shows that these are in general undecidable. However, the relative complexity of problems within MIP$^*$ is still not well-understood, as establishing gap-preserving reductions in the quantum setting presents new challenges. In this paper, we introduce a framework to study such reductions and use it to establish MIP$^*$-completeness of the gapped promise problem for the natural class of independent set games. In such a game, the goal is to determine whether a given graph contains an independent set of a specified size. We construct families of independent set games with constant question size for which the gapped promise problem is undecidable. In contrast, the same problem is decidable in polynomial time in the classical setting. To carry out our reduction, we establish a new stability theorem, which could be of independent interest, allowing us to perturb families of almost PVMs to genuine PVMs.</description>
