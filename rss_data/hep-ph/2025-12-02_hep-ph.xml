      <title>Quark-Lepton Unification Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the collider signatures of the minimal framework for quark-lepton unification at a scale not far from the electroweak symmetry breaking scale. This theory predicts a rich spectrum of new fields, including one vector leptoquark, two scalar leptoquarks, a color-octet scalar, and an additional Higgs doublet. Neutrino masses are generated via the inverse seesaw mechanism, facilitating viable matter unification at the low scale. We find that this theory predicts that in many cases the dominant leptoquark decays are to the third generation Standard Model quarks and leptons. We identify key experimental signatures at the Large Hadron Collider, evaluate and discuss the limits from current measurements, and outline potential strategies for probing this theory in the near future.</description>

      <title>Cosmology of Gravi-Axions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show how a mass term for gravitational axions (''gravi-axions'') with a Chern-Simons coupling to gravity can naturally arise due to non-perturbative contributions from Euclidean wormholes, breaking the continuous shift symmetry of the standard theory. The induced mass can be generated in a cosmologically relevant range to be the dark matter or dark energy of the universe for a reasonable and well-motivated range of the symmetry breaking scale. Upon generating the gravi-axion mass term, we discuss the cosmology of the theory. We find that the gravi-axion can be produced to be the dominant dark matter component via misalignment or gravitational particle production, and that in a different regime, the gravi-axion can act as dynamical dark energy. We discuss gravi-axion decay into gravitons as a potential observational window for this theory. Finally, we find that, for late-time, astrophysical compact objects, cosmologically relevant gravi-axions behave as minimally-coupled, massive scalar fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.00156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute three-loop virtual corrections to the associated production of a Higgs boson with a $Z$ boson in the large-$m_t$ limit. We describe in detail the application of the asymptotic expansion and provide, for all form factors, analytic results for the first three terms in the $1/m_t$ expansion. We also provide numerical routines implemented in the C++ library ggxy.</description>

      <title>Widen the Resonance at Ultra-High Energies: Novel Probes of Neutrino Self-interactions in the High-Mass Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutrino self-interaction beyond the Standard Model is well motivated by the nonzero masses of neutrinos, which are the only known particles guaranteed to have new physics. Cosmic messengers, especially neutrinos, play a central role in probing new physics, as they provide experimental conditions far beyond the reach of laboratories and serve as the link between laboratory fundamental-physics discoveries and their roles in the Universe, where many new physics motivations originate. In this work, we propose a novel probe of neutrino self-interactions through ultra-high-energy neutrinos scattering off the cosmic neutrino background when the lightest neutrino species remains relativistic today. This allows us to ``Widen the Resonance'' of such scattering. Meanwhile, we also provide a semi-analytic framework for cosmogenic UHE neutrino production, avoiding computationally intensive simulations and yielding results precise enough for BSM studies. The widened resonance enables future ultrahigh-energy neutrino telescopes, in particular GRAND, to probe mediator masses from MeV to GeV, reaching couplings down to $g \sim 10^{-3}$ -- up to two orders of magnitude beyond current bounds. Our results enhance the discovery potential of $\nu$SI in the high-mass regime, potentially offering crucial insights into the connections between the neutrino sector and dark sector.</description>

      <title>Searching for Ultralight Dark Matter with MOLeQuTE: a Massive Optically Levitated Quantum Tabletop Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many well theoretically motivated models of ultralight dark matter are expected to give rise to feeble oscillatory forces on macroscopic objects. Optically trapped sensors have high force sensitivities but have remained relatively unexplored in this context. In this work we propose a new, tunable, optically trapped sensor specifically designed to detect such forces. Our design features a high-mass (mg) plate whose weight is supported by a vertical beam. We present the first systematic analysis and optimisation of quantum noises in optically trapped systems and show that our setup has the potential to operate at the standard quantum limit with current off-the-shelf technologies. We demonstrate that our sensor could offer unique access to large regions of uncharted parameter space of vector B-L dark matter, with projected sensitivities that could advance existing limits by several orders of magnitude over a broad range of frequencies.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the sensitivity to neutrino oscillation parameters using synergy between T2K, NO$\nu$A and JUNO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the impact of combining the present NO$\nu$A and T2K data with simulated data from the JUNO experiment on the determination of the leptonic CP phase and the neutrino mass hierarchy. The current NO$\nu$A data exhibit a hierarchy--$\delta_{\rm CP}$ degeneracy, admitting both normal hierarchy (NH) with $\delta_{\rm CP} \in [0,180^\circ]$, and inverted hierarchy (IH) with $\delta_{\rm CP} \in [180^\circ,360^\circ]$ solutions at comparable significance, while T2K prefers $\delta_{\rm CP}\simeq 270^\circ$ for both hierarchies, leading to a $2\sigma$ tension between the two experiments for normal hierarchy. Using detailed GLoBES simulations, we show that future JUNO data with excellent hierarchy sensitivity, can lift the hierarchy--$\delta_{\rm CP}$ degeneracy in NO$\nu$A and strengthen the hierarchy reach of T2K in spite of having no $\delta_{\rm CP}$ sensitivity. Allowing the hierarchy to be a free parameter in the fit, if the true ordering is IH, JUNO aligns the NO$\nu$A and T2K allowed regions and resolves their present tension; if NH is true, the tension continues to persist. We also show that JUNO's precise measurement of $|\Delta_{31}|$ leads to improved constraints on $\sin^2\theta_{23}$ and $\delta_{\rm CP}$ for normal mass hierarchy in NO$\nu$A even though JUNO itself is insensitive to these parameters. Finally, updated solar parameter measurements from JUNO's first data release further enhance the combined precision. Our results demonstrate that JUNO plays a crucial synergistic role in the global neutrino oscillation programme, enabling a more robust determination of the mass ordering and improving the sensitivity to the CP phase when combined with long-baseline data.</description>

      <title>Why Is Attention Sparse In Particle Transformer?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformer-based models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in jet tagging at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC), with the Particle Transformer (ParT) representing a leading example of such models. A striking feature of ParT is its sparse, nearly binary, attention structure, raising questions about the origin of this behavior and whether it encodes physically meaningful correlations. In this work, we investigate the source of ParT's sparse attention by comparing models trained on multiple benchmark datasets and examine the relative contributions of the attention term and the physics-inspired interaction matrix before softmax. We find that binary sparsity arises primarily from the attention mechanism itself, with the interaction matrix playing a secondary role. Moreove, we show that ParT is able to identify key jet substructure elements, such as leptons in semileptonic top decays, even without explicit particle identification inputs. These results provide new insight into the interpretability of transformer-based jet taggers and clarify the conditions under which sparse attention patterns emerge in ParT.</description>

      <title>Gravitational form factors of the baryon octet in holographic QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gravitational form factors (GFFs) of the baryon octet, including hyperons, are investigated in a bottom-up holographic QCD model that explicitly incorporates the SU(3) flavor symmetry breaking through the strange quark mass. We fit the model parameters to reproduce the empirical masses of the baryon octet and examine the dependence of GFFs on the probe momentum. Our numerical results show distinct differences in the GFFs across the baryon octet. The computed GFFs are found to be in reasonable agreement with available lattice QCD results for the non-strange/nucleon sector. We also calculate the gravitational radii of the baryon octet and find that they decrease with increasing strangeness, indicating that heavier hyperons are more compact.</description>

      <title>Strong Decays of the Light Exotic $0^{+-}$ and $2^{+-}$ Hybrid Mesons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A model of hybrid meson structure based on the QCD Hamiltonian in Coulomb gauge and the use of a single constituent quasigluon is applied compute hadronic decays of mesons with exotic quantum numbers, $0^{+-}$ and $2^{+-}$. These correspond to hybrid mesons in which the gluon couples to a $q\bar{q}$ pair in an $P$-wave and can therefore be identified as orbital excitations of the exotic $1^{-+}$ state. Interestingly, we find $0^{+-}$ states to be narrow, contrary to what was found by previous calculations. This is primarily due to the suppression of the decay mode $0^{+-}\rightarrow 2^1S_0+1^1S_0$, which is unique to our model. The $2^{+-}$ states are found to be narrow, as expected.</description>

      <title>QCD corrections to charged-current decays with Heavy Sterile Neutrinos in initial or final state and their impact on $\tau$ decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Searches for a Heavy Sterile Neutrino $N$ profit from precise predictions of inclusive decay rates, entering predictions for branching fractions and lifetime. Once decay channels into semi-hadronic final states are open, a reliable calculation of inclusive decay rates is only possible if $N$ is heavy enough to permit a perturbative calculation. We adopt the scenario in which $N$ only interacts with SM particles through $N$-$\nu_\ell$ mixing, where $\ell=e,\mu,\tau$. Using literature results for $W$ boson correlators calculated to $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^4)$, we study the quality of the perturbation series for $N\to \ell +\mbox{hadrons}$ to determine mass ranges for which inclusive decay widths can be predicted robustly. We present novel analytic results for the decay rate $N\to \tau +\mbox{hadrons}$ in terms of $m_\tau/m_N$. Our expressions equally apply to $\tau \to N +\mbox{hadrons}$, perturbatively calculable for $m_N\lesssim 600\,$MeV. Applying our result to the $\tau$ lifetime, we determine the allowed parameter space for the $N$-$\nu_\tau$ mixing angle $\theta$ and $m_N$. We find $|\sin\theta| \leq 0.2 $ for $m_N=600\,$MeV and weaker bounds for a lighter $N$. For $m_N\geq m_{\tau}$ we find constraints from the dependence of $\tau$ decay rates on $\cos\theta$. Combining $\tau \to \pi^- \nu_\tau$ and $\tau \to K^- \nu_\tau$ data gives $|\sin\theta| = (9.09 \pm 3.56) \cdot 10^{-2}$ while $N$-$\nu_\tau$ mixing does not improve the agreement between theory and data for $\tau \to \ell \bar\nu_\ell \nu_\tau $. We find current data for the decay rate $\Gamma(\tau \to \ell+\mbox{nothing})$ about 1$\sigma$ above the SM prediction for $\Gamma(\tau \to \ell \bar\nu_\ell \nu_\tau)$, which leads to useful constraints on $\Gamma(\tau \to \ell X_{\mathrm{dark}})$ with dark-sector particles $X_{\mathrm{dark}}$ and might stimulate additional experimental effort on $\tau \to \ell+\mbox{nothing}$.</description>

      <title>Dispersive analysis of the $J/\psi\to\pi^0 \gamma^\ast$ transition form factor with $\rho$-$\omega$ mixing effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the discrepancies noted recently between the theoretical predictions of the electromagnetic $J/\psi \to \pi^0 \gamma^*$ transition form factor and the BESIII data, we reanalyze this transition form factor using the dispersive Khuri-Treiman equations, with final-state interactions in both the direct channel and the crossed channels properly considered. This improved framework incorporates $\rho$-$\omega$ mixing effects. The effect of four-pion states is evaluated through a dispersively improved vector-meson-dominance model. From this information, we propose a two-parameter fit that provides an excellent description of the BESIII data over the broad energy range from 0 to 2.8 GeV. We demonstrate that the $\rho\pi^0$ decay mode of the $J/\psi$ is dominated by strong interaction, while the $\omega\pi^0$ mode is dominated by one-photon exchange. From this, we extract the relative phase between the strong and the one-virtual-photon (electromagnetic) modes in hadronic decays of $J/\psi$ as $(62 \pm 21)^{\circ}$. This could provide useful information in understanding the long-standing $\rho \pi$ puzzle in $J/\psi$ decays.</description>

      <title>Exploring Background Contributions in $H \to Z \gamma$ Decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rare decay $H \to Z\gamma$ has been investigated by both the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations, with each reporting an excess in Run~2 in 2023 characterized by $\mu = 2.2 \pm 0.7$. This anomaly was initially attributed to possible modifications of the $HZ\gamma$ vertex. However, because the $H \to Z\gamma$ signal is reconstructed via the $H \to \ell\ell\gamma$ channel, background effects -- particularly those from processes that mimic the same final state -- may have been underestimated. In this work, we re-examine these backgrounds in detail and propose that the observed excess could be explained by an additional BSM-induced contribution. We present both an effective field theory framework and a UV-complete model that provide the necessary rates and a consistent interpretation of the data. The proposed model reproduces the newest ATLAS result, $\mu = 1.3^{+0.6}_{-0.5}$, obtained using a narrower dilepton invariant-mass window.</description>

      <title>Closepacking effects on strangeness and baryon production at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data from the LHC show a rise in strange-hadron production with charged-particle multiplicity in pp collisions. The Monte-Carlo event generator PYTHIA, using its default Monash tune, instead predicts constant strangeness. We investigate a mechanism invoked during hadronization called string closepacking, where overlapping strings generate a background field, here assumed to be predominantly aligned with the beam axis. This increases the effective string tension with rapidity, reducing strangeness suppression and thus enhancing strangeness production. We tune this model to LHC data and contrast it with several alternatives. We comment specifically on the challenge of simultaneously describing the strangeness data and the non-strange p/pi ratio, and introduce a mechanism which may act to suppress the latter. Many of the salient particle-production ratios can be qualitatively described by this model, although the XiC/D ratio and the shape of pT spectra remain challenging to account for.</description>

      <title>Probing a minimal dark gauge sector via microlensing of compact dark objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a minimal Dark Standard Model (DSM) consisting of a single spin-0 particle with dark $U(1)$ gauge symmetry, and completely decoupled from the visible sector. Characterized only by the scalar mass $\mu$ and the dark charge $q$, this framework naturally gives rise to a rich phenomenology, including stable solitonic configurations that behave as dark "mini-MACHOs". We numerically build and evolve these gauged scalar-field solitons, derive their mass-radius relations, and identify a critical charge beyond which no gravitationally bound configurations exist. By combining these results with microlensing surveys that exclude compact objects heavier than the asteroid-mass scale ($M\lesssim 10^{-11}M_\odot$), we obtain the constraint $\mu\gtrsim 10\,\rm eV$ for viable configurations, depending on $q$. Our results represent a step forward in showing that purely gravitational observations can constrain the internal parameters of a dark gauge sector, and provide a framework for exploring broader DSM scenarios through future probes such as gravitational wave detections.</description>

Abstract: The Standard Model of particle physics is built on the principle of local gauge symmetry. This work provides a pedagogical introduction for advanced undergraduates by using quantum electrodynamics (QED) as the simplest example of a gauge theory. Beginning with the Lagrangian formulation of classical mechanics, special relativity, and basic quantum mechanics, we develop classical field theory, reformulate electromagnetism in covariant form, introduce the Dirac equation for spin 1/2 particles, and finally arrive at the gauge principle. By showing how the requirement of local U(1) invariance leads naturally to the electromagnetic interaction, we illustrate the essential logic behind gauge theories and highlight the conceptual structure that underlies the Standard Model Lagrangian.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Dirac fermion: A source of neutrino mass and dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutral vectorlike fermion as inspired by unified theories might become quasi-Dirac states at TeV due to a violation in lepton-like symmetry. It is shown that such quasi-Dirac fermions can properly achieve radiative neutrino mass generation and dark matter stability. Indeed, the small splitting of quasi-Dirac masses, i.e. $\Delta M/M\ll 1$, suitably suppresses neutrino mass to be small in order to allow dark matter annihilation and detection to be appropriate to experiment as well as charged lepton flavor violation limit.</description>

      <title>The QCD Scale Parameter from the Photon Structure Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photon structure function has been a solid platform in testing strong interaction along with nucleon structure function. Strong Interaction has the property that it is perturbatively calculable at high energy but becomes non-perturbative at low energy. This nature makes QCD hard to handle theoretically in factorizing these two regions. The fundamental dimensional parameter, so called the QCD scale parameter, $\Lambda_{\overline{\textrm{MS}}}$, is one of key players to factorize two energy regions. In this work, we extract the QCD scale parameter from the photon structure function by separating the perturbative QCD and non-perturbative QCD. In the process we use the vector dominance model for the non-perturbative energy region of the photon structure function.</description>

      <title>Exotic $T_{c\bar s0}^a(2900)^0$ and $T_{c\bar s0}^a(2900)^{++}$ States in Born-Oppenheimer Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ Born-Oppenheimer approximation to the $T_{c\bar s0}^a(2900)^0$ and $T_{c\bar s0}^a(2900)^{++}$ states observed by the LHCb Collaboration and study mass spectrum and root-mean-square radius values. For this purpose, we use dynamical diquark model. We assume that strange quark is a heavy for the usage of Born-Oppenheimer approximation. Our results strongly indicate that the $T_{c\overline{s}0}^{a}(2900)$ states are best described as composed of axial-vector (spin-1) diquark pairs. Furthermore, the calculated root-mean-square radius, $\langle r^{2}\rangle^{1/2} \approx 0.70-0.80$ fm, which is significantly less than 1 fm, provides compelling evidence that these are compact tetraquarks rather than loosely bound hadronic molecules.</description>

      <title>Method to measure quarkonium wave function using $B_c$ decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a method that enables a direct experimental probe of the quarkonium wave function defined in potential nonrelativistic QCD (pNRQCD) using the three-body decay of the $B_c$ meson. We show that the momentum distribution of the spectator $c$-quark in the partonic decay is proportional to the absolute square of the momentum-space wave function of the $B_c$ state. It would provide, for the first time, an experimentally accessible probe of the quarkonium wave function.</description>

      <title>Lorentz violation and momentum-space geometric phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geometric phases can manifest when a relativistic quantum particle moves cyclically along a loop in parameter space. The phase can be affected by the presence of a background field and can be accompanied by nontrivial topological features. The appearance of adiabatic geometric phases in momentum space is demonstrated for a Lorentz-violating Weyl fermion, where the role of the background is played by the coefficients for Lorentz violation. As explicit examples, the Berry curvature and the first Chern number are derived for two cases with large Lorentz violation, one incorporating CPT violation and one preserving CPT symmetry. Some alternative topological invariants are also obtained. In certain scenarios with large Lorentz violation, the physical vacuum is associated with a topological phase.</description>

      <title>Linear realization of SU(3) parity doublet model for octet baryons with bad diquark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a linear $SU(3)_L \times SU(3)_R$ parity doublet model for octet baryons. Our model employs the $(3,\bar{3}) + (\bar{3},3)$ and $(3,6) + (6,3)$ chiral representations while excluding the $(8,1) + (1,8)$ representation. Through systematic analysis, we demonstrate that the $(3,6) + (6,3)$ representation containing symmetric ``bad'' diquarks, despite being energetically disfavored, is essential for reproducing the correct baryon mass hierarchy, particularly the $\Sigma$$\Xi$ mass ordering. The model incorporates both spontaneous and explicit chiral symmetry breaking, with the latter implemented through bare quark mass terms that properly account for $SU(3)$ flavor breaking effects. Our numerical analysis successfully reproduces the ground-state octet baryon masses and predicts the spectrum of excited states up to 2.5 GeV. For the experimentally challenging $\Xi$ sector, we provide specific predictions for spin-parity assignments: identifying $\Xi(1950)$ as the first positive-parity excitation. The analysis reveals that ground states are dominated by the $(3,\bar{3}) + (\bar{3},3)$ representation, consistent with the preference for ``good'' diquark configurations, while the $(3,6) + (6,3)$ contribution remains crucial for the mass spectrum.</description>

      <title>Analysis of $H \to J/\psi+\gamma$ up to Next-to-Next-to-Leading Order QCD Corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rare exclusive decay of the Higgs boson $H \to J/\psi + \gamma$ is an important channel for measuring the Yukawa coupling of the charm quark. In this article, we analyze the process by employing the Principle of Maximum Conformality (PMC) up to the next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in QCD. Conventional scale setting leads to theoretical predictions affected by errors dominated by renormalization scale uncertainty. The PMC provides a systematic method to eliminate this renormalization scale uncertainty by resumming non-conformal $\beta$ contributions into the QCD running coupling via renormalization group equation (RGE). We obtain a PMC scale result of $Q_\star = 3.29\ \text{GeV}$, which reflects the low virtuality of the underlying QCD dynamics for the $H \to J/\psi + \gamma$ process. In fact, this is an order of magnitude smaller than the guessed scale using the conventional method, i.e., $\mu_r = m_H/2$. By removing non-conformal $\{\beta_i\}$-terms from the perturbative QCD (pQCD) series, the PMC eliminates renormalization scale uncertainty. Comparing results, we find that the PMC NLO QCD correction term is significantly enhanced, while the PMC NNLO QCD correction is suppressed. This indicates improved convergence of the pQCD series up to NNLO. Finally, we determine the decay width $\Gamma(H \to J/\psi + \gamma) = 14.183^{+0.249}_{-0.347} \pm 0.022$ eV, where the first error arises from the factorization scale $\mu_\Lambda \in [1, 2]\ \text{GeV}$, and the second error from estimating unknown higher-order terms using the Pade approximant approach. The corresponding branching fraction is $\mathcal{B}(H \to J/\psi + \gamma) = 3.485_{-0.161}^{+0.152} \times 10^{-6}$.</description>

      <title>Effect of super-Gaussian pulse shape on pair production in chirped electric field with spatial inhomogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pair production in spatially inhomogeneous chirped electric fields with super-Gaussian pulse shape is investigated using the Dirac-Heisenberg-Wigner formalism, and the effect of super-Gaussian pulse shapes on the reduced momentum spectrum and the reduced total yield of created particles is mainly concerned. It is found that with the variation of the super-Gaussian envelope exponent, the momentum spectrum exhibits the more pronounced oscillations, shifting and broadening. The total yield of created particles increases monotonically with the increase of the super-Gaussian envelope exponent in the high-frequency fields with small chirp and low-frequency fields with any chirp. Meanwhile, the total yield of created particles under the super-Gaussian pulse electric fields is approximately twice that produced with the usual Gaussian pulse envelope. These results can provide theoretical guidance for optimizing the form of external field to enhance the vacuum pair production rate.</description>

      <title>A Coupled Source Description of Pseudorapidity Distributions from RHIC to LHC: Emergent $1/\mu_B$ Scaling and Limiting Fragmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the most remarkable observations in heavy-ion collisions is the systematic regularity exhibited by pseudorapidity distributions of charged particles across collision energies. While single-source models fail at higher energies and independent multi-source approaches do not reproduce the central dip observed at LHC energies, a unified description across the full RHIC-LHC energy range remains elusive. These distributions from Au+Au collisions at RHIC ($\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 19.6--200 GeV) and Pb+Pb collisions at LHC ($\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 2.76--5.36 TeV) are analyzed using a novel parametrization based on coupled Gaussian sources where the interaction strength is quantified by parameter $\lambda$. This coupled two-source model captures the interaction between forward and backward sources through the medium formed in the collision. Remarkably, $\lambda$ exhibits empirical scaling behavior resembling $1/\mu_B$, suggesting sensitivity to baryon stopping and the strongly-interacting medium. All fitting parameters follow systematic energy trends, with the peak-to-peak distance and chemical freeze-out temperature exhibiting identical exponential saturation patterns, indicating that geometric expansion and thermal evolution share a common underlying dynamics governed by QCD phase structure. Furthermore, the approach naturally preserves limiting fragmentation behavior across all energies, in contrast to independent source models that suggest its violation at LHC energies. Although the theoretical basis requires further investigation, these empirical correlations successfully unify charged particle production across nearly two orders of magnitude in collision energy, revealing fundamental connections to underlying collision dynamics.</description>

Abstract: We propose a resonant annihilation as a way to reconcile the WIMP annihilation cross sections in a recently reported gamma ray signal from the Milky Way halo with that for the freeze-out and the upper limit from dwarf galaxies. We perform a simple model-independent analysis based on this hypothesis and determine the required parameters. We also present a simple particle-physics model that can accommodate them.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: After more than a decade from its discovery, the Higgs boson remains at the centre of the particle physics programme. While its couplings to vector bosons and third-generation fermions have been measured with impressive precision, the structure of the Higgs potential, the self-couplings, and the interactions with first- and second-generation fermions are still poorly constrained. This contribution summarises recent theoretical progress in precision predictions in Higgs physics, the interpretation of these results in Effective Field Theories (EFTs), and the current and future prospects to probe light Yukawa couplings at the LHC and beyond.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In light of recent high-precision data taken by the BESIII Collaboration, we reconsider the dipion transition $\psi(3686) \rightarrow J/\psi \pi^+\pi^-$. The strong pion-pion final-state interactions are taken into account model-independently by using dispersion theory. We find that we can reproduce the substructure near the $\pi^+\pi^-$ threshold observed experimentally without introducing an extra resonance state. While a helicity-flip amplitude plays an important role for the formation of the dip in the invariant-mass distribution, virtual exchange of the charmoniumlike exotic $Z_c(3900)$ state improves the fit quality significantly.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measuring the electron neutrino mass is a long-standing objective and requires a high energy resolution of certain $\beta$-decay experiments, as well as a visible cosmic neutrino background ($C{\nu}B$) spectrum. Many quantum mechanical and chemical effects could potentially impair the required resolution/visibility, e.g., the Coulomb interactions between the electrons in the \b{eta}-decaying impurity and in the solid-state environment. We analyze the effect when hybridization is suppressed completely using a dielectric spacer, and also when hybridization is present up to the lowest nontrivial order in perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Refinement of an Analytical Holographic Model for the QCD Phase Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using (2+1)-flavor lattice QCD data, we refine the parameters of an analytical holographic model via gradient descent optimization to precisely locate the critical endpoint in the $T-\mu$ plane. Specifically, we calibrate the model using input data for the speed of sound at $\mu_B = 0$, the second-order baryon number susceptibility $\chi^B_2$, and the baryon number density at $\mu_B/T = 1$. With these parameters fixed, we calculate pressure and energy density versus temperature at small chemical potentials and compare the results with lattice QCD data using Taylor expansion techniques. This comparison validates the robustness of our model upon extension to finite chemical potentials, as the results show broad consistency with lattice QCD data in this regime. Finally, we employ the calibrated model to determine the coordinates of the critical endpoint in the $T-\mu_B$ plane, finding it located at $(\mu_B = 0.678 \, \rm{GeV}, T = 0.110 \, \rm{GeV})$</description>

      <title>PrecisionSM: an annotated database for low-energy $e^+e^-$ hadronic cross sections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: PrecisionSM is an annotated database that compiles the available data on low-energy cross sections of electron-positron collisions into hadronic channels. This database organizes and collects data samples from $e^+e^-$ experiments, which are used as input for the data-driven theoretical evaluation of the muon anomalous magnetic moment, $a_{\mu}$, serving as a precise test of the Standard Model when compared to the experimental measurements of $a_{\mu}$. The database is accessible through a custom website (https://precision-sm.github.io) which contains details about the data samples, such as the treatment of radiative corrections, as well as links to papers on INSPIRE-HEP and to tables on HEPData. The PrecisionSM database was developed within a Joint Research Initiative in the group application of the European hadron physics community, STRONG2020, and is now incorporated into the RadioMonteCarLow2 Working Group (RMCL2 WG) activities, which have the more general goal of improving the theoretical description of scattering processes at $e^+e^-$ colliders. The results of Phase I of the new RMCL2 WG have been published in Aliberti et al, arXiv:hep-ph/2410.22882. In this proceeding, we will report on the status of the PrecisionSM database, which currently contains a list of the dominant $2\pi$ channel as well as $3\pi$ and $\pi^0\gamma$, and on the ongoing work for the other channels and for responsive plots.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we use neutrino masses as a probe of the neutrino-light-quark effective scalar interactions. It is found that neutrinos can acquire masses not only from the usual light quark loop corrections but also from the light quark condensates. The latter contribution has been overlooked in the literature. We show that both contributions are comparable for operators involving $u$ and $d$ quarks, while quark loop corrections dominate for operators involving the $s$ quark. Using the low-energy effective field theory extended with light right-handed neutrinos and matching to chiral perturbation theory, we systematically analyze these contributions, deriving constraints on the corresponding Wilson coefficients from neutrino mass bounds, coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering, and light pseudoscalar meson invisible decays. Our analysis shows that electron neutrino mass measurements provide the most stringent constraints on these scalar couplings, significantly improving upon limits from other observables. The results highlight the importance of including both perturbative and nonperturbative contributions in complete phenomenological analyses of neutrino mass generation mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Towards Precision Gluon Densities at Small $x$: From Resummation to Collider Observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate gluon densities at small $x$ are essential for reducing theoretical uncertainties in collider predictions, yet remain one of the least constrained ingredients in global analyses. We report recent advances in the resummation of small-$x$ logarithms in the gluon sector, focusing on collinear distributions and their interplay with transverse-momentum-dependent formulations. Particular attention is paid to the impact of gluon-proton spin correlations and to the emergence of unintegrated gluon densities derived from resummed dynamics. These developments aim to fill the current precision gap in the small-$x$ region and enable robust applications to LHC and future-collider observables.</description>

      <title>Bayesian inference on Calabi--Yau moduli spaces and the axiverse: experimental data meets string theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop tools of Bayesian inference on the moduli space of Calabi--Yau (CY) manifolds. We sample from the invariant Weil--Petersson (WP) measure using Markov Chain Monte Carlo and normalising flows on \Kahler moduli space with dimension up to $h^{1,1}=30$, and present results on the spectrum of the CY volume and properties of divisors when the measure is restricted in physically meaningful ways. We furthermore present a theory-informed prior on axion masses and decay constants $(m_a,f_a)$ marginalised over the WP measure for all inequivalent CYs constructable from the Kreuzer--Skarke database with $h^{1,1}\leq 5$. We then impose likelihoods based on axion physics. We demonstrate how detection of a relatively heavy QCD axion at small $h^{1,1}$, e.g. by ADMX, provides detailed information about CY geometry and topology. Finally, we compute a full forward model incorporating likelihoods from the cosmic microwave background and Lyman-alpha forest and find the maximum posterior probability region on the moduli space of a given CY favoured by a resolution of the tension in these data by an ultralight axion composing $\mathcal{O}(1\%)$ of the dark matter. This demonstration serves as a blueprint for future statistical analyses within string phenomenology.</description>

      <title>A Bootstrap Study of Confinement in AdS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.00150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Yang-Mills theory in AdS$_{4}$ with Dirichlet boundary conditions is expected to undergo a transition as the AdS radius varies, since the boundary data is incompatible with confinement in flat space. Various mechanisms have been proposed for the disappearance of the Dirichlet boundary condition. From the boundary viewpoint, the associated $3d$ CFT is a deformation of a generalised free theory of non-Abelian conserved currents, with the deformation governed by the bulk gauge coupling. We test these scenarios by deriving non-perturbative constraints from the numerical conformal bootstrap of the four-point function of non-Abelian conserved currents. We rule out the scenario in which the boundary current decouples. Bounds on the lightest scalar operators disfavour a bulk Higgs mechanism and instead point to a transition driven by a scalar singlet becoming marginal. We also obtain bounds on other scalar operators and on the current central charge, and we refine character-based techniques incorporating parity and charge-conjugation symmetry to determine the operator spectrum of the $3d$ Generalised Free Vector theory. These results may be of independent interest beyond Yang-Mills theory in AdS.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Heating from Dark Compact Objects and Axion Minihalos: Implications for the 21-cm Signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The temperature of baryons at the end of the cosmic dark ages can be inferred from observations of the 21-cm hyperfine transition in neutral hydrogen. Any energy injection from the dark sector can therefore be detected through these measurements. Dark compact objects and dark-matter substructures can modify the baryon temperature by transferring heat via dynamical friction. In this work, we evaluate the prospects for detecting dynamical friction-induced heating from dark compact objects with a mass in the range $10^2 M_{\odot}$ to $10^5 M_{\odot}$, as well as from axion minihalos, using upcoming 21-cm experiments. We find that both the 21-cm global signal and power-spectrum measurements will be sensitive to dark compact objects that constitute about 10% of the dark matter, and will substantially improve our sensitivity to axion-like particles with masses in the range $10^{-18}$ eV to $10^{-9}$ eV.</description>

      <title>Cross-Geometry Transfer Learning in Fast Electromagnetic Shower Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate particle shower simulation remains a critical computational bottleneck for high-energy physics. Traditional Monte Carlo methods, such as Geant4, are computationally prohibitive, while existing machine learning surrogates are tied to specific detector geometries and require complete retraining for each design change or alternative detector. We present a transfer learning framework for generative calorimeter simulation models that enables adaptation across diverse geometries with high data efficiency. Using point cloud representations and pre-training on the International Large Detector detector, our approach handles new configurations without re-voxelizing showers for each geometry. On the CaloChallenge dataset, transfer learning with only 100 target-domain samples achieves a $44\%$ improvement on the geometric mean of Wasserstein distance over training from scratch. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning with bias-only adaptation achieves competitive performance while updating only $17\%$ of model parameters. Our analysis provides insight into adaptation mechanisms for particle shower development, establishing a baseline for future progress of point cloud approaches in calorimeter simulation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.00660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We summarize recent results of the observations of high (1 TeV-100 PeV) and ultrahigh ($\geq 100$ PeV) energy neutrinos, including the detection of a diffuse cosmic high-energy neutrino background, the identification of the first neutrino source candidates, and the observation of high-energy neutrinos from the Galactic plane. These findings open a new window to the universe by enabling the use of neutrinos to probe the cosmos that are otherwise inaccessible via photons. Although the origins of most detected neutrinos remain uncertain, we highlight several distinctive features of their sources that have emerged from current observations.</description>

      <title>A Review on Intense Electromagnetic Fields in Heavy-Ion Collisions: Theoretical Predictions and Experimental Results</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.00739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In heavy-ion collisions at relativistic energies, the incident nuclei travel at nearly the speed of light. These collisions deposit kinetic energy into the overlap region and create a high-temperature environment where hadrons ``melt'' into deconfined quarks and gluons. The spectator nucleons, which do not undergo scatterings, generate an ultra-intense electromagnetic field -- on the order of $10^{18}$ Gauss at Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider, and $10^{19}$ Gauss at the Large Hadron Collider. These powerful electromagnetic fields have a significant impact on the produced particles, not only complicating the study of particle interactions but also inducing novel physical phenomena. To explore the nature of these fields and their interactions with deconfined quarks, we provide a detailed overview, encompassing theoretical estimations of their generation and evolution, as well as experimental efforts to detect them. We also provide physical interpretations of the discovered results and discuss potential directions for future investigations.</description>

      <title>Probing the three-body force in hadronic systems with specific charge parity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Three-body forces, as a type of non-perturbative strong interaction, are widely discussed in studies of nuclear properties. However, whether their inclusion is necessary in nuclear systems remains a topic of intense debate. In this letter, we propose that the existence of three-body forces in certain three-body hadronic systems with definite $C$ parity is certain. Such systems consist of two components whose interactions are mediated by three-body forces a mechanism not easily realized in conventional three-nucleon systems. We investigate two specific three-body hadronic systems, $\bar{D}_sDK$ and $\bar{D}^*D\eta$, using contact-range potentials. The two-body hadron-hadron interactions are constrained by reproducing their scattering lengths, while the three-body couplings are constrained by charge symmetry. Our results indicate that three-body forces play a minor role in binding the $J^{PC}=0^{--}$ $\bar{D}_sDK$ system, but a crucial one in binding the $J^{PC}=1^{-+}$ $\bar{D}^*D\eta$ system. In fact, three-body forces determine whether $\bar{D} ^*D\eta$ forms a bound state, making this system a promising candidate for exploring three-body forces in hadronic physics.</description>

      <title>Fermi-liquid view of viscosity in cold and dense nucleon matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a framework to calculate transport properties in cold, dense relativistic quasiparticle system within the Fermi-liquid theory at the mean-field level. Building on our previous study [Phys. Rev. C 111, 044904 (2025)], we start from the linearized relativistic Boltzmann equation tailored to quasiparticles with medium-dependent dispersion relation and implement Landau matching conditions, proving that the bulk viscosity is manifestly nonnegative. A low-temperature expansion then yields leading-order ($T/\mu^*$) expressions for the shear ($\eta$) and bulk ($\zeta$) viscosities, where the behavior $\zeta/\eta \propto (T/\mu^*)^4$ in the degenerate regime is found to be robust against quasiparticle mass correction. We couple the kinetic framework to a Walecka-type mean-field equation of state and compute $\eta$ and $\zeta$ for cold, dense nucleon matter. The transport properties of nucleonic matter in the degenerate regime can be relevant for intermediate beam-energy nuclear experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Wigner function is a well-known phase space distribution function with many applications in quantum mechanics. In this article, we consider an open quantum system consisting of a non-relativistic single particle interacting with a general, possibly relativistic environment. For this system, we derive an expression for directly computing the time-dependent Wigner function from its initial values. This result renders time-dependent Wigner functions more applicable without having to make additional approximations that would otherwise be required in order to solve the corresponding equation of motion. As an illustration of our findings, we discuss the example of a non-relativistic single scalar particle interacting via a Yukawa interaction with an environment comprising another type of scalar field that is treated relativistically.</description>

      <title>Nuclear modification of heavy flavor decayed dielectrons in relativistic heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dielectrons from heavy flavor hadron decays not only constitute a crucial background to their thermal spectrum in high-energy nuclear collisions, from which the temperature of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) is extracted, but also provide a valuable probe of heavy quark interactions with the QGP. Using a linear Boltzmann transport (LBT) model to describe heavy quark evolution inside the QGP and a hybrid fragmentation-coalescence model for their hadronization, we find heavy quark energy loss softens the invariant mass spectrum of their decayed dielectrons and yields a higher value of the extracted QGP temperature, while coalescence hardens the spectrum and yields a lower value. Taking into account full medium effects leads to higher values of the extracted temperature than using vacuum baselines of heavy flavor decayed dielectrons in analyzing the experimental data. In addition, we find the angular correlations between dielectron pairs are sensitive to heavy quark interactions with the QGP: the radial flow of the QGP enhances the near-side correlations, and scatterings between heavy quarks and the QGP broaden the away-side correlations, with elastic and string interactions playing a dominant role.</description>

      <title>Quantum computing applications in High Energy Physics: clustering, integration and generative models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This PhD thesis explores the potential of quantum computing to address computational challenges in high-energy physics (HEP). As the Standard Model (SM) leaves key questions unanswered and no signs of new physics have emerged since the Higgs boson discovery, advanced experimental and computational tools become necessary. Quantum computing offers a promising alternative to classical methods, and this work investigates three main avenues where quantum algorithms can be useful in HEP research. First, we develop quantum subroutines for computing Minkowski distances and identifying maximum values in unsorted data, inserting them into clustering algorithms such as $k$-means, Affinity Propagation, and $k_T$-jet clustering. These quantum algorithms match classical performance while offering theoretical advantages when implemented on quantum hardware with qRAM. Then, we introduce a novel quantum Monte Carlo integrator, Quantum Fourier Iterative Amplitude Estimation (QFIAE), which combines a quantum neural network with amplitude estimation to integrate multivariate functions. QFIAE is executed on simulators and real quantum computers to evaluate Feynman loop integrals via Loop-Tree Duality, and is extended to compute (partially on hardware) a physical observable at NLO in perturbative quantum field theory. Finally, we present Quantum Chebyshev Probabilistic Models (QCPMs) for modeling multivariate distributions, applying them to fragmentation functions of partons fragmenting into kaons and pions. These models demonstrate accurate generative and interpolation capabilities. We also show how entanglement between variables plays a key role in training, enhancing model accuracy. Overall, these results show how quantum algorithms can already tackle relevant HEP problems on current hardware, while paving the way for future fault-tolerant applications that fully exploit quantum computational advantages.</description>

      <title>Analytical Emulator for the Baryon EoM inside the Fuzzy Dark Matter Soliton from Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An empirical baryon density profile can be included in the Schr\"odinger-Poisson (SP) equations to influence the fuzzy dark matter (FDM) soliton formation. However, to probe the effects of baryon on the other dynamical evolutions of the FDM soliton, its equation of motion (EoM) inside the corresponding FDM soliton is needed. In this paper, given an empirical baryon density profile, we first provide the cylinderical symmetric FDM soliton solution about the FDM density and the total potential of FDM and baryon. Then, we build an analytical baryon EoM from the obtained FDM density and total potential by machine learning. Finally, we check that this baryon EoM works as well as an empirical baryon density profile for the FDM soliton formation, with the fractional errors $\lesssim0.04$. It should also work well for some other simple FDM soliton evolutions.</description>

      <title>Equivalence of Stability Criteria for Multi-Fluid Stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a rigorous proof establishing the mathematical equivalence between two independent criteria for the marginal stability of multi-fluid relativistic stars: the dynamical criterion based on the vanishing of the fundamental radial pulsation mode's eigenfrequency, and the static criterion derived from the geometric alignment of mass and particle number gradients in the parameter space. Leveraging this equivalence, we introduce a powerful and computationally efficient framework as an upgraded version of the critical curve method, to systematically map the stability boundaries for multi-fluid mixed stars across the entire parameter space of central pressures. Our analysis, applied to a variety of nuclear and dark matter equations of state, reveals the existence of stable region in the observable mass-radius diagram. By resolving degeneracies with 3-dimensional Mass-Radius-Pressure diagrams, we provide a complete topological view of the ensemble. This work supplies a robust theoretical foundation for interpreting multi-messenger astronomical observations and constraining the properties of dark matter.</description>

Abstract: Concerning the stability of two-fluid star models, we prove the rigorous equivalence of two independent determining methods for mixed stars, after a brief review of the hybrid star case. Our derivations apply to general multi-fluid cases, and here we take dark matter admixed neutron star models for example, demonstrating a stability boundary distinct from the single-fluid case. Stable configurations form a surface in the three-dimensional parameter space of (either) central pressure, mass, and radius, which yields a group containing stable mixed stars. This group includes twin stars with identical masses and radii but different interior structures. These results can help interpret compact star observations and constrain dark matter properties through astrophysics.</description>

      <title>Probing hard/soft factorization via beam-spin asymmetry in exclusive pion electroproduction from the proton</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep exclusive meson production (DEMP) reactions, such as $p(\vec{e},e'\pi^+)n$, provide opportunities to study the three-dimensional structure of the nucleon through differential cross section and beam- and target-spin asymmetry measurements. This work aims to probe the onset of the hard/soft factorization regime through the exclusive $p(\vec{e},e'\pi^+)n$ reaction, as measured in the KaonLT experiment at Jefferson Lab Hall C. A 10.6 GeV longitudinally polarized electron beam was incident on an unpolarized liquid hydrogen target, and the scattered electron and produced meson were detected in two magnetic focusing spectrometers, enabling precision cross section measurements. The cross section ratio $\sigma_{LT'}/\sigma_0$ was extracted from the beam-spin asymmetry $A_{LU}$. The $t$-dependence of $\sigma_{LT'}/\sigma_0$ was determined at fixed $Q^2$ and $x_B$ over a range of kinematics from $2&lt;Q^2&lt;6$ GeV$^2$ above the resonance region ($W&gt;2$ GeV). Furthermore, these data are combined with recent results from CLAS/CLAS12 to determine the $Q^2$-dependence of $\sigma_{LT'}/\sigma_0$ at two ($x_B$, $t$) settings. This was fairly flat, with $Q^2$ not having a measurable effect on the value of $\sigma_{LT'}/\sigma_0$ in the range explored. Results are compared to predictions from the generalized parton distribution (GPD) formalism, which relies explicitly on hard/soft factorization, and Regge formalism. The Regge models better predict $\sigma_{LT'}/\sigma_0$, which suggests that the factorization regime is not yet reached.</description>

      <title>Constraining Dark Acoustic Oscillations with the High-Redshift UV Luminosity Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark acoustic oscillations (DAOs) in the matter power spectrum can arise in many different dark sector models, and can imprint on a variety of cosmological observables. In this work we use measurements of the galactic UV luminosity function (UVLF) at high redshifts to constrain the dark acoustic oscillation feature at small scales in a model-agnostic way. We introduce a phenomenological transfer function model for a dark sector with a species undergoing DAOs which can accommodate sub-dominant dark matter abundances, and obtain constraints on its parameters. In order to predict the UVLF, we employ an Extended Press-Schechter formalism which we calibrate using N-body simulations with initial conditions featuring DAOs. Using measurements from the Hubble Space Telescope, James Webb Space Telescope, Subaru Telescope, and Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope, we constrain the wave number of the first DAO peak to be at $k \gtrsim 50\ h/\mathrm{Mpc}$, unless the fraction of dark matter undergoing DAOs is less than $0.07$.</description>

      <title>Problems of studying $\gamma \gamma \to \gamma\gamma$ scattering at $e^+e^-$, $e^-e^-$ and $\gamma\gamma$ colliders</title>

Abstract: The process of elastic scattering of photons (scattering of light by light) has attracted much attention in recent years. It goes through a loop where all the charged particles contribute to the cross section. To date, this $\gamma\gamma \to \gamma\gamma$ process has been experimentally studied in the Delbr\"{u}ck scattering and splitting of photons in the Coulomb field of the nucleus, as well as at the LHC in the scattering of virtual photons in ion-ion collisions. Hopes for further study of this process are associated with high-luminosity $e^+e^-$ colliders (SuperKEKb, FCC, CEPC, ILC, CLIC) and gamma-gamma colliders based on the Compton scattering of laser photons on electrons. In this article, we show that there are some very serious background processes where the annihilation of electrons and positrons (real and virtual) produces a pair of photons flying into the detector, and the the remaining products fly away from the detector at small angles.</description>

      <title>Renormalization group running triggered tri-resonant leptogenesis within neutrino flavor-symmetry models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09363v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we have studied the consequences of some representative neutrino flavor-symmetry models for tri-resonant leptogenesis (which is realized by having three nearly degenerate right-handed neutrinos). To be specific, we have considered a neutrino flavor-symmetry model realizing the TM1 mixing and modular ${\rm A}^{}_4$, ${\rm S}^{}_4$ and ${\rm A}^{}_5$ symmetry models that have a right-handed neutrino mass matrix $M^{}_{\rm R}$ as shown in Eq.~(\ref{6}) which gives three exactly degenerate right-handed neutrino masses and consequently prohibits the leptogenesis mechanism to work successfully. For these models, we study the scenario that the desired right-handed neutrino mass splittings for leptogenesis to work are generated from the renormalization-group running effects. In such a scenario, we explore the parameter space that allows for the reproduction of the observed baryon-antibaryon asymmetry of the Universe.</description>

      <title>Study of $h\to Z\gamma$ in Flavor Gauged Two Higgs Doublet Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18540v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the $h \to Z\gamma$ decay within the flavor gauged two Higgs doublet model (FG2HDM). This model extends the Standard Model (SM) to include a scalar doublet and a scalar singlet, under the imposition of a $U(1)'$ flavor gauge symmetry. Compared to the SM, the FG2HDM predicts five additional physical scalars and a neutral gauge boson, $Z'$. The $h \to Z\gamma$ decay can be influenced in this model through contributions from either charged Higgs loops or corrections to the fermion-antifermion-$Z$ ($f\bar{f}Z$) vertex. For the charged Higgs contribution, combining the $\mu_{Z\gamma}$ measurement with the more stringent result from $\mu_{\gamma\gamma}$, we identify a parameter region (with $m_{H^\pm}&gt;200$~GeV and $\lambda_{hH^+H^-}&lt;0$) that satisfies both constraints at the $1\sigma$ level. However, due to the larger uncertainty in $\mu_{Z\gamma}$, this region is primarily constrained by $\mu_{\gamma\gamma}$. Regarding the vertex corrections, we consider the dominant contribution from the top quark. We find an allowed region in the $\mathcal{Q}_{tL}$-$\mathcal{Q}_{tR}$ plane that can simultaneously accommodate $\mu_{Z\gamma}$, top quark observables, and $b \to s\ell^+\ell^-$ data. Similarly, the most stringent constraint in this case originates from $b \to s\ell^+\ell^-$, not from $\mu_{Z\gamma}$. Future precision measurements of $\mu_{Z\gamma}$, which will reduce its current experimental uncertainty, are expected to enhance its capacity to constrain the FG2HDM parameter space.</description>

      <title>Probing axion and flavored new physics with the NA64$\mu$ experiment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06294v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-energy muon beam dump experiments are powerful probes of new physics models beyond the Standard Model, particularly those involving flavor-dependent interactions. We demonstrate the potential of muon beam dump by placing strong constraints on three new physics models utilizing data from the recent NA64$\mu$ experiment: (1) axions coupling to photons, (2) axions coupling to muons, and (3) a dark sector mediated by a massless $U(1)_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$ gauge boson. The new particles can be identified from the significant missing energy as the invisible channel, or the distinct energy deposition signature as the visible channel. We find that the current NA64$\mu$ data do not yet probe new parameter region on axion-photon coupling, while excluding new parameter space for the axion-muon coupling $g_{a\mu\mu}\gtrsim4\times10^{-3}$~GeV$^{-1}$ and the axion mass $m_a\lesssim 0.2$~GeV. For the dark sector, the current data provide stringent constraints that surpass existing ones by nearly one order of magnitude. The data from the 2023 NA64$\mu$ run, once available, will be capable of excluding new axion-photon coupling parameter space and probing the flavor structure of new physics, with more sensitivity advancement expected in near future runs.</description>

      <title>Quantum-mechanical numerical model of interaction between dark atom and nucleus of substance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12407v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The hypothesis of composite $XHe$ dark atoms may provide solution to the long-standing problem of direct searches for dark matter particles. The main problem of the $XHe$ dark atom is its ability to strongly interact with the nucleus of substance, arising from the unshielded nuclear attraction between the helium nucleus and the nucleus of matter. It is assumed that in order to prevent the destruction of the bound structure of dark atom, the effective potential of interaction between $XHe$ and the nucleus of substance must have dipole Coulomb barrier that prevents the fusion of dark matter atom particles with the nucleus of substance. The problem in describing the interaction between dark atom and substance nucleus is the three-body problem, for which an exact analytical solution is not available. Consequently, to assess the physical meaning of the proposed scenario, it is essential to develop a numerical approach. Our approach involves consistently developing an accurate quantum mechanical description of this three-body system, comprising bound dark atom and the external nucleus of substance. We incorporate the necessary effects and interactions to enhance the precision of the results, which helps to elucidate the most significant aspects of the proposed dark atom scenario.</description>

Abstract: The recent accurate measurements of the scattering of electrons off of the mirror nuclei $^3$H and $^3$He show with small errors that the neutron to proton ratio $r(x)=F^n_2(x)/F^p_2(x)$, approaches a value larger than 1/4 for $x \to 1$.

      <title>Why $w \ne -1$? Anthropic Selection in a $\Lambda$ + Axion Dark Energy Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12852v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a dark energy model composed of a bare negative cosmological constant and a single ultra-light axion, motivated by the string axiverse. Assuming that intelligent observers arise and observe, as in our universe, the onset of dark-energy-driven acceleration following matter domination, and that this acceleration persists to the present, we derive nontrivial constraints on both the axion mass and the bare cosmological constant. The axion mass is bounded from above to avoid fine-tuning of the initial misalignment angle near the hilltop, and from below because too light axions cannot achieve accelerated expansion due to their limited energy budget. As a result, the anthropically allowed axion mass range typically lies around $m = \mathcal{O}(10)\, H_0$ for a decay constant close to the Planck scale, where $H_0$ is the observed value of the Hubble constant. In this framework, the dark energy equation-of-state parameter $w_0$ generically deviates from $-1$ by $\mathcal{O}(0.1)$, providing a natural explanation for why $w \ne -1$ may be expected. We also find that, for a decay constant slightly smaller than the Planck scale, the peak value of dark energy density is significantly smaller than the anthropic bound on the cosmological constant and can be close to the observed value. These outcomes are intriguingly consistent with recent DESI hints of time-varying dark energy, and offer a compelling anthropic explanation within the $\Lambda$ + axion framework.</description>

      <title>Accelerating multijet-merged event generation with neural network matrix element surrogates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06203v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The efficient simulation of multijet final states presents a serious computational task for analyses of LHC data and will be even more so at the HL-LHC. We here discuss means to accelerate the generation of unweighted events based on a two-stage rejection-sampling algorithm that employs neural-network surrogates for unweighting the hard-process matrix elements. To this end, we generalise the previously proposed algorithm based on factorisation-aware neural networks to the case of multijet merging at tree-level accuracy. We thereby account for several non-trivial aspects of realistic event-simulation setups, including biased phase-space sampling, partial unweighting, and the mapping of partonic subprocesses. We apply our methods to the production of Z+jets final states at the HL-LHC using the Sherpa event generator, including matrix elements with up to six final-state partons. When using neural-network surrogates for the dominant Z+5 jets and Z+6 jets partonic processes, we find a reduction in the total event-generation time by more than a factor of 10 compared to baseline Sherpa.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the mass spectra of excited charmonia employing a nonrelativistic potential model with screening effect, and analyze their two-body strong decay, two-photon decay, leptonic decay, and hadronic transitions. Especially, we find that the newly observed resonances $X(4160)$, $Y(4500)$, and $Y(4710)$ can be identified as $3^3P_0$, $3^3D_1$, and $4^3D_1$ states, respectively. We also predict the masses and the widths of higher excited states in the charmonia family.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09179v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We estimate a possible contribution of the two-pion system $f_0(500)$ wide resonance to the decay probability of the super rare decay $K^+ \to 3\pi^0 e^+ \nu$. We vary the width of the resonance from 0.01 MeV to 1000 MeV. We found that the contribution of the narrow resonance in a system of several final state particles into the decay probability is proportional to its width. However it never exceeds the value of the decay probability calculated on free final state particles neglecting the resonance contribution.</description>

      <title>Higher-Order Corrections to Quantum Observables in $h\to WW^*$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19951v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Higgs boson decay $h \to WW^* \to \ell^+ \nu_\ell \ell'^- \bar{\nu}_{\ell'}$ provides a unique window into the structure of the Higgs couplings to electroweak gauge bosons and has recently gained attention for its potential to unveil quantum properties such as quantum entanglement between the intermediate gauge bosons. In this work, we present a systematic study of next-to-leading order electroweak corrections to the angular coefficients characterizing this decay. While these coefficients are highly constrained at leading order, radiative corrections induce shifts of up to 5% to the existing terms and generate novel structures that vanish at leading order, breaking previous relations among coefficients. While higher-order effects influence the results, the two-qutrit quantum structure in the $h\to WW^*$ channel exhibits greater stability under such corrections than in the previously studied $h \to ZZ^*$ decay.</description>

      <title>Discovering the Underlying Analytic Structure Within Standard Model Constants Using Artificial Intelligence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00225v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a method for uncovering hidden analytic relationships among the fundamental parameters of the Standard Model (SM), a foundational theory in physics that describes the fundamental particles and their interactions, using symbolic regression and genetic programming. Using this approach, we identify the simplest analytic relationships connecting pairs of these constants and report several notable expressions obtained with relative precision better than 1%. These results may serve as valuable inputs for model builders and artificial intelligence methods aimed at uncovering hidden patterns among the SM constants, or potentially used as building blocks for a deeper underlying law that connects all parameters of the SM through a small set of fundamental constants.</description>

      <title>A unified thermodynamic framework for coextensive dark matter admixed strange stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16468v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the structural and physical properties of a strange star admixed with self-interacting bosonic dark matter. The total energy density is modelled as a weighted combination of quark matter and dark matter components regulated by a fixed local volume fraction. The quark component is described by a linear equation of state, while the dark matter follows a mean-field EOS with repulsive self-interactions. By combining these EOSs into a barotropic effective EOS derived from a unified thermodynamic potential, the two-fluid system is reformulated as a thermodynamically closed and mechanically equilibrated configuration. The construction preserves the dynamical distinction between the quark and dark sectors but treats them as a macroscopically unified mixture governed by a single hydrostatic equilibrium equation. This framework identifies the entirely coextensive limit of two-fluid models as a physically meaningful and thermodynamically closed configuration, providing a coherent macroscopic closure that links dark matter-strange matter microphysics to stellar observables. Using the effective EOS, we solve the governing Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations to obtain the mass-radius relationship by varying the model parameters. Our results reveal distinct modifications to the $M-R$ profiles, suggesting observable signatures that could offer insights into the impacts of dark matter in extreme astrophysical environments. We note that even a modest dark matter admixture softens the effective equation of state and shrinks the maximum mass limit. We discuss the relevance of our investigation in the context of recent observational data available for pulsars, such as XTE J1814-338, PSR J0348+0432, PSR J0740+6620 and PSRJ0952-0607.</description>

      <title>Axionlike particle-assisted supercooling chiral phase transition in QCD: Identifying Coleman-Weinberg type-chiral phase transition in QCD-like scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18016v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new scenario to realize the Coleman-Weinberg (CW) type chiral phase transition in the QCD thermal history. This scenario predicts a heavy axionlike particle (ALP) with mass $\sim$ 5 MeV, consistently with the current experimental and cosmological bounds. The chiral phase transition is evaluated by monitoring ordinary QCD setup in a view of a two-flavor Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model including a simplified meson fluctuation contribution. The present work thus can open a new window to search for the ALP associated with the QCD phase transition epoch of the thermal history. The new QCD cosmological scenario potentially predicts rich epochs around the QCD scale: a mini-inflation; a nonperturbative preheating and/or reheating, which can provide characteristic gravitational wave and primordial black hole productions. This proposal is based on a generic classification of the order of the chiral phase transition at the level of the mean field approximation in view of the scale violation classes: the soft-scale breaking term and the CW-type scale anomaly term, in or off the medium with or without chemical potentials. On this theoretical ground, we also revisit existing scenarios which undergo the supercooling chiral phase transition, such as nearly scale-invariant QCD and QCD with a large baryon chemical potential.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates the physics potential of the proton-proton Future Circular Collider (FCC-hh) in the search for a new heavy gauge boson, Z', within the framework of the minimal Baryon-Lepton (B-L) symmetric model. We examine the exclusion limits on the mass of the Z' boson for various sets of coupling constants, utilizing leptonic decays, specifically into charged lepton pairs (electron and muon). Using the DARKCAST framework, we compare the parameter constraints derived from previous experiments with the expected reach of the FCC-hh, providing insights into the collider sensitivity and potential to probe new physics beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23441v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that multiparticle contributions to amplitudes of weak decays of the generic topology (heavy quark hits some intermediate point of the propagator line joining the end-points from which momenta $q$ and $q'$ are emitted) is given in the heavy quark limit and at the leading order in $\alpha_s$ by the convolution of (i) hard kernel composed of highly virtual propagators of light degrees of freedom and (ii) the $B$-meson multiparticle wave function, $\langle 0|\phi(x)\phi(x_1)\dots\phi(x_n)\phi_b(0)\phi(x'_{n'})\dots\phi(x'_1)\phi(x')|B(p)\rangle$, in a {\it double-collinear} light-cone configuration: the coordinates $x,x_1,...,x_n$ are ordered and aligned along the light-like 4-vector $a_\mu$, $a^2=0$, $q_\mu\propto a_\mu$, while the coordinates $x',x_1',...,x'_{n'}$ are ordered and aligned along the light-like 4-vector $a'_\mu$, $a'^2=0$, $q'_\mu\propto a'_\mu$, $a'a\ne 0$. Corrections to this factorization formula are suppressed by powers of $\Lambda_{\rm QCD}/M_B$.</description>

      <title>Testing the dark side of neutrino oscillations with the solar neutrino fog at Dark Matter experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14166v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent detection of the solar neutrino background at Dark Matter direct detection experiments paves the way to fully explore an important degeneracy in neutrino oscillations in the presence of new interactions, named the LMA-Dark degeneracy. This degeneracy makes it impossible to determine the neutrino mass ordering in oscillation experiments if neutrinos have new vectorial interactions with matter. As the composition of solar neutrinos at the Earth consists of all three neutrino flavors, testing the presence of new neutrino interactions in the muon and tau neutrino sector in scatterings can fully probe the LMA-Dark region for the first time. In this paper we show that current data from XENONnT and PandaX-4T does not yet exclude the LMA-Dark region with equal couplings of a new mediator to muon and tau neutrinos and quarks, and we identify the possible experimental scenarios to do so in the future. We also show that Dark Matter experiments can distinguish new interactions in the muon or tau sector only from new interactions affecting both sectors.</description>

      <title>Techniques for mass peak reconstruction in Searches for Long-Lived Heavy Neutral Leptons Decaying to a Lepton and a \(\rho\) Meson</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01357v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The precise reconstruction of the mass peak of long-lived heavy neutral leptons (HNLs) helps to improve the sensitivity for sterile neutrino searches in both fixed-target and collider environments (e.g., SHiP and the LHC). We present an analytical framework for reconstructing the HNL mass peak in the semileptonic HNL decay channel \(N\rightarrow l\rho\) with \(\rho\to\pi\pi^0\), using only the lepton and the charged pion emerging from the decay vertex together with kinematic constraints and the known particle masses. Incorporating mass constraints from intermediate resonances (e.g., the \(\rho\) meson) or the parent particle (e.g., the \(W\) boson at the collider experiments), we propose two methods, suitable for experiments with displaced vertex tracking capabilities. The particle-level simulation's results demonstrate that the \(\rho\)-mass constraint method yields promising HNL mass resolution in both beam-dump and collider-based environments. The W-mass constraint method, limited to the HNLs produced via \(W\)-boson decays at the collider-based experiments, shows better HNL mass resolution than the \(\rho\)-mass constraint method.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a two real scalar singlet extension of the two Higgs doublet model. We study the vacuum structure, the bounded from below conditions, the restrictions from the oblique parameters S,T and U, as well as the unitarity constraints. We submit the model to collider and Dark Matter experimental constraints and explore its allowed parameter space. We compare randomly populated simulations, simulations starting near the alignment limit, and a Machine Learning based exploration. Using Evolutionary Strategies, we efficiently search for regions with two Dark Matter candidates.</description>

      <title>The $R^2$-Higgs inflation: $R^3$ contribution and preheating after ACT and SPT data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02979v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $R^2$-Higgs inflation is one of the simplest yet best-fit models consistent with Planck data. The higher spectral index $n_s$ recently reported by the combined cosmic microwave background (CMB) data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), South Pole Telescope (SPT), and Planck, along with baryonic acoustic oscillation data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), disfavors the single-field-like regime of $R^2$-Higgs inflation at approximately $2\sigma$. Following a doubly covariant formalism, we show that the $R^2$-Higgs inflation, when modified by a dimension-six $R^3$ term, can account for the high $n_s$ reported by CMB+BAO. In this regard, we find that preheating may play a pivotal role. We also show that if the nonminimal coupling between the Ricci scalar $R$ and the Higgs field is $\mathcal{O}(10)$, then preheating via the production of Higgs quanta may help explain the reported observations.</description>

      <title>Heavy Field Effects on Inflationary Models in Light of ACT Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06739v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent results from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), when combined with Planck and DESI datasets, indicate a scalar spectral index $n_s$ larger than that reported in the Planck 2018 baseline, thereby challenging conventional Starobinsky-type ($\alpha$-attractor) inflationary scenarios at the $2\sigma$ level. In addition, the positive running of the spectral index $\alpha_s$ implied by the data provides strong constraints on these models. In this paper, we explore the possibility that the presence of an additional heavy field during inflation, with a mass of order the Hubble scale and a sizable mixing coupling to the inflaton, can reconcile such inflationary models with the ACT results by increasing both $n_s$ and $\alpha_s$, particularly in the strong-mixing regime. Furthermore, we extend this framework to traditional inflation models such as chaotic inflation and natural inflation, which have already been excluded by Planck alone, and show that they can be revived in certain regions of parameter space. Inflationary observables, including the spectral index $n_s$, the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$, and the running $\alpha_s$, are computed within the single-field EFT approach, which is applicable even in the presence of a heavy field with large mixing. We also discuss the non-Gaussianity signatures arising from the heavy field, noting that parts of the parameter space are already excluded or can be tested in future observations. Finally, we present concrete model realizations that allow for such a large mixing.</description>

      <title>Searching for axion-like particles from tau exotic decays at the Super Tau-Charm Facility and its far detectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23949v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Leptophilic axion-like particles (ALPs) extend the Standard Model (SM) with brand-new interactions between the ALP and leptons. In this work, we focus on studying exotic $\tau$ decays to explore such ALPs. Both the tauphilic and lepton flavor universal (LFU) scenarios, with electroweak preserving and violating benchmarks, have been investigated at a future $\tau$-factory, namely the Super Tau-Charm Facility (STCF) under development in China. Both prompt and far detection are proposed, targeting on leptonic $\tau$ decays, $\tau^- \to \ell^-\bar\nu_\ell \nu_\tau a$. For prompt detection, the $\tau^+\tau^-$ threshold $\sqrt s=3.56$ GeV and higher central energy $\sqrt s=4.2$ GeV are taken into account. In addition, a cylinder-like far detector has been proposed to complement prompt detection. We demonstrate the huge potential to detect leptophilic ALPs at the STCF. Concretely, for tauphilic scenario, the STCF is mostly sensitive in the currently unprobed region with $m_a\sim 1000$ MeV. However, in the LFU scenario, the dilepton channel tremendously shortens the ALP lifetime, and eventually the STCF only allows a precise measurement in the new regime with $100~\text{MeV}\lesssim m_a\lesssim 200~\text{MeV}$.</description>

Abstract: FIRE7 is a major update to the FIRE program for integration-by-parts (IBP) reduction of Feynman integrals. A large part of improvements is related to the automatic reduction and reconstruction with the modular arithmetic approach, while the performance of the classical rational polynomial approach is also significantly increased. An improved presolve algorithm performs Gaussian elimination to simplify IBP identities before substituting numerical indices as in the Laporta algorithm. Various new command line tools are included to facilitate tasks such as applying an IBP reduction table to reduce a loop integrand as a linear combination of individual integrals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09622v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel class of bosonic dark matter candidates that we dub wallions, featuring boundaries in field space. The wallion mass is exponentially suppressed when the separation between boundaries far exceeds their intrinsic width and remains radiatively stable under self-interactions. We study the early-universe evolution of wallions and the associated cosmological signatures. Finally, we show that instanton effects can dynamically generate field-space boundaries and discuss possible experimental probes once the wallion couples to Standard Model fields.</description>

Abstract: Hybrid quarkonia -exotic hadrons with explicit gluonic degrees of freedom- have gained increasing attention in hadron spectroscopy, particularly with the ongoing discovery of new XYZ mesons. In this work, we update the spectrum of heavy hybrid mesons in the charmonium and bottomonium sectors using the Born-Oppenheimer Effective Field Theory framework, by incorporating the latest lattice QCD results for hybrid static potentials. We refine earlier calculations and analyze allowed transitions from hybrids to conventional quarkonia, including both spin-conserved and spin-flip decays. We carry out a comprehensive error analysis and discuss the reliability of our results. We compare them to experimental data of the Particle Data Group, which allows us to identify hybrid candidates among the observed XYZ states. We provide hybrid or quarkonium interpretations for nearly all heavy isospin-zero mesons observed and incorporate new hybrid candidates.</description>

      <title>Energy recovery twin linear $e^+e^-$, $e^-e^-$ colliders (ERLC ) with high luminosities and accelerating gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.09758v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, the $e^+e^-$ high-energy superconducting linear collider with energy recovery (ERLC) and multiple use of beams has been proposed, using twin RF structures to avoid parasitic collisions in linacs. Such a collider can operate in either pulsed (with duty factor DF) or CW (continuous) mode, if sufficient power is available, with a luminosity of ${\cal O}(10^{36})$ cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ at $2E_0=$250-500 GeV. In this paper, we point out that the luminosity of the ERLC operating in the pulsed mode does not depend on the accelerating gradient G (for the same total power), allowing the ERLC to operate with the highest available accelerating gradients. This is also true for the CW mode at a power significantly exceeding the threshold power for this mode. The $e^+e^-$ luminosity depends on the quality factor of cavities as $L\propto Q_0^{1/2}$. We also consider for the first time a twin $e^-e^-$ collider with energy recovery and estimate its achievable luminosity. Such an $e^-e^-$ collider is simpler than an $e^+e^-$ one. It does not require beam recycling since electrons can be produced anew each time. The $e^-e^-$ luminosity depends on the quality factor as $L\propto Q_0^{1/4}$. RF travelling-wave structures allow higher gradients and reduced thermal loading. It is shown that an ERLC with an accelerating gradient of $G=40$ MeV/m can be operated in CW mode with $L_{e^+e^-} =$ (1-2.5)\,$10^{36}$ and $L_{e^-e^-} =$ (3-7)$10^{36}$ cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ for reasonable total powers of 150 and 300 MW at $2E_0=250$ and 500 GeV, respectively. Such a machine is a promising candidate for a Higgs factory.</description>

      <title>Probing Lambda-Gravity with Bose-Einstein Condensate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19755v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a precise test of two fundamental gravitational constants using a detector concept that exploits the dynamics of quantum phononic excitations in a trapped Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), operable at the scale of tabletop experiments. In this setup, the sensitivity is enhanced by approximately 2 orders of magnitude through the use of a tritter operation, which mixes phononic excitations with the BEC's ground state. The BEC exhibits unique sensitivity to the two key components of the gravitational potential in $\Lambda$-gravity: the Newtonian $GM/r$ term and the cosmological constant $\Lambda r^2$, both entering the most general function following from a Gurzadyan's theorem. Using state-of-the-art experimental design, we predict that the gravitational constant $G$ could be measured with an accuracy up to $10^{-17}$ N m$^2$/kg$^2$, representing an improvement by 2 orders of magnitude over current measurements. Moreover, this experiment aims to establish the best Earth-based upper limit on $\Lambda$ at $&lt;10^{-31}$ m$^{-2}$, marking the first laboratory-based probe of the cosmological constant. Additionally, the setup allows for the measurement of the distance-dependent behavior of each term in the gravitational potential, providing a means to test modified gravity theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.24011v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a free scalar field in a specific (1+1)-dimensional curved spacetime. By introducing an algebraic state that is locally Hadamard, we derive the renormalized Wightman function and explicitly calculate the covariantly conserved quantum energy-momentum tensor up to a relevant order. From this result, we show that the Hadamard renormalization scheme, which has been effective in traditional quantum field theory in curved spacetime, is also applicable in the quantum inhomogeneous field theory. As applications of this framework, we show the existence of an Unruh-like effect for an observer slightly out of the right asymptotic region, as well as the vanishing of quantum frictional effect in the leading order ($e^{- bx}$) on the bubble wall expansion during the electroweak phase transition in the early universe.</description>

Abstract: We present a method for relating the transition rate of an accelerated Unruh-deWitt detector to the rate of the same detector when stationary in Minkowski space. Furthermore, we show that when using the detector as a model for decay, its transition rate can be related directly to the decay rate obtained from QFT. Combined this provides a straightforward method for calculating the decay rate of accelerated particles to first order in the coupling constants.</description>

      <title>Echoes of Self-Interacting Dark Matter from Binary Black Hole Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08787v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dark matter (DM) environments around black holes (BHs) can influence their mergers through dynamical friction, causing gravitational wave (GW) dephasing during the inspiral phase. While this effect is well studied for collisionless dark matter (CDM), it remains unexplored for self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) due to the typically low DM density in SIDM halo cores. In this work, by considering BH mergers within SIDM spikes, which can arise from models with a massive force mediator, we show that the GWs emitted are dephased in a distinct manner. To incorporate the feedback of the BH orbital motion that can significantly modify the DM profiles, we use $N$-body simulations to analyze GW dephasing in binary BH inspirals within CDM and SIDM spikes. By tracking the binary's motion in different SIDM environments, we show that the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) can distinguish DM profiles shaped by varying DM interaction strengths, revealing detailed properties of SIDM.</description>

      <title>Quantum Chebyshev Probabilistic Models for Fragmentation Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16073v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum generative modeling is emerging as a powerful tool for advancing data analysis in high-energy physics, where complex multivariate distributions are common. However, efficiently learning and sampling these distributions remains challenging. We propose a quantum protocol for a bivariate probabilistic model based on shifted Chebyshev polynomials, trained as a circuit-based representation of two correlated variables, with sampling performed via quantum Chebyshev transforms. As a key application we study fragmentation functions (FFs) of charged pions and kaons from single-inclusive hadron production in electron-positron annihilation. We learn the joint distribution of momentum fraction $z$ and energy scale $Q$, and infer their correlations from the entanglement structure. Building on the generalization capabilities of the quantum model and extended register architecture, we perform fine-grid multivariate sampling for FF dataset augmentation. Our results highlight the growing potential of quantum generative modeling to advance data analysis and scientific discovery in high-energy physics.</description>

      <title>Strongly Coupled Sectors in Inflation: Gapless Theories and Unparticles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17840v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute correlation functions of the primordial density perturbations when they couple to a gapless, strongly coupled sector of spectator fields -- ``unparticles" -- during inflation. We first derive a four-point function of conformally coupled scalars for all kinematic configurations in de Sitter, which exchanges an unparticle at tree-level, by performing direct integration using the Mellin-Barnes method. To obtain inflationary bispectra and trispectra, we apply weight-shifting operators to the conformally coupled scalar correlator. We show that the correlators solve differential equations determined by the additional symmetries enjoyed by the unparticle propagator. Based on these differential equations, we are able to discuss the spinning-unparticle exchanges, focusing on two possible cases where the currents or the stress tensor of unparticles are coupled to inflatons, with the help of spin-raising operators. Finally, we study the phenomenology of the resulting shape functions. Depending on the value of the unparticle scaling dimension, we classify three characteristic shapes for the inflationary bispectra, including near-equilateral, near-orthogonal, and a novel shape which appears when the scaling dimensions are close to half-integers. More generally, we find that the leading order squeezed limits are insufficient to conclusively determine the detection of a light particle or unparticle. Only the full shapes of bispectra and trispectra can break this degeneracy.</description>

      <title>Neutrino mass tension or suppressed growth rate of matter perturbations?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01848v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Assuming a minimal $\Lambda$CDM cosmology with three massive neutrinos, the joint analysis of Planck cosmic microwave background data, DESI baryon acoustic oscillations, and distance moduli measurements of Type Ia supernovae from the Pantheon+ sample sets an upper bound on the total neutrino mass, $\sum m_\nu \lesssim 0.06$-$0.07$ eV, that lies barely above the lower limit from oscillation experiments. These constraints are mainly driven by mild differences in the inferred values of the matter density parameter across different probes that can be alleviated by introducing additional background-level degrees of freedom (e.g., by dynamical dark energy models). However, in this work we explore an alternative possibility. Since both $\Omega_\mathrm{m}$ and massive neutrinos critically influence the growth of cosmic structures, we test whether the neutrino mass tension may originate from the way matter clusters, rather than from a breakdown of the $\Lambda$CDM expansion history. To this end, we introduce the growth index $\gamma$, which characterizes the rate at which matter perturbations grow. Deviations from the standard $\Lambda$CDM value ($\gamma \simeq 0.55$) can capture a broad class of models, including non-minimal dark sector physics and modified gravity. We show that allowing $\gamma$ to vary significantly relaxes the neutrino mass bounds to $\sum m_\nu \lesssim 0.13$-$0.2$ eV, removing any tension with terrestrial constraints without altering the inferred value of $\Omega_\mathrm{m}$. However, this comes at the cost of departing from standard growth predictions: to have $\sum m_\nu \gtrsim 0.06$ eV one needs $\gamma &gt; 0.55$, and we find a consistent preference for $\gamma &gt; 0.55$ at the level of $\sim 2\sigma$. This preference increases to $\sim 2.5$-$3\sigma$ when a physically motivated prior $\sum m_\nu \ge 0.06$ eV from oscillation experiments is imposed.</description>

      <title>Low-energy multi-photon scattering at tree-level and one-loop order in a homogeneous electromagnetic field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22308v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study low energy photons coupled to scalar and spinor matter in the presence of an arbitrary homogeneous electromagnetic field in a first-quantised (worldline) approach. Utilising a Fock-Schwinger gauge for both the scattering photons and homogeneous background, simple compact expressions are found for both the photon- and background-dressed effective action and propagator in scalar and spinor quantum electrodynamics. The low-energy limit allows identification of the coupling of the scattering photons as one of an effective homogeneous superposition of their field strengths, with amplitudes following from application of a suitable linearisation operator.
  To treat the linearisation, several techniques are employed, including a functional expansion based on the proper time formalism and worldline Green functions, linearised vertex operators under a worldline path integral, and a matrix expansion in the field strengths. We find, in particular, that a replacement rule converting scalar amplitudes to spinor amplitudes at one-loop order can, surprisingly, be extended to tree level amplitudes in the low energy limit. Finally, we discuss a novel worldline representation of the momentum space matter propagators, obtaining a suitable worldline Green function for this path integral satisfying homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions and momentum space vertex operators representing the scattering photons already in momentum space.</description>

      <title>SN2023syz and SN2025cbj: Two Type IIn Supernovae Associated with IceCube High-energy Neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19080v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Type IIn supernovae (SNe IIn) are a subclass of core-collapse SNe in which strong interactions occur between the ejecta and dense circumstellar material, creating ideal conditions for the production of high-energy neutrinos. This makes them promising candidate sources of neutrinos. In this work, we conduct an association study between 163 SNe IIn observed by the Zwicky Transient Facility and 138 neutrino alert events detected by the IceCube neutrino observatory. After excluding alerts with poor localization, we find two SNe that are spatiotemporally coincident with neutrino events. IC231027A and IC250421A coincide with the positions of SN2023syz and SN2025cbj, respectively, within their localization uncertainties, and the neutrino arrival times are delayed by 38 days and 61 days relative to the discovery times of the corresponding SNe. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we estimate that the probability of such two coincidences occurring by chance in our sample is $p \sim 0.67\%$, suggesting that they may originate from genuine physical associations, though the result is not yet statistically significant. Our model calculations, however, indicate that the likelihood of a neutrino originating from IC231027A is low, implying that the association between IC231027A and SN2023syz is likely coincidental. Nevertheless, under optimistic parameters, the probability of detecting a neutrino from the whole SNe IIn sample could reach $\gtrsim6\%$, indicating that detecting neutrino emission from the SNe population may be possible. Our study provides a systematic analysis, combining statistical analysis and model calculations, to assess whether interacting supernovae can serve as potential sources of neutrino emission.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02694v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study an overpopulated gas of gravitationally interacting bosons surrounding a droplet of Bose-Einstein condensate - Bose star. We argue that kinetic evolution of this gas approaches with time a self-similar attractor solution to the kinetic equation. If the scale symmetry of the equation is broken by external conditions, the attractor solution exists, remains approximately self-similar, but has slowly drifting scaling dimension. The latter new regime of adiabatic self-similarity can determine growth of dark matter Bose stars in cosmological models.</description>

      <title>A Dark Matter Model with Quadratic Equation of State: Background Evolution and Structure Formation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11138v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose that dark matter (DM) possesses a quadratic equation of state, which becomes significant at high densities, altering the Universe's evolution during its early stages. We derive the modified background evolution equations for the Hubble parameter $H(z)$ and the DM density parameter $\Omega_{\text{dm}}(z)$. We then perturb the governing equations to study the linear growth of matter fluctuations, computing the observable growth factor $f\sigma_8(z)$. Finally, we compare the model with the latest cosmological data, including Hubble parameter $H(z)$ measurements, and growth factor $f\sigma_8(z)$ data, up to $z=3$. Our results indicate that the quadratic model, while remaining consistent with background observations, offers a distinct imprint on the growth of structure, providing not only a new phenomenological avenue to address cosmological tensions but also shedding light on the nature of DM.</description>

Abstract: Femtoscopy is one of the promising experimental approaches to put constraints on interactions between various species of hadrons from the momentum correlation functions measured in high-energy nuclear collision experiments. The Koonin-Pratt and Lednicky-Lyuboshitz formulae provide useful expressions of the correlation functions and have been widely used to analyze the experimental data based on the assumption that the effect of higher partial waves is negligible. Those formulae can be generalized for higher partial waves, but the generalized Lednicky-Lyuboshitz formula produces wrong results due to a singular behavior of the asymptotic wave function at the origin. In this study, we attempt to solve the problem by regularizing the generalized Lednicky-Lyuboshitz formula with a cutoff and validate it using the Koonin-Pratt formula as a reference. We also show the relationship between the cutoff in the regularized Lednicky-Lyuboshitz and the effective-range correction in the original Lednicky-Lyuboshitz formula. Using the obtained formula, we investigate the source-size dependence, the validity of the effective range expansion, and the cutoff dependence of the correlation function. We also discuss the interaction dependence using the heatmap as a function of the scattering-length parameter $1/a_l$ and the momentum $q$.</description>

      <title>Fibre Inflation Meets Quintessence: Implications of Perturbative Stabilisation</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we have discovered a new avenue of fibre inflation in perturbative large volume scenario (pLVS) due to the redefinition of the base modulus. pLVS offers a novel regime where large volume of the internal space is guaranteed without the need of non-perturbative effects. In this setup, we study the possibility where a base redefinition allows to assess different versions of fibre inflation whose spectral index aligns with Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) data and produces tensor-to-scalar ratio in the range $0.008\lesssim r\lesssim 0.01$ in different setups we have considered. The leading order flat direction - which in our case is the fibre modulus - is lifted with the combinations of string loop corrections, leading order $\alpha^{\prime 3}$$R^4$-correction, higher derivative $F^{4}$ corrections as well as our new ingredient redefinition of the modulus. Since recent Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) results appear to favour a dynamical explanation for late-time acceleration over a simple cosmological constant, exploring quintessence offers a more suitable approach. In this lore, we also examine the quintessence sector to complete our model and account for both early- and late-time cosmic acceleration. In this framework, the poly-instanton correction generates a potential along the axionic directions, and we find that the resulting quintessence behaviour and the subsequent cosmological predictions about dark matter closely resemble the predictions of the original fibre inflation scenario studied earlier.</description>
