      <title>sVAD: A Robust, Low-Power, and Light-Weight Voice Activity Detection with Spiking Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speech applications are expected to be low-power and robust under noisy conditions. An effective Voice Activity Detection (VAD) front-end lowers the computational need. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are known to be biologically plausible and power-efficient. However, SNN-based VADs have yet to achieve noise robustness and often require large models for high performance. This paper introduces a novel SNN-based VAD model, referred to as sVAD, which features an auditory encoder with an SNN-based attention mechanism. Particularly, it provides effective auditory feature representation through SincNet and 1D convolution, and improves noise robustness with attention mechanisms. The classifier utilizes Spiking Recurrent Neural Networks (sRNN) to exploit temporal speech information. Experimental results demonstrate that our sVAD achieves remarkable noise robustness and meanwhile maintains low power consumption and a small footprint, making it a promising solution for real-world VAD applications.</description>

      <title>An Audio-textual Diffusion Model For Converting Speech Signals Into Ultrasound Tongue Imaging Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Acoustic-to-articulatory inversion (AAI) is to convert audio into articulator movements, such as ultrasound tongue imaging (UTI) data. An issue of existing AAI methods is only using the personalized acoustic information to derive the general patterns of tongue motions, and thus the quality of generated UTI data is limited. To address this issue, this paper proposes an audio-textual diffusion model for the UTI data generation task. In this model, the inherent acoustic characteristics of individuals related to the tongue motion details are encoded by using wav2vec 2.0, while the ASR transcriptions related to the universality of tongue motions are encoded by using BERT. UTI data are then generated by using a diffusion module. Experimental results showed that the proposed diffusion model could generate high-quality UTI data with clear tongue contour that is crucial for the linguistic analysis and clinical assessment.

      <title>HAM-TTS: Hierarchical Acoustic Modeling for Token-Based Zero-Shot Text-to-Speech with Model and Data Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Token-based text-to-speech (TTS) models have emerged as a promising avenue for generating natural and realistic speech, yet they grapple with low pronunciation accuracy, speaking style and timbre inconsistency, and a substantial need for diverse training data. In response, we introduce a novel hierarchical acoustic modeling approach complemented by a tailored data augmentation strategy and train it on the combination of real and synthetic data, scaling the data size up to 650k hours, leading to the zero-shot TTS model with 0.8B parameters. Specifically, our method incorporates a latent variable sequence containing supplementary acoustic information based on refined self-supervised learning (SSL) discrete units into the TTS model by a predictor. This significantly mitigates pronunciation errors and style mutations in synthesized speech. During training, we strategically replace and duplicate segments of the data to enhance timbre uniformity. Moreover, a pretrained few-shot voice conversion model is utilized to generate a plethora of voices with identical content yet varied timbres. This facilitates the explicit learning of utterance-level one-to-many mappings, enriching speech diversity and also ensuring consistency in timbre. Comparative experiments (Demo page: https://anonymous.4open.science/w/ham-tts/)demonstrate our model's superiority over VALL-E in pronunciation precision and maintaining speaking style, as well as timbre continuity.</description>

      <title>Towards Decoupling Frontend Enhancement and Backend Recognition in Monaural Robust ASR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been shown that the intelligibility of noisy speech can be improved by speech enhancement (SE) algorithms. However, monaural SE has not been established as an effective frontend for automatic speech recognition (ASR) in noisy conditions compared to an ASR model trained on noisy speech directly. The divide between SE and ASR impedes the progress of robust ASR systems, especially as SE has made major advances in recent years. This paper focuses on eliminating this divide with an ARN (attentive recurrent network) time-domain and a CrossNet time-frequency domain enhancement models. The proposed systems fully decouple frontend enhancement and backend ASR trained only on clean speech. Results on the WSJ, CHiME-2, LibriSpeech, and CHiME-4 corpora demonstrate that ARN and CrossNet enhanced speech both translate to improved ASR results in noisy and reverberant environments, and generalize well to real acoustic scenarios. The proposed system outperforms the baselines trained on corrupted speech directly. Furthermore, it cuts the previous best word error rate (WER) on CHiME-2 by $28.4\%$ relatively with a $5.57\%$ WER, and achieves $3.32/4.44\%$ WER on single-channel CHiME-4 simulated/real test data without training on CHiME-4.</description>

      <title>Cosine Scoring with Uncertainty for Neural Speaker Embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uncertainty modeling in speaker representation aims to learn the variability present in speech utterances. While the conventional cosine-scoring is computationally efficient and prevalent in speaker recognition, it lacks the capability to handle uncertainty. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an approach for estimating uncertainty at the speaker embedding front-end and propagating it to the cosine scoring back-end. Experiments conducted on the VoxCeleb and SITW datasets confirmed the efficacy of the proposed method in handling uncertainty arising from embedding estimation. It achieved improvement with 8.5% and 9.8% average reductions in EER and minDCF compared to the conventional cosine similarity. It is also computationally efficient in practice.</description>

      <title>A Cross-Modal Approach to Silent Speech with LLM-Enhanced Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Silent Speech Interfaces (SSIs) offer a noninvasive alternative to brain-computer interfaces for soundless verbal communication. We introduce Multimodal Orofacial Neural Audio (MONA), a system that leverages cross-modal alignment through novel loss functions--cross-contrast (crossCon) and supervised temporal contrast (supTcon)--to train a multimodal model with a shared latent representation. This architecture enables the use of audio-only datasets like LibriSpeech to improve silent speech recognition. Additionally, our introduction of Large Language Model (LLM) Integrated Scoring Adjustment (LISA) significantly improves recognition accuracy. Together, MONA LISA reduces the state-of-the-art word error rate (WER) from 28.8% to 12.2% in the Gaddy (2020) benchmark dataset for silent speech on an open vocabulary. For vocal EMG recordings, our method improves the state-of-the-art from 23.3% to 3.7% WER. In the Brain-to-Text 2024 competition, LISA performs best, improving the top WER from 9.8% to 8.9%. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first instance where noninvasive silent speech recognition on an open vocabulary has cleared the threshold of 15% WER, demonstrating that SSIs can be a viable alternative to automatic speech recognition (ASR). Our work not only narrows the performance gap between silent and vocalized speech but also opens new possibilities in human-computer interaction, demonstrating the potential of cross-modal approaches in noisy and data-limited regimes.</description>

      <title>Asynchronous Microphone Array Calibration using Hybrid TDOA Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Asynchronous Microphone array calibration is a prerequisite for most audition robot applications. In practice, the calibration requires estimating microphone positions, time offsets, clock drift rates, and sound event locations simultaneously. The existing method proposed Graph-based Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (Graph-SLAM) utilizing common TDOA, time difference of arrival between two microphones (TDOA-M), and odometry measurement, however, it heavily depends on the initial value. In this paper, we propose a novel TDOA, time difference of arrival between adjacent sound events (TDOA-S), combine it with TDOA-M, called hybrid TDOA, and add odometry measurement to construct Graph-SLAM and use the Gauss-Newton (GN) method to solve. TDOA-S is simple and efficient because it eliminates time offset without generating new variables. Simulation and real-world experiment results consistently show that our method is independent of microphone number, insensitive to initial values, and has better calibration accuracy and stability under various TDOA noises. In addition, the simulation result demonstrates that our method has a lower Cram\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for microphone parameters, which explains the advantages of my method.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Expressiveness in Dance Generation via Integrating Frequency and Music Style Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dance generation, as a branch of human motion generation, has attracted increasing attention. Recently, a few works attempt to enhance dance expressiveness, which includes genre matching, beat alignment, and dance dynamics, from certain aspects. However, the enhancement is quite limited as they lack comprehensive consideration of the aforementioned three factors. In this paper, we propose ExpressiveBailando, a novel dance generation method designed to generate expressive dances, concurrently taking all three factors into account. Specifically, we mitigate the issue of speed homogenization by incorporating frequency information into VQ-VAE, thus improving dance dynamics. Additionally, we integrate music style information by extracting genre- and beat-related features with a pre-trained music model, hence achieving improvements in the other two factors. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method can generate dances with high expressiveness and outperforms existing methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.</description>

      <title>SCORE: Self-supervised Correspondence Fine-tuning for Improved Content Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is a growing interest in cost-effective self-supervised fine-tuning (SSFT) of self-supervised learning (SSL)-based speech models to obtain task-specific representations. These task-specific representations are used for robust performance on various downstream tasks by fine-tuning on the labelled data. This work presents a cost-effective SSFT method named Self-supervised Correspondence (SCORE) fine-tuning to adapt the SSL speech representations for content-related tasks. The proposed method uses a correspondence training strategy, aiming to learn similar representations from perturbed speech and original speech. Commonly used data augmentation techniques for content-related tasks (ASR) are applied to obtain perturbed speech. SCORE fine-tuned HuBERT outperforms the vanilla HuBERT on SUPERB benchmark with only a few hours of fine-tuning (&lt; 5 hrs) on a single GPU for automatic speech recognition, phoneme recognition, and query-by-example tasks, with relative improvements of 1.09%, 3.58%, and 12.65%, respectively. SCORE provides competitive results with the recently proposed SSFT method SPIN, using only 1/3 of the processed speech compared to SPIN.</description>

      <title>Multilingual Turn-taking Prediction Using Voice Activity Projection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the application of voice activity projection (VAP), a predictive turn-taking model for spoken dialogue, on multilingual data, encompassing English, Mandarin, and Japanese. The VAP model continuously predicts the upcoming voice activities of participants in dyadic dialogue, leveraging a cross-attention Transformer to capture the dynamic interplay between participants. The results show that a monolingual VAP model trained on one language does not make good predictions when applied to other languages. However, a multilingual model, trained on all three languages, demonstrates predictive performance on par with monolingual models across all languages. Further analyses show that the multilingual model has learned to discern the language of the input signal. We also analyze the sensitivity to pitch, a prosodic cue that is thought to be important for turn-taking. Finally, we compare two different audio encoders, contrastive predictive coding (CPC) pre-trained on English, with a recent model based on multilingual wav2vec 2.0 (MMS).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Echolocation is the prime sensing modality for many species of bats, who show the intricate ability to perform a plethora of tasks in complex and unstructured environments. Understanding this exceptional feat of sensorimotor interaction is a key aspect into building more robust and performant man-made sonar sensors. In order to better understand the underlying perception mechanisms it is important to get a good insight into the nature of the reflected signals that the bat perceives. While ensonification experiments are in important way to better understand the nature of these signals, they are as time-consuming to perform as they are informative. In this paper we present SonoTraceLab, an open-source software package for simulating both technical as well as biological sonar systems in complex scenes. Using simulation approaches can drastically increase insights into the nature of biological echolocation systems, while reducing the time- and material complexity of performing them.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2010.02977v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a non-parallel any-to-many voice conversion (VC) method termed VoiceGrad. Inspired by WaveGrad, a recently introduced novel waveform generation method, VoiceGrad is based upon the concepts of score matching and Langevin dynamics. It uses weighted denoising score matching to train a score approximator, a fully convolutional network with a U-Net structure designed to predict the gradient of the log density of the speech feature sequences of multiple speakers, and performs VC by using annealed Langevin dynamics to iteratively update an input feature sequence towards the nearest stationary point of the target distribution based on the trained score approximator network. Thanks to the nature of this concept, VoiceGrad enables any-to-many VC, a VC scenario in which the speaker of input speech can be arbitrary, and allows for non-parallel training, which requires no parallel utterances or transcriptions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.13189v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transformers, which were originally developed for natural language processing, have recently generated significant interest in the computer vision and audio communities due to their flexibility in learning long-range relationships. Constrained by the data hungry nature of transformers and the limited amount of labelled data, most transformer-based models for audio tasks are finetuned from ImageNet pretrained models, despite the huge gap between the domain of natural images and audio. This has motivated the research in self-supervised pretraining of audio transformers, which reduces the dependency on large amounts of labeled data and focuses on extracting concise representations of audio spectrograms. In this paper, we propose \textbf{L}ocal-\textbf{G}lobal \textbf{A}udio \textbf{S}pectrogram v\textbf{I}sion \textbf{T}ransformer, namely ASiT, a novel self-supervised learning framework that captures local and global contextual information by employing group masked model learning and self-distillation. We evaluate our pretrained models on both audio and speech classification tasks, including audio event classification, keyword spotting, and speaker identification. We further conduct comprehensive ablation studies, including evaluations of different pretraining strategies. The proposed ASiT framework significantly boosts the performance on all tasks and sets a new state-of-the-art performance in five audio and speech classification tasks, outperforming recent methods, including the approaches that use additional datasets for pretraining.</description>

      <title>DistriBlock: Identifying adversarial audio samples by leveraging characteristics of the output distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.17000v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Adversarial attacks can mislead automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems into predicting an arbitrary target text, thus posing a clear security threat. To prevent such attacks, we propose DistriBlock, an efficient detection strategy applicable to any ASR system that predicts a probability distribution over output tokens in each time step. We measure a set of characteristics of this distribution: the median, maximum, and minimum over the output probabilities, the entropy of the distribution, as well as the Kullback-Leibler and the Jensen-Shannon divergence with respect to the distributions of the subsequent time step. Then, by leveraging the characteristics observed for both benign and adversarial data, we apply binary classifiers, including simple threshold-based classification, ensembles of such classifiers, and neural networks. Through extensive analysis across different state-of-the-art ASR systems and language data sets, we demonstrate the supreme performance of this approach, with a mean area under the receiver operating characteristic for distinguishing target adversarial examples against clean and noisy data of 99% and 97%, respectively. To assess the robustness of our method, we show that adaptive adversarial examples that can circumvent DistriBlock are much noisier, which makes them easier to detect through filtering and creates another avenue for preserving the system's robustness.</description>

      <title>Beyond-Voice: Towards Continuous 3D Hand Pose Tracking on Commercial Home Assistant Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.17477v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The surging popularity of home assistants and their voice user interface (VUI) have made them an ideal central control hub for smart home devices. However, current form factors heavily rely on VUI, which poses accessibility and usability issues; some latest ones are equipped with additional cameras and displays, which are costly and raise privacy concerns. These concerns jointly motivate Beyond-Voice, a novel high-fidelity acoustic sensing system that allows commodity home assistant devices to track and reconstruct hand poses continuously. It transforms the home assistant into an active sonar system using its existing onboard microphones and speakers. We feed a high-resolution range profile to the deep learning model that can analyze the motions of multiple body parts and predict the 3D positions of 21 finger joints, bringing the granularity for acoustic hand tracking to the next level. It operates across different environments and users without the need for personalized training data. A user study with 11 participants in 3 different environments shows that Beyond-Voice can track joints with an average mean absolute error of 16.47mm without any training data provided by the testing subject.</description>

      <title>Fewer-token Neural Speech Codec with Time-invariant Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00014v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Language model based text-to-speech (TTS) models, like VALL-E, have gained attention for their outstanding in-context learning capability in zero-shot scenarios. Neural speech codec is a critical component of these models, which can convert speech into discrete token representations. However, excessive token sequences from the codec may negatively affect prediction accuracy and restrict the progression of Language model based TTS models. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel neural speech codec with time-invariant codes named TiCodec. By encoding and quantizing time-invariant information into a separate code, TiCodec can reduce the amount of frame-level information that needs encoding, effectively decreasing the number of tokens as codes of speech. Furthermore, this paper introduces a time-invariant encoding consistency loss to enhance the consistency of time-invariant code within an utterance and force it to capture more global information, which can benefit the zero-shot TTS task. Experimental results demonstrate that TiCodec can not only enhance the quality of reconstruction speech with fewer tokens but also increase the similarity and naturalness, as well as reduce the word error rate of the synthesized speech by the TTS model.</description>

      <title>DiffAR: Denoising Diffusion Autoregressive Model for Raw Speech Waveform Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01381v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion models have recently been shown to be relevant for high-quality speech generation. Most work has been focused on generating spectrograms, and as such, they further require a subsequent model to convert the spectrogram to a waveform (i.e., a vocoder). This work proposes a diffusion probabilistic end-to-end model for generating a raw speech waveform. The proposed model is autoregressive, generating overlapping frames sequentially, where each frame is conditioned on a portion of the previously generated one. Hence, our model can effectively synthesize an unlimited speech duration while preserving high-fidelity synthesis and temporal coherence. We implemented the proposed model for unconditional and conditional speech generation, where the latter can be driven by an input sequence of phonemes, amplitudes, and pitch values. Working on the waveform directly has some empirical advantages. Specifically, it allows the creation of local acoustic behaviors, like vocal fry, which makes the overall waveform sounds more natural. Furthermore, the proposed diffusion model is stochastic and not deterministic; therefore, each inference generates a slightly different waveform variation, enabling abundance of valid realizations. Experiments show that the proposed model generates speech with superior quality compared with other state-of-the-art neural speech generation systems.</description>

      <title>First-Shot Unsupervised Anomalous Sound Detection With Unknown Anomalies Estimated by Metadata-Assisted Audio Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14173v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: First-shot (FS) unsupervised anomalous sound detection (ASD) is a brand-new task introduced in DCASE 2023 Challenge Task 2, where the anomalous sounds for the target machine types are unseen in training. Existing methods often rely on the availability of normal and abnormal sound data from the target machines. However, due to the lack of anomalous sound data for the target machine types, it becomes challenging when adapting the existing ASD methods to the first-shot task. In this paper, we propose a new framework for the first-shot unsupervised ASD, where metadata-assisted audio generation is used to estimate unknown anomalies, by utilising the available machine information (i.e., metadata and sound data) to fine-tune a text-to-audio generation model for generating the anomalous sounds that contain unique acoustic characteristics accounting for each different machine type. We then use the method of Time-Weighted Frequency domain audio Representation with Gaussian Mixture Model (TWFR-GMM) as the backbone to achieve the first-shot unsupervised ASD. Our proposed FS-TWFR-GMM method achieves competitive performance amongst top systems in DCASE 2023 Challenge Task 2, while requiring only 1% model parameters for detection, as validated in our experiments.</description>

      <title>MART: Learning Hierarchical Music Audio Representations with Part-Whole Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06197v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent research in self-supervised contrastive learning of music representations has demonstrated remarkable results across diverse downstream tasks. However, a prevailing trend in existing methods involves representing equally-sized music clips in either waveform or spectrogram formats, often overlooking the intrinsic part-whole hierarchies within music. In our quest to comprehend the bottom-up structure of music, we introduce MART, a hierarchical music representation learning approach that facilitates feature interactions among cropped music clips while considering their part-whole hierarchies. Specifically, we propose a hierarchical part-whole transformer to capture the structural relationships between music clips in a part-whole hierarchy. Furthermore, a hierarchical contrastive learning objective is crafted to align part-whole music representations at adjacent levels, progressively establishing a multi-hierarchy representation space. The effectiveness of our music representation learning from part-whole hierarchies has been empirically validated across multiple downstream tasks, including music classification and cover song identification.</description>

      <title>Breaking Speaker Recognition with PaddingBack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.04179v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) has gained popularity due to advancements in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). However, untrusted third-party platforms have raised concerns about AI security, particularly in backdoor attacks. Recent research has shown that speech backdoors can utilize transformations as triggers, similar to image backdoors. However, human ears can easily be aware of these transformations, leading to suspicion. In this paper, we propose PaddingBack, an inaudible backdoor attack that utilizes malicious operations to generate poisoned samples, rendering them indistinguishable from clean ones. Instead of using external perturbations as triggers, we exploit the widely-used speech signal operation, padding, to break speaker recognition systems. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving a significant attack success rate while retaining benign accuracy. Furthermore, PaddingBack demonstrates the ability to resist defense methods and maintain its stealthiness against human perception.</description>

      <title>Improving Audio-Visual Speech Recognition by Lip-Subword Correlation Based Visual Pre-training and Cross-Modal Fusion Encoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.08488v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent research, slight performance improvement is observed from automatic speech recognition systems to audio-visual speech recognition systems in the end-to-end framework with low-quality videos. Unmatching convergence rates and specialized input representations between audio and visual modalities are considered to cause the problem. In this paper, we propose two novel techniques to improve audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR) under a pre-training and fine-tuning training framework. First, we explore the correlation between lip shapes and syllable-level subword units in Mandarin to establish good frame-level syllable boundaries from lip shapes. This enables accurate alignment of video and audio streams during visual model pre-training and cross-modal fusion. Next, we propose an audio-guided cross-modal fusion encoder (CMFE) neural network to utilize main training parameters for multiple cross-modal attention layers to make full use of modality complementarity. Experiments on the MISP2021-AVSR data set show the effectiveness of the two proposed techniques. Together, using only a relatively small amount of training data, the final system achieves better performances than state-of-the-art systems with more complex front-ends and back-ends.</description>

      <title>SPGM: Prioritizing Local Features for enhanced speech separation performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.12608v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dual-path is a popular architecture for speech separation models (e.g. Sepformer) which splits long sequences into overlapping chunks for its intra- and inter-blocks that separately model intra-chunk local features and inter-chunk global relationships. However, it has been found that inter-blocks, which comprise half a dual-path model's parameters, contribute minimally to performance. Thus, we propose the Single-Path Global Modulation (SPGM) block to replace inter-blocks. SPGM is named after its structure consisting of a parameter-free global pooling module followed by a modulation module comprising only 2% of the model's total parameters. The SPGM block allows all transformer layers in the model to be dedicated to local feature modelling, making the overall model single-path. SPGM achieves 22.1 dB SI-SDRi on WSJ0-2Mix and 20.4 dB SI-SDRi on Libri2Mix, exceeding the performance of Sepformer by 0.5 dB and 0.3 dB respectively and matches the performance of recent SOTA models with up to 8 times fewer parameters.

      <title>EMO-SUPERB: An In-depth Look at Speech Emotion Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13018v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Speech emotion recognition (SER) is a pivotal technology for human-computer interaction systems. However, 80.77% of SER papers yield results that cannot be reproduced. We develop EMO-SUPERB, short for EMOtion Speech Universal PERformance Benchmark, which aims to enhance open-source initiatives for SER. EMO-SUPERB includes a user-friendly codebase to leverage 15 state-of-the-art speech self-supervised learning models (SSLMs) for exhaustive evaluation across six open-source SER datasets. EMO-SUPERB streamlines result sharing via an online leaderboard, fostering collaboration within a community-driven benchmark and thereby enhancing the development of SER. On average, 2.58% of annotations are annotated using natural language. SER relies on classification models and is unable to process natural languages, leading to the discarding of these valuable annotations. We prompt ChatGPT to mimic annotators, comprehend natural language annotations, and subsequently re-label the data. By utilizing labels generated by ChatGPT, we consistently achieve an average relative gain of 3.08% across all settings.</description>
