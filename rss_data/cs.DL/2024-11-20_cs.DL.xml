      <title>Quantifying the Innovativeness of Celebrated Scientists and Their Embeddedness in Collaboration Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Matthew effects, or the tendency for early achievements in science to lead to more recognition and opportunities, are a potential source of stratification and lost innovation when they draw unreasonable attention away from equally innovative but less celebrated scholars. Here, we analyze whether prizewinners produce more innovative works before and after being awarded a prize compared to equivalently impactful non-prizewinning contenders. Our data covers the careers of prizewinners and their dynamically matched non-prizewinners, a longitudinal, science-wide sample of 23,562 scholars and 5.7 million publications. We measured the innovativeness of prizewinners' and non-prizewinners' publications in terms of their novelty, convergent thinking, and interdisciplinarity. We find that prizewinners display distinctive forms of innovativeness relative to their non-prizewinning counterparts in terms of combining ideas in novel ways, bridging foundational and cutting-edge work on a topic, and formulating approaches to problems that leverage the strengths of interdisciplinarity. Further, prizewinners' innovativeness is strongly predicted by their type of network embeddedness. In contrast to matched non-prizewinners, prizewinners have shorter-term collaborations, their collaborators tend to focus their attention on topics that are new to the prizewinners, and their collaborators' collaborators have minimal overlap.</description>
