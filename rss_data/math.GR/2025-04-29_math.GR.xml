      <title>On the almost algebraicity of groups of automorphisms of connected Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected Lie group, $C$ be the maximal compact connected subgroup of the center of $G$, and let Aut$(G)$ denote the group of Lie automorphisms of $G$, viewed, canonically, also as a subgroup of GL$(\frak G)$, where $\frak G$ is the Lie algebra of $G$. It is known (see Dani (1992) and Previts-Wu (2001)) that when $C$ is trivial Aut$(G)$ is almost algebraic, in the sense that it is open in an algebraic subgroup of GL$(\frak G)$, and in particular has only finitely many connected components. In this paper we analyse the situation further in this respect, with $C$ possibly nontrivial, and identify obstructions for almost algebraicity to hold; the criteria are in terms of the group of restrictions of automorphisms of $G$ to $C$, and the abelian quotient Lie group $G/\overline{[G,G]}C$ (see Theorem 1.1 for details). For the class of Lie groups which admit a finite-dimensional representation with discrete kernel (called class $\mathcal{C}$ groups) this yields a more precise description as to when Aut$(G)$ is almost algebraic (see Corollary 1.3), while in the general case a variety of patterns are observed (see \S 6). Along the way we also study almost algebraicity of subgroups of Aut$(G)$ fixing each point of a given torus in $G$, containing $C$ (see in particular Theorem 1.5), which also turns out to be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>On Simply Connected Quandles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we provide an alternative characterization of finite simply connected quandles involving only cocycles with values in abelian groups of prime size. As a corollary of such a characterization and the classification of connected quandles of size $p^2$ and $p^3$ we obtain a classification of simply connected quandles of size $p^2$ (already obtained with a different method in \cite{VV}) and $p^3$ for $p&gt;3$ using a method that works for quandles of size $p^n$ for arbitrary $n$. We also classify the simply connected quandles within two subclasses of finite involutory quandles: nilpotent latin quandles and core quandles.</description>

      <title>Components and realizability of fusion systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For $p=2$ it is known that a saturated fusion system is realizable if and only if each of its components is realizable by a finite quasisimple group. For odd primes $p$ this is false. Building on work of Broto, M{\o}ller, Oliver, and Ruiz, we show however that a fusion system $\mathcal{F}$ is realizable if and only if for each of its components $\mathcal{C}$ there exists a realizable subnormal subsystem $\mathcal{E}$ of $\mathcal{F}$ with $O^{p^\prime}(\mathcal{E})=\mathcal{C}$.</description>

      <title>A Group Theoretic Construction of Batch Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Batch codes serve as critical tools for load balancing in distributed storage systems. While numerous constructions exist for specific batch sizes t, current methodologies predominantly rely on code dimension parameters, limiting their adaptability. Practical implementations, however, demand versatile batch code designs capable of accommodating arbitrary batch sizes-a challenge that remains understudied in the literature. This paper introduces a novel framework for constructing batch codes through finite groups and their subgroup structures, building on the quasi-uniform group code framework proposed by Chan et al. By leveraging algebraic properties of groups, the proposed method enables systematic code construction, streamlined decoding procedures, and efficient reconstruction of information symbols. Unlike traditional linear codes, quasi-uniform codes exhibit broader applicability due to their inherent structural flexibility.
  Focusing on abelian 2-groups, the work investigates their subgroup lattices and demonstrates their utility in code design-a contribution of independent theoretical interest. The resulting batch codes achieve near-optimal code lengths and exhibit potential for dual application as locally repairable codes (LRCs), addressing redundancy and fault tolerance in distributed systems. This study not only advances batch code construction but also establishes group-theoretic techniques as a promising paradigm for future research in coded storage systems. By bridging algebraic structures with practical coding demands, the approach opens new directions for optimizing distributed storage architectures.</description>

      <title>Homological dimension of discrete subgroups in higher rank Lie groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this short note, we improve on a recent result by the authors. We show that infinite volume torsion free discrete subgroups of higher rank Lie groups have homological dimension gap at least one-eighth of the real rank, provided the injectivity radius of the quotient manifold is uniformly bounded from zero.</description>

      <title>Reduced Random Walks in the Hyperbolic Plane$\hspace{1pt}!\hspace{-3.8pt}?$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Lam's reduced random walk in a hyperbolic triangle group, which we view as a random walk in the upper half-plane. We prove that this walk converges almost surely to a point on the extended real line. We devote special attention to the reduced random walk in $PGL_2(\mathbb{Z})$ (i.e., the $(2,3,\infty)$ triangle group). In this case, we provide an explicit formula for the cumulative distribution function of the limit. This formula is written in terms of the interrobang function, a new function $!\hspace{-3.8pt}?\colon[0,1]\to\mathbb{R}$ that shares several of the remarkable analytic and arithmetic properties of Minkowski's question-mark function.</description>

      <title>On the Complexity of Identifying Groups without Abelian Normal Subgroups: Parallel, First Order, and GI-Hardness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we exhibit an $\textsf{AC}^{3}$ isomorphism test for groups without Abelian normal subgroups (a.k.a. Fitting-free groups), a class for which isomorphism testing was previously known to be in $\mathsf{P}$ (Babai, Codenotti, and Qiao; ICALP '12). Here, we leverage the fact that $G/\text{PKer}(G)$ can be viewed as permutation group of degree $O(\log |G|)$. As $G$ is given by its multiplication table, we are able to implement the solution for the corresponding instance of Twisted Code Equivalence in $\textsf{AC}^{3}$.
  In sharp contrast, we show that when our groups are specified by a generating set of permutations, isomorphism testing of Fitting-free groups is at least as hard as Graph Isomorphism and Linear Code Equivalence (the latter being $\textsf{GI}$-hard and having no known subexponential-time algorithm).
  Lastly, we show that any Fitting-free group of order $n$ is identified by $\textsf{FO}$ formulas (without counting) using only $O(\log \log n)$ variables. This is in contrast to the fact that there are infinite families of Abelian groups that are not identified by $\textsf{FO}$ formulas with $o(\log n)$ variables (Grochow &amp; Levet, FCT '23).</description>

      <title>On the cut-set of the Gruenberg-Kegel graph of a finite solvable group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.03723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.03723v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma(G)$ be the Gruenberg-Kegel graph of a finite group $G$. We prove that if $G$ is solvable and $\sigma$ is a cut-set for $\Gamma(G)$, then $G$ has a $\sigma$-series of length $5$ whose factors are controlled. As a consequence, we prove that if $G$ is a solvable group and $\Gamma(G)$ has a cut-vertex $p$, then the Fitting length $\ell_F(G)$ of $G$ is bounded and the bound obtained is the best possible. A cut-set is said \emph{minimal} if it does not contain any other proper subset that is a cut-set for the graph. For a finite solvable group $G$, we give a geometrical description of $\Gamma(G)$ when it has a minimal cut-set of size $2$, for a finite solvable group $G$.</description>

      <title>Algebraically hyperbolic groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2112.01331v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We initiate the study of torsion-free algebraically hyperbolic groups; these groups generalise torsion-free hyperbolic groups and are intricately related to groups with no Baumslag--Solitar subgroups. Indeed, for groups of cohomological dimension $2$ we prove that algebraic hyperbolicity is equivalent to containing no Baumslag--Solitar subgroups. This links algebraically hyperbolic groups to two famous questions of Gromov; recent work has shown these questions to have negative answers in general, but they remain open for groups of cohomological dimension $2$.
  We also prove that algebraically hyperbolic groups are CSA, and so have canonical abelian JSJ-decompositions. In the two-generated case we give a precise description of the form of these decompositions.</description>

Abstract: Let $X$ be a finite, 2-dimensional cell complex. The curvature invariants $\rho_\pm(X)$ and $\sigma_\pm(X)$ were defined in [13], and a programme of conjectures was outlined. Here, we prove the foundational result that the quantities $\rho_\pm(X)$ and $\sigma_\pm(X)$ are the extrema of explicit rational linear-programming problems. As a result they are rational, realised, and can be computed algorithmically.</description>

Abstract: We characterize those 1-ended word hyperbolic groups whose Gromov boundaries are homeomorphic to trees of graphs (i.e. to inverse limits of graphs that have particularly simple finitary descriptions). These are groups with the simplest connected Gromov boundaries of topological dimension 1. The characterization is expressed in terms of algebraic properties of the Bowditch JSJ splitting of the corresponding groups (i.e. the canonical JSJ splitting over 2-ended subgroups).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06914v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We characterize twisted right-angled Artin groups (T-RAAGs) that are subgroup separable using only their defining mixed graphs: such a group is subgroup separable if and only if the underlying simplicial graph contains neither induced paths nor squares on four vertices. This generalizes the results of Metaftsis-Raptis on classical right-angled Artin groups. Additionally, we show that the subgroup membership problem is decidable when the group is coherent, which occurs precisely when the defining mixed graph is chordal. We also address the rational and submonoid membership problems by exhibiting a cone-family of graphs for which the corresponding T-RAAGs have decidable rational and submonoid membership problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17459v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The method of range decreasing group homomorphisms can be applied to study various maps between mapping spaces, includin holomorphic maps, group homomorphisms, linear maps, semigroup homomorphisms, Lie algebra homomorphisms and algebra homomorphisms [Z1, Z2]. Previous studies on range decreasing group homomorphisms have primarily focused on specific subsets of mapping groups. In this paper, we provide a characterization of a general range decreasing group homomorphism applicable to the entire mapping group. As applications, we compute a particular class of homomorphisms between mapping groups and identify all range decreasing group homomorphisms defined on specific mapping groups.</description>

Abstract: We determine the structure of the finite non-solvable groups of order divisible by $3$ all whose maximal subgroups of order divisible by $3$ are supersolvable. Precisely, we demonstrate that if $G$ is a finite non-solvable group satisfying the above condition on maximal subgroups, then either $G$ is a $3'$-group or $G/{\bf O}_{3'}(G)$ is isomorphic to ${\rm PSL}_2(2^p)$ for an odd prime $p$, where ${\bf O}_{3'}(G)$ denotes the largest normal $3'$-subgroup of $G$. Furthermore, in the latter case, ${\bf O}_{3'}(G)$ is nilpotent and ${\bf O}_2(G)\leq {\bf Z}(G)$.</description>

      <title>Rowmotion on fences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2108.12443v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A fence is a poset with elements F = {x_1, x_2, ..., x_n} and covers x_1 &lt; x_2 &lt; ... &lt; x_a &gt; x_{a+1} &gt; ... &gt; x_b &lt; x_{b+1} &lt; ... where a, b, ... are positive integers. We investigate rowmotion on antichains and ideals of F. In particular, we show that orbits of antichains can be visualized using tilings. This permits us to prove various homomesy results for the number of elements of an antichain or ideal in an orbit. Rowmotion on fences also exhibits a new phenomenon, which we call homometry, where the value of a statistic is constant on orbits of the same size. Along the way, we prove a general homomesy result for all self-dual posets. We end with some conjectures and avenues for future research.</description>

      <title>Jordan and Cartan spectra in higher rank with applications to correlations</title>

Abstract: For a given $d$-tuple $\rho=(\rho_1,\dots,\rho_d):\Gamma \to G$ of faithful Zariski dense convex cocompact representations of a finitely generated group $\Gamma$, we study the correlations of length spectra $\{\ell_{\rho_i(\gamma)}\}_{[\gamma]\in[\Gamma]}$ and correlations of displacement spectra $\{\mathsf{d}(\rho_i(\gamma)o,o)\}_{\gamma\in\Gamma}$. We prove that for any interior vector $\mathsf v=(v_1,\dots,v_d)$ in the spectrum cone, there exists $\delta_\rho(\mathsf v) &gt; 0$ such that for any $\epsilon_1, \dots, \epsilon_d&gt;0$, there exist $c_1,c_2&gt; 0$ such that\begin{align*}&amp;\#\{[\gamma]\in [\Gamma]: v_iT \le \ell_{\rho_i(\gamma)} \le v_i T+\epsilon_i, \;1 \le i \le d\} \sim c_1 \frac{e^{\delta_\rho (\mathsf v)T}}{ T^{{(d+1)}/{2}}};\\&amp;\#\{\gamma\in \Gamma: v_iT \le \mathsf{d}(\rho_i(\gamma)o,o) \le v_i T+\epsilon_i, \;1 \le i \le d\} \sim c_2 \frac{e^{\delta_\rho (\mathsf v)T}}{ T^{{(d-1)}/{2}}}.\end{align*} The special case where $\Gamma$ is a surface group, $G=PSL_2(\mathbb R)$, and $\mathsf v=(1,1)$ was obtained by Schwarz and Sharp in 1993. We deduce this result as a special case of our main theorem on the distribution of Jordan projections with holonomies and Cartan projections in tubes of an Anosov subgroup $\Gamma$ of a semisimple real algebraic group $G$. We also show that the growth indicator of $\Gamma$ remains the same when we use Jordan projections instead of Cartan projections and tubes instead of cones.</description>

      <title>Complexity of Minimal Faithful Permutation Degree for Fitting-free Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16039v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the complexity of computing the minimal faithful permutation degree for groups without abelian normal subgroups. When our groups are given as quotients of permutation groups, we establish that this problem is in $\textsf{P}$. Furthermore, in the setting of permutation groups, we obtain an upper bound of $\textsf{NC}$ for this problem. This improves upon the work of Das and Thakkar (STOC 2024), who established a Las Vegas polynomial-time algorithm for this class in the setting of permutation groups.</description>
