      <title>An Oracle with no $\mathrm{UP}$-Complete Sets, but $\mathrm{NP}=\mathrm{PSPACE}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct an oracle relative to which $\mathrm{NP} = \mathrm{PSPACE}$, but $\mathrm{UP}$ has no many-one complete sets. This combines the properties of an oracle by Hartmanis and Hemachandra [HH88] and one by Ogiwara and Hemachandra [OH93].
  The oracle provides new separations of classical conjectures on optimal proof systems and complete sets in promise classes. This answers several questions by Pudl\'ak [Pud17], e.g., the implications $\mathsf{UP} \Longrightarrow \mathsf{CON}^{\mathsf{N}}$ and $\mathsf{SAT} \Longrightarrow \mathsf{TFNP}$ are false relative to our oracle.
  Moreover, the oracle demonstrates that, in principle, it is possible that $\mathrm{TFNP}$-complete problems exist, while at the same time $\mathrm{SAT}$ has no p-optimal proof systems.</description>

      <title>Fault-tolerant compiling of classically hard IQP circuits on hypercubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Realizing computationally complex quantum circuits in the presence of noise and imperfections is a challenging task. While fault-tolerant quantum computing provides a route to reducing noise, it requires a large overhead for generic algorithms. Here, we develop and analyze a hardware-efficient, fault-tolerant approach to realizing complex sampling circuits. We co-design the circuits with the appropriate quantum error correcting codes for efficient implementation in a reconfigurable neutral atom array architecture, constituting what we call a fault-tolerant compilation of the sampling algorithm. Specifically, we consider a family of $[[2^D , D, 2]]$ quantum error detecting codes whose transversal and permutation gate set can realize arbitrary degree-$D$ instantaneous quantum polynomial (IQP) circuits. Using native operations of the code and the atom array hardware, we compile a fault-tolerant and fast-scrambling family of such IQP circuits in a hypercube geometry, realized recently in the experiments by Bluvstein et al. [Nature 626, 7997 (2024)]. We develop a theory of second-moment properties of degree-$D$ IQP circuits for analyzing hardness and verification of random sampling by mapping to a statistical mechanics model. We provide evidence that sampling from hypercube IQP circuits is classically hard to simulate and analyze the linear cross-entropy benchmark (XEB) in comparison to the average fidelity. To realize a fully scalable approach, we first show that Bell sampling from degree-$4$ IQP circuits is classically intractable and can be efficiently validated. We further devise new families of $[[O(d^D),D,d]]$ color codes of increasing distance $d$, permitting exponential error suppression for transversal IQP sampling. Our results highlight fault-tolerant compiling as a powerful tool in co-designing algorithms with specific error-correcting codes and realistic hardware.</description>

      <title>Complexity of Round-Robin Allocation with Potentially Noisy Queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the complexity of a fundamental algorithm for fairly allocating indivisible items, the round-robin algorithm. For $n$ agents and $m$ items, we show that the algorithm can be implemented in time $O(nm\log(m/n))$ in the worst case. If the agents' preferences are uniformly random, we establish an improved (expected) running time of $O(nm + m\log m)$. On the other hand, assuming comparison queries between items, we prove that $\Omega(nm + m\log m)$ queries are necessary to implement the algorithm, even when randomization is allowed. We also derive bounds in noise models where the answers to queries are incorrect with some probability. Our proofs involve novel applications of tools from multi-armed bandit, information theory, as well as posets and linear extensions.</description>

      <title>Problems in NP can Admit Double-Exponential Lower Bounds when Parameterized by Treewidth or Vertex Cover</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.08149v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Treewidth (tw) is an important parameter that, when bounded, yields tractability for many problems. For example, graph problems expressible in Monadic Second Order (MSO) logic and QUANTIFIED SAT or, more generally, QUANTIFIED CSP, are FPT parameterized by the tw of the input's (primal) graph plus the length of the MSO-formula [Courcelle, Information &amp; Computation 1990] and the quantifier rank [Chen, ECAI 2004], resp. The algorithms from these (meta-)results have running times whose dependence on tw is a tower of exponents. A conditional lower bound by Fichte et al. [LICS 2020] shows that, for QUANTIFIED SAT, the height of this tower is equal to the number of quantifier alternations. Lower bounds showing that at least double-exponential factors in the running time are necessary are rare: there are very few (for tw and vertex cover vc parameterizations) and they are for problems that are complete for #NP, $\Sigma_2^p$, $\Pi_2^p$, or higher levels of the polynomial hierarchy.
  We show, for the first time, that it is not necessary to go higher up in the polynomial hierarchy to obtain such lower bounds. We design a novel, yet simple versatile technique based on Sperner families to obtain such lower bounds and apply it to 3 problems: METRIC DIMENSION, STRONG METRIC DIMENSION, and GEODETIC SET. We prove that they do not admit $2^{2^{o(tw)}} \cdot n^{O(1)}$-time algorithms, even on bounded diameter graphs, unless the ETH fails. For STRONG METRIC DIMENSION, the lower bound holds even for vc. We complement our lower bounds with matching upper bounds.</description>
