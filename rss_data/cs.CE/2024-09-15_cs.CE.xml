      <title>DIC2CAE: Calculating the stress intensity factors (KI-III) from 2D and stereo displacement fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrating experimental data into simulations is crucial for predicting material behaviour, especially in fracture mechanics. Digital Image Correlation (DIC) provides precise displacement measurements, essential for evaluating strain energy release rates and stress intensity factors (SIF) around cracks. Translating DIC data into CAE software like ABAQUS has been challenging. DIC2CAE, a MATLAB-based tool, automates this conversion, enabling accurate simulations. It uses the J-integral method to calculate SIFs and handles complex scenarios without needing specimen geometry or applied loads. DIC2CAE enhances fracture mechanics simulations' reliability, accelerating materials research and development.</description>

      <title>StockTime: A Time Series Specialized Large Language Model Architecture for Stock Price Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stock price prediction task holds a significant role in the financial domain and has been studied for a long time. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have brought new ways to improve these predictions. While recent financial large language models (FinLLMs) have shown considerable progress in financial NLP tasks compared to smaller pre-trained language models (PLMs), challenges persist in stock price forecasting. Firstly, effectively integrating the modalities of time series data and natural language to fully leverage these capabilities remains complex. Secondly, FinLLMs focus more on analysis and interpretability, which can overlook the essential features of time series data. Moreover, due to the abundance of false and redundant information in financial markets, models often produce less accurate predictions when faced with such input data. In this paper, we introduce StockTime, a novel LLM-based architecture designed specifically for stock price data. Unlike recent FinLLMs, StockTime is specifically designed for stock price time series data. It leverages the natural ability of LLMs to predict the next token by treating stock prices as consecutive tokens, extracting textual information such as stock correlations, statistical trends and timestamps directly from these stock prices. StockTime then integrates both textual and time series data into the embedding space. By fusing this multimodal data, StockTime effectively predicts stock prices across arbitrary look-back periods. Our experiments demonstrate that StockTime outperforms recent LLMs, as it gives more accurate predictions while reducing memory usage and runtime costs.</description>

      <title>LSR-IGRU: Stock Trend Prediction Based on Long Short-Term Relationships and Improved GRU</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stock price prediction is a challenging problem in the field of finance and receives widespread attention. In recent years, with the rapid development of technologies such as deep learning and graph neural networks, more research methods have begun to focus on exploring the interrelationships between stocks. However, existing methods mostly focus on the short-term dynamic relationships of stocks and directly integrating relationship information with temporal information. They often overlook the complex nonlinear dynamic characteristics and potential higher-order interaction relationships among stocks in the stock market. Therefore, we propose a stock price trend prediction model named LSR-IGRU in this paper, which is based on long short-term stock relationships and an improved GRU input. Firstly, we construct a long short-term relationship matrix between stocks, where secondary industry information is employed for the first time to capture long-term relationships of stocks, and overnight price information is utilized to establish short-term relationships. Next, we improve the inputs of the GRU model at each step, enabling the model to more effectively integrate temporal information and long short-term relationship information, thereby significantly improving the accuracy of predicting stock trend changes. Finally, through extensive experiments on multiple datasets from stock markets in China and the United States, we validate the superiority of the proposed LSR-IGRU model over the current state-of-the-art baseline models. We also apply the proposed model to the algorithmic trading system of a financial company, achieving significantly higher cumulative portfolio returns compared to other baseline methods.

      <title>MLP, XGBoost, KAN, TDNN, and LSTM-GRU Hybrid RNN with Attention for SPX and NDX European Call Option Pricing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06724v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the performance of various artificial neural network architectures, including a multilayer perceptron (MLP), Kolmogorov-Arnold network (KAN), LSTM-GRU hybrid recursive neural network (RNN) models, and a time-delay neural network (TDNN) for pricing European call options. In this study, we attempt to leverage the ability of supervised learning methods, such as ANNs, KANs, and gradient-boosted decision trees, to approximate complex multivariate functions in order to calibrate option prices based on past market data. The motivation for using ANNs and KANs is the Universal Approximation Theorem and Kolmogorov-Arnold Representation Theorem, respectively. Specifically, we use S\&amp;P 500 (SPX) and NASDAQ 100 (NDX) index options traded during 2015-2023 with times to maturity ranging from 15 days to over 4 years (OptionMetrics IvyDB US dataset). Black \&amp; Scholes's (BS) PDE \cite{Black1973} model's performance in pricing the same options compared to real data is used as a benchmark. This model relies on strong assumptions, and it has been observed and discussed in the literature that real data does not match its predictions. Supervised learning methods are widely used as an alternative for calibrating option prices due to some of the limitations of this model. In our experiments, the BS model underperforms compared to all of the others. Also, the best TDNN model outperforms the best MLP model on all error metrics. We implement a simple self-attention mechanism to enhance the RNN models, significantly improving their performance. The best-performing model overall is the LSTM-GRU hybrid RNN model with attention. Also, the KAN model outperforms the TDNN and MLP models. We analyze the performance of all models by ticker, moneyness category, and over/under/correctly-priced percentage.</description>
