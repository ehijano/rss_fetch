      <title>Helmholtz decompositions of horizontal structure functions including components associated with cyclone-anticyclone symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, several studies have been made in which atmospheric and oceanic data were used to decompose horizontal velocity statistics into a rotational component, associated with vertical vorticity, and a divergent component, associated with horizontal divergence. Making the assumption of statistical homogeneity in a horizontal plane, this can be accomplished by relating the rotational and divergent components of the difference between the velocities at two points to the corresponding longitudinal and transverse components, where the longitudinal and transverse directions are parallel respectively perpendicular to the line between the points. In previous studies, the decomposition has most often been made under the assumption of statistical isotropy. Some attempts have also been made to analyse the anisotropic problem. We derive the full anisotropic equations relating the rotational, divergent and the rotational-divergent components of the second order structure functions to the longitudinal, transverse and longitudinal-transverse components and solve the equations analytically. We also derive some results for third order structure functions, with special focus on the components associated with cyclone-anticyclone asymmetry. Based on the analysis of these components and results from previous analyses of aircraft data, it is concluded that there is an exclusively rotational flow component that is giving rise to strong dominance of cyclonic motions in the upper troposphere and a strong dominance of anticyclonic motions in the lower stratosphere in the range of scales from ten to one thousand km</description>

      <title>On the Peril of Inferring Phytoplankton Properties from Remote-Sensing Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since 1978, sensors on remote-sensing satellites have provided global, multi-band images at optical wavelengths to assess ocean color. In parallel, sophisticated radiative transfer models account for attenuation and emission by the Earth's atmosphere and ocean, thereby estimating the water-leaving radiance or and remote-sensing reflectance Rrs. From these Rrs measurements, estimates of the absorption and scattering by seawater are inferred. We emphasize an inherent, physical degeneracy in the radiative transfer equation that relates Rrs to the absorption and backscattering coefficients a and b_b, aka inherent optical properties (IOPs). Because Rrs depends solely on the ratio of b_b to a, meaning one cannot retrieve independent functions for the non-water IOPs, a_nw and b_bnw, without a priori knowledge. Moreover, water generally dominates scattering at blue wavelengths and absorption at red wavelengths, further limiting retrievals of IOPs in the presence of noise. We demonstrate that all previous and current multi-spectral satellite observations lack the statistical power to measure more than 3 parameters total to describe a_nw and b_bnw. Due to the ubiquitous exponential-like absorption by color dissolved organic matter at short wavelengths (l&lt;500nm), multi-spectral Rrs do not permit the detection of phytoplankton absorption a_ph without very strict priors. Furthermore, such priors lead to biased and uncertain retrievals of a_ph. Hyperspectral observations may recover a 4th and possibly 5th parameter describing only one or two aspects of the complexity of a_ph. These results cast doubt on decades of literature on IOP retrievals, including estimates of phytoplankton growth and biomass. We further conclude that NASA/PACE will greatly enhance our ability to measure the phytoplankton biomass of Earth, but challenges remain in resolving the IOPs.</description>

      <title>DUNE: A Machine Learning Deep UNet++ based Ensemble Approach to Monthly, Seasonal and Annual Climate Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Capitalizing on the recent availability of ERA5 monthly averaged long-term data records of mean atmospheric and climate fields based on high-resolution reanalysis, deep-learning architectures offer an alternative to physics-based daily numerical weather predictions for subseasonal to seasonal (S2S) and annual means. A novel Deep UNet++-based Ensemble (DUNE) neural architecture is introduced, employing multi-encoder-decoder structures with residual blocks. When initialized from a prior month or year, this architecture produced the first AI-based global monthly, seasonal, or annual mean forecast of 2-meter temperatures (T2m) and sea surface temperatures (SST). ERA5 monthly mean data is used as input for T2m over land, SST over oceans, and solar radiation at the top of the atmosphere for each month of 40 years to train the model. Validation forecasts are performed for an additional two years, followed by five years of forecast evaluations to account for natural annual variability. AI-trained inference forecast weights generate forecasts in seconds, enabling ensemble seasonal forecasts. Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Anomaly Correlation Coefficient (ACC), and Heidke Skill Score (HSS) statistics are presented globally and over specific regions. These forecasts outperform persistence, climatology, and multiple linear regression for all domains. DUNE forecasts demonstrate comparable statistical accuracy to NOAA's operational monthly and seasonal probabilistic outlook forecasts over the US but at significantly higher resolutions. RMSE and ACC error statistics for other recent AI-based daily forecasts also show superior performance for DUNE-based forecasts. The DUNE model's application to an ensemble data assimilation cycle shows comparable forecast accuracy with a single high-resolution model, potentially eliminating the need for retraining on extrapolated datasets.</description>

      <title>Interacting internal waves explain global patterns of interior ocean mixing</title>

Abstract: Across the stable density stratification of the abyssal ocean, deep dense water is slowly propelled upward by sustained, though irregular, turbulent mixing. The resulting mean upwelling determines large-scale oceanic circulation properties like heat and carbon transport. In the ocean interior, this turbulent mixing is caused mainly by breaking internal waves: generated predominantly by winds and tides, these waves interact nonlinearly, transferring energy downscale, and finally become unstable, break and mix the water column. This paradigm, long parameterized heuristically, still lacks full theoretical explanation. Here, we close this gap using wave-wave interaction theory with input from both localized and global observations. We find near-ubiquitous agreement between first-principle predictions and observed mixing patterns in the global ocean interior. Our findings lay the foundations for a wave-driven mixing parameterization for ocean general circulation models that is entirely physics-based, which is key to reliably represent future climate states that could differ substantially from today's.</description>

      <title>Identifying Three-Dimensional Radiative Patterns Associated with Early Tropical Cyclone Intensification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09493v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cloud radiative feedback impacts early tropical cyclone (TC) intensification, but limitations in existing diagnostic frameworks make them unsuitable for studying asymmetric or transient radiative heating. We propose a linear Variational Encoder-Decoder (VED) to learn the hidden relationship between radiation and the surface intensification of realistic simulated TCs. Limiting VED model inputs enables using its uncertainty to identify periods when radiation has more importance for intensification. A close examination of the extracted 3D radiative structures suggests that longwave radiative forcing from inner core deep convection and shallow clouds both contribute to intensification, with the deep convection having the most impact overall. We find that deep convection downwind of the shallow clouds is critical to the intensification of Haiyan. Our work demonstrates that machine learning can discover thermodynamic-kinematic relationships without relying on axisymmetric or deterministic assumptions, paving the way towards the objective discovery of processes leading to TC intensification in realistic conditions.</description>

      <title>Capturing the Variability of the Nocturnal Boundary Layer through Localized Perturbation Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07602v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A single-column model is used to investigate regime transitions within the stable atmospheric boundary layer, focusing on the role of small-scale fluctuations in wind and temperature dynamics and of turbulence intermittency as triggers for these transitions. Previous studies revealed abrupt near-surface temperature inversion transitions within a limited wind speed range. However, representing these transitions in numerical weather prediction (NWP) and climate models is a known difficulty. To shed light on boundary layer processes that explain these abrupt transitions, the Ekman layer height and its correlation with regime shifts are analyzed. A sensitivity study is performed with several types of perturbations of the wind and temperature tendencies, as well as with the inclusion of intermittent turbulent mixing through a stochastic stability function, to quantify the effect of small fluctuations of the dynamics on regime transitions. The combined results for all tested perturbation types indicate that small-scale phenomena can drive persistent regime transitions from very to weakly stable regimes, but for the opposite direction, no evidence of persistent regime transitions was found. The inclusion of intermittency prevents the model from getting trapped in the very stable regime, thus preventing the so-called "runaway cooling", an issue for commonly used short-tail stability functions. The findings suggest that using stochastic parameterizations of boundary layer processes, either through stochastically perturbed tendencies or parameters, is an effective approach to represent sharp transitions in the boundary layer regimes and is, therefore, a promising avenue to improve the representation of stable boundary layers in NWP and climate models.</description>

      <title>Residual Corrective Diffusion Modeling for Km-scale Atmospheric Downscaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15214v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The state of the art for physical hazard prediction from weather and climate requires expensive km-scale numerical simulations driven by coarser resolution global inputs. Here, a generative diffusion architecture is explored for downscaling such global inputs to km-scale, as a cost-effective machine learning alternative. The model is trained to predict 2km data from a regional weather model over Taiwan, conditioned on a 25km global reanalysis. To address the large resolution ratio, different physics involved at different scales and prediction of channels beyond those in the input data, we employ a two-step approach where a UNet predicts the mean and a corrector diffusion (CorrDiff) model predicts the residual. CorrDiff exhibits encouraging skill in bulk MAE and CRPS scores. The predicted spectra and distributions from CorrDiff faithfully recover important power law relationships in the target data. Case studies of coherent weather phenomena show that CorrDiff can help sharpen wind and temperature gradients that co-locate with intense rainfall in cold front, and can help intensify typhoons and synthesize rain band structures. Calibration of model uncertainty remains challenging. The prospect of unifying methods like CorrDiff with coarser resolution global weather models implies a potential for global-to-regional multi-scale machine learning simulation.</description>

      <title>Numerical simulations of the latest caldera-forming eruption of Okmok volcano, Alaska</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.05516v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The 2050 14C yBP caldera-forming eruption of Okmok volcano, Alaska, had a global atmospheric impact. The associated global climate cooling was driven by the amount of sulfur injected into the stratosphere during the climactic phase of the eruption. This phase was dominated by pyroclastic density currents, which have complex emplacement dynamics precluding direct estimates of the sulfur stratospheric load. We simulated the dynamics of the climactic phase with the two-phase flow model MFIX-TFM under axisymmetric conditions with several combinations of mass eruption rate, jet water content, vent size, particle size and density, topography, and emission duration. Results suggest that a steady mass eruption rate of 1.2-3.9e11 kg/s is consistent with field observations. Minimal stratospheric injections occur during emission as most of the volcanic gas is injected into the stratosphere by the buoyant liftoff of dilute parts of the currents at the end of the eruption. Overall, 58-64 wt percent of the total amount of gas emitted reaches the stratosphere. Combined with petrological estimates of the degassed S, our results suggest that the eruption injected 11 to 20 Tg S into the stratosphere, consistent with the subsequent climate response and Greenland ice sheet deposition. Our results also show that the combination of the source Richardson number and the mass eruption rate is able to characterize the buoyant-collapse transition at Okmok. We extended this result to 141 runs from 10 published numerical studies of eruptive jets and found that this regime diagram is able to capture the first-order layout of the buoyant-collapse transition in all studies except one. An existing multivariate criterion yields the best predictions of this regime transition.</description>

      <title>Symmetry breaking of rotating convection due to Non-Oberbeck-Boussinesq effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01721v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The non-Oberbeck--Boussinesq (NOB) effects arising from variations in thermal expansivity are theoretically and numerically studied in the context of rotating Rayleigh--B\'{e}nard convection in forms of two-dimensional (2D) rolls. The thermal expansivity increases with pressure (depth), and its variation is measured by a dimensionless factor $\epsilon$. Utilizing an asymptotic expansion with weak nonlinearity, we derive an amplitude equation, revealing that NOB effects amplify the magnitude of convection. An $\epsilon^2$-order NOB correction leads to a symmetry breaking about the horizontal mid-plane, manifested in the strengthening of convection near the bottom and its weakening near the top, forming bottom-heavy profiles. At $\epsilon^3$-order, the conjunction of NOB effects and nonlinear advection leads to a horizontal symmetry breaking. The values of Taylor number and Prandlt number determine whether upward or downward plumes are stronger. Numerical calculations validate the theoretical analyses in weakly nonlinear regime. This work advances our understanding of hydrothermal plumes in some winter lakes on Earth, and in the subglacial oceans on icy moons as well as tracer transport from the seafloor to the ice shell.</description>
