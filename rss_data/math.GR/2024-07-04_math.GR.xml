      <title>Conjugation groups and structure groups of quandles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quandles are certain algebraic structures showing up in different mathematical contexts. A group $G$ with the conjugation operation forms a quandle, $\operatorname{Conj}(G)$. In the opposite direction, one can construct a group $\operatorname{As}(Q)$ starting from any quandle $Q$. These groups are useful in practice, but hard to compute. We explore the group $\operatorname{As}(\operatorname{Conj}(G))$ for so-called $\overline{C}$-groups $G$. These are groups admitting a presentation with only conjugation and power relations. Symmetric groups $S_n$ are typical examples. We show that for $\overline{C}$-groups, $\operatorname{As}(\operatorname{Conj}(G))$ injects into $G \times \mathbb{Z}^m$, where $m$ is the number of conjugacy classes of $G$. From this we deduce information about the torsion, center, and derived group of $\operatorname{As}(\operatorname{Conj}(G))$. As an application, we compute the second quandle homology group of $\operatorname{Conj}(S_n)$ for all $n$, and unveil rich torsion therein.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove finiteness properties for groups of homeomorphisms that have finitely many "singular points", and we describe the normal structure of such groups. As an application, we prove that every countable abelian group can be embedded into a finitely presented simple group, verifying the Boone-Higman conjecture for countable abelian groups. Indeed, we describe a specific 2-generated, $\mathrm{F}_\infty$ simple group $V\mathcal{A}$ of homeomorphisms of the Cantor set that contains every countable abelian group. As a second application, we prove that if $G$ is a bounded automata group then the associated R\"over-Nekrashevych groups $V_{d,r}G$ have type $\mathrm{F}_\infty$, verifying a conjecture of Nekrashevych for a large class of contracting self-similar groups. Among others, this result applies to R\"{o}ver-Nekrashevych groups associated to Gupta-Sidki groups and the basilica group.</description>

      <title>The Lamplighter groups and Thompson's group $F$ have infinite weak-cop number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11996v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The weak-cop number of a graph, introduced by Lee et al (2023), is a quasi-isometric invariant of graphs and hence of finitely generated groups via their Cayley graphs. While for any $m\in\mathbb{Z}_+\cup\{\infty\}$ there exist graphs with weak-cop number $m$, it is an open question whether there exists finitely generated groups whose weak-cop number is different than $1$ and $\infty$. We prove that wreath products of nontrivial groups by infinite groups have infinite weak-cop number. We also prove that Thompson's group $F$ has infinite weak-cop number. The results are proved by defining two new pursuit and evasion games and proving the existence of strategies for the evader. In the case of Thompson's group $F$, we also present an alternative and more algebraic argument proving that it has infinite weak-cop number.</description>

      <title>Coloring Groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03092v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce coloring groups, which are permutation groups obtained from a proper edge coloring of a graph. These groups generalize the generalized toggle groups of Striker (which themselves generalize the toggle groups introduced by Cameron and Fon-der-Flaass). We present some general results connecting the structure of a coloring group to the structure of its graph coloring, providing graph-theoretic characterizations of the centralizer and primitivity of a coloring group. We apply these results particularly to generalized toggle groups arising from trees as well as coloring groups arising from the independence posets introduced by Thomas and Williams.</description>

      <title>The harmonic oscillator on the Moyal-Groenewold plane: an approach via Lie groups and twisted Weyl tuples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06143v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the functional calculus of the harmonic oscillator on each Moyal-Groenewold plane, the noncommutative phase space which is a fundamental object in quantum mechanics. Specifically, we show that the harmonic oscillator admits a bounded $\mathrm{H}^\infty(\Sigma_\omega)$ functional calculus for any angle $0 &lt; \omega &lt; \frac{\pi}{2}$ and even a bounded H\"ormander functional calculus on the associated noncommutative $\mathrm{L}^p$-spaces, where $\Sigma_\omega=\{ z \in \mathbb{C}^*: |\arg z| &lt;\omega \}$. To achieve these results, we develop a connection with the theory of 2-step nilpotent Lie groups by introducing a notion of twisted Weyl tuple and connecting it to some semigroups of operators previously investigated by Robinson via group representations. Along the way, we demonstrate that $\mathrm{L}^p$-square-max decompositions lead to new insights between noncommutative ergodic theory and $R$-boundedness, and we prove a twisted transference principle, which is of independent interest. Our approach accommodate the presence of a constant magnetic field and they are indeed new even in the framework of magnetic Weyl calculus on classical $\mathrm{L}^p$-spaces. Our results contribute to the understanding of functional calculi on noncommutative spaces and have implications for the maximal regularity of the most basic evolution equations associated to the harmonic oscillator.</description>
