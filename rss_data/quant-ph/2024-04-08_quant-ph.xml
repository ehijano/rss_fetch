      <title>Quantum Spin Chains and Symmetric Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the question of what quantum spin chains naturally encode in their Hilbert space. It turns out that quantum spin chains are rather rich systems, naturally encoding solutions to various problems in combinatorics, group theory, and algebraic geometry. In the case of the XX Heisenberg spin chain these are given by skew Kostka numbers, skew characters of the symmetric group, and Littlewood-Richardson coefficients. As we show, this is revealed by a fermionic representation of the theory of "quantized" symmetric functions formulated by Fomin and Greene, which provides a powerful framework for constructing operators extracting this data from the Hilbert space of quantum spin chains. Furthermore, these operators are diagonalized by the Bethe basis of the quantum spin chain. Underlying this is the fact that quantum spin chains are examples of "quantum integrable systems." This is somewhat analogous to bosons encoding permanents and fermions encoding determinants. This points towards considering quantum integrable systems, and the combinatorics associated with them, as potentially interesting targets for quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Is Intersubjectivity Proven? A Reply to Khrennikov and to QBists</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In two recent papers Khrennikov uses what he calls Ozawa intersubjectivity theorem to claim that intersubjectivity is necessarily verified in quantum mechanics and to criticize QBism and more generally all interpretations that are perspectival. In agreement with two previous QBist papers, I explain here why Khrennikov proof is not valid but in contrast with one of these papers, I criticize the way intersubjectivity is dealt with in QBism.</description>

      <title>Strong interactions between integrated microresonators and alkali atomic vapors: towards single-atom, single-photon operation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cavity quantum electrodynamics (cQED), the interaction of a two-level system with a high quality factor (Q) cavity, is a foundational building block in different architectures for quantum computation, communication, and metrology. The strong interaction between the atom and the cavity enables single photon operation which is required for quantum gates and sources. Cold atoms, quantum dots, and color centers in crystals are amongst the systems that have shown single photon operations, but they require significant physical infrastructure. Atomic vapors, on the other hand, require limited experimental infrastructure and are hence much easier to deploy outside a laboratory, but they produce an ensemble of moving atoms that results in short interaction times involving multiple atoms, which can hamper quantum operations. A solution to this issue can be found in nanophotonic cavities, where light-matter interaction is enhanced and the volume of operation is small, so that fast single-atom, single-photon operations are enabled. In this work, we study the interaction of an atomically-clad microring resonator (ACMRR) with different-sized ensembles of Rb atoms. We demonstrate strong coupling between an ensemble of ~50 atoms interacting with a high-quality factor (Q &gt; 4 x 10^5) ACMRR, yielding a many-atom cooperativity C ~ 5.5. We continue to observe signatures of atom-photon interaction for a few (&lt; 3) atoms, for which we observe saturation at the level of one intracavity photon. Further development of our platform, which includes integrated thermo-optic heaters to enable cavity tuning and stabilization, should enable the observation of interactions between single photons and single atoms.</description>

      <title>Engineering quantum states with neutral atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aquila, an analog quantum simulation platform developed by QuEra Computing, supports control of the position and coherent evolution of up to 256 neutral atoms. This study details novel experimental protocols designed for analog quantum simulators that generate Bell state entanglement far away from the blockade regime, construct a Z2 state with a defect induced by an ancilla, and optimize the driving fields schedule to prepare excited states with enhanced fidelity.
  We additionally evaluate the effectiveness of readout error mitigation techniques in improving the fidelity of measurement results. All experiments were executed on Aquila from QuEra and facilitated by the AWS Braket interface.
  Our experimental results closely align with theoretical predictions and numerical simulations. The insights gained from this study showcase Aquila's capabilities in handling complex quantum simulations and computations, and also pave the way for new avenues of research in quantum information processing and physics that employ programmable analog hardware platforms.</description>

      <title>Local Test for Unitarily Invariant Properties of Bipartite Quantum States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the power of local test for bipartite quantum states. Our central result is that, for properties of bipartite pure states, unitary invariance on one part implies an optimal (over all global testers) local tester acting only on the other part. This suggests a canonical local tester for entanglement spectra (i.e., Schmidt coefficients), and reveals that purified samples offer no advantage in property testing of mixed states. As applications, we settle two open questions raised in the survey of Montanaro and de Wolf (2016) by providing:
  1. A matching lower bound $\Omega(1/\varepsilon^2)$ for testing whether a multipartite pure state is product or $\varepsilon$-far, showing that the algorithm of Harrow and Montanaro (2010) is optimal, even for bipartite states;
  2. The first non-trivial lower bound $\Omega(r/\varepsilon)$ for testing whether the Schmidt rank of a bipartite pure state is at most $r$ or $\varepsilon$-far.
  We also show other new sample lower bounds, for example:
  - A matching lower bound $\Omega(d/\varepsilon^2)$ for testing whether a $d$-dimensional bipartite pure state is maximally entangled or $\varepsilon$-far, showing that the algorithm of O'Donnell and Wright (2015) is optimal for this task.
  Beyond sample complexity, we also contribute new quantum query lower bounds:
  - A query lower bound $\widetilde \Omega(\sqrt{d/\Delta})$ for the $d$-dimensional entanglement entropy problem with gap $\Delta$, improving the prior best $\Omega(\sqrt[4]{d})$ by She and Yuen (2023) and $\widetilde \Omega(1/\sqrt{\Delta})$ by Wang and Zhang (2023) and Weggemans (2024).
  Furthermore, our central result can be extended when the tested state is mixed: one-way LOCC is sufficient to realize the optimal tester.</description>

      <title>Superdense Coding using Bragg Diffracted Hyperentangled Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superdense coding (SDC) is a popular protocol demonstrating the potential of using quantum mechanics to transfer data, where The sender (Alice) can transfer 2 bits of classical information over a single qubit. We present a scheme for quantum superdense coding through Bragg diffracted hyperentangled atoms generated using cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED). In our scheme, Alice transfers 2 bits of classical information over a single hyperentangled atom. This is achieved by introducing multiple quantum gates using resonant and off-resonant Bragg diffraction in cavity QED setup. This scheme uses multiple degrees of freedom to add an extra layer of security to the encoded information.</description>

      <title>Feedback-Based Quantum Algorithm for Excited States Calculation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, feedback-based quantum algorithms have been introduced to calculate the ground states of Hamiltonians, inspired by quantum Lyapunov control theory. This paper aims to generalize these algorithms to the problem of calculating an eigenstate of a given Hamiltonian, assuming that the lower energy eigenstates are known. To this aim, we propose a new design methodology that combines the layer-wise construction of the quantum circuit in feedback-based quantum algorithms with a new feedback law based on a new Lyapunov function to assign the quantum circuit parameters. We present two approaches for evaluating the circuit parameters: one based on the expectation and overlap estimation of the terms in the feedback law and another based on the gradient of the Lyapunov function. We demonstrate the algorithm through an illustrative example and through an application in quantum chemistry. To assess its performance, we conduct numerical simulations and execution on IBM's superconducting quantum computer.</description>

      <title>Nonadiabatic Field on Quantum Phase Space: A Century after Ehrenfest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonadiabatic transition dynamics lies at the core of many electron/hole transfer, photoactivated, and vacuum field-coupled processes. About a century after Ehrenfest proposed "Phasenraum" and the Ehrenfest theorem, we report a conceptually novel trajectory-based nonadiabatic dynamics approach, nonadiabatic field (NaF), based on a generalized exact coordinate-momentum phase space formulation of quantum mechanics. It does not employ the conventional Born-Oppenheimer or Ehrenfest trajectory in the nonadiabatic coupling region. Instead, in NaF the equations of motion of the independent trajectory involve a nonadiabatic nuclear force term in addition to an adiabatic nuclear force term of a single electronic state. A few benchmark tests for gas phase and condensed phase systems indicate that NaF offers a practical tool to capture the correct correlation of electronic and nuclear dynamics for processes where the states remain coupled all the time as well as for the asymptotic region where the coupling of electronic states vanishes.</description>

      <title>A Novel Class of Phase Space Representations for the Exact Population Dynamics of Two-State Quantum Systems and the Relation to Triangle Window Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Isomorphism of the two-state system is heuristic in understanding the dynamical or statistical behavior of the simplest yet most quantum system that has no classical counterpart. We use constraint phase space [developed in J. Chem. Phys. 2016, 145, 204105; 2019, 151, 024105 and J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 2021, 12, 2496-2501], non-covariant phase space functions, time-dependent weight functions, and time-dependent normalization factors to construct a novel class of phase space representations of the exact population dynamics of the two-state quantum system. The equations of motion of the trajectory on constraint phase space are isomorphic to the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation. The contribution of each trajectory to the integral expression for the population dynamics is always positive semi-definite. We also prove that the triangle window function approach, albeit empirically proposed in J. Chem. Phys. 2016, 145, 144108, is related to a special case of the novel class and leads to an isomorphic representation of the exact population dynamics of the two-state quantum system.</description>

      <title>Comparative Study of Quantum-Circuit Scalability in a Financial Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computer is extensively used in solving financial problems. Quantum amplitude estimation, an algorithm that aims to estimate the amplitude of a given quantum state, can be utilized to determine the expectation value of bonds as the logic introduced in quantum risk analysis. As the number of the evaluation qubit increases, the more accurate the precise the outcome expectation value is. This augmentation in qubits, however, also leads to a varied escalation in circuit complexity, contingent upon the type of quantum computing device. By analyzing the number of two-qubit gates in the superconducting circuit and ion-trap quantum system, this study examines that the native gates and connectivity nature of the ion-trap system lead to less complicated quantum circuits. Across a range of experiments conducted with one to nineteen qubits, the examination reveals that the ion-trap system exhibits a two to three factor reduction in the number of required two-qubit gates when compared to the superconducting circuit system.</description>

      <title>Universal energy fluctuations in inelastic scattering processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum scattering is used ubiquitously in both experimental and theoretical physics across a wide range of disciplines, from high-energy physics to mesoscopic physics. In this work, we uncover universal relations for the energy fluctuations of a quantum system scattering inelastically with a particle at arbitrary kinetic energies. In particular, we prove a fluctuation relation describing an asymmetry between energy absorbing and releasing processes which relies on the non-unital nature of the underlying quantum map. This allows us to derive a bound on the average energy exchanged. We find that energy releasing processes are dominant when the kinetic energy of the particle is comparable to the system energies, but are forbidden at very high kinetic energies where well known fluctuation relations are recovered. Our work provides a unified view of energy fluctuations when the source driving the system is not macroscopic but rather an auxiliary quantum particle in a scattering process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the implementation of quantum entanglement distribution and quantum state teleportation over a 14.4-km urban dark-fiber link, which is partially underground, partially overhead, and patched in several stations. We characterize the link for its use as a quantum channel and realize its active polarization stabilization. Using a type-II cavity-enhanced SPDC photon pair source, a $^{40}$Ca$^{+}$ single-ion quantum memory, and quantum frequency conversion to the telecom C-band, we demonstrate photon-photon entanglement, ion-photon entanglement, and teleportation of a qubit state from the ion onto a remote telecom photon, all realized over the urban fiber link.</description>

      <title>Quantum electrodynamics of lossy samples in vacuum: modified Langevin noise formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum behavior of the electromagnetic field in unbounded macroscopic media displaying absorption is properly described by the Langevin noise formalism (macroscopic quantum electrodynamics) where the field is assumed to be entirely produced by medium fluctuating sources via the dyadic Green's function. On the other hand, such formalism leads to inconsistencies when applied to finite-size lossy objects placed in vacuum since it does not take into account the scattering modes, whose homomeneous plane wave asymptotic behavior is ruled out in unbounded lossy media. Accordingly a modified Langevin noise formalism has been proposed to encompass the scattering modes and its consistency has been numerically validated in few specific geometries. In this paper we analytically derive the modified Langevin noise formalism from the enstablished canonical quantization of the electromagnetic field in macroscopic media, thus proving that it models any possible scenario involving linear, inhomegeneous and magnetodielectric samples. The derivation starts from quantum Maxwell equations in the Heisenberg picture together with their formal solution as the superposition of the medium assisted field and the scattering modes. We analytically prove that each of the two field parts can be expressed in term of particular bosonic operators, which in turn diagonalize the electromagnetic Hamiltonian and whose associated quasi-particles are medium assisted and scattering polaritons, respectively. The key ingredient underpinning our reasoning is a peculiar integral relation linking the far field amplitude of the dyadic Green's function and the scattering modes, relation we rigorously derive and physically explain by identifying the scattering modes as fields generated by infinitely far dipole point sources.</description>

      <title>Portable diamond maser with reduced magnetic field through orientation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Masers have the potential to transform medical sensing and boost qubit readout detection due to their superb low-noise amplification. The negatively-charged nitrogen vacancy (NV-) diamond maser is the only continuous-wave solid-state maser discovered at room temperature, however it suffers from requiring large and bulky magnets which prevent its more widespread use. We present a significant reduction in size of the entire diamond maser using a much lighter and small-footprint electromagnet, reducing the weight from an immovable 2000 kilograms to a portable 30 kilograms. We achieve a maximum maser output power near -80 dBm, ten times higher than the first implementation, and have discovered techniques to reduce the magnetic field strength required for masing by precise manipulation of the spin orientation. With the diamond maser now shrunk to a size that can fit on a lab benchtop, we have brought continuous-wave room temperature masers away from the confines of research laboratories and closer to transforming readouts in quantum computing, frequency standards and quantum-limited medical sensing.</description>

      <title>Observational-Interventional Bell Inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalizations of Bell's theorem, particularly within quantum networks, are now being analyzed through the causal inference lens. However, the exploration of interventions, a central concept in causality theory, remains significantly unexplored. In this work we give an initial step in this direction, by analyzing the instrumental scenario and proposing novel hybrid Bell inequalities integrating observational and interventional data. Focusing on binary outcomes with any number of inputs, we obtain the complete characterization of the observational-interventional polytope, equivalent to a Hardy-like Bell inequality albeit describing a distinct quantum experiment. To illustrate its applications, we show a significant enhancement regarding threshold detection efficiencies for quantum violations also showing the use of these hybrid approach in quantum steering scenarios.</description>

      <title>Magic Boundaries of 3D Color Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate boundaries of 3D color codes and provide a systematic classification into 101 distinct boundary types. The elementary types of boundaries are codimension-1 (2D) boundaries that condense electric particle ($Z$-type) or magnetic flux ($X$-type) excitations in the 3D color code, including the $Z$-boundary condensing only electric particles, the $X$-boundary condensing only the magnetic flux, and other boundaries condensing both electric and magnetic excitations. Two novel types of boundaries can be generated based on certain elementary types. The first type is generated by applying transversal-$T$ gate on the entire code in the presence of the $X$-boundary, which effectively sweeps the codimension-1 (2D) $T$-domain wall across the system and attaches it to the $X$-boundary. Since the $T$-domain wall cannot condense on the $X$-boundary, a new \textit{magic boundary} is produced, where the boundary stabilizers contain $XS$-stabilizers going beyond the conventional Pauli stabilizer formalism and hence contains `magic'. Neither electric nor magnetic excitations can condense on such a magic boundary, and only the composite of the magnetic flux and codimension-2 (1D) $S$-domain wall can condense on it, which makes the magic boundary going beyond the classification of the Lagrangian subgroup. The second type is generated by applying transversal-$S$ gate on a codimension-1 (2D) submanifold in the presence of certain codimension-1 (2D) boundaries, which effectively sweeps the $S$-domain wall across this submanifold and attaches it onto the boundary. This generates a codimension-2 (1D) \textit{nested boundary} at the intersection. We also connect these novel boundaries to their previously discovered counterpart in the $\mathbb{Z}_2^3$ gauge theory equivalent to three copies of 3D toric codes...</description>

      <title>Robustness of Quantum Random Walk Search with multi-phase matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In our previous works, we have studied quantum random walk search algorithm on hypercube, with traversing coin constructed by using generalized Householder reflection and a phase multiplier. When the same phases are used each iteration, the algorithm is robust (stable against errors in the phases) if a certain connection between the phases in the traversing coin is preserved, otherwise small errors lead to poor algorithm performance. Here we investigate how the robustness changes if different phases are used, depending on the current iteration number. We numerically study six different examples with different phase sequences. We show that usage of a particular sequence of phases can make the algorithm more robust even if there is no preserved connection between the phases in the traversing coin.</description>

      <title>Efficient Gradient Estimation of Variational Quantum Circuits with Lie Algebraic Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid quantum-classical optimization and learning strategies are among the most promising approaches to harnessing quantum information or gaining a quantum advantage over classical methods. However, efficient estimation of the gradient of the objective function in such models remains a challenge due to several factors including the exponential dimensionality of the Hilbert spaces, and information loss of quantum measurements. In this work, we study generic parameterized circuits in the context of variational methods. We develop a framework for gradient estimation that exploits the algebraic symmetries of Hamiltonian characterized through Lie algebra or group theory. Particularly, we prove that when the dimension of the dynamical Lie algebra is polynomial in the number of qubits, one can estimate the gradient with polynomial classical and quantum resources. This is done by a series of Hadamard tests applied to the output of the ansatz with no change to its circuit. We show that this approach can be equipped with classical shadow tomography to further reduce the measurement shot complexity to scale logarithmically with the number of parameters.</description>

      <title>Time-dependent conserved operators for non-relativistic Schr\"odinger equation with electromagnetic field and quantization of resistance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two systems are studied: the first one involves a charged particle under the influence of a constant electric field, and the second one involves a charged particle under the influence of a constant electromagnetic field. For both systems, it is possible to find time-dependent conserved operators that can be used to derive time-dependent solutions to the complete Schr\"odinger equation. These conserved operators are employed to define the symmetries of the system. An argument of invariance of the wave function under the action of a unitary operator leads to the quantization of resistance and resistivity, in integer multiples of the von Klitzing's constant, for the first and second cases respectively.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel superconducting qubit architecture utilizing parallel arrays of Josephson junctions. This design offers a substantialy improved relative anharmonicity, typically within the range of $|\alpha_r| \approx 0.1 - 0.3$, while maintaining transition matrix elements in both the charge and flux channels that are on par with those of transmon qubits. Our proposed device also features exceptional tunability and includes a parameter regime akin to an enhanced version of the fluxonium qubit. Notably, it enables an additional order of magnitude reduction in matrix elements influenced by flux noise, thus further enhancing its suitability for quantum information processing applications.</description>

      <title>Towards Optimal Circuit Size for Quantum Sparse State Preparation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compared to general quantum states, the sparse states arise more frequently in the field of quantum computation. In this work, we consider the preparation for $n$-qubit sparse quantum states with $s$ non-zero amplitudes and propose two algorithms. The first algorithm uses $O(ns/\log n + n)$ gates, improving upon previous methods by $O(\log n)$. We further establish a matching lower bound for any algorithm which is not amplitude-aware and employs at most $\operatorname{poly}(n)$ ancillary qubits. The second algorithm is tailored for binary strings that exhibit a short Hamiltonian path. An application is the preparation of $U(1)$-invariant state with $k$ down-spins in a chain of length $n$, including Bethe states, for which our algorithm constructs a circuit of size $O\left(\binom{n}{k}\log n\right)$. This surpasses previous results by $O(n/\log n)$ and is close to the lower bound $O\left(\binom{n}{k}\right)$. Both the two algorithms shrink the existing gap theoretically and provide increasing advantages numerically.</description>

      <title>Quantum and Classical Two-photon Interference of Single Photons with Ultralong Coherence Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-photon interference (TPI) is a fundamental phenomenon in quantum optics and plays a crucial role in quantum information science and technology. TPI is commonly considered as quantum interference with an upper bound of $100\%$ for both the TPI visibility and the beat visibility in contrast to its classical counterpart with a maximum visibility of $50\%$. However, this is not always the case. Here we report a simultaneous observation of quantum and classical TPI of single photons with ultralong coherence time which is longer than the photon correlation time by five orders of magnitude. We observe a TPI visibility of $94.3\%\pm 0.2\%$ but a beat visibility of $50\%$. Besides an anti-bunching central dip due to single-photon statistics, we observe two bunching side peaks in cross-correlation curves for indistinguishable photons. Using either classical wave superposition theory or quantum field approach, we derive the same expressions for the cross-correlation functions which reproduce and explain the experiments well. We conclude that quantum TPI with a stream of single photons is equivalent to classical TPI, both of which are the fourth-order interference arising from the second-order interference occurring on the time scale of photon coherence time.</description>

      <title>Quantum Circuit for High Order Perturbation Theory Corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Perturbation theory (PT) might be one of the most powerful and fruitful tools for both physicists and chemists, which has led to a wide variety of applications. Over the past decades, advances in quantum computing provide opportunities for alternatives to classical methods. Recently, a general quantum circuit estimating the low order PT corrections has been proposed. In this article, we revisit the quantum circuits for PT calculations, and develop the methods for higher order PT corrections of eigenenergy, especially the 3rd and 4th order corrections. We present the feasible quantum circuit to estimate each term in these PT corrections. There are two the fundamental operations in the proposed circuit. One approximates the perturbation terms, the other approximates the inverse of unperturbed energy difference. The proposed method can be generalized to higher order PT corrections.</description>

      <title>Hybrid quantum systems with artificial atoms in solid state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of single-platform qubits, predominant for most of the last few decades, has driven the progress of quantum information technologies but also highlighted the limitations of various platforms. Some inherent issues such as charge/spin noise in materials hinder certain platforms, while increased decoherence upon attempts to scale-up severely impact qubit quality and coupling on others. In addition, a universal solution for coherent information transfer between quantum systems remains lacking. By combining one or more qubit platforms, one could potentially create new hybrid platforms that might alleviate significant issues that current single platform qubits suffer from, and in some cases, even facilitate the conversion of static to flying qubits on the same hybrid platform. While nascent, this is an area of rising importance that could shed new light on robust and scalable qubit development and provide new impetus for research directions. Here, we define the requirements for hybrid systems with artificial atoms in solid state, exemplify them with systems that have been proposed or attempted, and conclude with our outlook for such hybrid quantum systems.</description>

      <title>A Note on the Common Haar State Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Common random string model is a popular model in classical cryptography with many constructions proposed in this model. We study a quantum analogue of this model called the common Haar state model, which was also studied in an independent work by Chen, Coladangelo and Sattath (arXiv 2024). In this model, every party in the cryptographic system receives many copies of one or more i.i.d Haar states.
  Our main result is the construction of a statistically secure PRSG with: (a) the output length of the PRSG is strictly larger than the key size, (b) the security holds even if the adversary receives $O\left(\frac{\lambda}{(\log(\lambda))^{1.01}} \right)$ copies of the pseudorandom state. We show the optimality of our construction by showing a matching lower bound. Our construction is simple and its analysis uses elementary techniques.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heralding, which is often used for preparing quantum optical states, is studied to determine the effects of the spatiotemporal properties of the process. Incorporating all the spatiotemporal degrees of freedom, we follow a Wigner functional approach to consider cases where these states are prepared to have Wigner functionals with negative regions, being suitable resources for quantum information technologies. General expressions are derived for single-photon-subtracted and single-photon-added states. As examples, we consider the photon-subtracted squeezed vacuum state, the photon-added coherent state, and the photon-added thermal state. The Wigner functional approach reveals the importance of the spatiotemporal transformations imposed by the experimental conditions.</description>

      <title>Continuous-variable quantum key distribution with noisy squeezed states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the role of noisy squeezing in security and performance of continuous-variable (CV) quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols. Squeezing has long been recognized for its numerous advantages in CV QKD, such as enhanced robustness against channel noise and loss, and improved secret key rates. However, the noise of the squeezed states, that unavoidably originates already from optical loss in the source, raises concerns about its potential exploitation by an eavesdropper. This is particularly relevant if this noise is pessimistically assumed untrusted. We address the allocation of untrusted noise within a squeezed state and show that anti-squeezing noise is typically more harmful for security of the protocols, as it potentially provides more information to an eavesdropper. Although the anti-squeezing noise may not directly contribute to the generated key data, it is involved in parameter estimation and can in fact be harmful even if considered trusted. Our study covers the effects of anti-squeezing noise in both the asymptotic and finite-size regimes. We highlight the positive effects and limitations of imposing trust assumption on anti-squeezing noise. Additionally, we emphasize the detrimental impact of untrusted noise in both fiber and free-space fading links. Our findings offer essential insights for practical implementations and optimization of squeezed-state CV QKD protocols in realistic scenarios.</description>

      <title>Creating highly symmetric qudit heralded entanglement through highly symmetric graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent attention has turned to exploring quantum information within larger Hilbert spaces by utilizing qudits, which offer increased information capacity and potential for robust quantum communications. While the efficient generation of multipartite qudit entanglement is crucial for studying quantum correlations in high-dimensional Hilbert spaces, the increased dimension makes the circuit design challanging, especially when the entanglement is generated by heralding detections. In this work, we demonstrate that the graph picture of linear quantum networks (LQG picture) can provide a simplified method to generate qudit multipartite heralded entanglement of high symmetries. The LQG picture enables the reduction of circuit complexity by directly imposing the state symmetry onto the circuit structure. Leveraging this insight, we propose heralded schemes for generating $N$-partite $N$-level anti-symmetric (singlet) and symmetric (Dicke) states. Our study shed light on the optimal circuit design of high-dimensional entanglement with a systematic graphical strategy.</description>

      <title>Energy exchange statistics and fluctuation theorem for non-thermal asymptotic states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exchange energy statistics between two bodies at different thermal equilibrium obey the Jarzynski-W\'ojcik fluctuation theorem. The corresponding energy scale factor is the difference of the inverse temperatures associated to the bodies at equilibrium. In this work, we consider a dissipative quantum dynamics leading the quantum system towards a, possibly non-thermal, asymptotic state. To generalize the Jarzynski-W\'ojcik theorem to non-thermal states, we identify a sufficient condition ${\cal I}$ for the existence of an energy scale factor $\eta^{*}$ that is unique, finite and time-independent, such that the characteristic function of the exchange energy distribution becomes identically equal to $1$ for any time. This $\eta^*$ plays the role of the difference of inverse temperatures. We discuss the physical interpretation of the condition ${\cal I}$, showing that it amounts to an almost complete memory loss of the initial state. The robustness of our results against quantifiable deviations from the validity of ${\cal I}$ is evaluated by experimental studies on a single nitrogen-vacancy center subjected to a sequence of laser pulses and dissipation.</description>

      <title>Mapping indefinite causal order processes to composable quantum protocols in a spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Formalisms for higher order quantum processes provide a theoretical formalisation of quantum processes where the order of agents' operations need not be definite and acyclic, but may be subject to quantum superpositions. This has led to the concept of indefinite causal structures (ICS) which have garnered much interest. However, the interface between these information-theoretic approaches and spatiotemporal notions of causality is less understood, and questions relating to the physical realisability of ICS in a spatiotemporal context persist despite progress in their information-theoretic characterisation. Further, previous work suggests that composition of processes is not so straightforward in ICS frameworks, which raises the question of how this connects with the observed composability of physical experiments in spacetime. To address these points, we compare the formalism of quantum circuits with quantum control of causal order (QC-QC), which models an interesting class of ICS processes, with that of causal boxes, which models composable quantum information protocols in spacetime. We incorporate the set-up assumptions of the QC-QC framework into the spatiotemporal perspective and show that every QC-QC can be mapped to a causal box that satisfies these set up assumptions and acts on a Fock space while reproducing the QC-QC's behaviour in a relevant subspace defined by the assumptions. Using a recently introduced concept of fine-graining, we show that the causal box corresponds to a fine-graining of the QC-QC, which unravels the original ICS of the QC-QC into a set of quantum operations with a well-defined and acyclic causal order, compatible with the spacetime structure. Our results also clarify how the composability of physical experiments is recovered, while highlighting the essential role of relativistic causality and the Fock space structure.</description>

Abstract: Dense Rydberg atom ensembles display intriguing collective behaviors mediated by their strong, long-range dipole-dipole interactions. These collective effects, often modeled using Rydberg superatoms, have gained significant attention across various fields due to their potential applications in quantum information processing and quantum optics. In this review article, we delve into the theoretical foundations of Rydberg interactions and explore experimental techniques for their manipulation and detection. We also discuss the latest advancements in harnessing Rydberg collective effects for quantum computation and optical quantum technologies. By synthesizing insights from theoretical studies and experimental demonstrations, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview of this rapidly evolving field and its potential impact on the future of quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Nonadiabatic Field with Triangle Window Functions on Quantum Phase Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The constraint coordinate-momentum phase space (CPS) formulation of finite-state quantum systems has recently revealed that the triangle window function approach is an isomorphic representation of the exact population-population correlation function of the two-state system. We use the triangle window (TW) function and the CPS mapping kernel element to formulate a novel useful representation of discrete electronic degrees of freedom (DOFs). When it is employed with nonadiabatic field (NaF) dynamics, a new variant of the NaF approach (i.e., NaF-TW) is proposed. Extensive benchmark tests of model systems in both the condensed phase and gas phase demonstrate that the NaF-TW approach is competent in faithfully capturing the dynamical interplay between electronic and nuclear DOFs. In comparison to the symmetrical quasi-classical (SQC) method where triangle window functions were originally proposed, the performance of NaF-TW is significantly better when the bifurcation characteristic of nuclear motion in the asymptotic region is important.</description>

      <title>Quantum Annealers Chain Strengths: A Simple Heuristic to Set Them All</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum annealers (QA), such as D-Wave systems, become increasingly efficient and competitive at solving combinatorial optimization problems. However, solving problems that do not directly map the chip topology remains challenging for this type of quantum computer. The creation of logical qubits as sets of interconnected physical qubits overcomes limitations imposed by the sparsity of the chip at the expense of increasing the problem size and adding new parameters to optimize. This paper explores the advantages and drawbacks provided by the structure of the logical qubits and the impact of the rescaling of coupler strength on the minimum spectral gap of Ising models. We show that densely connected logical qubits require a lower chain strength to maintain the ferromagnetic coupling. We also analyze the optimal chain strength variations considering different minor embeddings of the same instance. This experimental study suggests that the chain strength can be optimized for each instance. We design a heuristic that optimizes the chain strength using a very low number of shots during the pre-processing step. This heuristic outperforms the default method used to initialize the chain strength on D-Wave systems, increasing the quality of the best solution by up to 17.2% for tested instances on the max-cut problem.</description>

      <title>Efficient Encodings of the Travelling Salesperson Problem for Variational Quantum Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Routing problems are a common optimization problem in industrial applications, which occur on a large scale in supply chain planning. Due to classical limitations for solving NP-hard problems, quantum computing hopes to improve upon speed or solution quality. Several suggestions have been made for encodings of routing problems to solve them with variational quantum algorithms. However, for an end user it is hard to decide a priori which encoding will give the best solutions according to their needs. In this work, we investigate different encodings for the Travelling Salesperson Problem. We compare their scaling and performance when using the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm and the Variational Quantum Eigensolver and provide a clear guide for users when to choose which encoding. For small instances, we find evidence that the permutation encoding can yield good results since it does not suffer from feasibility issues.</description>

      <title>Density Classification with Non-Unitary Quantum Cellular Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The density classification (DC) task, a computation which maps global density information to local density, is studied using one-dimensional non-unitary quantum cellular automata (QCAs). Two approaches are considered: one that preserves the number density and one that performs majority voting. For the DC, two QCAs are introduced that reach the fixed point solution in a time scaling quadratically with the system size. One of the QCAs is based on a known classical probabilistic cellular automaton which has been studied in the context of DC. The second QCA for DC is a new quantum model that is designed to demonstrate additional quantum features and is restricted to only two-body interactions. Both can be generated by continuous-time Lindblad dynamics. A third QCA is a hybrid rule defined by discrete-time three-body interactions that is shown to solve the majority voting problem within a time that scales linearly with the system size.</description>

      <title>Quantum optimization with linear Ising penalty functions for customer data science</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constrained combinatorial optimization problems, which are ubiquitous in industry, can be solved by quantum algorithms such as quantum annealing (QA) and the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA). In these quantum algorithms, constraints are typically implemented with quadratic penalty functions. This penalty method can introduce large energy scales and make interaction graphs much more dense. These effects can result in worse performance of quantum optimization, particularly on near-term devices that have sparse hardware graphs and other physical limitations. In this work, we consider linear Ising penalty functions, which are applied with local fields in the Ising model, as an alternative method for implementing constraints that makes more efficient use of physical resources. We study the behaviour of the penalty method in the context of quantum optimization for customer data science problems. Our theoretical analysis and numerical simulations of QA and the QAOA indicate that this penalty method can lead to better performance in quantum optimization than the quadratic method. However, the linear Ising penalty method is not suitable for all problems as it cannot always exactly implement the desired constraint. In cases where the linear method is not successful in implementing all constraints, we propose that schemes involving both quadratic and linear Ising penalties can be effective.</description>

      <title>Quench dynamics of interacting bosons: generalized coherent states versus multi-mode Glauber states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-mode Glauber coherent states (MMGS) as well as Bloch states with zero quasi-momentum, which are a special case of generalized coherent states (GCS), are frequently used to describe condensed phases of bosonic many-body systems. The difference of two-point correlators of MMGS and GCS vanishes in the thermodynamic limit. Using the established expansion of GCS in terms of MMGS, we derive a Fourier-type relation between the (auto-)correlation functions of the two different time-evolved states. This relation reveals that the (auto-)correlation and thus the dynamical free energy density for the two cases are still different, even in the thermodynamic limit, due to the lack of the U(1) symmetry of the MMGS. Analytic results for the deep lattice model of interacting bosons for increasing filling factors show multiple sharp structures in the dynamical free energy-density of increasing complexity. These are explained using the evolution of Husimi functions in phase space.</description>

      <title>Modeling the effects of perturbations and steepest entropy ascent on the time evolution of entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents an analysis of the evolution of perturbed Bell diagonal states using the equation of motion of steepest-entropy-ascent quantum thermodynamics (SEAQT), the Lindblad equation, and various measures of loss of entanglement. First, a brief derivation is presented showing that Bell diagonal states are stationary states that are not stable equilibrium states relative to the SEAQT equation of motion, highlighting the need for the development of perturbation methods to study the evolutions of nearby states. This contrasts with the Lindblad equation of motion for which only some of the Bell diagonal states are stationary. Next, two perturbation methods are presented. The first is a general method for perturbing bipartite systems and the second is a method based on a set of unitary operations that are constrained to hold the system energy and system entropy constant. Sets of density operators are randomly generated with each method and the resulting time-varying characteristics of the system's entanglement are analyzed. The findings reveal that the constrained perturbation accurately predicts the loss of non-locality and aligns well with the measured concurrence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Attosecond spectroscopy comprises several techniques to probe matter through electrons and photons. One frontier of attosecond methods is to reveal complex phenomena arising from quantum-mechanical correlations in the matter system, in the photon fields and among them. Recent theories have laid the groundwork for understanding how quantum-optical properties affect high-field photonics, such as strong-field ionization and acceleration of electrons in quantum-optical fields, and how entanglement between the field modes arises during the interaction. Here we demonstrate a new experimental approach that transduces some properties of a quantum-optical state through a strong-field nonlinearity. We perturb high-harmonic emission from a semiconductor with a bright squeezed vacuum field resulting in the emission of sidebands of the high-harmonics with super-Poissonian statistics, indicating that the emitted photons are bunched. Our results suggest that perturbing strong-field dynamics with quantum-optical states is a viable way to coherently control the generation of these states at short wavelengths, such as extreme ultraviolet or soft X-rays. Quantum correlations will be instrumental to advance attosecond spectroscopy and imaging beyond the classical limits.</description>

      <title>Experimental demonstration of improved quantum optimization with linear Ising penalties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The standard approach to encoding constraints in quantum optimization is the quadratic penalty method. Quadratic penalties introduce additional couplings and energy scales, which can be detrimental to the performance of a quantum optimizer. In quantum annealing experiments performed on a D-Wave Advantage, we explore an alternative penalty method that only involves linear Ising terms and apply it to a customer data science problem. Our findings support our hypothesis that the linear Ising penalty method should improve the performance of quantum optimization compared to using the quadratic penalty method due to its more efficient use of physical resources. Although the linear Ising penalty method is not guaranteed to exactly implement the desired constraint in all cases, it is able to do so for the majority of problem instances we consider. For problems with many constraints, where making all penalties linear is unlikely to be feasible, we investigate strategies for combining linear Ising penalties with quadratic penalties to satisfy constraints for which the linear method is not well-suited. We find that this strategy is most effective when the penalties that contribute most to limiting the dynamic range are removed.</description>

      <title>Quantum Optimization Methods for Satellite Mission Planning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Satellite mission planning for Earth observation satellites is a combinatorial optimization problem that consists of selecting the optimal subset of imaging requests, subject to constraints, to be fulfilled during an orbit pass of a satellite. The ever-growing amount of satellites in orbit underscores the need to operate them efficiently, which requires solving many instances of the problem in short periods of time. However, current classical algorithms often fail to find the global optimum or take too long to execute. Here, we approach the problem from a quantum computing point of view, which offers a promising alternative that could lead to significant improvements in solution quality or execution speed in the future. To this end, we study a planning problem with a variety of intricate constraints and discuss methods to encode them for quantum computers. Additionally, we experimentally assess the performance of quantum annealing and the quantum approximate optimization algorithm on a realistic and diverse dataset. Our results identify key aspects like graph connectivity and constraint structure that influence the performance of the methods. We explore the limits of today's quantum algorithms and hardware, providing bounds on the problems that can be currently solved successfully and showing how the solution degrades as the complexity grows. This work aims to serve as a baseline for further research in the field and establish realistic expectations on current quantum optimization capabilities.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian Learning using Machine Learning Models Trained with Continuous Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We build upon recent work on using Machine Learning models to estimate Hamiltonian parameters using continuous weak measurement of qubits as input. We consider two settings for the training of our model: (1) supervised learning where the weak measurement training record can be labeled with known Hamiltonian parameters, and (2) unsupervised learning where no labels are available. The first has the advantage of not requiring an explicit representation of the quantum state, thus potentially scaling very favorably to larger number of qubits. The second requires the implementation of a physical model to map the Hamiltonian parameters to a measurement record, which we implement using an integrator of the physical model with a recurrent neural network to provide a model-free correction at every time step to account for small effects not captured by the physical model. We test our construction on a system of two qubits and demonstrate accurate prediction of multiple physical parameters in both the supervised and unsupervised context. We demonstrate that the model benefits from larger training sets establishing that it is in fact "learning," and we show robustness to errors in the assumed physical model by achieving accurate parameter estimation in the presence of unanticipated single particle relaxation.</description>

      <title>Distributing Arbitrary Quantum Cluster States by Graph Transformation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum cluster state is a special class of nonlocal state among multiple quantum particles, underpinning several nonclassical and promising applications such as quantum computing and quantum secret sharing. Recently, establishing quantum cluster states among physically distant nodes has gained increasing popularity owing to its potential in expanding current quantum applications in scale. Existing research on this topic relies on a two-step approach: first distributing low-dimension elementary entanglement to target nodes, and then fusing them into a high-dimension quantum cluster state. However, most existing studies focus solely on minimizing costs (e.g., the number of elementary entanglements consumed) to entangle target nodes, while neglecting the structure of the final quantum cluster state. This can easily result in weak system entanglement, jeopardizing the cluster state under partial measurement or noises.
  In this paper, we aim to establish any arbitrary quantum cluster states of strong entanglement structures at a much lower cost than the state of the art. The method is to search for and establish an alternative state to the target state that is of lowest cost in creation. Subsequently, we transform such an alternative state back to the target state via compressed single-qubit Clifford operations. To verify the performance of our developed algorithm, we conduct comprehensive simulations based on an open dataset containing all cluster state structures up to 8 qubits. The results demonstrate fast algorithm convergence, an increased success probability in distributing any cluster states, and 53.57% saving in ERP cost compared with the state-of-the-art baseline.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atom-photon bound states arise from the coupling of quantum emitters to the band edge of dispersion-engineered waveguides. Thanks to their tunable-range interactions, they are promising building blocks for quantum simulators. Here, we study the dynamics of an atom-photon bound state emerging from coupling a frequency-tunable quantum emitter - a transmon-type superconducting circuit - to the band edge of a microwave metamaterial. Employing precise temporal control over the frequency detuning of the emitter from the band edge, we examine the transition from adiabatic to non-adiabatic behavior in the formation of the bound state and its melting into the propagating modes of the metamaterial. Moreover, we experimentally observe multi-mode emission from the bound state, triggered by a fast change of the emitter's frequency. Our study offers insight into the dynamic preparation of atom-photon bound states and provides a method to characterize their photonic content, with implications in quantum optics and quantum simulation.</description>

      <title>Improving Quantum and Classical Decomposition Methods for Vehicle Routing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing is a promising technology to address combinatorial optimization problems, for example via the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA). Its potential, however, hinges on scaling toy problems to sizes relevant for industry. In this study, we address this challenge by an elaborate combination of two decomposition methods, namely graph shrinking and circuit cutting. Graph shrinking reduces the problem size before encoding into QAOA circuits, while circuit cutting decomposes quantum circuits into fragments for execution on medium-scale quantum computers. Our shrinking method adaptively reduces the problem such that the resulting QAOA circuits are particularly well-suited for circuit cutting. Moreover, we integrate two cutting techniques which allows us to run the resulting circuit fragments sequentially on the same device. We demonstrate the utility of our method by successfully applying it to the archetypical traveling salesperson problem (TSP) which often occurs as a sub-problem in practically relevant vehicle routing applications. For a TSP with seven cities, we are able to retrieve an optimum solution by consecutively running two 7-qubit QAOA circuits. Without decomposition methods, we would require five times as many qubits. Our results offer insights into the performance of algorithms for combinatorial optimization problems within the constraints of current quantum technology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the concept of topological pumping in one-dimensional systems with long-range interactions and apply it to the transport of a photon in quantum optical systems. In our theoretical investigation, we introduce an extended version of the Rice-Mele model with all-to-all exchange interactions. By analyzing its properties, we identify the general conditions for topological pumping and demonstrate the topologically protected and dispersionless transport of a photon on a one-dimensional emitter chain. As concrete examples, we investigate three different popular quantum optics platforms, namely Rydberg atom lattices, dense lattices of atoms excited to low-lying electronic states, and atoms coupled to waveguides, using experimentally relevant parameters. We observe that despite the long-ranged character of the dipole-dipole interactions, topological pumping facilitates the transport of a photon with a fidelity per cycle which can reach 99.9%. Moreover, we find that the photon pumping process remains topologically protected against local disorder in the coupling rates.</description>

      <title>Examples of Atoms Absorbing Photon via Schr\"odinger Equation and Vacuum Fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The absorption of photons by atoms encompasses fundamental quantum mechanical aspects, particularly the emergence of randomness to account for the inherent unpredictability in absorption outcomes. We demonstrate that vacuum fluctuations can be the origin of this randomness. An illustrative example of this is the absorption of a single photon by two symmetrically arranged atoms. In the absence of a mechanism to introduce randomness, the Schr\"odinger equation alone governs the time evolution of the process until an entangled state of the two atoms emerges. This entangled state consists of two components: one in which the first atom is excited by the photon while the second remains in the ground state, and another in which the first atom remains in the ground state while the second is excited by the photon. These components form a superposition state characterized by an unbreakable symmetry in the absence of external influences. Consequently, the absorption process remains incomplete. When vacuum fluctuations come into play, they can induce fluctuations in the weights of these components, akin to Brownian motion. Over time, one component diminishes, thereby breaking the entanglement between the two atoms and allowing the photon absorption process to conclude. The remaining component ultimately determines which atom completes the photon absorption. Similar studies involving different numbers of atoms can be conducted. Vacuum fluctuations not only introduce randomness but also have the potential to give rise to the Born rule in this context. Furthermore, the Casimir effect, which is closely tied to vacuum fluctuations, presents a promising experimental avenue for validating this mechanism.</description>

      <title>Quantum tomography of structured light patterns from simple intensity measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the tomography of spatial qudits encoded on structured light photons. While direct position measurements with cameras do not provide an informationally complete Positive Operator Valued Measure (POVM) in the space of fixed order modes, we complement this POVM with an astigmatic transformation. The enlarged POVM is informationally complete, allowing full characterization of the spatial quantum state from simple intensity measurements in both the intense and in the low photocount regimes. For intense light, the standard technique of linear inversion is used. For the low photocount regime, we employ Bayesian mean inference, and study how the quality of the tomographic reconstruction behaves as we increase the photocounts. In both cases, we also perform the tomography using a convolutional neural network, which displays an increased flexibility in exchange for a slightly lower quality reconstruction in some of the cases. These methods will be useful for classical and quantum communication with structured light.</description>

      <title>Single-qubit rotation algorithm with logarithmic Toffoli count and gate depth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a direct (non-recursive) algorithm for applying a rotation $R_{\theta^\ast}$, $\epsilon$-close to a desired rotation $R_\theta$, to a single qubit using the Clifford+Toffoli gate set. Our algorithm does not rely on repeatedly applying a fixed rotation, but immediately applies $R_{\theta^\ast}$. It succeeds with probability strictly greater than $1/2$, has an expected number of iterations strictly less than 2, expected Toffoli count logarithmic in $\tfrac{1}{\epsilon}$, and expected gate depth also logarithmic in $\tfrac{1}{\epsilon}$.</description>

      <title>Experimental observation of a time rondeau crystal: Temporal Disorder in Spatiotemporal Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our understanding of phases of matter relies on symmetry breaking, one example being water ice whose crystalline structure breaks the continuous translation symmetry of space. Recently, breaking of time translation symmetry was observed in systems not in thermal equilibrium. The associated notion of time crystallinity has led to a surge of interest, raising the question about the extent to which highly controllable quantum simulators can generate rich and tunable temporal orders, beyond the conventional classification of order in static systems. Here, we investigate different kinds of partial temporal orders, stabilized by non-periodic yet structured drives, which we call rondeau order. Using a $^{13}$C-nuclear-spin diamond quantum simulator, we report the first experimental observation of a -- tunable degree of -- short-time disorder in a system exhibiting long-time stroboscopic order. This is based on a novel spin control architecture that allows us to implement a family of drives ranging from structureless via structured random to quasiperiodic and periodic drives. Leveraging a high throughput read-out scheme, we continuously observe the spin polarization over 105 pulses to probe rondeau order, with controllable lifetimes exceeding 4 seconds. Using the freedom in the short-time temporal disorder of rondeau order, we show the capacity to encode information in the response of observables. Our work broadens the landscape of observed nonequilibrium temporal order, paving the way for new applications harnessing driven quantum matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we have demonstrated the acquisition of pulsed ODMR data with the help of a high speed oscilloscope. We show how the on-system data averaging and the memory of the oscilloscope can be utilized to obtain high SNR data at high speeds. The problem of experimental drift and the strategy for eliminating the same is discussed. Two distinct methods of data acquisition and processing are discussed, and their applicability to different pulsed protocols is investigated. Rabi Oscillations, Ramsey Interferometry, T1 measurement, and spin echo are demonstrated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Applications of quantum mechanics rely on the accuracy of reading and writing data. This requires accurate measurements and preparations of the quantum states. I show that accurate measurements and preparations are impossible if the total Hamiltonian is bounded from below (as thought to be in our universe). This result invites a reevaluation of the limitations of quantum control, quantum computing, and other quantum technologies dependent on the accuracy of quantum preparations and measurements, and maybe of the assumption that the Hamiltonian is bounded from below.</description>

      <title>Assessment of practical satellite quantum key distribution architectures for current and near-future missions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) allows the generation of cryptographic keys beyond the computational hardness paradigm and is befitting for secure data transmission requiring long-term security. The communication distance of fibre-based QKD, however, is limited to a few hundred kilometers due to the exponential scaling of signal attenuation. Satellite QKD (SatQKD) can instead leverage free-space optical links to establish long-range connections and enable global-scale QKD. In this work we review the manifold of design choices that concur to form the set of possible SatQKD architectures. These include the choice of the QKD protocol and its physical implementation, but also the satellite orbit, the optical link direction, and whether or not to use trusted-node relays. The possible SatQKD architectures are then evaluated in terms of key generation throughput, latency and maximum reachable communication distance, but also the system-level security and implementation complexity. Given the technical challenges of realising SatQKD systems it is paramount, for near-future satellite missions, to adhere to the simplest possible architecture that still allows to deliver the QKD service. We thus identify as advisable options the use of low-Earth orbit satellites as trusted nodes for prepare-and-measure discrete-variable QKD downlinks with weak laser pulses. The decoy-state version of BB84 is found to be the most promising QKD protocols due to the maturity of the security proofs, the high key generation rate and low system complexity. These findings are confirmed by the multitude of current and planned SatQKD missions that are adopting these architectural choices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide an overview of standard "projective" quantum measurements with the goal of elucidating connections between theory and experiment. We make use of a unitary "Stinespring" representation of measurements on a dilated Hilbert space that includes both the physical degrees of freedom and those of the measurement apparatus. We explain how this unitary representation (i) is guaranteed by the axioms of quantum mechanics, (ii) relates to both the Kraus and von Neumann representations, and (iii) corresponds to the physical time evolution of the system and apparatus during the measurement process. The Stinespring representation also offers significant conceptual insight into measurements, helps connects theory and experiment, is particularly useful in describing protocols involving midcircuit measurements and outcome-dependent operations, and establishes that all quantum operations are compatible with relativistic locality, among other insights.</description>

      <title>In-situ Imaging of a Single-Atom Wave Packet in Continuous Space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The wave nature of matter remains one of the most striking aspects of quantum mechanics. Since its inception, a wealth of experiments has demonstrated the interference, diffraction or scattering of massive particles. More recently, experiments with ever increasing control and resolution have allowed imaging the wavefunction of individual atoms. Here, we use quantum gas microscopy to image the in-situ spatial distribution of deterministically prepared single-atom wave packets as they expand in a plane. We achieve this by controllably projecting the expanding wavefunction onto the sites of a deep optical lattice and subsequently performing single-atom imaging. The protocol established here for imaging extended wave packets via quantum gas microscopy is readily applicable to the wavefunction of interacting many-body systems in continuous space, promising a direct access to their microscopic properties, including spatial correlation functions up to high order and large distances.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The conventional approach to understanding the characteristics of an unknown quantum state involves having numerous identical independent copies of the system in that state. However, we demonstrate that gleaning insights into specific properties is feasible even with a single-state sample. Perhaps surprisingly, the confidence level of our findings increases proportionally with the number of qubits. Our conclusions apply to quantum states with low circuit complexity, including noise-affected ones. Additionally, this extends to learning from a solitary sample of probability distributions. Our results establish a strong lower bound for discriminating quantum states with low complexity. Furthermore, we reveal no quantum advantage in decision problems involving low-depth quantum circuits. Our results can be used to verify NISQ devices.</description>

      <title>ATP-Dependent Mismatch Recognition in DNA Replication Mismatch Repair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.03026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.03026v4 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mismatch repair is a critical step in DNA replication that occurs after base selection and proofreading, significantly increasing fidelity. However, the mechanism of mismatch recognition has not been established for any repair enzyme. Speculations in this area mainly focus on exploiting thermodynamic equilibrium and free energy. Nevertheless, non-equilibrium processes may play a more significant role in enhancing mismatch recognition accuracy by utilizing adenosine triphosphate (ATP). This study aimed to investigate this possibility. Considering our limited knowledge of actual mismatch repair enzymes, we proposed a hypothetical enzyme that operates as a quantum system with three discrete energy levels. When the enzyme is raised to its highest energy level, a quantum transition occurs, leading to one of two low-energy levels representing potential recognition outcomes: a correct match or a mismatch. The probabilities of the two outcomes are exponentially different, determined by the energy gap between the two low energy levels. By flipping the energy gap, discrimination between mismatches and correct matches can be achieved. Within a framework that combines quantum mechanics with thermodynamics, we established a relationship between energy cost and the recognition error.</description>

      <title>Quantum-informed simulations for mechanics of materials: DFTB+MBD framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The macroscopic behaviors of materials are determined by interactions that occur at multiple lengths and time scales. Depending on the application, describing, predicting, and understanding these behaviors require models that rely on insights from electronic and atomic scales. In such cases, classical simplified approximations at those scales are insufficient, and quantum-based modeling is required. In this paper, we study how quantum effects can modify the mechanical properties of systems relevant to materials engineering. We base our study on a high-fidelity modeling framework that combines two computationally efficient models rooted in quantum first principles: Density Functional Tight Binding (DFTB) and many-body dispersion (MBD). The MBD model is applied to accurately describe non-covalent van der Waals interactions. Through various benchmark applications, we demonstrate the capabilities of this framework and the limitations of simplified modeling. We provide an open-source repository containing all codes, datasets, and examples presented in this work. This repository serves as a practical toolkit that we hope will support the development of future research in effective large-scale and multiscale modeling with quantum-mechanical fidelity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a general theory for calculating photon transitions in arbitrarily time-varying metamaterials. This theory circumvents the difficulties of conventional approaches in solving such a general problem by exploiting the eigenstates of time-dependent number operators. We demonstrate here the temporal evolution of these operators and the related transition probabilities for the cases of logistic and linear permittivity profiles. The theory is potentially extensible to arbitrary space-time modulations and may hence lead to multiple novel quantum effects and applications.</description>

      <title>Signatures of fragmentation for periodically driven fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the possible signatures of prethermal strong Hilbert space fragmentation (HSF) for one-dimensional (1D) fermions subjected to a periodic drive. We extend the results of Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 120401 (2023) to show the possibility of such fragmentation for a large class of experimentally relevant drive protocols. Moreover, we demonstrate the persistence of HSF when the fermion chain is taken away from half-filling. Both these analysis indicate the robustness of the fragmentation phenomenon reported earlier. We also provide an alternate derivation of the Floquet Hamiltonian of the driven chain which yields insight into the generic nested commutator structure of its higher order terms. Finally, we study the density-density out-of-time-correlators (OTOC) of the driven chain both away and near the special drive frequencies at which its first order Floquet Hamiltonian exhibits fragmentation. We show that these OTOCs, for a chain with open boundary condition, exhibit a distinct periodic unscrambling of information at special drive frequencies; such unscrambling can therefore serve as a marker of prethermal HSF. We provide an approximate analytic explanation of the role of HSF behind such periodic unscrambling and discuss experiments which can detect signatures of strong HSF in such driven chains.</description>

      <title>Disorder operators in 2D Fermi and non-Fermi liquids through multidimensional bosonization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Disorder operators are a type of non-local observables for quantum many-body systems, measuring the fluctuations of symmetry charges inside a region. It has been shown that disorder operators can reveal global aspects of many-body states that are otherwise difficult to access through local measurements. We study disorder operator for U(1) (charge or spin) symmetry in 2D Fermi and non-Fermi liquid states, using the multidimensional bosonization formalism. For a region $A$, the logarithm of the charge disorder parameter in a Fermi liquid with isotropic interactions scales asympototically as $l_A\ln l_A$, with $l_A$ being the linear size of the region $A$. We calculate the proportionality coefficient in terms of Landau parameters of the Fermi liquid theory. We then study models of Fermi surface coupled to gapless bosonic fields realizing non-Fermi liquid states. In a simple spinless model, where the fermion density is coupled to a critical scalar, we find that at the quantum critical point, the scaling behavior of the charge disorder operators is drastically modified to $l_A \ln^2 l_A$. We also consider the composite Fermi liquid state and argue that the charge disorder operator scales as $l_A$.</description>

      <title>Estimating the Energy Threshold of Phonon-mediated Superconducting Qubit Detectors Operated in an Energy-Relaxation Sensing Scheme</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the lack of a conclusive detection of WIMP dark matter at the 10 GeV/c$^{2}$ mass scale and above has encouraged development of low-threshold detector technology aimed at probing lighter dark matter candidates. Detectors based on Cooper-pair-breaking sensors have emerged as a promising avenue for this detection due to the low (meV-scale) energy required for breaking a Cooper pair in most superconductors. Among them, devices based on superconducting qubits are interesting candidates for sensing due to their observed sensitivity to broken Cooper pairs. We have developed an end-to-end G4CMP-based simulation framework and have used it to evaluate performance metrics of qubit-based devices operating in a gate-based "energy relaxation" readout scheme, akin to those used in recent studies of qubit sensitivity to ionizing radiation. We find that for this readout scheme, the qubit acts as a phonon sensor with an energy threshold ranging down to $\simeq$0.4 eV for near-term performance parameters.</description>

      <title>Quantum mechanical aspects of coherent photoproduction: the limits of coherence, and multiple vector mesons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum mechanics is central to coherent photoproduction in ultra-peripheral collisions (UPCs). This writeup will discuss some surprising aspects of UPCs that stem from these quantum mechanical roots. The Good-Walker (GW) paradigm, which connects coherent photoproduction with the target nucleus remaining in its ground state. This contrasts with a semi-classical picture, where coherence depends on the positions of the individual nucleons and the momentum transfer. Unlike the GW approach, the semiclassical picture is consistent with the observed data on coherent photoproduction with nuclear breakup, and with coherent photoproduction in peripheral collisions. The semiclassical approach allows for a wider variety of coherent UPC reactions, such as coherent photoproduction of charged mesons, including some non $q\overline q$ exotica. Quantum mechanics is also key to the coherent photoproduction of multiple vector mesons by the interactions of a single ion pair. The vector mesons share a common impact parameter, and so can exhibit richer interference patterns than single mesons. At forward rapidities, the cross sections to produce multiple identical vector mesons are enhanced due to superradiance. With enough statistics, multi-meson events may provide an opportunity to observe stimulated decays.}</description>

      <title>Formation and Microwave Losses of Hydrides in Superconducting Niobium Thin Films Resulting from Fluoride Chemical Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconducting Nb thin films have recently attracted significant attention due to their utility for quantum information technologies. In the processing of Nb thin films, fluoride-based chemical etchants are commonly used to remove surface oxides that are known to affect superconducting quantum devices adversely. However, these same etchants can also introduce hydrogen to form Nb hydrides, potentially negatively impacting microwave loss performance. Here, we present comprehensive materials characterization of Nb hydrides formed in Nb thin films as a function of fluoride chemical treatments. In particular, secondary-ion mass spectrometry, X-ray scattering, and transmission electron microscopy reveal the spatial distribution and phase transformation of Nb hydrides. The rate of hydride formation is determined by the fluoride solution acidity and the etch rate of Nb2O5, which acts as a diffusion barrier for hydrogen into Nb. The resulting Nb hydrides are detrimental to Nb superconducting properties and lead to increased power-independent microwave loss in coplanar waveguide resonators. However, Nb hydrides do not correlate with two-level system loss or device aging mechanisms. Overall, this work provides insight into the formation of Nb hydrides and their role in microwave loss, thus guiding ongoing efforts to maximize coherence time in superconducting quantum devices.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present note, we discuss a simple example of a macroscopic quantum many-body system in which the approach to thermal equilibrium from an arbitrary initial state in the microcanonical energy shell is proved without relying on any unproven assumptions. The model, which is equivalent to a free fermion chain, is designed to be a toy model for a weakly heat-conducting one-dimensional solid. We take a phenomenological point of view and perceive that the system is in thermal equilibrium when the measured coarse-grained energy distribution is uniform.
  The result on thermalization reported here is a variation (and an improvement) of our previous result on the irreversible expansion in a free fermion chain. As far as we know, this is the first concrete and rigorous realization of the philosophy on the foundation of equilibrium statistical mechanics proposed by von Neumann in 1929, and further developed recently by Goldstein, Lebowitz, Mastrodonato, Tumulka, and Zangh\`\i and the present author, namely, to characterize thermal equilibrium from a macroscopic viewpoint and to make use of the strong ETH to control the long-time dynamics.
  This note will be the most technical part of my longer article on thermalization, "What is thermal equilibrium and how do we get there?". I am making this document public at this stage since I have already announced (and will announce) the results at some of my talks.</description>

      <title>Incoherent non-Hermitian skin effect in photonic quantum walks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect describes the concentration of an extensive number of eigenstates near the boundaries of certain dissipative systems. This phenomenon has raised a huge interest in different areas of physics, including photonics, deeply expanding our understanding of non-Hermitian systems and opening up new avenues in both fundamental and applied aspects of topological phenomena. The skin effect has been associated to a nontrivial point-gap spectral topology and has been experimentally demonstrated in a variety of synthetic matter systems, including photonic lattices. In most of physical models exhibiting the non-Hermitian skin effect full or partial wave coherence is generally assumed. Here we push the concept of skin effect into the fully incoherent regime and show that rather generally (but not universally) the non-Hermitian skin effect persists under dephasing dynamics. The results are illustrated by considering incoherent light dynamics in non-Hermitian photonic quantum walks.</description>

      <title>Robust Anderson transition in non-Hermitian photonic quasicrystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anderson localization, i.e. the suppression of diffusion in lattices with random or incommensurate disorder, is a fragile interference phenomenon which is spoiled out in the presence of dephasing effects or fluctuating disorder. As a consequence, Anderson localization-delocalization phase transitions observed in Hermitian systems, such as in one-dimensional quasicrystals when the amplitude of the incommensurate potential is increased above a threshold, are washed out when dephasing effects are included. Here we consider localization-delocalization spectral phase transitions occurring in non-Hermitian quasicrystals with local incommensurate gain and loss, and show that, contrary to the Hermitian case, the non-Hermitian phase transition is robust against dephasing effects. The results are illustrated by considering synthetic quasicrystals in photonic mesh lattices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The unitary representations of the Poincare group of a discrete space-time are constructed, following the Wigner method in continuum relativity. They can be interpreted as elementary particles with one significant new feature: the momentum space being the 4-torus is identified as the Brillouin zone of space-time where all physical phenomena occur. Consequently 4-momentum is defined and conserved only modulo a reciprocal lattice vector of the order of the Planck mass, implying that there is no notion of an invariant mass except when it vanishes. In particular the propagation of massive particles have superluminal phases under very large (trans-Planckian) boosts. This behaviour leads to new features in early cosmology which are not in conflict with current knowledge.</description>

      <title>Infinite Grassmann time-evolving matrix product operator method for zero-temperature equilibrium quantum impurity problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Grassmann time-evolving matrix product operator (GTEMPO) method has proven to be an accurate and efficient numerical method for the real-time dynamics of quantum impurity problems. Whereas its application for imaginary-time calculations is much less competitive compared to well-established methods such as the continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo (CTQMC). In this work, we unleash the full power of GTEMPO for zero-temperature imaginary-time calculations: the multi-time impurity state is time-translationally invariant with infinite boundary condition, therefore it can be represented as an infinite Grassmann matrix product state (GMPS) with nontrivial unit cell in a single time step, instead of an open boundary GMPS spanning the whole imaginary-time axis. We devise a very efficient infinite GTEMPO algorithm targeted at zero-temperature equilibrium quantum impurity problems, which is known to be a hard regime for quantum Monte Carlo methods. To demonstrate the performance of our method, we benchmark it against exact solutions in the noninteracting limit, and against CTQMC calculations in the Anderson impurity models with up to two orbitals, where we show that the required bond dimension of the infinite GMPS is much smaller than its finite-temperature counterpart.</description>

      <title>Photon Many-body Dispersion: an Exchange-correlation Functional for Strongly Coupled Light-matter Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce an electron-photon exchange-correlation functional for quantum electrodynamical density-functional theory (QEDFT). The approach, photon MBD (pMBD), is inspired by the many-body dispersion (MBD) method for weak intermolecular interactions, which is generalized to include both electronic and photonic (electromagnetic) degrees of freedom on the same footing. We demonstrate that pMBD accurately captures effects that arise in the context of strong light-matter interactions, such as anisotropic electron-photon interactions, beyond single-photon effects, and cavity modulated van der Waals interactions. Moreover, we show that pMBD is computationally efficient and allows simulations of large complex systems coupled to optical cavities.</description>

      <title>Spin-lattice relaxation with non-linear couplings: Comparison between Fermi's golden rule and extended dissipaton equation of motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fermi's golden rule (FGR) offers an empirical framework for understanding the dynamics of spin-lattice relaxation in magnetic molecules, encompassing mechanisms like direct (one-phonon) and Raman (two-phonon) processes. These principles effectively model experimental longitudinal relaxation rates, denoted as $T_1^{-1}$. However, under scenarios of increased coupling strength and nonlinear spin-lattice interactions, FGR's applicability may diminish. This paper numerically evaluates the exact spin-lattice relaxation rate kernels, employing the extended dissipaton equation of motion (DEOM) formalism. Our calculations reveal that when quadratic spin-lattice coupling is considered, the rate kernels exhibit a free induction decay-like feature, and the damping rates depend on the interaction strength. We observe that the temperature dependence predicted by FGR significantly deviates from the exact results since FGR ignores the non-Markovian nature of spin-lattice relaxation. Our methods can be readily applied to other systems with nonlinear spin-lattice interactions and provide valuable insights into the temperature dependence of $T_1$ in molecular qubits.</description>

Abstract: We propose that the logarithmic singularities of the Renyi entropy of local-operator-excited states for replica index $n$ can be a sign of quantum chaos. As concrete examples, we analyze the logarithmic singularities of the Renyi entropy in various two-dimensional conformal field theories. We show that there are always logarithmic singularities of the Renyi entropy in holographic CFTs, but no such singularities in free and rational CFTs. These singularities of the Renyi entropy are also related to the logarithmic time growth of the Renyi entropy at late times.</description>

      <title>Quantum and thermal noise in coupled non-Hermitian waveguide systems with different models of gain and loss</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian (NH) photonic systems leverage gain and loss to open new directions for nanophotonic technologies. However, the quantum and thermal noise intrinsically associated with gain/loss affects the eigenvalue/eigenvector structure of NH systems, as well as its practical noise performance. Here, we present a comparative analysis of the impact of different gain and loss mechanisms on the noise generated in gain-loss compensated NH waveguide systems. Our results highlight important differences in the eigenvalue/eigenvector structure, noise power, photon statistics and squeezing. At the same time, we identify some universal properties such as gain-loss compensation, broken to unbroken phase transitions, coalesce of pairs of eigenvectors, and linear scaling of the noise with the length of the waveguide. We believe that these results provide a more global understanding on the impact of the gain/loss mechanism on the noise generated in NH systems.</description>

      <title>Inducing a Metal-Insulator Transition through Systematic Alterations of Local Rewriting Rules in a Quantum Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Anderson localization transition in quantum graphs has garnered significant recent attention due to its relevance to many-body localization studies. Typically, graphs are constructed using top-down methods. Here, we explore a bottom-up approach, employing a simple local rewriting rule to construct the graph. Through the use of ratio statistics for the energy spectrum and Kullback-Leibler divergence correlations for the eigenstates, numerical analysis demonstrates that slight adjustments to the rewriting rule can induce a transition from a localized to an extended quantum phase. This extended state exhibits non-ergodic behavior, akin to the non-ergodic extended phase observed in the Porter-Rosenzweig model and suggested for many-body localization. Thus, by adapting straightforward local rewriting rules, it becomes feasible to assemble complex graphs from which desired global quantum phases emerge. This approach holds promise for numerical investigations and could be implemented in building optical realizations of complex networks using optical fibers and beam splitters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the quasi-parton distributions of the lightest $\eta'$ meson in massive two-dimensional Quantum electrodynamics (QED2) by performing a digital quantum simulation on a classical computer (exact diagonalization). The Hamiltonian and boost operators are mapped onto spin qubits in a spatial lattice with open boundary conditions. The lowest excited state in the exact diagonalization is shown to interpolate continuously between an anomalous $\eta'$ state at strong coupling,and a non-anomalous heavy meson at weak coupling, with a cusp at the critical point. The boosted $\eta'$ state follows relativistic kinematics but with large deviations in the luminal limit. The spatial quasi-parton distribution function and amplitude for the $\eta'$ state are computed numerically for increasing rapidity both at strong and weak coupling, and compared to the exact light front results. The numerical results from the boosted form of the spatial parton distributions, compare fairly with the inverse Fourier transformation of the luminal parton distributions, derived in the lowest Fock space approximation. Our analysis points out some of the limitations facing the current lattice program for the parton distributions.</description>

      <title>Proximity-Induced Exchange Interaction: a New Pathway for Quantum Sensing using Spin Centers in Hexagonal Boron Nitride</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Defects in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), a two-dimensional van der Waals material, have raised wide range interest for its potential in various quantum applications. Due to hBN's 2D nature, spin center in hBN can be engineered in close proximity to target material, providing advantages over their 3D counterparts, such as nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond. Here we propose a novel quantum sensing protocol driven by exchange interaction between spin center in hBN and the underlying magnetic substrate induced by magnetic proximity effect. By first-principle calculation, we demonstrate the induced exchange interaction dominates over dipole-dipole interaction by orders of magnitude when in proximity. The interaction remains antiferromagnetic across all stacking configuration between the spin center in hBN and the target van der Waals magnets. Additionally, we explored the scaling behavior of the exchange field as a function of the spatial separation between the spin center and the targets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of an ion moving through a homogeneous Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) after an initial momentum is imparted. For this, we derive a master equation in the weak-coupling limit and Lamb-Dicke approximation for the reduced density matrix of the ion. We study the time evolution of the ion's kinetic energy and observe that its expectation value, identified as the ion temperature $T_\mathrm{ion}$, is reduced by several orders of magnitude in a time on the order of microseconds for a condensate density in the experimentally relevant range between $10^{13}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$ and $10^{14}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$. We characterize this behavior by defining the duration at half maximum as the time required by $T_\mathrm{ion}$ to reach half of its initial value, and study its dependence on the system parameters. Similarly, we find that the expectation value of the ion's momentum operator is reduced by nine orders of magnitude on the same timescale, making the ion's position converge to a final value. Based on these results, we conclude that the interaction with the bosonic bath allows for cooling and pinning of the ion by decreasing the expectation value of its kinetic energy and velocity, which constitutes a result of direct relevance for current atom-ion experiments.</description>

      <title>Solving quantum impurity problems on the L-shaped Kadanoff-Baym contour</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The path integral formalism is the building block of many powerful numerical methods for quantum impurity problems. However, existing path integral based numerical calculations have only been performed in either the imaginary-time or the real-time axis, while the most generic scenario formulated on the L-shaped Kadanoff-Baym contour is left unexplored. In this work, we extended the recently developed Grassmann time-evolving matrix product operator (GTEMPO) method to solve quantum impurity problems directly on the Kadanoff-Baym contour. The resulting method is numerically exact, with only two sources of numerical errors, e.g., the time discretization error and the matrix product state bond truncation error, which can both be well controlled. The accuracy of this method is numerically demonstrated against exact solutions in the noninteracting case, and against existing calculations on the real- and imaginary-time axes for the single-orbital Anderson impurity model. Our method is a perfect benchmarking baseline for its alternatives which often employ less-controlled approximations, and can also be used as a real-time impurity solver in dynamical mean field theory and its non-equilibrium extension.</description>

We invoke the explicit formulas of the eigenstates of the oscillator systems to establish bounds for their $\epsilon$-R\'enyi entanglement entropy $\epsilon\in(0,1)$.

      <description>arXiv:2404.05685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has long been believed that doped quantum spin liquids (QSLs) can give rise to fascinating quantum phases, including the possibility of high-temperature superconductivity (SC) as proposed by P. W. Anderson's resonating valence bond (RVB) scenario. The Kagome lattice $t$-$J$ model is known to exhibit spin liquid behavior at half-filling, making it an ideal system for studying the properties of doped QSL. In this study, we employ the fermionic projected entangled simplex state (PESS) method to investigate the ground state properties of the Kagome lattice $t$-$J$ model with $t/J = 3.0$. Our results reveal a phase transition from charge density wave (CDW) states to uniform states around a critical doping level $\delta_c \approx 0.27$. Within the CDW phase, we observe different types of Wigner crystal (WC) formulated by doped holes that are energetically favored. As we enter the uniform phase, a non-Fermi liquid (NFL) state emerges within the doping range $0.27 &lt; \delta &lt; 0.32$, characterized by an exponential decay of all correlation functions. With further hole doping, we discover the appearance of a pair density wave (PDW) state within a narrow doping region $0.32 &lt; \delta &lt; 1/3$. We also discuss the potential experimental implications of our findings.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the Chebyshev pseudosite matrix product state approach (ChePSMPS) as a solver for cluster perturbation theory (CPT), crucial for simulating spectral functions in two-dimensional electron-phonon ($e$-ph) coupling systems. ChePSMPS distinguishes itself from conventional exact diagonalization solvers by supporting larger clusters, thereby significantly mitigating finite-size effects. Free from the fermion sign problem, ChePSMPS enhances its ability to explore $e$-ph effects and generate high-resolution spectral functions in doped Mott insulators. We use this method to simulate the spectra for both one- and two-dimensional Hubbard-Holstein models, highlighting its superiority over other methods. Our findings validate ChePSMPS as a powerful and reliable Green's function solver. In conjunction with embedding methods, ChePSMPS emerges as an essential tool for simulating strongly correlated $e$-ph coupling systems.</description>

Abstract: We theoretically investigate the properties of magnetically-levitated superconducting rotors confined in anti-Helmholtz traps, for application in magnetomechanical experiments. We study both the translational modes and a librational mode. The librational mode gives an additional degree of freedom that levitated spheres do not have access to. We compare rotors of different shapes: ellipsoids, cylinders and cuboids. We find that the stable orientations of the rotors depend on the rotors' aspect ratios.</description>

      <title>Quantum non-Gaussianity of multi-phonon states of a single atom</title>

      <description>arXiv:2111.10129v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum non-Gaussian mechanical states from inherently nonlinear quantum processes are already required in a range of applications spanning from quantum sensing up to quantum computing with continuous variables. The discrete building blocks of such states are the energy eigenstates - Fock states. Despite the progress in their preparation, the remaining imperfections can still invisibly cause loss of the critical quantum non-Gaussian aspects of the phonon distribution relevant in the applications. We derive the most challenging hierarchy of quantum non-Gaussian criteria for the individual mechanical Fock states and demonstrate its implementation on the characterization of single trapped-ion oscillator states up to 10~phonons. We analyze the depth of quantum non-Gaussian features under mechanical heating and predict their application in quantum sensing. These results uncover that the crucial quantum non-Gaussian features are demanded to reach quantum advantage in the applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.11772v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work proposes double-bracket iterations as a framework for obtaining diagonalizing quantum circuits. Their implementation on a quantum computer consists of interlacing evolutions generated by the input Hamiltonian with diagonal evolutions which can be chosen variationally. No qubit overheads or controlled-unitary operations are needed but the method is recursive which makes the circuit depth grow exponentially with the number of recursion steps. To make near-term implementations viable, the proposal includes optimization of diagonal evolution generators and of recursion step durations. Indeed, thanks to this numerical examples show that the expressive power of double-bracket iterations suffices to approximate eigenstates of relevant quantum models with few recursion steps. Compared to brute-force optimization of unstructured circuits double-bracket iterations do not suffer from the same trainability limitations. Moreover, with an implementation cost lower than required for quantum phase estimation they are more suitable for near-term quantum computing experiments. More broadly, this work opens a pathway for constructing purposeful quantum algorithms based on so-called double-bracket flows also for tasks different from diagonalization and thus enlarges the quantum computing toolkit geared towards practical physics problems.</description>

      <title>Robust Qubit Mapping Algorithm via Double-Source Optimal Routing on Large Quantum Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.01306v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Qubit Mapping is a critical aspect of implementing quantum circuits on real hardware devices. Currently, the existing algorithms for qubit mapping encounter difficulties when dealing with larger circuit sizes involving hundreds of qubits. In this paper, we introduce an innovative qubit mapping algorithm, Duostra, tailored to address the challenge of implementing large-scale quantum circuits on real hardware devices with limited connectivity. Duostra operates by efficiently determining optimal paths for double-qubit gates and inserting SWAP gates accordingly to implement the double-qubit operations on real devices. Together with two heuristic scheduling algorithms, the Limitedly-Exhausitive (LE) Search and the Shortest-Path (SP) Estimation, it yields results of good quality within a reasonable runtime, thereby striving toward achieving quantum advantage. Experimental results showcase our algorithm's superiority, especially for large circuits beyond the NISQ era. For example, on large circuits with more than 50 qubits, we can reduce the mapping cost on an average 21.75% over the virtual best results among QMAP, t|ket&gt;, Qiskit and SABRE. Besides, for mid-size circuits such as the SABRE-large benchmark, we improve the mapping costs by 4.5%, 5.2%, 16.3%, 20.7%, and 25.7%, when compared to QMAP, TOQM, t|ket&gt;, Qiskit, and SABRE, respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.03668v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Several classes of quantum circuits have been shown to provide a quantum computational advantage under certain assumptions. The study of ever more restricted classes of quantum circuits capable of quantum advantage is motivated by possible simplifications in experimental demonstrations. In this paper we study the efficiency of measurement-based quantum computation with a completely flat temporal ordering of measurements. We propose new constructions for the deterministic computation of arbitrary Boolean functions, drawing on correlations present in multi-qubit Greenberger, Horne, and Zeilinger (GHZ) states. We characterize the necessary measurement complexity using the Clifford hierarchy, and also generally decrease the number of qubits needed with respect to previous constructions. In particular, we identify a family of Boolean functions for which deterministic evaluation using non-adaptive MBQC is possible, featuring quantum advantage in width and number of gates with respect to classical circuits.</description>

Abstract: Engineered dissipative reservoirs have the potential to steer many-body quantum systems toward correlated steady states useful for quantum simulation of high-temperature superconductivity or quantum magnetism. Using up to 49 superconducting qubits, we prepared low-energy states of the transverse-field Ising model through coupling to dissipative auxiliary qubits. In one dimension, we observed long-range quantum correlations and a ground-state fidelity of 0.86 for 18 qubits at the critical point. In two dimensions, we found mutual information that extends beyond nearest neighbors. Lastly, by coupling the system to auxiliaries emulating reservoirs with different chemical potentials, we explored transport in the quantum Heisenberg model. Our results establish engineered dissipation as a scalable alternative to unitary evolution for preparing entangled many-body states on noisy quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium dynamics of the Jaynes-Cummings dimer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.00614v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the nonequilibrium dynamics of a Josephson-coupled Jaynes-Cummings dimer in the presence of Kerr nonlinearity, which can be realized in the cavity and circuit quantum electrodynamics systems. The semiclassical dynamics is analyzed systematically to chart out a variety of photonic Josephson oscillations and their regime of stability. Different types of transitions between the dynamical states lead to the self-trapping phenomenon, which results in photon population imbalance between the two cavities. We also study the dynamics quantum mechanically to identify characteristic features of different steady states and to explore fascinating quantum effects, such as spin dephasing, phase fluctuation, and revival phenomena of the photon field, as well as the entanglement of spin qubits. For a particular "self-trapped" state, the mutual information between the atomic qubits exhibits a direct correlation with the photon population imbalance, which is promising for generating photon mediated entanglement between two non interacting qubits in a controlled manner. Under a sudden quench from stable to unstable regime, the photon distribution exhibits phase space mixing with a rapid loss of coherence, resembling a thermal state. Finally, we discuss the relevance of the new results in experiments, which can have applications in quantum information processing and quantum technologies.</description>

Abstract: We take a fresh look at Wigner's Friend thought-experiment and some of its more recent variants and extensions, such as the Frauchiger-Renner (FR) Paradox. We discuss various solutions proposed in the literature, focusing on a few questions: What is the correct epistemic interpretation of the multiplicity of state assignments in these scenarios? Under which conditions can one include classical observers into the quantum state descriptions, in a way that is still compatible with traditional Quantum Mechanics? Under which conditions can one system be admitted as an additional 'observer' from the perspective of another background observer? When can the standard axioms of multi-agent Epistemic Logic (that allow "knowledge transfer" between agents) be applied to quantum-physical observers? In the last part of the paper, we propose a new answer to these questions, sketch a particular formal implementation of this answer, and apply it to obtain a principled solution to Wigner Friend-type paradoxes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.06489v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we propose a novel device for controlling the flow of information using Weyl fermions. Based on a previous work of our group, we show that it is possible to fully control the flow of Weyl fermions on several different channels, by applying an electric field perpendicular to the direction of motion of the particles on each channel. In this way, we can transmit information as logical bits, depending on the existence or not of a Weyl current on each channel. We also show that the response time of this device is exceptionally low, less than 1 ps, for typical values of its parameters, allowing the control of the flow of information at extremely high rates, of the order of 100 Petabits per second. Alternatively, this device could also operate as an electric field sensor. In addition, we demonstrate that Weyl fermions can be efficiently guided through the proposed device using appropriate magnetic fields. Finally, we discuss some particularly interesting remarks regarding the electromagnetic interactions of high energy particles.</description>

      <title>Gaussian decomposition of magic states for matchgate computations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.12654v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magic states, pivotal for universal quantum computation via classically simulable Clifford gates, often undergo decomposition into resourceless stabilizer states, facilitating simulation through classical means. This approach yields three operationally significant metrics: stabilizer rank, fidelity, and extent. We extend these simulation methods to encompass matchgate circuits (MGCs), and define equivalent metrics for this setting. We begin with an investigation into the algebraic constraints defining Gaussian states, marking the first explicit characterisation of these states. The explicit description of Gaussian states is pivotal to our methods for tackling all the simulation tasks. Central to our inquiry is the concept of Gaussian rank -- a pivotal metric defining the minimum terms required for decomposing a quantum state into Gaussian constituents. This metric holds paramount significance in determining the runtime of rank-based simulations for MGCs featuring magic state inputs. The absence of low-rank decompositions presents a computational hurdle, thereby prompting a deeper examination of fermionic magic states. We find that the Gaussian rank of 2 instances of our canonical magic state is 4 under symmetry-restricted decompositions. Additionally, our numerical analysis suggests the absence of low-rank decompositions for 2 or 3 copies of this magic state. Further, we explore the Gaussian extent, a convex metric offering an upper bound on the rank. We prove the Gaussian extent's multiplicative behaviour on 4-qubit systems, along with initial strides towards proving its sub-multiplicative nature in general settings. One important result in that direction we present is an upper bound on the Gaussian fidelity of generic states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.13518v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of phase transitions in dissipative quantum systems based on the Liouvillian is often hindered by the difficulty of constructing a time-local master equation when the system-environment coupling is strong. To address this issue, the complex discretization approximation for the environment is proposed to study the quantum phase transition in the extended Jaynes-Cumming model with an infinite number of boson modes. This approach yields a non-Hermitian effective Hamiltonian that can be used to simulate the dynamics of the spin. It is found that the ground state of this effective Hamiltonian determines the spin dynamics in the single-excitation subspace. Depending on the opening of the energy gap and the maximum population of excitations on the spin degree of freedom, three distinct phases can be identified: fast decaying, localized, and stretched dynamics of the spin. This approach can be extended to multiple excitations, and similar dynamics were found in the double-excitation subspace, indicating the robustness of the single-excitation phase.</description>

      <title>Learnability transitions in monitored quantum dynamics via eavesdropper's classical shadows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.15011v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Monitored quantum dynamics -- unitary evolution interspersed with measurements -- has recently emerged as a rich domain for phase structure in quantum many-body systems away from equilibrium. Here we study monitored dynamics from the point of view of an eavesdropper who has access to the classical measurement outcomes, but not to the quantum many-body system. We show that a measure of information flow from the quantum system to the classical measurement record -- the informational power -- undergoes a phase transition in correspondence with the measurement-induced phase transition (MIPT). This transition determines the eavesdropper's (in)ability to learn properties of an unknown initial quantum state of the system, given a complete classical description of the monitored dynamics and arbitrary classical computational resources. We make this learnability transition concrete by defining classical shadows protocols that the eavesdropper may apply to this problem, and show that the MIPT manifests as a transition in the sample complexity of various shadow estimation tasks, which become harder in the low-measurement phase. We focus on three applications of interest: Pauli expectation values (where we find the MIPT appears as a point of optimal learnability for typical Pauli operators), many-body fidelity, and global charge in $U(1)$-symmetric dynamics. Our work unifies different manifestations of the MIPT under the umbrella of learnability and gives this notion a general operational meaning via classical shadows.</description>

      <title>Collective Polaritonic Effects on Chemical Dynamics Suppressed by Disorder</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.03954v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a powerful formalism, disordered collective dynamics using truncated equations (d-CUT-E), to simulate the ultrafast quantum dynamics of molecular polaritons in the collective strong coupling regime, where a disordered ensemble of $N\gg10^{6}$ molecules couples to a cavity mode. Notably, we can capture this dynamics with a cavity hosting a single \textit{effective} molecule with $\sim N_{bins}$ electronic states, where $N_{bins}\ll N$ is the number of bins discretizing the disorder distribution. Using d-CUT-E we conclude that strong coupling, as evaluated from linear optical spectra, can be a poor proxy for polariton chemistry. For highly disordered ensembles, total reaction yield upon broadband excitation is identical to that outside of the cavity, while narrowband excitation produces distinct reaction yields solely due to differences in the initial states prepared prior to the reaction.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we develop a supervised learning model for implementing robust quantum control in composite-pulse systems, where the training parameters can be either phases, detunings, or Rabi frequencies. This model exhibits great resistance to all kinds of systematic errors, including single, multiple, and time-varying errors. We propose a modified gradient descent algorithm for adapting the training of phase parameters, and show that different sampling methods result in different robust performances. In particular, there is a trade-off between high fidelity and robustness for a given number of training parameters, and both can be simultaneously enhanced by increasing the number of training parameters (pulses). For its applications, we demonstrate that the current model can be used for achieving high-fidelity arbitrary superposition states and universal quantum gates in a robust manner. This work provides a highly efficient learning model for fault-tolerant quantum computation by training various physical parameters.</description>

      <title>Accurate Hyperfine Tensors for Solid State Quantum Applications: Case of the NV Center in Diamond</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.03983v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The decoherence of point defect qubits is often governed by the electron spin-nuclear spin hyperfine interaction that can be parameterized by using ab inito calculations in principle. So far most of the theoretical works have focused on the hyperfine interaction of the closest nuclear spins, while the accuracy of the predictions for distinct nuclear spins is barely discussed. We demonstrate for the case of the NV center in diamond that the absolute relative error of the computed hyperfine parameters can exceed 100\% in VASP for weakly coupled nuclear spins. To overcome this issue, we implement an alternative method and report on significantly improved hyperfine values with $O$(1\%) relative mean error at all distances. The provided accurate hyperfine data for the NV center enables high-precision simulation of NV quantum nodes for quantum information processing and positioning of nuclear spins by comparing experimental and theoretical hyperfine data.</description>

      <title>Certifying sets of quantum observables with any full-rank state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05735v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that some sets of quantum observables are unique up to an isometry and have a contextuality witness that attains the same value for any initial state. We prove that these two properties make it possible to certify any of these sets by looking at the statistics of experiments with sequential measurements and using any initial state of full rank, including thermal and maximally mixed states. We prove that this ``certification with any full-rank state'' (CFR) is possible for any quantum system of finite dimension $d \ge 3$ and is robust and experimentally useful in dimensions 3 and 4. In addition, we prove that complete Kochen-Specker sets can be Bell self-tested if and only if they enable CFR. This establishes a fundamental connection between these two methods of certification, shows that both methods can be combined in the same experiment, and opens new possibilities for certifying quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Post-processing variationally scheduled quantum algorithm for constrained combinatorial optimization problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.08120v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a post-processing variationally scheduled quantum algorithm (pVSQA) for solving constrained combinatorial optimization problems (COPs). COPs are typically transformed into ground-state search problems of the Ising model on a quantum annealer or gate-type quantum device. Variational methods are used to find an optimal schedule function that leads to high-quality solutions in a short amount of time. Post-processing techniques convert the output solutions of the quantum devices to satisfy the constraints of the COPs. pVSQA combines the variational methods and the post-processing technique. We obtain a sufficient condition for constrained COPs to apply pVSQA based on a greedy post-processing algorithm. We apply the proposed method to two constrained NP-hard COPs: the graph partitioning problem and the quadratic knapsack problem. pVSQA on a simulator shows that a small number of variational parameters is sufficient to achieve a (near-)optimal performance within a predetermined operation time. Then building upon the simulator results, we implement pVSQA on a quantum annealer and a gate-type quantum device. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.</description>

Abstract: The group of transversal gates is an invariant of quantum codes. With respect to this parameter, we demonstrate that non-additive codes can strictly outperform stabilizer codes, and often by large margins. We do this by constructing spin codes that corresponds to permutationally invariant multiqubit codes implementing generalized phase gates transversally. Of particular note, we construct codes that implement a transversal $ T $ gate using fewer qubits and with a better minimum distance than is possible with any stabilizer code.</description>

Abstract: With its rich dynamics, the quantum harmonic oscillator is an innate platform for understanding real-world quantum systems and could even excel as the heart of a quantum computer. A particularly promising and rapidly advancing platform that harnesses quantum harmonic oscillators for information processing is the bosonic circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) system. In this article, we provide perspectives on the progress, challenges, and future directions in building a bosonic cQED quantum computer. We describe the main hardware building blocks and how they facilitate quantum error correction, metrology, and simulation. We conclude with our views of the key challenges that lie on the horizon, as well as scientific and cultural strategies for overcoming them and building a practical quantum computer with bosonic cQED hardware.</description>

      <title>Optimal work extraction from quantum batteries based on the expected utility hypothesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14489v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Work extraction in quantum finite systems is an important issue in quantum thermodynamics. The optimal work extracted is called ergotropy, and it is achieved by maximizing the average work extracted over all the unitary cycles. However, an agent that is non-neutral to risk is affected by fluctuations and should extract work by following the expected utility hypothesis. Thus, we investigate the optimal work extraction performed by a risk non-neutral agent by maximizing the average utility function over all the unitary cycles. We mainly focus on initial states that are incoherent with respect to the energy basis, achieving a probability distribution of work. In this case we show how the optimal work extraction will be performed with an incoherent unitary transformation, namely a permutation of the energy basis, which depends on the risk aversion of the agent. We give several examples, in particular also the work extraction from an ensemble of quantum batteries is examined. Furthermore, we also investigate how work extraction is affected by the presence of initial quantum coherence in the energy basis by considering a quasiprobability distribution of work.</description>

Abstract: We provide a systemic theory to entangle excitons with microcavity photons. This is realized by adopting an exciton-optomechanics system and introducing a nonlinear dispersive interaction with a mechanical oscillator. We show that when either the exciton and cavity modes in the weak-coupling regime, or the two exciton-polariton modes in the strong-coupling regime, are respectively resonant with the optomechanical Stokes and anti-Stokes sidebands, entanglement between excitons and cavity photons, or between two exciton polaritons, can be established. The entanglement is in the steady state and can potentially be achievable at room temperature. In both cases, genuine tripartite entanglement is shown to be present.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.04778v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Liouville theorem (LT) reveals robust incompressibility of distribution function in phase space, given arbitrary potentials. However, its quantum generalization, Wigner flow, is compressible, i.e., LT is only conditionally true (e.g., for perfect Harmonic potential). We develop quantum Liouville theorem (rigorous incompressibility) for arbitrary potentials (interacting or not) in Hamiltonians. Haar measure, instead of symplectic measure dp^dq used in Wigner's scheme, plays a central role. The argument is based on general measure theory, independent of specific spaces or coordinates. Comparison of classical and quantum is made: for instance, we address why Haar measure and metric preservation do not work in the classical case. Applications of theorems in statistics, topological phase transition, ergodic theory, etc. are discussed.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we represent $n$-qubits as hypermatrices and consider various applications to quantum entanglement. In particular, we use the higher-order singular value decomposition of hypermatrices to prove that the $\pi$-transpose is an LU invariant. Additionally, through our construction we show that the matrix representation of the combinatorial hyperdeterminant of $2n$-qubits can be expressed as a product of the second Pauli matrix, allowing us to derive a formula for the combinatorial hyperdeterminant of $2n$-qubits in terms of the $n$-tangle.</description>

Abstract: We consider the quantum memory assisted state verification task, where the local verifiers can store copies of quantum states and measure them collectively. We establish an exact analytic formula for optimizing two-copy state verification and give a globally optimal two-copy strategy for multi-qubit graph states involving only Bell measurements. When arbitrary memory is available to the verifiers, we present a dimension expansion technique that designs efficient verification strategies, showcasing its application to GHZ-like states. These strategies become increasingly advantageous with growing memory resources, ultimately approaching the theoretical limit of efficiency. Our findings demonstrate that quantum memories enhance state verification efficiency, sheding light on error-resistant strategies and practical applications of large-scale quantum memory-assisted verification.</description>

Abstract: In photonic quantum applications, optical routers are required to handle single photons with low loss, high speed, and preservation of their quantum states. Single-photon routing with maintained polarization states is particularly important for utilizing them as qubits. Here, we demonstrate a polarization-maintaining electro-optic router compatible with single photons. Our custom electro-optic modulator is embedded in a configuration of a Mach-Zehnder interferometer, where each optical component achieves polarization-maintaining operation. We observe the performance of the router with 2-4% loss, 20 dB switching extinction ratio, 2.9 ns rise time, and $&gt;$ 99% polarization process fidelity to an ideal identity operation.</description>

      <title>The Quantum Ratio</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10702v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The concept of {\it quantum ratio} emerged in the recent efforts to understand how Newton's equations appear for the center of mass (CM) of an isolated macroscopic body at finite body-temperatures, as the first approximation to quantum-mechanical equations. It is defined as $Q\equiv R_q/L_0$, where the quantum fluctuation range $R_q$ is the spatial extension of the pure-state CM wave function, whereas $L_0$ stands for the body's linear size (the space support of the internal, bound-state wave function). The two cases $R_q /L_0 \lesssim 1$ or $R_q/ L_0 \gg 1$, roughly correspond to the body's CM behaving classically or quantum mechanically, respectively. In the present note we elaborate more on this concept, illustrating it in several examples. An important notion following from introduction of the quantum ratio is that the elementary particles (thus the electron and the photon) are quantum mechanical, even when the environment-induced decoherence turns them into a mixed state. Decoherence and classical state should not be identified. This simple observation, further illustrated by the consideration of a few atomic or molecular processes, may have significant implications on the way quantum mechanics works in biological systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17201v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The modification of the quantum properties of coherence of photons through their interaction with matter lies at the heart of the quantum theory of light. Indeed, the absorption and emission of photons by atoms can lead to different kinds of light with characteristic quantum statistical properties. As such, different types of light are typically associated with distinct sources. Here, we report on the observation of the modification of quantum coherence of multiphoton systems in free space. This surprising effect is produced by the scattering of thermal multiphoton wavepackets upon propagation. The modification of the excitation mode of a photonic system and its associated quantum fluctuations result in the formation of different light fields with distinct quantum coherence properties. Remarkably, we show that these processes of scattering can lead to multiphoton systems with sub-shot-noise quantum properties. Our observations are validated through the nonclassical formulation of the emblematic van Cittert-Zernike theorem. We believe that the possibility of producing quantum systems with modified properties of coherence, through linear propagation, can have dramatic implications for diverse quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Quantum Heat Engine Based on Non-Markovian Dynamics of an Optomechanical Hamiltonian</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18515v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a recipe for demonstrating an autonomous quantum heat engine where the working fluid consists of a harmonic oscillator, the frequency of which is tuned by a driving mode. The working fluid is coupled two heat reservoirs each exhibiting a peaked power spectrum, a hot reservoir peaked at a higher frequency than the cold reservoir. Provided that the driving mode is initialized in a coherent state with a high enough amplitude and the parameters of the utilized optomechanical Hamiltonian and the reservoirs are appropriate, the driving mode induces an approximate Otto cycle for the working fluid and consequently its oscillation amplitude begins to increase in time. We build both an analytical and a non-Markovian quasiclassical model for this quantum heat engine and show that reasonably powerful coherent fields can be generated as the output of the quantum heat engine. This general theoretical proposal heralds the in-depth studies of quantum heat engines in the non-Markovian regime. Further, it paves the way for specific physical realizations, such as those in optomechanical systems, and for the subsequent experimental realization of an autonomous quantum heat engine.</description>

Abstract: In view of the remarkable progress in micro-rheology to monitor the random motion of Brownian particles with size as small as few nanometers, in association that de Broglie matter waves have been experimentally observed for large molecules of comparable nanometer size; we examine whether Brownian particles can manifest a particle-wave duality without employing a priori arguments from quantum decoherence. First, we examine the case where Brownian particles are immersed in a memoryless viscous fluid with a time-independent diffusion coefficient; and the requirement for the Brownian particles to manifest a particle-wave duality leads to the untenable result that the diffusion coefficient has to be proportional to the inverse time; therefore, diverging at early times. This finding agrees with past conclusions--that quantum mechanics is not equivalent to a Markovian diffusion process. Next, we examine the case where the Brownian particle is trapped in a harmonic potential well with and without dissipation. Both solutions of the Fokker-Plank equation for the case with dissipation, and of the Schrodinger equation for the case without dissipation lead to the same physically acceptable result-that for the Brownian particle to manifest a particle-wave duality, its mean kinetic energy needs to be half the ground-state energy of the quantum harmonic oscillator. Our one-dimensional calculations show that for this to happen, the trapping needs to be very strong so that a Brownian nanoparticle needs to be embedded in an extremely stiff solid.</description>

      <title>Clock offset recovery with sublinear complexity enables synchronization on low-level hardware for quantum key distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04081v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce iQSync, a clock offset recovery method designed for implementation on low-level hardware, such as FPGAs or microcontrollers, for quantum key distribution (QKD). iQSync requires minimal memory, only a simple instruction set (e.g. no floating-point operations), and can be evaluated with sublinear time complexity, typically involving no more than a few thousand iterations of a simple loop. Furthermore, iQSync allows for a precise clock offset recovery within few seconds, even for large offsets, and is well suited for scenarios with high channel loss and low signal-to-noise ratio, irrespective of the prepare-and-measure QKD protocol used. We implemented the method on our QKD platform, demonstrating its performance and conformity with analytically derived success probabilities for channel attenuations exceeding 70 dB.</description>

      <title>Microscopic theory of nonlinear phase space filling in polaritonic lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.07968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.07968v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a full microscopic theory for a nonlinear phase space filling (NPSF) in strongly coupled two-dimensional polaritonic lattices. Ubiquitous in polaritonic experiments, the theoretical description of NPSF, remains limited to perturbative treatment and homogeneous samples. In this study, we go beyond the existing theoretical description and discover the broad scope of regimes where NPSF crucially modifies the optical response. Studying the quantum effects of non-bosonicity, cooperative light-matter coupling, and Coulomb blockade, we reveal several regimes for observing the nonlinear Rabi splitting quench due to the phase space filling. Unlike prior studies, we derive nonlinear Rabi frequency scaling all the way to the saturation limit and show that the presence of a lattice potential leads to qualitatively distinct nonlinearity. We concentrate on three regimes of NPSF: 1) planar; 2) fractured; and 3) ultralocalized. In planar saturation, the Rabi frequency decreases exponentially as a function of exciton density. For the fractured case, where excitons form a lattice with sites exceeding the exciton size, we discover fast NPSF at low occupation in the lattice. This is followed by slower NPSF as the medium becomes fully saturated. This behavior is particularly pronounced in the presence of Coulomb (or Rydberg) blockade, where regions of fast and slow NPSF depend on the strength of repulsion. For the ultralocalized NPSF, we observe the square-root saturation typical to the collection of two-level systems. Our findings can help describing recent observations of strong nonlinearity in heterobilayers of transition metal dichalcogenides where Moir{\'e} lattices emerge naturally [Nature \textbf{591}, 61 (2021)]. The theory also opens the prospects for engineering strongly nonlinear responses of polaritonic lattices with patterned samples, driving polaritonics into the quantum regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.04112v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the internal quality factors of high impedance superconducting resonators made of granular aluminum can be improved by coating them with micrometric films of solid para-hydrogen molecular crystals. We attribute the average measured $\approx 8\%$ reduction in dissipation to absorption of stray terahertz radiation at the crystal-resonator interface and the subsequent dissipation of its energy in the form of phonons below the pair-breaking gap. Our results prove that, contrary to expectations, replacing the vacuum dielectric atop a superconducting resonator can be beneficial, thanks to the added protection against Cooper pair-braking terahertz radiation. Moreover, at the level of internal quality factors in the $10^5$ range, the hydrogen crystal does not introduce additional losses, which is promising for embedding impurities to couple to superconducting thin-film devices in hybrid quantum architectures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.15177v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Advanced tensor network numerical methods are used to explore the fidelity of repeated SWAP operations on a system comprising 20-100 quantum dot spin qubits in the presence of valley leakage and electrostatic crosstalk. The fidelity of SWAP gates is largely unaffected by Zeeman splitting and valley splitting, except when these parameters come into resonance. The fidelity remains independent of the overall valley phase for valley eigenstates, while for generic valley states, some minor corrections arise. We analyze the fidelity scaling for long qubit chains without valley effects, where crosstalk represents the only error source.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.06240v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the direct observation of superconductivity in nitridized-aluminum thin films. The films are produced by sputtering deposition of aluminum in a controlled mixture of nitrogen diluted in argon. The concentration of applied nitrogen directly determines the properties of the superconducting thin films. We observe samples displaying critical temperatures up to 3.38$\pm$0.01K and resilience to in-plane magnetic fields well above 1T, with good reproducibility of the results. This work represents an unambiguous demonstration of tunable superconductivity in aluminum-based nitridized thin films. Our results put forward nitridized aluminum as a promising material to be employed in superconducting quantum circuits for quantum technology applications.</description>

      <title>Similarity between a many-body quantum avalanche model and the ultrametric random matrix model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.07431v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the field of ergodicity-breaking phases, it has been recognized that quantum avalanches can destabilize many-body localization at a wide range of disorder strengths. This has in particular been demonstrated by the numerical study of a toy model, sometimes simply called the "avalanche model" or the "quantum sun model" [Phys. Rev. Lett. 129, 060602 (2022)], which consists of an ergodic seed coupled to a perfectly localized material. In this paper, we connect this toy model to a well-studied model in random matrix theory, the ultrametric ensemble. We conjecture that the models share the following features. 1) The location of the critical point may be predicted sharply by analytics. 2) On the localized site, both models exhibit Fock space localization. 3) There is a manifold of critical points. On the critical manifold, the eigenvectors exhibit nontrivial multifractal behaviour that can be tuned by moving on the manifold. 4) The spectral statistics at criticality is intermediate between Poisson statistics and random matrix statistics, also tunable on the critical manifold. We confirm numerically these properties.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Decay due to Operator Spreading in Bulk-Dissipated Quantum Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.03485v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Markovian open many-body quantum systems display complicated relaxation dynamics. The spectral gap of the Liouvillian characterizes the asymptotic decay rate towards the stationary state, but it has recently been pointed out that the spectral gap does not necessarily determine the overall relaxation time. Our understanding on the relaxation process before the asymptotically long-time regime is still limited. We here present a collective relaxation dynamics of autocorrelation functions in the stationary state. As a key quantity in the analysis, we introduce the instantaneous decay rate, which characterizes the transient relaxation and converges to the conventional asymptotic decay rate in the long-time limit. Our theory predicts that a bulk-dissipated system generically shows an accelerated decay before the asymptotic regime due to the scrambling of quantum information associated with the operator spreading.</description>

      <title>Absence of spin liquid phase in the $J_1-J_2$ Heisenberg model on the square lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13630v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform an in-depth investigation of the phase diagram of the $J_1-J_2$ Heisenberg model on the square lattice. We take advantage of Density Matrix Renormalization Group and Fully-Augmented Matrix Product States methods and reach unprecedented accuracy with large bond dimensions. We utilize excited-level crossing analysis to pinpoint the phase transition points. It was believed before that there exists a narrow spin liquid phase sandwiched by the N\'eel antiferromagnetic (AFM) and valence bond solid (VBS) phases. Through careful finite size scaling of the level crossing points, we find a direct phase transition between the N\'eel AFM and VBS phases at $J_2/J_1 = 0.535(3)$, suggesting the absence of an intermediate spin liquid phase. We also provide accurate results for ground state energies for a variety of sizes, from which we find that the transition between the N\'eel AFM and VBS phases is continuous. These results indicate the existence of a deconfined quantum critical point at $J_2/J_1 = 0.535(3)$ in the model. From the crossing of the first derivative of the energies with $J_2$ for different sizes, we also determine the precise location of the first order phase transition between the VBS and stripe AFM phases at $J_2/J_1=0.610(5)$.</description>

      <title>Remarks on effects of projective phase on eigenstate thermalization hypothesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.11425v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The existence of $p$-form symmetry in $(d+1)$-dimensional quantum field is known to always lead to the breakdown of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) for certain $(d-p)$-dimensional operators other than symmetry operators under some assumptions. The assumptions include the mixing of symmetry sectors within a given energy shell, which is rather challenging to verify because it requires information on the eigenstates in the middle of the spectrum. We reconsider this assumption from the viewpoint of projective representations to avoid this difficulty. In the case of $\mathbb{Z}_N$ symmetries, we can circumvent the difficulty by considering $\mathbb{Z}_N\times\mathbb{Z}_N$-symmetric theories with nontrivial projective phases, and perturbing the Hamiltonian while preserving one of the $\mathbb{Z}_N$ symmetries of our interest. We also perform numerical analyses for $(1+1)$-dimensional spin chains and the $(2+1)$-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.05674v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has recently been understood that the complete global symmetry of finite group topological gauge theories contains the structure of a higher-group. Here we study the higher-group structure in (3+1)D $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory with an emergent fermion, and point out that pumping chiral $p+ip$ topological states gives rise to a $\mathbb{Z}_{8}$ 0-form symmetry with mixed gravitational anomaly. This ordinary symmetry mixes with the other higher symmetries to form a 3-group structure, which we examine in detail. We then show that in the context of stabilizer quantum codes, one can obtain logical CCZ and CS gates by placing the code on a discretization of $T^3$ (3-torus) and $T^2 \rtimes_{C_2} S^1$ (2-torus bundle over the circle) respectively, and pumping $p+ip$ states. Our considerations also imply the possibility of a logical $T$ gate by placing the code on $\mathbb{RP}^3$ and pumping a $p+ip$ topological state.</description>

      <title>The T-Complexity Costs of Error Correction for Control Flow in Quantum Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12772v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Numerous quantum algorithms require the use of quantum error correction to overcome the intrinsic unreliability of physical qubits. However, error correction imposes a unique performance bottleneck, known as T-complexity, that can make an implementation of an algorithm as a quantum program run more slowly than on idealized hardware. In this work, we identify that programming abstractions for control flow, such as the quantum if-statement, can introduce polynomial increases in the T-complexity of a program. If not mitigated, this slowdown can diminish the computational advantage of a quantum algorithm.
  To enable reasoning about the costs of control flow, we present a cost model that a developer can use to accurately analyze the T-complexity of a program and pinpoint the sources of slowdown. We also present a set of program-level optimizations, that a developer can use to rewrite a program to reduce its T-complexity, predict the T-complexity of the optimized program using the cost model, and then compile it to an efficient circuit via a straightforward strategy.
  We implement the program-level optimizations in Spire, an extension of the Tower quantum compiler. Using a set of 11 benchmark programs that use control flow, we show that the cost model is accurate, and that Spire's optimizations recover programs that are asymptotically efficient, meaning their runtime T-complexity under error correction is equal to their time complexity on idealized hardware.
  Our results show that optimizing a program before it is compiled to a circuit can yield better results than compiling the program to an inefficient circuit and then invoking a quantum circuit optimizer found in prior work. For our benchmarks, only 2 of 8 tested circuit optimizers recover circuits with asymptotically efficient T-complexity. Compared to these 2 optimizers, Spire uses 54x to 2400x less compile time.</description>

      <title>Probing pair correlations in Fermi gases with Ramsey-Bragg interferometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13960v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an interferometric method to probe pair correlations in a gas of spin-1/2 fermions. The method consists of a Ramsey sequence where both spin states of the Fermi gas are set in a superposition of a state at rest and a state with a large recoil velocity. The two-body density matrix is extracted via the fluctuations of the transferred fraction to the recoiled state. In the pair-condensed phase, the off-diagonal long-range order is directly reflected in the asymptotic behavior of the interferometric signal for long interrogation times. The method also allows to probe the spatial structure of the condensed pairs: the interferometric signal is an oscillating function of the interrogation time in the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer regime; it becomes an overdamped function in the molecular Bose-Einstein condensate regime.</description>

      <title>Work fluctuation theorems with initial quantum coherence</title>

Abstract: Fluctuation theorems are fundamental results in nonequilibrium thermodynamics beyond the linear response regime. Among these, the paradigmatic Tasaki-Crooks fluctuation theorem relates the statistics of the works done in a forward out-of-equilibrium quantum process and in a corresponding backward one. In particular, the initial states of the two processes are thermal states and thus incoherent in the energy basis. Here, we aim to investigate the role of initial quantum coherence in work fluctuation theorems, by considering a quasiprobability distribution of work. To do this, we formulate and examine the implications of a detailed fluctuation theorem, which reproduces the Tasaki-Crooks fluctuation theorem in the absence of initial quantum coherence.</description>

Abstract: A general scheme is given for supercomputer simulation of quantum processes, which are described by various modifications of finite-dimensional cavity quantum electrodynamics models, including Jaynes-Cummings-Hubbard model and Tavis-Cummings-Hubbard model.

      <title>Unscrambling of single-particle wave functions in systems localized through disorder and monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10725v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In systems undergoing localization-delocalization quantum phase transitions due to disorder or monitoring, there is a crucial need for robust methods capable of distinguishing phases and uncovering their intrinsic properties. In this work, we develop a process of finding a Slater determinant representation of free-fermion wave functions that accurately characterizes localized particles, a procedure we dub "unscrambling". The central idea is to minimize the overlap between envelopes of single-particle wave functions or, equivalently, to maximize the inverse participation ratio of each orbital. This numerically efficient methodology can differentiate between distinct types of wave functions: exponentially localized, power-law localized, and conformal critical, also revealing the underlying physics of these states. Furthermore, we apply this approach to a more challenging problem involving disordered monitored free fermions in one dimension, where the unscrambling process unveils the presence of a conformal critical phase and a localized area-law quantum Zeno phase. Importantly, our method can also be extended to free fermion systems without particle number conservation, which we demonstrate by estimating the phase diagram of $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetric disordered monitored free fermions. Our results unlock the potential of utilizing single-particle wave functions to gain valuable insights into the localization transition properties in systems such as monitored free fermions and disordered models.</description>

      <title>Dispersive shock waves in a one-dimensional droplet-bearing environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02998v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the controllable generation of distinct types of dispersive shock-waves emerging in a quantum droplet bearing environment with the aid of step-like initial conditions. Dispersive regularization of the ensuing hydrodynamic singularities occurs due to the competition between meanfield repulsion and attractive quantum fluctuations. This interplay delineates the dominance of defocusing (hyperbolic) and focusing (elliptic) hydrodynamic phenomena respectively being designated by real and imaginary speed of sound. Specifically, the symmetries of the extended Gross-Pitaevskii model lead to a three-parameter family, encompassing two densities and a relative velocity, of the underlying Riemann problem utilized herein. Surprisingly, dispersive shock waves persist across the hyperbolic-to-elliptic threshold, while a plethora of additional wave patterns arise, such as rarefaction waves, traveling dispersive shock waves, (anti)kinks and droplet wavetrains. The classification and characterization of these features is achieved by deploying Whitham modulation theory. Our results pave the way for unveiling a multitude of unexplored coherently propagating waveforms in such attractively interacting mixtures and should be detectable by current experiments.</description>

      <title>Direct Experimental Constraints on the Spatial Extent of a Neutrino Wavepacket</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03102v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite their high relative abundance in our Universe, neutrinos are the least understood fundamental particles of nature. They also provide a unique system to study quantum coherence in fundamental systems due to their extremely weak interaction probabilities. The quantum properties of neutrinos emitted in experimentally relevant sources are virtually unknown and theoretical predictions for the spatial width of neutrino wavepackets vary by many orders of magnitude. In weak nuclear decay, the size of a neutrino wavepacket, $\sigma_{\nu,x}$, is related to the spatial wavefunction of its parent at production. Here, we present the first direct limits of this quantity through a new experimental concept to extract the energy width, $\sigma_{\textrm{N},E}$, of the recoil daughter nucleus emitted in the nuclear electron capture (EC) decay of $^7$Be. The final state in the EC decay process contains a recoiling $^7$Li nucleus and an electron neutrino ($\nu_e$) which are entangled at their creation. The $^7$Li energy spectrum is measured to high precision by directly embedding $^7$Be radioisotopes into a high resolution superconducting tunnel junction that is operated as a cryogenic charge sensitive detector. The lower limit on the spatial coherence of the recoil daughter was found to be $\sigma_{\textrm{N}, x} \geq 6.2$ pm, which implies the system remains in a spatially coherent state much larger than the nuclear scale. Further, this implies a lower limit on the size of a neutrino wavepacket, $\sigma_{\nu,x} \geq 35$ nm, which is more than five orders of magnitude more stringent than the limits from all combined reactor oscillation experiments. These results have wide-reaching implications in several areas including quantum coherence, the nature of spatial localization at sub-atomic scales, interpretation of neutrino physics data, and the potential reach of future large-scale experiments.</description>

      <title>Attosecond Rabi Oscillations in High Harmonic Generation Resonantly Driven by Extreme Ultraviolet Laser Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04053v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-order harmonic generation driven by intense extreme ultraviolet (EUV) fields merges quantum optics and attosecond science, giving rise to an appealing route for the generation of coherent EUV and soft X-ray light for high-resolution imaging and spectroscopies. We theoretically investigate ultrafast resonant dynamics during the interaction of He atoms with strong extreme ultraviolet pulses. At high driving intensities, we identify record fast attosecond Rabi oscillations imprinting observable signatures in the high harmonic spectrum. At field strengths suppressing the Coulomb potential barrier for all the bounded states, we demonstrate the survival of the attosecond two-level dynamics for several Rabi cycles. Consequently, this intense EUV laser-atom interaction reveals a new strong-field scenario where the resonant coupling of two-level bound-bound transitions prevails, contrasting with the dominance of bound-continuum transitions in the conventional strong-field infrared regimes. These findings set an interesting perspective for extreme attosecond nonlinear optics with intense short-wavelength fields.</description>
