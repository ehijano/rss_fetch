      <title>$\Lambda$(1405) in the flavor SU(3) limit using a separable potential in the HAL QCD method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the HAL QCD method, we investigate S-wave meson-baryon interactions in singlet and two octet channels in the flavor SU(3) limit, where the chiral unitary model predicts that a combination of bound-state poles in these channels corresponds to $\Lambda(1405)$. To avoid the singular behavior of the leading-order potentials of these channels in the derivative expansion, we instead employ a separable potential in the time-dependent HAL QCD method. To calculate all-to-all propagators in the three-point correlation functions including $\Lambda$-baryon source operators with zero momentum, we employ the conventional stochastic estimation combined with the covariant approximation averaging. Separable potentials both in the singlet and octet channels show attraction without singular behavior. Our results of the corresponding phase shifts indicate that the attractive interaction in the singlet channel is stronger than that in the octet. Binding energies are consistent with the estimates from the two-point correlation function within one (two) sigma for the singlet (octet) channel, and this ordering of binding energies is consistent with the mass hierarchy suggested by the chiral unitary model.</description>

      <title>Resolving the critical bubble in SU(8) deconfinement transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strongly coupled confining models with a first order phase transition present an interesting DM candidate. Near the critical temperature these models are strongly non-perturbative, and the critical bubble nucleation rate has so far only been estimated via approximative methods. As a model of a strong first order deconfinement transition, we simulate 4D SU(8) pure gauge model with multicanonical Monte Carlo. We demonstrate that resolving the critical bubble is possible in a strongly coupled model. We calculate the free energy of a critical bubble, which gives a rough upper limit for the nucleation rate. For the parameter points we investigated, the thin-wall approximation for the critial bubble free energy is off by a factor of 2, overestimating the rate at least by a factor of $e^{10}$.</description>

      <title>Hessian-free force-gradient integrators and their application to lattice QCD simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present initial results on Hessian-free force-gradient integrators for lattice field theories. Integrators of this framework promise to provide substantial performance enhancements, particularly for larger lattice volumes where higher-order integrators demonstrate greater efficiency. Numerical results demonstrate the superior efficiency of the proposed integrators compared to commonly employed non-gradient schemes, particularly due to enhanced stability properties. It is anticipated that the advantages of the Hessian-free framework will become even more pronounced in nested integration approaches and for smaller fermion masses, where the numerical stability properties of the integrators become increasingly important.</description>

      <title>The four-gluon vertex from lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The four-gluon one-particle irreducible Green function contributes to various quantities with phenomenological relevance. An example where the four-gluon plays a role is the determination of the gluon propagator, a basic building block for QCD, using continuum methods. This four leg Green function is poorly known and we are only starting to grasp its non-perturbative structure. Here, we report on the computation of the one-particle irreducible four-gluon Green function, in the Landau gauge, with lattice simulations. Besides stating the problems associated with the computation, several form factors that characterise this Green function are measured.</description>

      <title>Predicting the spectrum and decay constants of positive-parity heavy-strange mesons using domain-wall fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a lattice-QCD calculation of the masses and decay constants of the positive-parity heavy-strange mesons $D^*_{s0}$, $D_{s1}$, $B^*_{s0}$, and $B_{s1}$. The calculations are performed with domain-wall fermions for the light and strange quarks and an anisotropic clover action for the charm and bottom quarks. We use seven different RBC/UKQCD ensembles with pion masses ranging from a near-physical 139 MeV up to 431 MeV. We consider two different analysis types, with or without two-meson operators at the source. We observe the expected below-threshold ground states. The fits without the two-meson operators appear to be more stable, but may overestimate the ground-state energies, while preliminary fits with two-meson operators at the source only appear to underestimate the ground-state energies.</description>

      <title>Quantum Simulation of non-Abelian Lattice Gauge Theories: a variational approach to $\mathbb{D}_8$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we address the problem of a resource-efficient formulation of non-Abelian LGTs by focusing on the difficulty of simulating fermionic degrees of freedom and the Hilbert space redundancy. First, we show a procedure that removes the matter and improves the efficiency of the hardware resources. We demonstrate it for the simplest non-Abelian group addressable with this procedure, $\mathbb{D}_8$, both in the cases of one (1D) and two (2D) spatial dimensions. Then, with the objective of running a variational quantum simulation on real quantum hardware, we map the $\mathbb{D}_8$ lattice gauge theory onto qudit systems with local interactions. We propose a variational scheme for the qudit system with a local Hamiltonian, which can be implemented on a universal qudit quantum device as the one developed in $\href{https://doi.org/10.1038/s41567-022-01658-0}{[Nat. Phys. 18, 1053 (2022)]}$. Our results show the effectiveness of the matter-removing procedure, solving the redundancy problem and reducing the amount of quantum resources. This can serve as a way of simulating lattice gauge theories in high spatial dimensions, with non-Abelian gauge groups, and including dynamical fermions.</description>

      <title>Relativistic chiral nuclear forces: status and prospects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding nuclear structure, reactions, and the properties of neutron stars from \textit{ab initio} calculations from the nucleon degrees of freedom has always been a primary goal of nuclear physics, in which the microscopic nuclear force serves as the fundamental input. So far, the Weinberg chiral nuclear force, first proposed by the Nobel laureate Weinberg, has become the \textit{de facto} standard input for nuclear \textit{ab initio} studies. However, compared to their non-relativistic counterparts, relativistic \textit{ab initio} calculations, which describe better nuclear observables, have only begun. The lack of modern relativistic nucleon-nucleon interactions is an important issue restricting their development. In this work, we briefly review the development and status of the Weinberg chiral nuclear force, as well as its limitations. We further present a concise introduction to the relativistic chiral nuclear force, show its description of the scattering phase shifts and observables such as differential cross sections, and demonstrate its unique features. Additionally, we show that the relativistic framework could be naturally extended to the antinucleon-nucleon interaction.</description>

      <title>Machine-Learning-Enhanced Optimization of Noise-Resilient Variational Quantum Eigensolvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Variational Quantum Eigensolvers (VQEs) are a powerful class of hybrid quantum-classical algorithms designed to approximate the ground state of a quantum system described by its Hamiltonian. VQEs hold promise for various applications, including lattice field theory. However, the inherent noise of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices poses a significant challenge for running VQEs as these algorithms are particularly susceptible to noise, e.g., measurement shot noise and hardware noise.
  In a recent work, it was proposed to enhance the classical optimization of VQEs with Gaussian Processes (GPs) and Bayesian Optimization, as these machine-learning techniques are well-suited for handling noisy data. In these proceedings, we provide additional insights into this new algorithm and present further numerical experiments. In particular, we examine the impact of hardware noise and error mitigation on the algorithm's performance. We validate the algorithm using classical simulations of quantum hardware, including hardware noise benchmarks, which have not been considered in previous works. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that GP-enhanced algorithms can outperform state-of-the-art baselines, laying the foundation for future research on deploying these techniques to real quantum hardware and lattice field theory setups.</description>

      <title>Inequivalence between the Euclidean and Lorentzian versions of the type IIB matrix model from Lefschetz thimble calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The type IIB matrix model is conjectured to describe superstring theory nonperturbatively in terms of ten $N \times N$ bosonic traceless Hermitian matrices $A_\mu$ ($\mu=0, \ldots , 9$), whose eigenvalues correspond to $(9+1)$-dimensional space-time. Quite often, this model has been investigated in its Euclidean version, which is well defined although the ${\rm SO}(9,1)$ Lorentz symmetry of the original model is replaced by the ${\rm SO}(10)$ rotational symmetry. Recently, a well-defined model respecting the Lorentz symmetry has been proposed by gauge-fixing the Lorentz symmetry nonperturbatively using the Faddeev-Popov procedure. Here we investigate the two models by Monte Carlo simulations, overcoming the severe sign problem by the Lefschetz thimble method, in the case of matrix size $N=2$ omitting fermionic contributions. We add a quadratic term $\gamma \, \mathrm{tr} (A_\mu A^\mu)$ in the action and calculate the expectation values of rotationally symmetric (or Lorentz symmetric) observables as a function of the coefficient $\gamma$. Our results exhibit striking differences between the two models around $\gamma=0$ and in the $\gamma&gt;0$ region, associated with the appearance of different saddle points, clearly demonstrating their inequivalence against naive expectations from quantum field theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17349v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: $\mathbb{Z}_3$ lattice gauge theory is the simplest discrete gauge theory with three-quark bound states, i.e., baryons. Since it has a finite-dimensional Hilbert space, it can be used for testing quantum simulation of lattice gauge theory at nonzero baryon density. We discuss global and local gauge symmetries and their importance in quantum simulation. We perform quantum emulator calculation and demonstrate how to study the ground state property of baryonic matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02045v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We re-examine by numerical simulation the phase structure of the three-dimensional Abelian lattice gauge theory (LGT) with $Z(2)$ gauge fields coupled to $Z(2)$-valued Higgs fields. Concretely, we explore two different order parameters which are able to distinguish the three phases of the theory: (i) the Fredenhagen-Marcu operator used to discriminate between deconfinement and confinement/Higgs phases and (ii) the Greensite-Matsuyama overlap operator proposed recently to distinguish confinement and Higgs phases. The latter operator is an analog of the overlap Edwards-Anderson order parameter for spin-glasses. According to it, the Higgs phase is realized as a glassy phase of the gauge system. For this reason standard tricks for simulations of spin-glass phases are utilized in this work, namely tempered Monte Carlo and averaging over replicas. In addition, we also present results for a certain definition of distance between Higgs field configurations. Finally, we calculate various gauge-invariant correlation functions in order to extract the corresponding masses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13138v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We determine the nucleon-sigma terms from lattice QCD. We find that the dominant excited state contamination in the nucleon three-point function with a scalar current is due to the transition between the nucleon and a S-wave scattering state of a nucleon and a scalar (sigma) meson. In this proof-of-concept study, we analyse a single $N_f=3$ ensemble with the unphysically large pion mass $M_\pi=429$ MeV. Excited state contamination is substantially reduced compared to the standard method when employing nucleon-sigma type interpolating operators within a generalised eigenvector analysis.</description>

      <title>Improvement of Heatbath Algorithm in LFT using Generative models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.08615v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Heatbath Algorithm is commonly used for sampling in local lattice field theories, but performing exact updates or sampling from the local density is challenging when dealing with continuous variables. Heatbath methods rely on rejection-based sampling at each site, which can suffer from low acceptance rates if the proposal distribution is not optimally chosen a nontrivial task. In this work, we propose a novel, straightforward approach for generating proposals at each lattice site for the phi4 and XY models using generative AI models. This method learns a conditional local distribution, without requiring training samples from the target, conditioned on both neighboring sites and action parameter values.</description>

      <title>Noninvertible operators in one, two, and three dimensions via gauging spatially modulated symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16744v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spatially modulated symmetries have emerged since the discovery of fractons, which characterize unconventional topological phases with mobility-constrained quasiparticle excitations. On the other hand, non-invertible duality defects have attracted substantial attention in communities of high energy and condensed matter physics due to their deep insight into quantum anomalies and exotic phases of matter. However, the connection between these exotic symmetries and defects has not been fully explored. In this paper, we construct concrete lattice models with non-invertible duality defects via gauging spatially modulated symmetries and investigate their exotic fusion rules. Specifically, we construct spin models with subsystem symmetries or dipole symmetries on one, two, and three-dimensional lattices. Gauging subsystem symmetries leads to non-invertible duality defects whose fusion rules involve $0$-form subsystem charges in two dimensions and higher-form operators that correspond to ``lineon'' excitations (excitations which are mobile along one-dimensional line) in three dimensions. Gauging dipole symmetries leads to non-invertible duality defects with dipole algebras that describe a hierarchical structure between global and dipole charges. Notably, the hierarchical structure of the dual dipole charges is inverted compared with the original ones. Our work provides a unified and systematic analytical framework for constructing exotic duality defects by gauging relevant symmetries.</description>
