      <title>Automatic driving lane change safety prediction model based on LSTM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous driving technology can improve traffic safety and reduce traffic accidents. In addition, it improves traffic flow, reduces congestion, saves energy and increases travel efficiency. In the relatively mature automatic driving technology, the automatic driving function is divided into several modules: perception, decision-making, planning and control, and a reasonable division of labor can improve the stability of the system. Therefore, autonomous vehicles need to have the ability to predict the trajectory of surrounding vehicles in order to make reasonable decision planning and safety measures to improve driving safety. By using deep learning method, a safety-sensitive deep learning model based on short term memory (LSTM) network is proposed. This model can alleviate the shortcomings of current automatic driving trajectory planning, and the output trajectory not only ensures high accuracy but also improves safety. The cell state simulation algorithm simulates the trackability of the trajectory generated by this model. The research results show that compared with the traditional model-based method, the trajectory prediction method based on LSTM network has obvious advantages in predicting the trajectory in the long time domain. The intention recognition module considering interactive information has higher prediction and accuracy, and the algorithm results show that the trajectory is very smooth based on the premise of safe prediction and efficient lane change. And autonomous vehicles can efficiently and safely complete lane changes.</description>

      <title>A Collision Cone Approach for Control Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a unified approach for collision avoidance using Collision-Cone Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) in both ground (UGV) and aerial (UAV) unmanned vehicles. We propose a novel CBF formulation inspired by collision cones, to ensure safety by constraining the relative velocity between the vehicle and the obstacle to always point away from each other. The efficacy of this approach is demonstrated through simulations and hardware implementations on the TurtleBot, Stoch-Jeep, and Crazyflie 2.1 quadrotor robot, showcasing its effectiveness in avoiding collisions with dynamic obstacles in both ground and aerial settings. The real-time controller is developed using CBF Quadratic Programs (CBF-QPs). Comparative analysis with the state-of-the-art CBFs highlights the less conservative nature of the proposed approach. Overall, this research contributes to a novel control formation that can give a guarantee for collision avoidance in unmanned vehicles by modifying the control inputs from existing path-planning controllers.</description>

      <title>Mapping High-level Semantic Regions in Indoor Environments without Object Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robots require a semantic understanding of their surroundings to operate in an efficient and explainable way in human environments. In the literature, there has been an extensive focus on object labeling and exhaustive scene graph generation; less effort has been focused on the task of purely identifying and mapping large semantic regions. The present work proposes a method for semantic region mapping via embodied navigation in indoor environments, generating a high-level representation of the knowledge of the agent. To enable region identification, the method uses a vision-to-language model to provide scene information for mapping. By projecting egocentric scene understanding into the global frame, the proposed method generates a semantic map as a distribution over possible region labels at each location. This mapping procedure is paired with a trained navigation policy to enable autonomous map generation. The proposed method significantly outperforms a variety of baselines, including an object-based system and a pretrained scene classifier, in experiments in a photorealistic simulator.</description>

      <title>RaceMOP: Mapless Online Path Planning for Multi-Agent Autonomous Racing using Residual Policy Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interactive decision-making in multi-agent autonomous racing offers insights valuable beyond the domain of self-driving cars. Mapless online path planning is particularly of practical appeal but poses a challenge for safely overtaking opponents due to the limited planning horizon. Accordingly, this paper introduces RaceMOP, a novel method for mapless online path planning designed for multi-agent racing of F1TENTH cars. Unlike classical planners that depend on predefined racing lines, RaceMOP operates without a map, relying solely on local observations to overtake other race cars at high speed. Our approach combines an artificial potential field method as a base policy with residual policy learning to introduce long-horizon planning capabilities. We advance the field by introducing a novel approach for policy fusion with the residual policy directly in probability space. Our experiments for twelve simulated racetracks validate that RaceMOP is capable of long-horizon decision-making with robust collision avoidance during overtaking maneuvers. RaceMOP demonstrates superior handling over existing mapless planners while generalizing to unknown racetracks, paving the way for further use of our method in robotics. We make the open-source code for RaceMOP available at http://github.com/raphajaner/racemop.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Interface Adaptation with User-Friendly Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robots often need to convey information to human users. For example, robots can leverage visual, auditory, and haptic interfaces to display their intent or express their internal state. In some scenarios there are socially agreed upon conventions for what these signals mean: e.g., a red light indicates an autonomous car is slowing down. But as robots develop new capabilities and seek to convey more complex data, the meaning behind their signals is not always mutually understood: one user might think a flashing light indicates the autonomous car is an aggressive driver, while another user might think the same signal means the autonomous car is defensive. In this paper we enable robots to adapt their interfaces to the current user so that the human's personalized interpretation is aligned with the robot's meaning. We start with an information theoretic end-to-end approach, which automatically tunes the interface policy to optimize the correlation between human and robot. But to ensure that this learning policy is intuitive -- and to accelerate how quickly the interface adapts to the human -- we recognize that humans have priors over how interfaces should function. For instance, humans expect interface signals to be proportional and convex. Our approach biases the robot's interface towards these priors, resulting in signals that are adapted to the current user while still following social expectations. Our simulations and user study results across $15$ participants suggest that these priors improve robot-to-human communication. See videos here: https://youtu.be/Re3OLg57hp8</description>

      <title>iRoCo: Intuitive Robot Control From Anywhere Using a Smartwatch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces iRoCo (intuitive Robot Control) - a framework for ubiquitous human-robot collaboration using a single smartwatch and smartphone. By integrating probabilistic differentiable filters, iRoCo optimizes a combination of precise robot control and unrestricted user movement from ubiquitous devices. We demonstrate and evaluate the effectiveness of iRoCo in practical teleoperation and drone piloting applications. Comparative analysis shows no significant difference between task performance with iRoCo and gold-standard control systems in teleoperation tasks. Additionally, iRoCo users complete drone piloting tasks 32\% faster than with a traditional remote control and report less frustration in a subjective load index questionnaire. Our findings strongly suggest that iRoCo is a promising new approach for intuitive robot control through smartwatches and smartphones from anywhere, at any time.

      <title>3D Uncertain Distance Field Mapping using GMM and GP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we address the challenge of constructing continuous three-dimensional (3D) models that accurately represent uncertain surfaces, derived from noisy and incomplete LiDAR scanning data. Building upon our prior work, which utilized the Gaussian Process (GP) and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) for structured building models, we introduce a more generalized approach tailored for complex surfaces in urban scenes, where four-dimensional (4D) GMM Regression and GP with derivative observations are applied. A Hierarchical GMM (HGMM) is employed to optimize the number of GMM components and speed up the GMM training. With the prior map obtained from HGMM, GP inference is followed for the refinement of the final map. Our approach models the implicit surface of the geo-object and enables the inference of the regions that are not completely covered by measurements. The integration of GMM and GP yields well-calibrated uncertainty estimates alongside the surface model, enhancing both accuracy and reliability. The proposed method is evaluated on the real data collected by a mobile mapping system. Compared to the performance in mapping accuracy and uncertainty quantification of other methods such as Gaussian Process Implicit Surface map (GPIS) and log-Gaussian Process Implicit Surface map (Log-GPIS), the proposed method achieves lower RMSEs, higher log-likelihood values and fewer computational costs for the evaluated datasets.</description>

      <title>Stereo-NEC: Enhancing Stereo Visual-Inertial SLAM Initialization with Normal Epipolar Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an accurate and robust initialization approach for stereo visual-inertial SLAM systems. Unlike the current state-of-the-art method, which heavily relies on the accuracy of a pure visual SLAM system to estimate inertial variables without updating camera poses, potentially compromising accuracy and robustness, our approach offers a different solution. We realize the crucial impact of precise gyroscope bias estimation on rotation accuracy. This, in turn, affects trajectory accuracy due to the accumulation of translation errors. To address this, we first independently estimate the gyroscope bias and use it to formulate a maximum a posteriori problem for further refinement. After this refinement, we proceed to update the rotation estimation by performing IMU integration with gyroscope bias removed from gyroscope measurements. We then leverage robust and accurate rotation estimates to enhance translation estimation via 3-DoF bundle adjustment. Moreover, we introduce a novel approach for determining the success of the initialization by evaluating the residual of the normal epipolar constraint. Extensive evaluations on the EuRoC dataset illustrate that our method excels in accuracy and robustness. It outperforms ORB-SLAM3, the current leading stereo visual-inertial initialization method, in terms of absolute trajectory error and relative rotation error, while maintaining competitive computational speed. Notably, even with 5 keyframes for initialization, our method consistently surpasses the state-of-the-art approach using 10 keyframes in rotation accuracy.</description>

      <title>Tractable Joint Prediction and Planning over Discrete Behavior Modes for Urban Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Significant progress has been made in training multimodal trajectory forecasting models for autonomous driving. However, effectively integrating these models with downstream planners and model-based control approaches is still an open problem. Although these models have conventionally been evaluated for open-loop prediction, we show that they can be used to parameterize autoregressive closed-loop models without retraining. We consider recent trajectory prediction approaches which leverage learned anchor embeddings to predict multiple trajectories, finding that these anchor embeddings can parameterize discrete and distinct modes representing high-level driving behaviors. We propose to perform fully reactive closed-loop planning over these discrete latent modes, allowing us to tractably model the causal interactions between agents at each step. We validate our approach on a suite of more dynamic merging scenarios, finding that our approach avoids the $\textit{frozen robot problem}$ which is pervasive in conventional planners. Our approach also outperforms the previous state-of-the-art in CARLA on challenging dense traffic scenarios when evaluated at realistic speeds.</description>

      <title>Toward An Analytic Theory of Intrinsic Robustness for Dexterous Grasping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional approaches to grasp planning require perfect knowledge of an object's pose and geometry. Uncertainties in these quantities induce uncertainties in the quality of planned grasps, which can lead to failure. Classically, grasp robustness refers to the ability to resist external disturbances after grasping an object. In contrast, this work studies robustness to intrinsic sources of uncertainty like object pose or geometry affecting grasp planning before execution. To do so, we develop a novel analytic theory of grasping that reasons about this intrinsic robustness by characterizing the effect of friction cone uncertainty on a grasp's force closure status. As a result, we show the Ferrari-Canny metric -- which measures the size of external disturbances a grasp can reject -- bounds the friction cone uncertainty a grasp can tolerate, and thus also measures intrinsic robustness. In tandem, we show that the recently proposed min-weight metric lower bounds the Ferrari-Canny metric, justifying it as a computationally-efficient, uncertainty-aware alternative. We validate this theory on hardware experiments versus a competitive baseline and demonstrate superior performance. Finally, we use our theory to develop an analytic notion of probabilistic force closure, which we show in simulation generates grasps that can incorporate uncertainty distributions over an object's geometry.</description>

      <title>MPS: A New Method for Selecting the Stable Closed-Loop Equilibrium Attitude-Error Quaternion of a UAV During Flight</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present model predictive selection (MPS), a new method for selecting the stable closed-loop (CL) equilibrium attitude-error quaternion (AEQ) of an uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) during the execution of high-speed yaw maneuvers. In this approach, we minimize the cost of yawing measured with a performance figure of merit (PFM) that takes into account both the aerodynamic-torque control input and attitude-error state of the UAV. Specifically, this method uses a control law with a term whose sign is dynamically switched in real time to select, between two options, the torque associated with the lesser cost of rotation as predicted by a dynamical model of the UAV derived from first principles. This problem is relevant because the selection of the stable CL equilibrium AEQ significantly impacts the performance of a UAV during high-speed rotational flight, from both the power and control-error perspectives. To test and demonstrate the functionality and performance of the proposed method, we present data collected during one hundred real-time high-speed yaw-tracking flight experiments. These results highlight the superior capabilities of the proposed MPS-based scheme when compared to a benchmark controller commonly used in aerial robotics, as the PFM used to quantify the cost of flight is reduced by 60.30 %, on average. To our best knowledge, these are the first flight-test results that thoroughly demonstrate, evaluate, and compare the performance of a real-time controller capable of selecting the stable CL equilibrium AEQ during operation.</description>

      <title>Multi-task Manipulation Policy Modeling with Visuomotor Latent Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling a generalized visuomotor policy has been a longstanding challenge for both computer vision and robotics communities. Existing approaches often fail to efficiently leverage cross-dataset resources or rely on heavy Vision-Language models, which require substantial computational resources, thereby limiting their multi-task performance and application potential. In this paper, we introduce a novel paradigm that effectively utilizes latent modeling of manipulation skills and an efficient visuomotor latent diffusion policy, which enhances the utilizing of existing cross-embodiment and cross-environment datasets, thereby improving multi-task capabilities. Our methodology consists of two decoupled phases: action modeling and policy modeling. Firstly, we introduce a task-agnostic, embodiment-aware trajectory latent autoencoder for unified action skills modeling. This step condenses action data and observation into a condensed latent space, effectively benefiting from large-scale cross-datasets. Secondly, we propose to use a visuomotor latent diffusion policy that recovers target skill latent from noises for effective task execution. We conducted extensive experiments on two widely used benchmarks, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed paradigms on multi-tasking and pre-training.

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motion planners are essential for the safe operation of automated vehicles across various scenarios. However, no motion planning algorithm has achieved perfection in the literature, and improving its performance is often time-consuming and labor-intensive. To tackle the aforementioned issues, we present DrPlanner, the first framework designed to automatically diagnose and repair motion planners using large language models. Initially, we generate a structured description of the planner and its planned trajectories from both natural and programming languages. Leveraging the profound capabilities of large language models in addressing reasoning challenges, our framework returns repaired planners with detailed diagnostic descriptions. Furthermore, the framework advances iteratively with continuous feedback from the evaluation of the repaired outcomes. Our approach is validated using search-based motion planners; experimental results highlight the need of demonstrations in the prompt and the ability of our framework in identifying and rectifying elusive issues effectively.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose SemGauss-SLAM, the first semantic SLAM system utilizing 3D Gaussian representation, that enables accurate 3D semantic mapping, robust camera tracking, and high-quality rendering in real-time. In this system, we incorporate semantic feature embedding into 3D Gaussian representation, which effectively encodes semantic information within the spatial layout of the environment for precise semantic scene representation. Furthermore, we propose feature-level loss for updating 3D Gaussian representation, enabling higher-level guidance for 3D Gaussian optimization. In addition, to reduce cumulative drift and improve reconstruction accuracy, we introduce semantic-informed bundle adjustment leveraging semantic associations for joint optimization of 3D Gaussian representation and camera poses, leading to more robust tracking and consistent mapping. Our SemGauss-SLAM method demonstrates superior performance over existing dense semantic SLAM methods in terms of mapping and tracking accuracy on Replica and ScanNet datasets, while also showing excellent capabilities in novel-view semantic synthesis and 3D semantic mapping.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An open problem in mobile manipulation is how to represent objects and scenes in a unified manner, so that robots can use it both for navigating in the environment and manipulating objects. The latter requires capturing intricate geometry while understanding fine-grained semantics, whereas the former involves capturing the complexity inherit to an expansive physical scale. In this work, we present GeFF (Generalizable Feature Fields), a scene-level generalizable neural feature field that acts as a unified representation for both navigation and manipulation that performs in real-time. To do so, we treat generative novel view synthesis as a pre-training task, and then align the resulting rich scene priors with natural language via CLIP feature distillation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach by deploying GeFF on a quadrupedal robot equipped with a manipulator. We evaluate GeFF's ability to generalize to open-set objects as well as running time, when performing open-vocabulary mobile manipulation in dynamic scenes.</description>

      <title>Efficient Global Navigational Planning in 3D Structures based on Point Cloud Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Navigation in complex 3D scenarios requires appropriate environment representation for efficient scene understanding and trajectory generation. We propose a highly efficient and extensible global navigation framework based on a tomographic understanding of the environment to navigate ground robots in multi-layer structures. Our approach generates tomogram slices using the point cloud map to encode the geometric structure as ground and ceiling elevations. Then it evaluates the scene traversability considering the robot's motion capabilities. Both the tomogram construction and the scene evaluation are accelerated through parallel computation. Our approach further alleviates the trajectory generation complexity compared with planning in 3D spaces directly. It generates 3D trajectories by searching through multiple tomogram slices and separately adjusts the robot height to avoid overhangs. We evaluate our framework in various simulation scenarios and further test it in the real world on a quadrupedal robot. Our approach reduces the scene evaluation time by 3 orders of magnitude and improves the path planning speed by 3 times compared with existing approaches, demonstrating highly efficient global navigation in various complex 3D environments.

      <title>A Study on Centralised and Decentralised Swarm Robotics Architecture for Part Delivery System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Drones are also known as UAVs are originally designed for military purposes. With the technological advances, they can be seen in most of the aspects of life from filming to logistics. The increased use of drones made it sometimes essential to form a collaboration between them to perform the task efficiently in a defined process. This paper investigates the use of a combined centralised and decentralised architecture for the collaborative operation of drones in a parts delivery scenario to enable and expedite the operation of the factories of the future. The centralised and decentralised approaches were extensively researched, with experimentation being undertaken to determine the appropriateness of each approach for this use-case. Decentralised control was utilised to remove the need for excessive communication during the operation of the drones, resulting in smoother operations. Initial results suggested that the decentralised approach is more appropriate for this use-case. The individual functionalities necessary for the implementation of a decentralised architecture were proven and assessed, determining that a combination of multiple individual functionalities, namely VSLAM, dynamic collision avoidance and object tracking, would give an appropriate solution for use in an industrial setting. A final architecture for the parts delivery system was proposed for future work, using a combined centralised and decentralised approach to combat the limitations inherent in each architecture.</description>

      <title>Online Adaptation of Sampling-Based Motion Planning with Inaccurate Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robotic manipulation relies on analytical or learned models to simulate the system dynamics. These models are often inaccurate and based on offline information, so that the robot planner is unable to cope with mismatches between the expected and the actual behavior of the system (e.g., the presence of an unexpected obstacle). In these situations, the robot should use information gathered online to correct its planning strategy and adapt to the actual system response. We propose a sampling-based motion planning approach that uses an estimate of the model error and online observations to correct the planning strategy at each new replanning. Our approach adapts the cost function and the sampling bias of a kinodynamic motion planner when the outcome of the executed transitions is different from the expected one (e.g., when the robot unexpectedly collides with an obstacle) so that future trajectories will avoid unreliable motions. To infer the properties of a new transition, we introduce the notion of context-awareness, i.e., we store local environment information for each executed transition and avoid new transitions with context similar to previous unreliable ones. This is helpful for leveraging online information even if the simulated transitions are far (in the state-and-action space) from the executed ones. Simulation and experimental results show that the proposed approach increases the success rate in execution and reduces the number of replannings needed to reach the goal.</description>

      <title>A Framework for Controlling Multiple Industrial Robots using Mobile Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: Over the last few decades, the development of the hardware and software has enabled the application of advanced systems. In the robotics field, the UI design is an intriguing area to be explored due to the creation of devices with a wide range of functionalities in a reduced size. Moreover, the idea of using the same UI to control several systems arouses a great interest considering that this involves less learning effort and time for the users. Therefore, this paper will present a mobile application to control two industrial robots with four modes of operation. Design/methodology/approach: The smartphone was selected to be the interface due to its wide range of capabilities and the MIT Inventor App was used to create the application, whose environment is supported by Android smartphones. For the validation, ROS was used since it is a fundamental framework utilised in industrial robotics and the Arduino Uno was used to establish the data transmission between the smartphone and the board NVIDIA Jetson TX2. In MIT Inventor App, the graphical interface was created to visualize the options available in the app whereas two scripts in python were programmed to perform the simulations in ROS and carry out the tests. Findings: The results indicated that the use of the sliders to control the robots is more favourable than the Orientation Sensor due to the sensibility of the sensor and human limitations to hold the smartphone perfectly still. Another important finding was the limitations of the autonomous mode, in which the robot grabs an object. In this case, the configuration of the Kinect camera and the controllers has a significant impact on the success of the simulation. Finally, it was observed that the delay was appropriate despite the use of the Arduino UNO to transfer the data between the Smartphone and the Nvidia Jetson TX2.</description>

      <title>PROSKILL: A formal skill language for acting in robotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Acting is an important decisional function for autonomous robots. Acting relies on skills to implement and to model the activities it oversees: refinement, local recovery, temporal dispatching, external asynchronous events, and commands execution, all done online. While sitting between planning and the robotic platform, acting often relies on programming primitives and an interpreter which executes these skills. Following our experience in providing a formal framework to program the functional components of our robots, we propose a new language, to program the acting skills. This language maps unequivocally into a formal model which can then be used to check properties offline or execute the skills, or more precisely their formal equivalent, and perform runtime verification. We illustrate with a real example how we can program a survey mission for a drone in this new language, prove some formal properties on the program and directly execute the formal model on the drone to perform the mission.</description>

      <title>DexCap: Scalable and Portable Mocap Data Collection System for Dexterous Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Imitation learning from human hand motion data presents a promising avenue for imbuing robots with human-like dexterity in real-world manipulation tasks. Despite this potential, substantial challenges persist, particularly with the portability of existing hand motion capture (mocap) systems and the difficulty of translating mocap data into effective control policies. To tackle these issues, we introduce DexCap, a portable hand motion capture system, alongside DexIL, a novel imitation algorithm for training dexterous robot skills directly from human hand mocap data. DexCap offers precise, occlusion-resistant tracking of wrist and finger motions based on SLAM and electromagnetic field together with 3D observations of the environment. Utilizing this rich dataset, DexIL employs inverse kinematics and point cloud-based imitation learning to replicate human actions with robot hands. Beyond learning from human motion, DexCap also offers an optional human-in-the-loop correction mechanism to refine and further improve robot performance. Through extensive evaluation across six dexterous manipulation tasks, our approach not only demonstrates superior performance but also showcases the system's capability to effectively learn from in-the-wild mocap data, paving the way for future data collection methods for dexterous manipulation.

      <title>RobotCycle: Assessing Cycling Safety in Urban Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces RobotCycle, a novel ongoing project that leverages Autonomous Vehicle (AV) research to investigate how cycling infrastructure influences cyclist behaviour and safety during real-world journeys. The project's requirements were defined in collaboration with key stakeholders (i.e. city planners, cyclists, and policymakers), informing the design of risk and safety metrics and the data collection criteria. We propose a data-driven approach relying on a novel, rich dataset of diverse traffic scenes captured through a custom-designed wearable sensing unit. We extract road-user trajectories and analyse deviations suggesting risk or potentially hazardous interactions in correlation with infrastructural elements in the environment. Driving profiles and trajectory patterns are associated with local road segments, driving conditions, and road-user interactions to predict traffic behaviour and identify critical scenarios. Moreover, leveraging advancements in AV research, the project extracts detailed 3D maps, traffic flow patterns, and trajectory models to provide an in-depth assessment and analysis of the behaviour of all traffic agents. This data can then inform the design of cyclist-friendly road infrastructure, improving road safety and cyclability, as it provides valuable insights for enhancing cyclist protection and promoting sustainable urban mobility.</description>

      <title>DeliGrasp: Inferring Object Mass, Friction, and Compliance with LLMs for Adaptive and Minimally Deforming Grasp Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can provide rich physical descriptions of most worldly objects, allowing robots to achieve more informed and capable grasping. We leverage LLMs' common sense physical reasoning and code-writing abilities to infer an object's physical characteristics--mass $m$, friction coefficient $\mu$, and spring constant $k$--from a semantic description, and then translate those characteristics into an executable adaptive grasp policy. Using a current-controllable, two-finger gripper with a built-in depth camera, we demonstrate that LLM-generated, physically-grounded grasp policies outperform traditional grasp policies on a custom benchmark of 12 delicate and deformable items including food, produce, toys, and other everyday items, spanning two orders of magnitude in mass and required pick-up force. We also demonstrate how compliance feedback from DeliGrasp policies can aid in downstream tasks such as measuring produce ripeness.

      <description>arXiv:2403.07867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce LazyBoE, a multi-query method for kinodynamic motion planning with forward propagation. This algorithm allows for the simultaneous exploration of a robot's state and control spaces, thereby enabling a wider suite of dynamic tasks in real-world applications. Our contributions are three-fold: i) a method for discretizing the state and control spaces to amortize planning times across multiple queries; ii) lazy approaches to collision checking and propagation of control sequences that decrease the cost of physics-based simulation; and iii) LazyBoE, a robust kinodynamic planner that leverages these two contributions to produce dynamically-feasible trajectories. The proposed framework not only reduces planning time but also increases success rate in comparison to previous approaches.</description>

      <title>TeleMoMa: A Modular and Versatile Teleoperation System for Mobile Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A critical bottleneck limiting imitation learning in robotics is the lack of data. This problem is more severe in mobile manipulation, where collecting demonstrations is harder than in stationary manipulation due to the lack of available and easy-to-use teleoperation interfaces. In this work, we demonstrate TeleMoMa, a general and modular interface for whole-body teleoperation of mobile manipulators. TeleMoMa unifies multiple human interfaces including RGB and depth cameras, virtual reality controllers, keyboard, joysticks, etc., and any combination thereof. In its more accessible version, TeleMoMa works using simply vision (e.g., an RGB-D camera), lowering the entry bar for humans to provide mobile manipulation demonstrations. We demonstrate the versatility of TeleMoMa by teleoperating several existing mobile manipulators - PAL Tiago++, Toyota HSR, and Fetch - in simulation and the real world. We demonstrate the quality of the demonstrations collected with TeleMoMa by training imitation learning policies for mobile manipulation tasks involving synchronized whole-body motion. Finally, we also show that TeleMoMa's teleoperation channel enables teleoperation on site, looking at the robot, or remote, sending commands and observations through a computer network, and perform user studies to evaluate how easy it is for novice users to learn to collect demonstrations with different combinations of human interfaces enabled by our system. We hope TeleMoMa becomes a helpful tool for the community enabling researchers to collect whole-body mobile manipulation demonstrations.

      <description>arXiv:2403.07870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open-sourced, user-friendly tools form the bedrock of scientific advancement across disciplines. The widespread adoption of data-driven learning has led to remarkable progress in multi-fingered dexterity, bimanual manipulation, and applications ranging from logistics to home robotics. However, existing data collection platforms are often proprietary, costly, or tailored to specific robotic morphologies. We present OPEN TEACH, a new teleoperation system leveraging VR headsets to immerse users in mixed reality for intuitive robot control. Built on the affordable Meta Quest 3, which costs $500, OPEN TEACH enables real-time control of various robots, including multi-fingered hands and bimanual arms, through an easy-to-use app. Using natural hand gestures and movements, users can manipulate robots at up to 90Hz with smooth visual feedback and interface widgets offering closeup environment views. We demonstrate the versatility of OPEN TEACH across 38 tasks on different robots. A comprehensive user study indicates significant improvement in teleoperation capability over the AnyTeleop framework. Further experiments exhibit that the collected data is compatible with policy learning on 10 dexterous and contact-rich manipulation tasks. Currently supporting Franka, xArm, Jaco, and Allegro platforms, OPEN TEACH is fully open-sourced to promote broader adoption. Videos are available at https://open-teach.github.io/.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper presents a technique using reinforcement learning (RL) to adapt the control gains of a quadcopter controller. Specifically, we employed Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to train a policy which adapts the gains of a cascaded feedback controller in-flight. The primary goal of this controller is to minimize tracking error while following a specified trajectory. The paper's key objective is to analyze the effectiveness of the adaptive gain policy and compare it to the performance of a static gain control algorithm, where the Integral Squared Error and Integral Time Squared Error are used as metrics. The results show that the adaptive gain scheme achieves over 40$\%$ decrease in tracking error as compared to the static gain controller.</description>

      <title>NavCoT: Boosting LLM-Based Vision-and-Language Navigation via Learning Disentangled Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN), as a crucial research problem of Embodied AI, requires an embodied agent to navigate through complex 3D environments following natural language instructions. Recent research has highlighted the promising capacity of large language models (LLMs) in VLN by improving navigational reasoning accuracy and interpretability. However, their predominant use in an offline manner usually suffers from substantial domain gap between the VLN task and the LLM training corpus. This paper introduces a novel strategy called Navigational Chain-of-Thought (NavCoT), where we fulfill parameter-efficient in-domain training to enable self-guided navigational decision, leading to a significant mitigation of the domain gap in a cost-effective manner. Specifically, at each timestep, the LLM is prompted to forecast the navigational chain-of-thought by: 1) acting as a world model to imagine the next observation according to the instruction, 2) selecting the candidate observation that best aligns with the imagination, and 3) determining the action based on the reasoning from the prior steps. Through constructing formalized labels for training, the LLM can learn to generate desired and reasonable chain-of-thought outputs for improving the action decision. Experimental results across various training settings and popular VLN benchmarks (e.g., Room-to-Room (R2R), Room-across-Room (RxR), Room-for-Room (R4R)) show the significant superiority of NavCoT over the direct action prediction variants. Through simple parameter-efficient finetuning, our NavCoT outperforms a recent GPT4-based approach with ~7% relative improvement on the R2R dataset. We believe that NavCoT will help unlock more task-adaptive and scalable LLM-based embodied agents, which are helpful for developing real-world robotics applications.

      <description>arXiv:2403.07548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In learning an embodied agent executing daily tasks via language directives, the literature largely assumes that the agent learns all training data at the beginning. We argue that such a learning scenario is less realistic since a robotic agent is supposed to learn the world continuously as it explores and perceives it. To take a step towards a more realistic embodied agent learning scenario, we propose two continual learning setups for embodied agents; learning new behaviors (Behavior Incremental Learning, Behavior-IL) and new environments (Environment Incremental Learning, Environment-IL) For the tasks, previous 'data prior' based continual learning methods maintain logits for the past tasks. However, the stored information is often insufficiently learned information and requires task boundary information, which might not always be available. Here, we propose to update them based on confidence scores without task boundary information during training (i.e., task-free) in a moving average fashion, named Confidence-Aware Moving Average (CAMA). In the proposed Behavior-IL and Environment-IL setups, our simple CAMA outperforms prior state of the art in our empirical validations by noticeable margins.

      <title>Ensembling Prioritized Hybrid Policies for Multi-agent Pathfinding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) based Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) has recently gained attention due to its efficiency and scalability. Several MARL-MAPF methods choose to use communication to enrich the information one agent can perceive. However, existing works still struggle in structured environments with high obstacle density and a high number of agents. To further improve the performance of the communication-based MARL-MAPF solvers, we propose a new method, Ensembling Prioritized Hybrid Policies (EPH). We first propose a selective communication block to gather richer information for better agent coordination within multi-agent environments and train the model with a Q-learning-based algorithm. We further introduce three advanced inference strategies aimed at bolstering performance during the execution phase. First, we hybridize the neural policy with single-agent expert guidance for navigating conflict-free zones. Secondly, we propose Q value-based methods for prioritized resolution of conflicts as well as deadlock situations. Finally, we introduce a robust ensemble method that can efficiently collect the best out of multiple possible solutions. We empirically evaluate EPH in complex multi-agent environments and demonstrate competitive performance against state-of-the-art neural methods for MAPF.</description>

      <title>Federated Learning of Socially Appropriate Agent Behaviours in Simulated Home Environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As social robots become increasingly integrated into daily life, ensuring their behaviours align with social norms is crucial. For their widespread open-world application, it is important to explore Federated Learning (FL) settings where individual robots can learn about their unique environments while also learning from each others' experiences. In this paper, we present a novel FL benchmark that evaluates different strategies, using multi-label regression objectives, where each client individually learns to predict the social appropriateness of different robot actions while also sharing their learning with others. Furthermore, splitting the training data by different contexts such that each client incrementally learns across contexts, we present a novel Federated Continual Learning (FCL) benchmark that adapts FL-based methods to use state-of-the-art Continual Learning (CL) methods to continually learn socially appropriate agent behaviours under different contextual settings. Federated Averaging (FedAvg) of weights emerges as a robust FL strategy while rehearsal-based FCL enables incrementally learning the social appropriateness of robot actions, across contextual splits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.03467v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Having good knowledge of terrain information is essential for improving the performance of various downstream tasks on complex terrains, especially for the locomotion and navigation of legged robots. We present a novel framework for neural urban terrain reconstruction with uncertainty estimations. It generates dense robot-centric elevation maps online from sparse LiDAR observations. We design a novel pre-processing and point features representation approach that ensures high robustness and computational efficiency when integrating multiple point cloud frames. A Bayesian-GAN model then recovers the detailed terrain structures while simultaneously providing the pixel-wise reconstruction uncertainty. We evaluate the proposed pipeline through extensive simulation and real-world experiments. It demonstrates efficient terrain reconstruction with high quality and real-time performance on a mobile platform, which further benefits the downstream tasks of legged robots.

      <title>Prompter: Utilizing Large Language Model Prompting for a Data Efficient Embodied Instruction Following</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.03267v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Embodied Instruction Following (EIF) studies how autonomous mobile manipulation robots should be controlled to accomplish long-horizon tasks described by natural language instructions. While much research on EIF is conducted in simulators, the ultimate goal of the field is to deploy the agents in real life. This is one of the reasons why recent methods have moved away from training models end-to-end and take modular approaches, which do not need the costly expert operation data. However, as it is still in the early days of importing modular ideas to EIF, a search for modules effective in the EIF task is still far from a conclusion. In this paper, we propose to extend the modular design using knowledge obtained from two external sources. First, we show that embedding the physical constraints of the deployed robots into the module design is highly effective. Our design also allows the same modular system to work across robots of different configurations with minimal modifications. Second, we show that the landmark-based object search, previously implemented by a trained model requiring a dedicated set of data, can be replaced by an implementation that prompts pretrained large language models for landmark-object relationships, eliminating the need for collecting dedicated training data. Our proposed Prompter achieves 41.53\% and 45.32\% on the ALFRED benchmark with high-level instructions only and step-by-step instructions, respectively, significantly outperforming the previous state of the art by 5.46\% and 9.91\%.</description>

      <title>Improved Exploration for Safety-Embedded Differential Dynamic Programming Using Tolerant Barrier States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.03360v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Tolerant Discrete Barrier States (T-DBaS), a novel safety-embedding technique for trajectory optimization with enhanced exploratory capabilities. The proposed approach generalizes the standard discrete barrier state (DBaS) method by accommodating temporary constraint violation during the optimization process while still approximating its safety guarantees. Consequently, the proposed approach eliminates the DBaS's safe nominal trajectories assumption, while enhancing its exploration effectiveness for escaping local minima. Towards applying T-DBaS to safety-critical autonomous robotics, we combine it with Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP), leading to the proposed safe trajectory optimization method T-DBaS-DDP, which inherits the convergence and scalability properties of the solver. The effectiveness of the T-DBaS algorithm is verified on differential drive robot and quadrotor simulations. In addition, we compare against the classical DBaS-DDP as well as Augmented-Lagrangian DDP (AL-DDP) in extensive numerical comparisons that demonstrate the proposed method's competitive advantages. Finally, the applicability of the proposed approach is verified through hardware experiments on the Georgia Tech Robotarium platform.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Methods Applied to Soft Robot Modeling and Control: A Review</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.12137v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Soft robots show compliance and have infinite degrees of freedom. Thanks to these properties, such robots can be leveraged for surgery, rehabilitation, biomimetics, unstructured environment exploring, and industrial grippers. In this case, they attract scholars from a variety of areas. However, nonlinearity and hysteresis effects also bring a burden to robot modeling. Moreover, following their flexibility and adaptation, soft robot control is more challenging than rigid robot control. In order to model and control soft robots, a large number of data-driven methods are utilized in pairs or separately. This review first briefly introduces two foundations for data-driven approaches, which are physical models and the Jacobian matrix, then summarizes three kinds of data-driven approaches, which are statistical method, neural network, and reinforcement learning. This review compares the modeling and controller features, e.g., model dynamics, data requirement, and target task, within and among these categories. Finally, we summarize the features of each method. A discussion about the advantages and limitations of the existing modeling and control approaches is presented, and we forecast the future of data-driven approaches in soft robots. A website (https://sites.google.com/view/23zcb) is built for this review and will be updated frequently.</description>

      <title>Fast Safe Rectangular Corridor-based Online AGV Trajectory Optimization with Obstacle Avoidance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.07979v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) are essential in various industries for their efficiency and adaptability. However, planning trajectories for AGVs in obstacle-dense, unstructured environments presents significant challenges due to the nonholonomic kinematics, abundant obstacles, and the scenario's nonconvex and constrained nature. To address this, we propose an efficient trajectory planning framework for AGVs by formulating the problem as an optimal control problem. Our framework utilizes the fast safe rectangular corridor (FSRC) algorithm to construct rectangular convex corridors, representing avoidance constraints as box constraints. This eliminates redundant obstacle influences and accelerates the solution speed. Additionally, we employ the Modified Visibility Graph algorithm to speed up path planning and a boundary discretization strategy to expedite FSRC construction. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our framework, particularly in computational efficiency. Compared to advanced frameworks, our framework achieves computational efficiency gains of 1 to 2 orders of magnitude. Notably, FSRC significantly outperforms other safe convex corridor-based methods regarding computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Toward a Plug-and-Play Vision-Based Grasping Module for Robotics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.04349v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite recent advancements in AI for robotics, grasping remains a partially solved challenge, hindered by the lack of benchmarks and reproducibility constraints. This paper introduces a vision-based grasping framework that can easily be transferred across multiple manipulators. Leveraging Quality-Diversity (QD) algorithms, the framework generates diverse repertoires of open-loop grasping trajectories, enhancing adaptability while maintaining a diversity of grasps. This framework addresses two main issues: the lack of an off-the-shelf vision module for detecting object pose and the generalization of QD trajectories to the whole robot operational space. The proposed solution combines multiple vision modules for 6DoF object detection and tracking while rigidly transforming QD-generated trajectories into the object frame. Experiments on a Franka Research 3 arm and a UR5 arm with a SIH Schunk hand demonstrate comparable performance when the real scene aligns with the simulation used for grasp generation. This work represents a significant stride toward building a reliable vision-based grasping module transferable to new platforms, while being adaptable to diverse scenarios without further training iterations.</description>

      <title>Mechanically-Inflatable Bio-Inspired Locomotion for Robotic Pipeline Inspection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.00232v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pipelines, vital for fluid transport, pose an important yet challenging inspection task, particularly in small, flexible biological systems, that robots have yet to master. In this study, we explored the development of an innovative robot inspired by the ovipositor of parasitic wasps to navigate and inspect pipelines. The robot features a flexible locomotion system that adapts to different tube sizes and shapes through a mechanical inflation technique. The flexible locomotion system employs a reciprocating motion, in which groups of three sliders extend and retract in a cyclic fashion. In a proof-of-principle experiment, the robot locomotion efficiency demonstrated positive linear correlation (r=0.6434) with the diameter ratio (ratio of robot diameter to tube diameter). The robot showcased a remarkable ability to traverse tubes of different sizes, shapes and payloads with an average of (70%) locomotion efficiency across all testing conditions, at varying diameter ratios (0.7-1.5). Furthermore, the mechanical inflation mechanism displayed substantial load-carrying capacity, producing considerable holding force of (13 N), equivalent to carrying a payload of approximately (5.8 Kg) inclusive the robot weight. This novel soft robotic system shows promise for inspection and navigation within tubular confined spaces, particularly in scenarios requiring adaptability to different tube shapes, sizes, and load-carrying capacities. This novel design serves as a foundation for a new class of pipeline inspection robots that exhibit versatility across various pipeline environments, potentially including biological systems.</description>

      <title>LOTUS: Continual Imitation Learning for Robot Manipulation Through Unsupervised Skill Discovery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.02058v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce LOTUS, a continual imitation learning algorithm that empowers a physical robot to continuously and efficiently learn to solve new manipulation tasks throughout its lifespan. The core idea behind LOTUS is constructing an ever-growing skill library from a sequence of new tasks with a small number of human demonstrations. LOTUS starts with a continual skill discovery process using an open-vocabulary vision model, which extracts skills as recurring patterns presented in unsegmented demonstrations. Continual skill discovery updates existing skills to avoid catastrophic forgetting of previous tasks and adds new skills to solve novel tasks. LOTUS trains a meta-controller that flexibly composes various skills to tackle vision-based manipulation tasks in the lifelong learning process. Our comprehensive experiments show that LOTUS outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by over 11% in success rate, showing its superior knowledge transfer ability compared to prior methods.

      <description>arXiv:2311.08354v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study focuses on a layered, experience-based, multi-modal contact planning framework for agile quadrupedal locomotion over a constrained rebar environment. To this end, our hierarchical planner incorporates locomotion-specific modules into the high-level contact sequence planner and solves kinodynamically-aware trajectory optimization as the low-level motion planner. Through quantitative analysis of the experience accumulation process and experimental validation of the kinodynamic feasibility of the generated locomotion trajectories, we demonstrate that the experience planning heuristic offers an effective way of providing candidate footholds for a legged contact planner. Additionally, we introduce a guiding torso path heuristic at the global planning level to enhance the navigation success rate in the presence of environmental obstacles. Our results indicate that the torso-path guided experience accumulation requires significantly fewer offline trials to successfully reach the goal compared to regular experience accumulation. Finally, our planning framework is validated in both dynamics simulations and real hardware implementations on a quadrupedal robot provided by Skymul Inc.</description>

Abstract: Decentralized coordination for multi-robot systems involves planning in challenging, high-dimensional spaces. The planning problem is particularly challenging in the presence of obstacles and different sources of uncertainty such as inaccurate dynamic models and sensor noise. In this paper, we introduce Stein Variational Belief Propagation (SVBP), a novel algorithm for performing inference over nonparametric marginal distributions of nodes in a graph. We apply SVBP to multi-robot coordination by modelling a robot swarm as a graphical model and performing inference for each robot. We demonstrate our algorithm on a simulated multi-robot perception task, and on a multi-robot planning task within a Model-Predictive Control (MPC) framework, on both simulated and real-world mobile robots. Our experiments show that SVBP represents multi-modal distributions better than sampling-based or Gaussian baselines, resulting in improved performance on perception and planning tasks. Furthermore, we show that SVBP's ability to represent diverse trajectories for decentralized multi-robot planning makes it less prone to deadlock scenarios than leading baselines.</description>

      <title>3D Diffuser Actor: Policy Diffusion with 3D Scene Representations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10885v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We marry diffusion policies and 3D scene representations for robot manipulation. Diffusion policies learn the action distribution conditioned on the robot and environment state using conditional diffusion models. They have recently shown to outperform both deterministic and alternative state-conditioned action distribution learning methods. 3D robot policies use 3D scene feature representations aggregated from a single or multiple camera views using sensed depth. They have shown to generalize better than their 2D counterparts across camera viewpoints. We unify these two lines of work and present 3D Diffuser Actor, a neural policy architecture that, given a language instruction, builds a 3D representation of the visual scene and conditions on it to iteratively denoise 3D rotations and translations for the robot's end-effector. At each denoising iteration, our model represents end-effector pose estimates as 3D scene tokens and predicts the 3D translation and rotation error for each of them, by featurizing them using 3D relative attention to other 3D visual and language tokens. 3D Diffuser Actor sets a new state-of-the-art on RLBench with an absolute performance gain of 16.3% over the current SOTA on a multi-view setup and an absolute gain of 13.1% on a single-view setup. On the CALVIN benchmark, it outperforms the current SOTA in the setting of zero-shot unseen scene generalization by being able to successfully run 0.2 more tasks, a 7% relative increase. It also works in the real world from a handful of demonstrations. We ablate our model's architectural design choices, such as 3D scene featurization and 3D relative attentions, and show they all help generalization. Our results suggest that 3D scene representations and powerful generative modeling are keys to efficient robot learning from demonstrations.</description>

      <title>Goal-Reaching Trajectory Design Near Danger with Piecewise Affine Reach-avoid Computation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15604v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Autonomous mobile robots must maintain safety, but should not sacrifice performance, leading to the classical reach-avoid problem. This paper seeks to compute trajectory plans for which a robot is guaranteed to reach a goal and avoid obstacles in the specific near-danger case that the obstacles and goal are near each other. The proposed method builds off of a common approach of using a simplified planning model to generate plans, which are then tracked using a high-fidelity tracking model and controller. Existing safe planning approaches use reachability analysis to overapproximate the error between these models, but this introduces additional numerical approximation error and thereby conservativeness that prevents goal-reaching. The present work instead proposes a Piecewise Affine Reach-avoid Computation (PARC) method to tightly approximate the reachable set of the planning model. With PARC, the main source of conservativeness is the model mismatch, which can be mitigated by careful controller and planning model design. The utility of this method is demonstrated through extensive numerical experiments in which PARC outperforms state-of-the-art reach-avoid methods in near-danger goal-reaching. Furthermore, in a simulated demonstration, PARC enables the generation of provably-safe extreme vehicle dynamics drift parking maneuvers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02604v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Learning a universal manipulation policy encompassing doors with diverse categories, geometries and mechanisms, is crucial for future embodied agents to effectively work in complex and broad real-world scenarios. Due to the limited datasets and unrealistic simulation environments, previous works fail to achieve good performance across various doors. In this work, we build a novel door manipulation environment reflecting different realistic door manipulation mechanisms, and further equip this environment with a large-scale door dataset covering 6 door categories with hundreds of door bodies and handles, making up thousands of different door instances. Additionally, to better emulate real-world scenarios, we introduce a mobile robot as the agent and use the partial and occluded point cloud as the observation, which are not considered in previous works while possessing significance for real-world implementations. To learn a universal policy over diverse doors, we propose a novel framework disentangling the whole manipulation process into three stages, and integrating them by training in the reversed order of inference. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our designs and demonstrate our framework's strong performance. Code, data and videos are avaible on https://unidoormanip.github.io/.</description>

      <title>Using Fiber Optic Bundles to Miniaturize Vision-Based Tactile Sensors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05500v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vision-based tactile sensors have recently become popular due to their combination of low cost, very high spatial resolution, and ease of integration using widely available miniature cameras. The associated field of view and focal length, however, are difficult to package in a human-sized finger. In this paper we employ optical fiber bundles to achieve a form factor that, at 15 mm diameter, is smaller than an average human fingertip. The electronics and camera are also located remotely, further reducing package size. The sensor achieves a spatial resolution of 0.22 mm and a minimum force resolution 5 mN for normal and shear contact forces. With these attributes, the DIGIT Pinki sensor is suitable for applications such as robotic and teleoperated digital palpation. We demonstrate its utility for palpation of the prostate gland and show that it can achieve clinically relevant discrimination of prostate stiffness for phantom and ex vivo tissue.</description>

      <title>Lander.AI: Adaptive Landing Behavior Agent for Expertise in 3D Dynamic Platform Landings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06572v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mastering autonomous drone landing on dynamic platforms presents formidable challenges due to unpredictable velocities and external disturbances caused by the wind, ground effect, turbines or propellers of the docking platform. This study introduces an advanced Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agent, Lander:AI, designed to navigate and land on platforms in the presence of windy conditions, thereby enhancing drone autonomy and safety. Lander:AI is rigorously trained within the gym-pybullet-drone simulation, an environment that mirrors real-world complexities, including wind turbulence, to ensure the agent's robustness and adaptability.
  The agent's capabilities were empirically validated with Crazyflie 2.1 drones across various test scenarios, encompassing both simulated environments and real-world conditions. The experimental results showcased Lander:AI's high-precision landing and its ability to adapt to moving platforms, even under wind-induced disturbances. Furthermore, the system performance was benchmarked against a baseline PID controller augmented with an Extended Kalman Filter, illustrating significant improvements in landing precision and error recovery. Lander:AI leverages bio-inspired learning to adapt to external forces like birds, enhancing drone adaptability without knowing force magnitudes.This research not only advances drone landing technologies, essential for inspection and emergency applications, but also highlights the potential of DRL in addressing intricate aerodynamic challenges.</description>

      <title>LF-PGVIO: A Visual-Inertial-Odometry Framework for Large Field-of-View Cameras using Points and Geodesic Segments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.06663v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose LF-PGVIO, a Visual-Inertial-Odometry (VIO) framework for large Field-of-View (FoV) cameras with a negative plane using points and geodesic segments. The purpose of our research is to unleash the potential of point-line odometry with large-FoV omnidirectional cameras, even for cameras with negative-plane FoV. To achieve this, we propose an Omnidirectional Curve Segment Detection (OCSD) method combined with a camera model which is applicable to images with large distortions, such as panoramic annular images, fisheye images, and various panoramic images. The geodesic segment is sliced into multiple straight-line segments based on the radian and descriptors are extracted and recombined. Descriptor matching establishes the constraint relationship between 3D line segments in multiple frames. In our VIO system, line feature residual is also extended to support large-FoV cameras. Extensive evaluations on public datasets demonstrate the superior accuracy and robustness of LF-PGVIO compared to state-of-the-art methods. The source code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/flysoaryun/LF-PGVIO.</description>

      <title>Robust 3D Object Detection from LiDAR-Radar Point Clouds via Cross-Modal Feature Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.17336v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for robust 3D object detection from point clouds via cross-modal hallucination. Our proposed approach is agnostic to either hallucination direction between LiDAR and 4D radar. We introduce multiple alignments on both spatial and feature levels to achieve simultaneous backbone refinement and hallucination generation. Specifically, spatial alignment is proposed to deal with the geometry discrepancy for better instance matching between LiDAR and radar. The feature alignment step further bridges the intrinsic attribute gap between the sensing modalities and stabilizes the training. The trained object detection models can deal with difficult detection cases better, even though only single-modal data is used as the input during the inference stage. Extensive experiments on the View-of-Delft (VoD) dataset show that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods for both radar and LiDAR object detection while maintaining competitive efficiency in runtime.

      <title>On Solving Close Enough Orienteering Problem with Overlapped Neighborhoods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04257v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Close Enough Traveling Salesman Problem (CETSP) is a well-known variant of TSP whereby the agent may complete its mission at any point within a target neighborhood. Heuristics based on overlapped neighborhoods, known as Steiner Zones (SZ), have gained attention in addressing CETSP. While SZs offer effective approximations to the original graph, their inherent overlap imposes constraints on search space, potentially conflicting with global optimization objectives. Here we show how such limitations can be converted into advantages in a Close Enough Orienteering Problem (CEOP) by aggregating prizes across overlapped neighborhoods. We further extend classic CEOP with Non-uniform Neighborhoods (CEOP-N) by introducing non-uniform costs for prize collection. To tackle CEOP and CEOP-N, we develop a new approach featuring a Randomized Steiner Zone Discretization (RSZD) scheme coupled with a hybrid algorithm based on Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Ant Colony System (ACS), CRaSZe-AntS. The RSZD scheme identifies sub-regions for PSO exploration, and ACS determines the discrete visiting sequence. We evaluate the RSZD's discretization performance on CEOP instances derived from established CETSP instances and compare CRaSZe-AntS against the most relevant state-of-the-art heuristic focused on single-neighborhood optimization for CEOP instances. We also compare the performance of the interior search within SZs and the boundary search on individual neighborhoods in the context of CEOP-N. Our experimental results show that CRaSZe-AntS can yield comparable solution quality with significantly reduced computation time compared to the single neighborhood strategy, where we observe an average 140.44% increase in prize collection and a 55.18% reduction in algorithm execution time. CRaSZe-AntS is thus highly effective in solving emerging CEOP-N, examples of which include truck-and-drone delivery scenarios.</description>

      <title>RIME: Robust Preference-based Reinforcement Learning with Noisy Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17257v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Preference-based Reinforcement Learning (PbRL) avoids the need for reward engineering by harnessing human preferences as the reward signal. However, current PbRL algorithms over-reliance on high-quality feedback from domain experts, which results in a lack of robustness. In this paper, we present RIME, a robust PbRL algorithm for effective reward learning from noisy preferences. Our method incorporates a sample selection-based discriminator to dynamically filter denoised preferences for robust training. To mitigate the accumulated error caused by incorrect selection, we propose to warm start the reward model, which additionally bridges the performance gap during transition from pre-training to online training in PbRL. Our experiments on robotic manipulation and locomotion tasks demonstrate that RIME significantly enhances the robustness of the current state-of-the-art PbRL method. Ablation studies further demonstrate that the warm start is crucial for both robustness and feedback-efficiency in limited-feedback cases.</description>

      <title>LiDAR Point Cloud-based Multiple Vehicle Tracking with Probabilistic Measurement-Region Association</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06423v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multiple extended target tracking (ETT) has gained increasing attention due to the development of high-precision LiDAR and radar sensors in automotive applications. For LiDAR point cloud-based vehicle tracking, this paper presents a probabilistic measurement-region association (PMRA) ETT model, which can describe the complex measurement distribution by partitioning the target extent into different regions. The PMRA model overcomes the drawbacks of previous data-region association (DRA) models by eliminating the approximation error of constrained estimation and using continuous integrals to more reliably calculate the association probabilities. Furthermore, the PMRA model is integrated with the Poisson multi-Bernoulli mixture (PMBM) filter for tracking multiple vehicles. Simulation results illustrate the superior estimation accuracy of the proposed PMRA-PMBM filter in terms of both positions and extents of the vehicles comparing with PMBM filters using the gamma Gaussian inverse Wishart and DRA implementations.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Joint Motion Prediction for Individuals with Limb Loss Through Model Reprogramming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06569v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mobility impairment caused by limb loss is a significant challenge faced by millions of individuals worldwide. The development of advanced assistive technologies, such as prosthetic devices, has the potential to greatly improve the quality of life for amputee patients. A critical component in the design of such technologies is the accurate prediction of reference joint motion for the missing limb. However, this task is hindered by the scarcity of joint motion data available for amputee patients, in contrast to the substantial quantity of data from able-bodied subjects. To overcome this, we leverage deep learning's reprogramming property to repurpose well-trained models for a new goal without altering the model parameters. With only data-level manipulation, we adapt models originally designed for able-bodied people to forecast joint motion in amputees. The findings in this study have significant implications for advancing assistive tech and amputee mobility.</description>
