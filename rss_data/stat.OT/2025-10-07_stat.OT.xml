      <title>Variational Autoencoders-based Detection of Extremes in Plant Productivity in an Earth System Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Climate anomalies significantly impact terrestrial carbon cycle dynamics, necessitating robust methods for detecting and analyzing anomalous behavior in plant productivity. This study presents a novel application of variational autoencoders (VAE) for identifying extreme events in gross primary productivity (GPP) from Community Earth System Model version 2 simulations across four AR6 regions in the Continental United States. We compare VAE-based anomaly detection with traditional singular spectral analysis (SSA) methods across three time periods: 1850-80, 1950-80, and 2050-80 under the SSP585 scenario. The VAE architecture employs three dense layers and a latent space with an input sequence length of 12 months, trained on a normalized GPP time series to reconstruct the GPP and identifying anomalies based on reconstruction errors. Extreme events are defined using 5th percentile thresholds applied to both VAE and SSA anomalies. Results demonstrate strong regional agreement between VAE and SSA methods in spatial patterns of extreme event frequencies, despite VAE producing higher threshold values (179-756 GgC for VAE vs. 100-784 GgC for SSA across regions and periods). Both methods reveal increasing magnitudes and frequencies of negative carbon cycle extremes toward 2050-80, particularly in Western and Central North America. The VAE approach shows comparable performance to established SSA techniques, while offering computational advantages and enhanced capability for capturing non-linear temporal dependencies in carbon cycle variability. Unlike SSA, the VAE method does not require one to define the periodicity of the signals in the data; it discovers them from the data.</description>

      <title>Comparison of Parametric versus Machine-learning Multiple Imputation in Clinical Trials with Missing Continuous Outcomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The use of flexible machine-learning (ML) models to generate imputations of missing data within the framework of Multiple Imputation (MI) has recently gained traction, particularly in observational settings. For randomised controlled trials (RCTs), it is unclear whether ML approaches to MI provide valid inference, and whether they outperform parametric MI approaches under complex data generating mechanisms. We conducted two simulations in RCT settings that have incomplete continuous outcomes but fully observed covariates. We compared Complete Cases, standard MI (MI-norm), MI with predictive mean matching (MI-PMM) and ML-based approaches to MI, including classification and regression trees (MI-CART), Random Forests (MI-RF) and SuperLearner when outcomes are missing completely at random or missing at random conditional on treatment/covariate. The first simulation explored non-linear covariate-outcome relationships in the presence/absence of covariate-treatment interactions. The second simulation explored skewed repeated measures, motivated by a trial with digital outcomes. In the absence of interactions, we found that Complete Cases yields reliable inference; MI-norm performs similarly, except when missingness depends on the covariate. ML approaches can lead to smaller mean squared error than Complete Cases and MI-norm in specific non-linear settings, but provide unreliable inference for others. MI-PMM can lead to unreliable inference in several settings. In the presence of complex treatment-covariate interactions, performing MI separately by arm, either with MI-norm, MI-RF or MI-CART, provides inference that has comparable or with better properties compared to Complete Cases when the analysis model omits the interaction. For ML approaches, we observed unreliable inference in terms of bias in the estimated effect and/or its standard error when Rubin's Rules are implemented.</description>
