      <title>Single-File Diffusion of Active Brownian Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-file diffusion (SFD) is a key mechanism underlying transport phenomena in confined physical and biological systems. In a typical SFD process, microscopic particles are restricted to moving in a narrow channel where they cannot pass one another, resulting in constrained motion and anomalous diffusion at long times. In this study, we use Brownian dynamics simulations and analytical theory to investigate the SFD of active Brownian particles (ABPs) -- a minimal model of active colloids. Using a combination of scaling relations and heuristic arguments, we derive an accurate analytical expression for a tagged ABP's mean square displacement (MSD). We find the MSD exhibits ballistic behavior at short times, which can quantitatively be related to the reduced kinetic temperature of the single-file ABP system. We also find that while the characteristic subdiffusive scaling of SFD $[\langle (\Delta x)^2 \rangle \sim t^{1/2}]$ is preserved at long times, self-propulsion introduces significant modifications to the 1D-mobility, which can be directly related to the constant P\'eclet (Pe) compressibility. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the generalized 1D-mobility, initially proposed by Kollmann for equilibrium systems [Phys. Rev. Lett. $\textbf{90}$, 180602 (2003)], can be extended to active systems with minimal modification. These findings have important implications for tuning particle transport at the microscale and provide a basis for understanding active matter in geometries with highly restricted motion.</description>

      <title>Island formation in heteroepitaxial growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Island formation in strain-free heteroepitaxial deposition of thin films is analyzed using kinetic Monte Carlo simulations of two minimal lattice models and scaling approaches. The transition from layer-by-layer (LBL) to island (ISL) growth is driven by a weaker binding strength of the substrate which, in the kinetic model, is equivalent to an increased diffusivity of particles on the substrate compared to particles on the film. The LBL-ISL transition region is characterized by particle fluxes between layers 1 and 2 significantly exceeding the net flux between them, which sets a quasi-equilibrium condition. Deposition on top of monolayer islands weakly contributes to second layer nucleation, in contrast with the homoepitaxial growth case. A thermodynamic approach for compact islands with one or two layers predicts the minimum size in which the second layer is stable. When this is linked to scaling expressions for submonolayer island deposition, the dependence of the ISL-LBL transition point on the kinetic parameters qualitatively matches the simulation results, with quantitative agreement in some parameter ranges. The transition occurs in the equilibrium regime of partial wetting and the convergence of the transition point upon reducing the deposition rate is very slow and practically unattainable in experiments.</description>

      <title>Diffusive dynamics of charge regulated macro-ion solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Onsager's variational principle is generalized to address the diffusive dynamics of an electrolyte solution composed of charge-regulated macro-ions and counterions. The free energy entering the Rayleighian corresponds to the Poisson-Boltzmann theory augmented by the charge-regulation mechanism. The dynamical equations obtained by minimizing the Rayleighian include the classical Poisson-Nernst-Planck equations, the Debye-Falkenhagen equation, and their modifications in the presence of charge regulation. By analyzing the steady state, we show that the charge regulation has an important impact on the non-equilibrium macro-ion spatial distribution and their effective charge, deviating significantly from their equilibrium values. Our model, based on Onsager's variational principle offers a unified approach to the diffusive dynamics of electrolytes containing components that undergo various charge association/dissociation processes.</description>

      <title>Faraday Cup Measurements of Triboelectrically Charged Granular Material: A Modular Interpretation Methodology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The triboelectric charging of granular materials remains a poorly understood phenomenon with a wide range of scientific and industrial applications, from volcanic lightning to pharmaceutical manufacturing. The Faraday cup is the most commonly used apparatus for studying triboelectric charging, yet current methods of interpreting measurements are overly simplistic, often conflating charging due to particle-particle interactions with other charging mechanisms. In this study, we present a modular approach for interpreting Faraday cup measurements, which allows for more detailed exploration of triboelectric phenomena. The approach involves fitting approximated charge distribution shapes to experimental Faraday cup data, using measured size distributions alongside simplified models of charge distribution and particle dynamics. This modular framework is adaptable, allowing for fine-tuning at each step to suit specific application cases, making it broadly applicable to any insulating granular material. As a case study, we examine volcanic ash samples from Gr\'imsv\"otn and Atitl\'an volcanoes, finding that the Gr\'imsv\"otn ash exhibited a higher proportion of charge due to particle-particle interactions. Experimental validation with sieved volcanic ash fractions revealed that larger particle sizes showed stronger particle-particle charging. Additionally, non-particle-particle charging was found to scale with particle size as $\propto d_p^{-0.85 \pm 0.03}$, approximately following the particles' effective surface area.</description>

      <title>Tailoring interactions between active nematic defects with reinforcement learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active nematics, formed from a liquid crystalline suspension of active force dipoles, are a paradigmatic active matter system whose study provides insights into how chemical driving produces the cellular mechanical forces essential for life. Recent advances in optogenetic control over molecular motors and cell-signaling pathways now allow experimenters to mimic the spatiotemporal regulation of activity necessary to drive biologically relevant active nematic flows in vivo. However, engineering effective activity protocols remains challenging due to the system's complex dynamics. Here, we explore a model-free approach for controlling active nematic fields using reinforcement learning. Specifically, we demonstrate how local activity fields can induce interactions between pairs of nematic defects, enabling them to follow designer dynamical laws such as those of overdamped springs with varying stiffnesses. Reinforcement learning bypasses the need for accurate parameterization and model representation of the nematic system, and could thus transfer straightforwardly to experimental implementation. Moreover, the sufficiency of our low-dimensional system observables and actions suggests that coarse projections of the active nematic field can be used for precise feedback control, making the biological implementation of such feedback loops plausible.</description>

      <title>Noise-driven odd elastic waves in living chiral active matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral active matter is predicted to exhibit odd elasticity, with nontraditional elastic response arising from a combination of chirality, being out of equilibrium, and the presence of nonreciprocal interactions. One of the resulting phenomena is the possible occurrence of odd elastic waves in overdamped systems, although its experimental realization still remains elusive. Here we show that in overdamped active systems, noise is required to generate persistent elastic waves. In the chiral crystalline phase of active matter, such as that found recently in populations of swimming starfish embryos, the noise arises from self-driving of active particles and their mutual collisions, a key factor that has been missing in previous studies. We identify the criterion for the occurrence of noise-driven odd elastic waves, and postulate the corresponding phase diagram for the general chiral active crystals. Our results can be used to predict the experimental conditions for achieving a transition to self-sustained elastic waves in overdamped active systems.</description>

      <title>Inter-Species Interactions in Dual, Fibrous Gel Enable Control of Gel Structure and Rheology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Natural and synthetic multi-component gels display emergent properties, which implies that they are more than just the sum of their components. This warrants the investigation of the role played by inter-species interactions in shaping gel architecture and rheology. Here, using computer simulations, we investigate the effect of changing the strength of the interaction between two species forming a fibrous double network. Simply changing the strength of inter-species lateral association, we generate two types of gels: one in which the two components demix, and another one in which the two species wrap around each other. We show that demixed gels have structure and rheology that are largely unaffected by the strength of attraction between the components. In contrast, architecture and material properties of intertwined gels strongly depend on inter-species "stickiness" and volume exclusion. These results can be used as the basis of a design principle for double networks which are made to emphasize either stability to perturbations or responsiveness to stimuli. Similar ideas could be used to interpret naturally occurring multi-component gels.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a model in which particles belonging to two species proliferate with volume exclusion on an expanding surface. If the surface expands uniformly, we show that the domains formed by the two species present a critical behavior. We compute the critical exponents characterizing the decay of interfaces and the size distribution of domains using a mean-field theory. These mean-field exponents agree very accurately with those fitted in numerical simulations, suggesting that the theory is exact.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantifying the correlations between the position of a tagged tracer and the density of surrounding bath particles is key to understanding tracer diffusion in interacting particle systems. We address this problem analytically for both hard-core and soft-core interactions, using minimal yet paradigmatic models in $d$ spatial dimensions. In both cases, we derive analytical expressions for the spatial correlation profiles in the reference frame of the tracer. We reveal unexpected universal features in their large-distance behavior, characterized by power-law tails with exponents that depend solely on the spatial dimensionality of the system. Beyond these simple models, we demonstrate the robustness of our results across different regimes using particle-based numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>A survey of probabilistic generative frameworks for molecular simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence is now a widely used tool in molecular science. Despite the popularity of probabilistic generative models, numerical experiments benchmarking their performance on molecular data are lacking. In this work, we introduce and explain several classes of generative models, broadly sorted into two categories: flow-based models and diffusion models. We select three representative models: Neural Spline Flows, Conditional Flow Matching, and Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models, and examine their accuracy, computational cost, and generation speed across datasets with tunable dimensionality, complexity, and modal asymmetry. Our findings are varied, with no one framework being the best for all purposes. In a nutshell, (i) Neural Spline Flows do best at capturing mode asymmetry present in low-dimensional data, (ii) Conditional Flow Matching outperforms other models for high-dimensional data with low complexity, and (iii) Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models appears the best for low-dimensional data with high complexity. Our datasets include a Gaussian mixture model and the dihedral torsion angle distribution of the Aib\textsubscript{9} peptide, generated via a molecular dynamics simulation. We hope our taxonomy of probabilistic generative frameworks and numerical results may guide model selection for a wide range of molecular tasks.</description>

      <title>Numerical prediction of the steady-state distribution under stochastic resetting from measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A common and effective method for calculating the steady-state distribution of a process under stochastic resetting is the renewal approach that requires only the knowledge of the reset-free propagator of the underlying process and the resetting time distribution. The renewal approach is widely used for simple model systems such as a freely diffusing particle with exponentially distributed resetting times. However, in many real-world physical systems, the propagator, the resetting time distribution, or both are not always known beforehand. In this study, we develop a numerical renewal method to determine the steady-state probability distribution of particle positions based on the measured system propagator in the absence of resetting combined with the known or measured resetting time distribution. We apply and validate our method in two distinct systems: one involving interacting particles and the other featuring strong environmental memory. Thus, the renewal approach can be used to predict the steady state under stochastic resetting of any system, provided that the free propagator can be measured and that it undergoes complete resetting.</description>

      <title>NEP-MB-pol: A unified machine-learned framework for fast and accurate prediction of water's thermodynamic and transport properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Water's unique hydrogen-bonding network and anomalous properties present significant challenges for accurately modeling its structural, thermodynamic, and transport behavior across varied conditions. Although machine-learned potentials have advanced the prediction of individual properties, a unified computational framework capable of simultaneously capturing water's complex and subtle properties with high accuracy has remained elusive. Here, we address this challenge by introducing NEP-MB-pol, a highly accurate and efficient neuroevolution potential trained on extensive MB-pol reference data with coupled-cluster-level accuracy, combined with path-integral molecular dynamics and quantum-correction techniques to incorporate nuclear quantum effects. This NEP-MB-pol framework reproduces experimentally measured structural, thermodynamic, and transport properties of water across a broad temperature range, achieving simultaneous, fast, and accurate prediction of self-diffusion coefficient, viscosity, and thermal conductivity. Our approach provides a unified and robust tool for exploring thermodynamic and transport properties of water under diverse conditions, with significant potential for broader applications across research fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.06119v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Biopolymer networks from the intracellular to tissue scale display high rigidity and tensile stress while having coordinations well below the normal threshold for mechanical rigidity. The elastic filaments in these networks are often severed by enzymes in a tension-inhibited manner. The effects of such pruning on the mechanics of prestressed networks have not been studied. We show that networks pruned by a tension-inhibited method remain rigid at much lower coordinations than randomly pruned ones. These findings suggest a possible reason for the repeated evolution of tension-inhibited filament-severing proteins.</description>

      <title>Thermomechanical Approach to Calculating Mechanical Stresses in Inhomogeneous Fluids and Its Applications to Ionic Fluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10597v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This extended article presents a thermomechanical approach for calculating the stress tensor from the thermodynamic potential of inhomogeneous fluids and some applications to ionic fluids. The technique, based on the invariance of the fluid's thermodynamic potential with respect to spatial transformations of translation and rotation, offers an alternative to the general covariant approach developed by two of the authors. We apply this technique to both pure mean-field theories of fluids in general and a theory that includes thermal fluctuations of the order parameter, using the example of ionic fluids. Additionally, we apply the thermomechanical approach to fluid models with vector order parameters, such as liquid dielectrics. For this case, we obtain a general expression for the stress tensor. Furthermore, we discuss specific issues related to the calculation of disjoining pressure in ionic fluids confined in nanoscale slit-like pores with metal or dielectric walls, using the Coulomb gas model. To test the robustness of the proposed approach, we reproduce a number of known results from the statistical theory of inhomogeneous fluids and obtain several new ones.</description>

      <title>Mean square displacement of intruders in freely cooling multicomponent granular mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08726v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mean square displacement (MSD) of intruders (tracer particles) immersed in a multicomponent granular mixture made up of smooth inelastic hard spheres in a homogeneous cooling state is explicitly computed. The multicomponent granular mixture is constituted by $s$ species with different masses, diameters, and coefficients of restitution. In the hydrodynamic regime, the time decay of the granular temperature of the mixture gives rise to a time decay of the intruder's diffusion coefficient $D_0$. The corresponding MSD of the intruder is determined by integrating the corresponding diffusion equation. As expected from previous works on binary mixtures, we find a logarithmic time dependence of the MSD which involves the coefficient $D_0$. To analyze the dependence of the MSD on the parameter space of the system, the diffusion coefficient is explicitly determined by considering the so-called second Sonine approximation (two terms in the Sonine polynomial expansion of the intruder's distribution function). The theoretical results for $D_0$ are compared with those obtained by numerically solving the Boltzmann equation by means of the direct simulation Monte Carlo method. We show that the second Sonine approximation improves the predictions of the first Sonine approximation, especially when the intruders are much lighter than the particles of the granular mixture. In the long-time limit, our results for the MSD agree with those recently obtained by Bodrova [Phys. Rev. E \textbf{109}, 024903 (2024)] when $D_0$ is determined by considering the first Sonine approximation.</description>

      <title>Unified percolation scenario for the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ processes in simple glass formers</title>

Abstract: Given the vast differences in interaction details, describing the dynamics of structurally disordered materials in a unified theoretical framework presents a fundamental challenge to condensed-matter physics and materials science. This paper investigates numerically a percolation scenario for the two most important relaxation processes of supercooled liquids and glasses. For nine binary glass formers we find that, as temperature is lowered from the liquid state, percolation of immobile particles takes place at the temperature locating the $\alpha$ process. Mirroring this, upon continued cooling into the glass, mobile-particle percolation pinpoints a Johari-Goldstein $\beta$ relaxation whenever it is well separated from the $\alpha$ process. For 2D systems under the same conditions, percolation of mobile and immobile particles occurs nearly simultaneously and no $\beta$ relaxation can be identified. Our findings suggest a general description of glassy dynamics based on a percolation perspective.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative solutions of hierarchies of evolution equations for colliding particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02121</link>

Abstract: The article deals with the challenge of the construction of solutions to hierarchies of fundamental evolution equations for many colliding particles. The method of cluster expansions of the groups of operators of the Liouville equations for observables and a state is used to establish the generating operators of expansions representing solutions of the Cauchy problems of the BBGKY hierarchy (Bogolyubov-Born-Green-Kirkwood-Yvon) as well as of the dual BBGKY hierarchy, respectively.</description>

      <title>Liquid Hopfield model: retrieval and localization in heterogeneous liquid mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18853v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Biological mixtures, such as the cellular cytoplasm, are composed of a large number of different components. From this heterogeneity, ordered mesoscopic structures emerge, such as liquid phases with controlled composition. These structures compete with each other for the same components. This raises several questions, such as what types of interactions allow the retrieval of multiple ordered mesoscopic structures, and what are the physical limitations for the retrieval of said structures. In this work, we develop an analytically tractable model for liquids capable of retrieving states with target compositions. We name this model the liquid Hopfield model in reference to corresponding work in the theory of associative neural networks. By solving this model, we show that non-linear repulsive interactions are necessary for retrieval of target structures. We demonstrate that this is because liquid mixtures at low temperatures tend to transition to phases with few components, a phenomenon that we term localization. Taken together, our results demonstrate a trade-off between retrieval and localization phenomena in liquid mixtures.</description>
