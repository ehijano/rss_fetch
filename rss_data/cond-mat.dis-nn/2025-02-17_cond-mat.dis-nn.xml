      <title>Iterative quantum optimisation with a warm-started quantum state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a method to prepare a warm-started quantum state from measurements with an iterative framework to enhance the quantum approximate optimisation algorithm (QAOA). The numerical simulations show the method can effectively address the "stuck issue" of the standard QAOA using a single-string warm-started initial state described in [Cain et al., 2023]. When applied to the $3$-regular MaxCut problem, our approach achieves an improved approximation ratio, with a lower bound that iteratively converges toward the best classical algorithms for $p=1$ standard QAOA. Additionally, in the context of the discrete global minimal variance portfolio (DGMVP) model, simulations reveal a more favourable scaling of identifying the global minimal compared to the QAOA standalone, the single-string warm-started QAOA and a classical constrained sampling approach.</description>

      <title>Fading ergodicity meets maximal chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fading ergodicity provides a theoretical framework for understanding deviations from the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) near ergodicity-breaking transitions. In this work, we demonstrate that the breakdown of the ETH at the interaction-driven ergodicity-breaking critical point in the quantum sun model gives rise to to the maximally divergent fidelity susceptibility. We further extend our analysis to the energy-driven ergodicity-breaking transition associated with the many-body mobility edge. Specifically, we show that fidelity susceptibilities at energies away from the middle of the spectrum exhibit a divergent peak near the mobility edge. Finally, we argue that fading ergodicity provides a simple and accurate description of the ETH breakdown in the quantum sun model, which is accompanied with the emergence of a peak in fidelity susceptibility and the onset of maximal chaos at the ergodicity-breaking critical point.</description>

      <title>Theory of enhanced-by-coincidence neural information transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The activity of neurons within brain circuits has been ubiquitously reported to be correlated. The impact of these correlations on brain function has been extensively investigated. Correlations can in principle increase or decrease the information that neural populations carry about sensory stimuli, but experiments in cortical areas have mostly reported information-limiting correlations, which decrease the information encoded in the population. However, a second stream of evidence suggests that temporal correlations between the spiking activity of different neurons may increase the impact of neural activity downstream, implying that temporal correlations affect both the encoding of information and its downstream readout. The principle of how encoding and readout combine are still unclear. Here, we consider a model of transmission of stimulus information encoded in pre-synaptic input spike trains with information-limiting time-correlations to the output firing of a post-synaptic biologicaly-plausible leaky integrate and fire (LIF) readout neuron. We derive an analytical solution of the model in the diffusion approximation, in which the encoding spiking activity is treated as a continuous-time stochastic variable. An ansatz based on a separation of timescales allows us compute the stimulus information transmitted to the readout over a broad range of parameters. Our analytical results reveal that, for sufficiently low input firing rates, large enough difference in input stimulus-specific activity, and moderately large input temporal correlations, the stimulus discriminability of the firing of the LIF readout neuron can be enhanced by the presence of input time correlations, despite they decrease the stimulus information encoded in its inputs.</description>

      <title>Deep learning-based holography for T-linear resistivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employ deep learning within holographic duality to investigate $T$-linear resistivity, a hallmark of strange metals. Utilizing Physics-Informed Neural Networks, we incorporate boundary data for $T$-linear resistivity and bulk differential equations into a loss function. This approach allows us to derive dilaton potentials in Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton-Axion theories, capturing essential features of strange metals, such as $T$-linear resistivity and linear specific heat scaling. We also explore the impact of the resistivity slope on dilaton potentials. Regardless of slope, dilaton potentials exhibit universal exponential growth at low temperatures, driving $T$-linear resistivity and matching infrared geometric analyses. At a specific slope, our method rediscovers the Gubser-Rocha model, a well-known holographic model of strange metals. Additionally, the robustness of $T$-linear resistivity at higher temperatures correlates with the asymptotic AdS behavior of the dilaton coupling to the Maxwell term. Our findings suggest that deep learning could help uncover mechanisms in holographic condensed matter systems and advance our understanding of strange metals.</description>

      <title>(How) Can Transformers Predict Pseudo-Random Numbers?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformers excel at discovering patterns in sequential data, yet their fundamental limitations and learning mechanisms remain crucial topics of investigation. In this paper, we study the ability of Transformers to learn pseudo-random number sequences from linear congruential generators (LCGs), defined by the recurrence relation $x_{t+1} = a x_t + c \;\mathrm{mod}\; m$. Our analysis reveals that with sufficient architectural capacity and training data variety, Transformers can perform in-context prediction of LCG sequences with unseen moduli ($m$) and parameters ($a,c$). Through analysis of embedding layers and attention patterns, we uncover how Transformers develop algorithmic structures to learn these sequences in two scenarios of increasing complexity. First, we analyze how Transformers learn LCG sequences with unseen ($a, c$) but fixed modulus, and we demonstrate successful learning up to $m = 2^{32}$. Our analysis reveals that models learn to factorize the modulus and utilize digit-wise number representations to make sequential predictions. In the second, more challenging scenario of unseen moduli, we show that Transformers can generalize to unseen moduli up to $m_{\text{test}} = 2^{16}$. In this case, the model employs a two-step strategy: first estimating the unknown modulus from the context, then utilizing prime factorizations to generate predictions. For this task, we observe a sharp transition in the accuracy at a critical depth $=3$. We also find that the number of in-context sequence elements needed to reach high accuracy scales sublinearly with the modulus.</description>

      <title>Evidence of Scaling Regimes in the Hopfield Dynamics of Whole Brain Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07538v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is shown that a Hopfield recurrent neural network exhibits a scaling regime, whose specific exponents depend on the number of parcels used and the decay length of the coupling strength. This scaling regime recovers the picture introduced by Deco et al., according to which the process of information transfer within the human brain shows spatially correlated patterns qualitatively similar to those displayed by turbulent flows, although with a more singular exponent, 1/2 instead of 2/3. Both models employ a coupling strength which decays exponentially with the Euclidean distance between the nodes, informed by experimentally derived brain topology. Nevertheless, their mathematical nature is very different, Hopf oscillators versus a Hopfield neural network, respectively. Hence, their convergence for the same data parameters, suggests an intriguing robustness of the scaling picture.Furthermore, the present analysis shows that the Hopfield model brain remains functional by removing links above about five decay lengths, corresponding to about one sixth of the size of the global brain. This suggests that, in terms of connectivity decay length, the Hopfield brain functions in a sort of intermediate ``turbulent liquid''-like state, whose essential connections are the intermediate ones between the connectivity decay length and the global brain size. The evident sensitivity of the scaling exponent to the value of the decay length, as well as to the number of brain parcels employed, leads us to take with great caution any quantitative assessment regarding the specific nature of the scaling regime.</description>

      <title>Quantum Chaos in Random Ising Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14376v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report a systematic investigation of universal quantum chaotic signatures in the transverse field Ising model on an Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi network. This is achieved by studying local spectral measures such as the level spacing and the level velocity statistics. A spectral form factor analysis is also performed as a global measure, probing energy level correlations at arbitrary spectral distances. Our findings show that these measures capture the breakdown of chaotic behavior upon varying the connectivity and strength of the transverse field in various regimes. We demonstrate that the level spacing statistics and the spectral form factor signal this breakdown for sparsely and densely connected networks. The velocity statistics capture the surviving chaotic signatures in the sparse limit. However, these integrable-like regimes extend over a vanishingly small segment in the full range of connectivity.</description>

      <title>Universal Sharpness Dynamics in Neural Network Training: Fixed Point Analysis, Edge of Stability, and Route to Chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02076v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In gradient descent dynamics of neural networks, the top eigenvalue of the loss Hessian (sharpness) displays a variety of robust phenomena throughout training. This includes early time regimes where the sharpness may decrease during early periods of training (sharpness reduction), and later time behavior such as progressive sharpening and edge of stability. We demonstrate that a simple $2$-layer linear network (UV model) trained on a single training example exhibits all of the essential sharpness phenomenology observed in real-world scenarios. By analyzing the structure of dynamical fixed points in function space and the vector field of function updates, we uncover the underlying mechanisms behind these sharpness trends. Our analysis reveals (i) the mechanism behind early sharpness reduction and progressive sharpening, (ii) the required conditions for edge of stability, (iii) the crucial role of initialization and parameterization, and (iv) a period-doubling route to chaos on the edge of stability manifold as learning rate is increased. Finally, we demonstrate that various predictions from this simplified model generalize to real-world scenarios and discuss its limitations.</description>

      <title>Competing structures in a minimal double-well potential model of condensed matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17901v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The microscopic structure of several amorphous substances often reveals complex patterns such as medium- or long-range order, spatial heterogeneity, and even local polycrystallinity. To capture all these features, models usually incorporate a refined description of the particle interaction that includes an ad hoc design of the inside of the system constituents, and use temperature as a control parameter. We show that all these features can emerge from a minimal athermal two-dimensional model where particles interact isotropically by a double-well potential, which includes an excluded volume and a maximum coordination number. The rich variety of structural patterns shown by this simple geometrical model apply to a wide range of real systems including water, silicon, and different amorphous materials.</description>

Abstract: We perform a principal component analysis (PCA) of two one-dimensional lattice models belonging to distinct nonequilibrium universality classes - directed bond percolation and branching and annihilating random walks with even number of offspring. We find that the uncentered PCA of datasets storing various system's configurations can be successfully used to determine the critical properties of these nonequilibrium phase transitions. In particular, in both cases, we obtain good estimates of the critical point and the dynamical critical exponent of the models. For directed bond percolation we are, furthermore, able to extract critical exponents associated with the correlation length and the order parameter. We discuss the relation of our analysis with low-rank approximations of datasets.</description>

      <title>Analytical solution for the polydisperse random close packing problem in 2D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03354v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An analytical theory for the random close packing density, $\phi_\textrm{RCP}$, of polydisperse hard disks is provided using an equilibrium model of crowding [A. Zaccone, Phys. Rev. Lett. 128, 028002 (2022)] which has been justified on the basis of extensive numerical analysis of the maximally random jammed (MRJ) line in the phase diagram of hard spheres [Anzivino et al., J. Chem. Phys. 158, 044901 (2023)]. The solution relies on the equations of state for the hard disk fluid and provides predictions for $\phi_\textrm{RCP}$ as a function of the ratio, $s$, of the standard deviation of the distribution of disk diameters to its mean. For a power-law size distribution with $s=0.246$, the theory yields $\phi_\textrm{RCP} =0.892$, which compares well with the most recent numerical estimate $\phi_\textrm{RCP} =0.905$ based on the Monte-Carlo swap algorithms [Ghimenti, Berthier, van Wijland, Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 028202 (2024)].</description>
