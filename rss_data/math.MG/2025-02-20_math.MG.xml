      <title>A Sharp Bound on Large Planar Signed Vector Sums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a sharp lower bound to the largest possible Euclidean norm of signed sums of $n$ vectors in the plane. This is achieved by connecting the signed vector sum problem to the isoperimetric problem for the circumradius of polygons. In turn, we apply the sharp bound for the signed vector sum problem to establish a sharp lower bound to the circumradius of the Minkowski sum of $n$ planar symmetric convex bodies. We also determine a tight lower bound to the circumradius of the Minkowski sum of general convex bodies in any dimension independent of their number.</description>

      <title>On uniqueness of coarse median structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that any product of bushy hyperbolic spaces has a unique coarse median structure, and that having a unique coarse median structure is a property closed under relative hyperbolicity. As a consequence, in contrast with the case of mapping class groups, there are non-hyperbolic pants graphs that have unique coarse median structures.</description>

      <title>On the Steiner tree connecting a fractal set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.01932v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct an example of an infinite planar embedded self-similar binary tree $\Sigma$ which is the essentially unique solution to the Steiner problem of finding the shortest connection of a given planar self-similar fractal set $C$ of positive Hausdorff dimension. The set $C$ can be considered the set of leaves, or the ``boundary``, of the tree $\Sigma$, so that $\Sigma$ is an irreducible solution to the Steiner problem with datum $C$ (i.e. $\Sigma\setminus C$ is connected).</description>

      <title>Steiner trees with infinitely many terminals on the sides of an angle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11546v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Euclidean Steiner problem is the problem of finding a set $St$, with the shortest length, such that $St \cup A$ is connected, where $A$ is a given set in a Euclidean space. The solutions $St$ to the Steiner problem will be called Steiner sets while the set $A$ will be called input. Since every Steiner set is acyclic we call it Steiner tree in the case when it is connected. We say that a Steiner tree is indecomposable if it does not contain any Steiner tree for a subset of the input.
  We are interested in finding the Steiner set when the input consists of infinitely many points distributed on two lines. In particular we would like to find a configuration which gives an indecomposable Steiner tree.
  We consider a self-similar input, namely the set $A_{\alpha,\lambda}$ of points with coordinates $(\lambda^{k-1}\cos \alpha,$ $\pm \lambda^{k-1}\sin \alpha)$, where $\lambda&gt;0$ and $\alpha&gt;0$ are small fixed values. These points are distributed on the two sides of an angle of size $2\alpha$ in such a way that the distances from the points to the vertex of the angle are in a geometric progression.
  To our surprise, we show that in this case the solutions to the Steiner problem for $A_{\alpha,\lambda}$, when $\alpha$ and $\lambda$ are small enough, are always decomposable trees. More precisely, any Steiner tree for $A_{\alpha,\lambda}$ is a countable union of Steiner trees, each one connecting 5 points from the input. By considering only a finite number of components we obtain many solutions to the Steiner problem for finite sets composed of $4k+1$ points distributed on the two lines ($2k+1$ on a line and $2k$ on the other line). These solutions are very similar to the ladders of Chung and Graham.</description>

      <title>Nonnegative cross-curvature in infinite dimensions: synthetic definition and spaces of measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18112v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonnegative cross-curvature (NNCC) is a geometric property of a cost function defined on a product space that originates in optimal transportation and the Ma-Trudinger-Wang theory. Motivated by applications in optimization, gradient flows and mechanism design, we propose a variational formulation of nonnegative cross-curvature on c-convex domains applicable to infinite dimensions and nonsmooth settings. The resulting class of NNCC spaces is closed under Gromov-Hausdorff convergence and for this class, we extend many properties of classical nonnegative cross-curvature: stability under generalized Riemannian submersions, characterization in terms of the convexity of certain sets of c-concave functions, and in the metric case, it is a subclass of positively curved spaces in the sense of Alexandrov. One of our main results is that Wasserstein spaces of probability measures inherit the NNCC property from their base space. Additional examples of NNCC costs include the Bures-Wasserstein and Fisher-Rao squared distances, the Hellinger-Kantorovich squared distance (in some cases), the relative entropy on probability measures, and the 2-Gromov-Wasserstein squared distance on metric measure spaces.</description>

      <title>On the perimeter, diameter and circumradius of ordinary hyperbolic reduced polygons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03666v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A convex body $R$ in the hyperbolic plane is reduced if any convex body $K\subset R$ has a smaller minimal width than $R$. We answer a few of Lassak's questions about ordinary reduced polygons regarding its perimeter, diameter and circumradius, and we also obtain a hyperbolic extension of a result of Fabi\'nska.</description>

      <title>Periodic double tilings of the plane</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08396v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study tilings of the plane composed of two repeating tiles of different assigned areas relative to an arbitrary periodic lattice. We classify isoperimetric configurations (i.e., configurations with minimal length of the interfaces) both in the case of a fixed lattice or for an arbitrary periodic lattice. We find three different configurations depending on the ratio between the assigned areas of the two tiles and compute the isoperimetric profile. The three different configurations are composed of tiles with a different number of circular edges, moreover, different configurations exhibit a different optimal lattice. Finally, we raise some open problems related to our investigation.</description>

      <title>Metrical properties of Hurwitz Continued Fractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.08254v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop the geometry of Hurwitz continued fractions, a major tool in understanding the approximation properties of complex numbers by ratios of Gaussian integers. Based on a thorough study of the geometric properties of Hurwitz continued fractions, among other things, we determine that the space of valid sequences is not a closed set of sequences. Additionally, we establish a comprehensive metrical theory for Hurwitz continued fractions.%, paralleling the classical theory for regular continued fractions in real numbers.
  Let $\Phi:\mathbb{N}\to \mathbb{R}_{&gt;0}$ be any function. For any complex number $z$ and $n\in\mathbb{N}$, let $a_n(z)$ denote the $n$th partial quotient in the Hurwitz continued fraction of $z$. One of the main results of this paper is the computation of the Hausdorff dimension of the set \[E(\Phi) := \left\{ z\in \mathbb C: |a_n(z)|\geq \Phi(n) \text{ for infinitely many }n\in\mathbb{N} \right\}. \] This study is a complex analog of a well-known result of Wang and Wu [Adv. Math. 218 (2008), no. 5, 1319--1339].</description>

      <title>Circle bundles with PSC over large manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01047v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct infinitely many examples of macroscopically large manifolds of dimension $m \geq 4$ equipped with circle bundles whose total spaces admit metrics of positive scalar curvature and have macroscopic dimension at most $\lceil m/2 \rceil + 1$. In particular, we answer a question of Gromov on the existence of circle bundles over enlargeable manifolds whose total spaces admit metrics of positive scalar curvature, in all dimensions. Our constructions are based on techniques from symplectic geometry.</description>
