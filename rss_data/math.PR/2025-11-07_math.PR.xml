      <title>Random Young diagrams and Jacobi Unitary Ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider random Young diagrams with respect to the measure induced by the decomposition of the $p$-th exterior power of $\mathbb{C}^{n}\otimes \mathbb{C}^{k}$ into irreducible representations of $GL_{n}\times GL_{k}$. We demonstrate that transition probabilities for these diagrams in the limit $n,k,p\to\infty$ with $p\sim nk$ converge to the large $N$ limiting law for the eigenvalues of random matrices in Jacobi Unitary Ensemble. We compute the characters of Young--Jucys--Murphy elements in $\bigwedge^{p}(\mathbb{C}^{n}\otimes\mathbb{C}^{k})$ and discuss their relation to surface counting. We formulate several conjectures on the connection between the correlators in both random ensembles.</description>

      <title>Fluctuations of functions of sparse Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $A$ be the (rescaled) adjacency matrix of the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs $\cal G(N,p)$. For $N^{-1+\tau} \leqslant p\leqslant N^{-\tau}$, we study the fluctuation of $f(A)_{ii}$ on the global and mesoscopic spectral scales. We show that the distribution of $f(A)_{ii}$ is asymptotically the sum of two independent Gaussian random variables on different scales, where a phase transition occurs on the spectral scale $p$.</description>

      <title>Functional central limit theorem for Euler--Maruyama scheme with decreasing step sizes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Euler--Maruyama (EM) scheme of a family of dissipative SDEs, whose step sizes $\eta_{1}\ge\eta_{2}\ge \cdots$ are decreasing, and prove that the EM scheme weakly converges to a subordinated Brownian motion $\{B_{a(t)}\}_{0\le t\le 1}$ rather than $\{B_{t}\}_{0\le t\le 1}$, where $a(t)$ is an increasing function depending on $\{\eta_{k}\}_{k \ge 1}$, for instance, $a(t)=t^{1+\alpha}$ if $\eta_k =k^{-\alpha}$.
  Compared to the EM scheme with constant step size, there are substantial differences as the following:
  (i) the EM time series is inhomogeneous and weakly converges to the ergodic measure in a polynomial speed;
  (ii) we have a special number $T_n =\frac{1}{\eta_1 }+\cdots+\frac{1}{\eta_n }$ which roughly measures the dependence of the EM time series;
  (iii) the normalized number in the CLT is $T_n ^{-1/2}n$ rather than $\sqrt{n}$, in particular, $T_n ^{-1/2}n \propto n^{(1-\beta)/2}$ when $\eta_{k}=1/k^{\beta}$ with $\beta\in(0,1)$;
  (iv) in the critical choice $\eta_{k}=1/k$, we have $T_{n}^{-1/2}n=O(1)$ and thus conjecture that the CLT and FCLT do not hold. This conjecture has been verified by simulations.
  A key distinction arises between the constant and decreasing step size implementations of the EM scheme. Under a constant step size, the time series is homogeneous. This allows one to use a stationary initialization, which automatically eliminates several complex terms in the subsequent proof of the CLT. Conversely, the time series generated by the EM scheme with decreasing step sizes forms an inhomogeneous Markov chain. To manage the analogous difficult terms in this case, that is, when the test function $h$ is Lipschitz, we must instead establish a bound for the Wasserstein-2 distance $W_{2}(\theta_k ,X_{t_k })$. This technique for handling the inhomogeneous case could be of independent interest beyond the current proof.</description>

      <title>The Navier-Stokes equations with transport noise in critical $H^{1/2}$ space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Navier-Stokes equations with transport noise in critical function spaces. Assuming the initial data belongs to $H^{1/2}$ almost surely, we establish the existence and uniqueness of a local-in-time probabilistically strong solution. Moreover, we show that the probability of global existence can be made arbitrarily close to $1$ by choosing the initial data norm sufficiently small, and that the solution norm remains small for all time. Our analysis is independent of the compactness of the spatial domain, and consequently, the results apply both to the three-dimensional torus and to the whole space.</description>

Abstract: We prove a Central Limit Theorem for the drift of a non-elementary random walk with a finite exponential moment on a wreath product $A\wr H=\bigoplus_{H} A\rtimes H$ with $A$ a non-trivial finite group and $H$ a finitely generated acylindrically hyperbolic group. We also provide the upper bounds on the central moments of the drift. Furthermore, our results extend to the case where $A$ is an arbitrary (possibly infinite) finitely generated group.</description>

      <title>A Natural Stochastic SIS Model, Analysis of Moments and Comparison of Different Perturbation Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, a new and natural way of constructing a stochastic Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) model is proposed. This approach is natural in the sense that the disease transmission rate, $\beta$, is substituted with a generic, almost surely non-negative one-dimensional diffusion. The condition $\beta \geq 0$ is essential in the deterministic model but generally overlooked in stochastic counterparts (see [12, 16]). Under different conditions on the parameters, the dynamics of the infected population such as boundedness, extinction, and persistence are identified. The new stochastic model agrees with its deterministic version, where the basic reproduction number $R^D_0$ determines the limiting dynamics: extinction when $R_0^D &lt; 1$ and persistence when $R_0^D &gt; 1$. A novel analytic technique is also provided to approximate the expectation of any well-behaved function of the infected population, including its moments, using an increasing power of correction terms. This is useful since the average dynamics of stochastic SIS models are not tractable due to their nonlinearity. Finally, using the first-order correction terms, two different perturbations with the same expectations: (1.4) performed in [12] and the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) perturbation proposed here are compared in terms of their expected effect on the infected population dynamics. This comparison provides insight into how different small perturbations affect the overall dynamics of the model.</description>

      <title>Deterministic--Distance Couplings of Brownian Motions on Radially Isoparametric Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a unified geometric framework for coadapted Brownian couplings on radially isoparametric manifolds (RIM)--spaces whose geodesic spheres have principal curvatures $\kappa_1(r),\dots,\kappa_{n-1}(r)$ depending only on the geodesic radius $r$. The mean curvature of such a geodesic sphere is denoted by $A(r) = \mathrm{Tr}(S_r) = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \kappa_i(r)$, where $S_r$ is the shape operator of the sphere of radius $r$.
  Within the stochastic two--point It\^{o} formalism, we derive an intrinsic drift--window inequality \[ A(r) - \sum_i |\kappa_i(r)| \;\le\; \rho'(t) \;\le\; A(r) + \sum_i |\kappa_i(r)|, \] governing the deterministic evolution of the inter--particle distance $\rho_t = d(X_t, Y_t)$ under all coadapted couplings. We prove that this bound is both necessary and sufficient for the existence of a coupling realizing any prescribed distance law $\rho(t)$, thereby extending the constant--curvature classification of Pascu--Popescu (2018) to all RIM.
  The endpoints of the drift window correspond to the synchronous and reflection couplings, providing geometric realizations of extremal stochastic drifts. Applications include stationary fixed--distance couplings on compact--type manifolds, linear escape laws on asymptotically hyperbolic spaces, and rigidity of rank--one symmetric geometries saturating the endpoint bounds. This establishes a direct correspondence between radial curvature data and stochastic coupling dynamics, linking Riccati comparison geometry with probabilistic coupling theory.</description>

      <title>Occupation times for superprocesses in random environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X=(X_t, t\geq 0)$ be a superprocess in a random environment governed by a Gaussian noise $W=\{W(t, x),t\geq 0,x\in\mathbb{R}^d\}$ white in time and colored in space with correlation kernel $g$. We consider the occupation time process of the model starting from a finite measure. It is shown that the occupation time process of $X$ is absolutely continuous with respect to Lebesgue measure in $d\leq 3$, whereas it is singular with respect to Lebesgue measure in $d\geq 4$. Regarding the absolutely continuous case in $d\leq 3$, we further prove that the associated density function is jointly H\"older continuous based on the Tanaka formula and moment formulas, and derive the H\"older exponents with respect to the spatial variable $x$ and the time variable $t$.</description>

      <title>Complex analytic proofs of two probabilistic theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we use purely complex analytic techniques to prove two results of the first author which were hitherto given only probabilistic proofs.
  A general form of the Phragm\'en-Lindel\"of principle states that if the $p$\textsuperscript{th} Hardy norm of the conformal map from the disk to a simply connected domain is finite, then an analytic function on that domain is either bounded by its supremum on the boundary or else goes to $\ff$ along some sequence more rapidly than $e^{|z|^{p}}$. We will prove this and discuss a number of special cases.
  We also derive a series expansion for the Green's function of a disk, and show how it leads to an infinite product identity. The celebrated infinite product expansions for sine and cosine are realized as special cases.</description>

      <title>Hidden Convexity in Queueing Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the joint control of arrival and service rates in queueing systems with the objective of minimizing long-run expected cost minus revenue. Although the objective function is non-convex, first-order methods have been empirically observed to converge to globally optimal solutions. This paper provides a theoretical foundation for this empirical phenomenon by characterizing the optimization landscape and identifying a hidden convexity: the problem admits a convex reformulation after an appropriate change of variables. Leveraging this hidden convexity, we establish the Polyak-Lojasiewicz-Kurdyka (PLK) condition for the original control problem, which excludes spurious local minima and ensures global convergence for first-order methods. Our analysis applies to a broad class of $GI/GI/1$ queueing models, including those with Gamma-distributed interarrival and service times. As a key ingredient in the proof, we establish a new convexity property of the expected queue length under a square-root transformation of the traffic intensity.</description>

      <title>Relative entropy estimate and geometric ergodicity for implicit Langevin Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the implicit Langevin Monte Carlo (iLMC) method, which simulates the overdamped Langevin equation via an implicit iteration rule. In many applications, iLMC is favored over other explicit schemes such as the (explicit) Langevin Monte Carlo (LMC). LMC may blow up when the drift field $\nabla U$ is not globally Lipschitz, while iLMC has convergence guarantee when the drift is only one-sided Lipschitz. Starting from an adapted continuous-time interpolation, we prove a time-discretization error bound under the relative entropy (or the Kullback-Leibler divergence), where a crucial gradient estimate for the logarithm numerical density is obtained via a sequence of PDE techniques, including Bernstein method. Based on a reflection-type continuous-discrete coupling method, we prove the geometric ergodicity of iLMC under the Wasserstein-1 distance. Moreover, we extend the error bound to a uniform-in-time one by combining the relative entropy error bound and the ergodicity. Our proof technique is universal and can be applied to other implicit or splitting schemes for simulating stochastic differential equations with non-Lipschitz drifts.</description>

      <title>Finding Planted Cycles in a Random Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of finding a collection of planted cycles in an \ER random graph $G \sim \mathcal{G}(n, \lambda/n)$, in analogy to the famous Planted Clique Problem. When the cycles are planted on a uniformly random subset of $\delta n$ vertices, we show that almost-exact recovery (that is, recovering all but a vanishing fraction of planted-cycle edges as $n \to \infty$) is information-theoretically possible if $\lambda &lt; \frac{1}{(\sqrt{2 \delta} + \sqrt{1-\delta})^2}$ and impossible if $\lambda &gt; \frac{1}{(\sqrt{2 \delta} + \sqrt{1-\delta})^2}$. Moreover, despite the worst-case computational hardness of finding long cycles, we design a polynomial-time algorithm that attains almost exact recovery when $\lambda &lt; \frac{1}{(\sqrt{2 \delta} + \sqrt{1-\delta})^2}$. This stands in stark contrast to the Planted Clique Problem, where a significant computational-statistical gap is widely conjectured.</description>

      <title>Statistics of leaves in growing random trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Leaves, i.e., vertices of degree one, can play a significant role in graph structure, especially in sparsely connected settings in which leaves often constitute the largest fraction of vertices. We consider a leaf-based counterpart of the degree, namely, the leaf degree -- the number of leaves a vertex is connected to -- and the associated leaf degree distribution, analogous to the degree distribution. We determine the leaf degree distribution of random recursive trees (RRTs) and trees grown via a leaf-based preferential attachment mechanism that we introduce. The RRT leaf degree distribution decays factorially, in contrast with its purely geometric degree distribution. In the one-parameter leaf-based growth model, each new vertex attaches to an existing vertex with rate $\ell$ + a, where $\ell$ is the leaf degree of the existing vertex, and a &gt; 0. The leaf degree distribution has a powerlaw tail when 0 &lt; a &lt; 1 and an exponential tail (with algebraic prefactor) for a &gt; 1. The critical case of a = 1 has a leaf degree distribution with stretched exponential tail. We compute a variety of additional characteristics in these models and conjecture asymptotic equivalence of degree and leaf degree powerlaw tail exponent in the scale free regime. We highlight several avenues of possible extension for future studies.</description>

      <title>Mean-field approximations in insurance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The calculation of the insurance liabilities of a cohort of dependent individuals in general requires the solution of a high-dimensional system of coupled linear forward integro-differential equations, which is infeasible for a larger cohort. However, by using a mean-field approximation, the high dimensional system of linear forward equations can be replaced by a low-dimensional system of non-linear forward integro-differential equations. We show that, subject to certain regularity conditions, the insurance liability viewed as a (conditional) expectation of a functional of an underlying jump process converges to its mean-field approximation, as the number of individuals in the cohort goes to infinity. Examples from both life- and non-life insurance illuminate the practical importance of mean-field approximations.</description>

      <title>Signature-Based Universal Bilinear Approximations for Nonlinear Systems and Model Order Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper deals with non-Lipschitz nonlinear systems. Such systems can be approximated by a linear map of so-called signatures, which play a crucial role in the theory of rough paths and can be interpreted as collections of iterated integrals involving the control process. As a consequence, we identify a universal bilinear system, solved by the signature, that can approximate the state or output of the original nonlinear dynamics arbitrarily well. In contrast to other (bi)linearization techniques, the signature approach remains feasible in large-scale settings, as the dimension of the associated bilinear system grows only with the number of inputs. However, the signature model is typically of high order, requiring an optimization process based on model order reduction (MOR). We derive an MOR method for unstable bilinear systems with non-zero initial states and apply it to the signature, yielding a potentially low-dimensional bilinear model. An advantage of our method is that the original nonlinear system need not be known explicitly, since only data are required to learn the linear map of the signature. The subsequent MOR procedure is model-oriented and specifically designed for the signature process. Consequently, this work has two main applications: (1) efficient modeling/data fitting using small-scale bilinear systems, and (2) MOR for nonlinear systems. We illustrate the effectiveness of our approach in the second application through numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Robust mean-field control under common noise uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose and analyze a framework for discrete-time robust mean-field control problems under common noise uncertainty. In this framework, the mean-field interaction describes the collective behavior of infinitely many cooperative agents' state and action, while the common noise -- a random disturbance affecting all agents' state dynamics -- is uncertain. A social planner optimizes over open-loop controls on an infinite horizon to maximize the representative agent's worst-case expected reward, where worst-case corresponds to the most adverse probability measure among all candidates inducing the unknown true law of the common noise process. We refer to this optimization as a robust mean-field control problem under common noise uncertainty. We first show that this problem arises as the asymptotic limit of a cooperative $N$-agent robust optimization problem, commonly known as propagation of chaos. We then prove the existence of an optimal open-loop control by linking the robust mean field control problem to a lifted robust Markov decision problem on the space of probability measures and by establishing the dynamic programming principle and Bellman--Isaac fixed point theorem for the lifted robust Markov decision problem. Finally, we complement our theoretical results with numerical experiments motivated by distribution planning and systemic risk in finance, highlighting the advantages of accounting for common noise uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Knothe-Rosenblatt maps via soft-constrained optimal transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the theory of optimal transport, the Knothe-Rosenblatt (KR) rearrangement provides an explicit construction to map between two probability measures by building one-dimensional transformations from the marginal conditionals of one measure to the other. The KR map has shown to be useful in different realms of mathematics and statistics, from proving functional inequalities to designing methodologies for sampling conditional distributions. It is known that the KR rearrangement can be obtained as the limit of a sequence of optimal transport maps with a weighted quadratic cost. We extend these results in this work by showing that one can obtain the KR map as a limit of maps that solve a relaxation of the weighted-cost optimal transport problem with a soft-constraint for the target distribution. In addition, we show that this procedure also applies to the construction of triangular velocity fields via dynamic optimal transport yielding optimal velocity fields. This justifies various variational methodologies for estimating KR maps in practice by minimizing a divergence between the target and pushforward measure through an approximate map. Moreover, it opens the possibilities for novel static and dynamic OT estimators for KR maps.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a comprehensive probability theory for coherent transport of random waves through arbitrary linear media. The transmissivity distribution for random coherent waves is a fundamental B-spline with knots at the transmission eigenvalues. We analyze the distribution's shape, bounds, moments, and asymptotic behaviors. In the large n limit, the distribution converges to a Gaussian whose mean and variance depend solely on those of the eigenvalues. This result resolves the apparent paradox between bimodal eigenvalue distribution and unimodal transmissivity distribution.</description>

      <title>ODE approximation for the Adam algorithm: General and overparametrized setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Adam optimizer is currently presumably the most popular optimization method in deep learning. In this article we develop an ODE based method to study the Adam optimizer in a fast-slow scaling regime. For fixed momentum parameters and vanishing step-sizes, we show that the Adam algorithm is an asymptotic pseudo-trajectory of the flow of a particular vector field, which is referred to as the Adam vector field. Leveraging properties of asymptotic pseudo-trajectories, we establish convergence results for the Adam algorithm. In particular, in a very general setting we show that if the Adam algorithm converges, then the limit must be a zero of the Adam vector field, rather than a local minimizer or critical point of the objective function.
  In contrast, in the overparametrized empirical risk minimization setting, the Adam algorithm is able to locally find the set of minima. Specifically, we show that in a neighborhood of the global minima, the objective function serves as a Lyapunov function for the flow induced by the Adam vector field. As a consequence, if the Adam algorithm enters a neighborhood of the global minima infinitely often, it converges to the set of global minima.</description>

      <title>Age of Job Completion Minimization with Stable Queues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a time-slotted job-assignment system with a central server, N users and a machine which changes its state according to a Markov chain (hence called a Markov machine). The users submit their jobs to the central server according to a stochastic job arrival process. For each user, the server has a dedicated job queue. Upon receiving a job from a user, the server stores that job in the corresponding queue. When the machine is not working on a job assigned by the server, the machine can be either in internally busy or in free state, and the dynamics of these states follow a binary symmetric Markov chain. Upon sampling the state information of the machine, if the server identifies that the machine is in the free state, it schedules a user and submits a job to the machine from the job queue of the scheduled user. To maximize the number of jobs completed per unit time, we introduce a new metric, referred to as the age of job completion. To minimize the age of job completion and the sampling cost, we propose two policies and numerically evaluate their performance. For both of these policies, we find sufficient conditions under which the job queues will remain stable.</description>

      <title>Joint scaling limit of a bipolar-oriented triangulation and its dual in the peanosphere sense</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.01194</link>
      <description>arXiv:1603.01194v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kenyon, Miller, Sheffield, and Wilson (2015) showed how to encode a random bipolar-oriented planar map by means of a random walk with a certain step size distribution. Using this encoding together with the mating-of-trees construction of Liouville quantum gravity (LQG) due to Duplantier, Miller, and Sheffield (2014), they proved that random bipolar-oriented planar maps converge in the scaling limit to a $\sqrt{4/3}$-LQG surface decorated by an independent SLE$_{12}$ in the peanosphere sense, meaning that the height functions of a particular pair of trees on the maps converge in the scaling limit to the correlated planar Brownian motion which encodes the SLE-decorated LQG surface. We improve this convergence result by proving that the pair of height functions for an infinite-volume random bipolar-oriented triangulation and the pair of height functions for its dual map converge jointly in law in the scaling limit to the two planar Brownian motions which encode the same $\sqrt{4/3}$-LQG surface decorated by both an SLE$_{12}$ curve and the ``dual'' SLE$_{12}$ curve which travels in a direction perpendicular (in the sense of imaginary geometry) to the original curve. This confirms a conjecture of Kenyon, Miller, Sheffield, and Wilson (2015). Our paper is the starting point of recent works connecting LQG and random permutons such as the Baxter permuton.</description>

      <title>A central limit theorem for a generalization of the Ewens measure to random tuples of commuting permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11469v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a central limit theorem (CLT) for the number of joint orbits of random tuples of commuting permutations. In the uniform sampling case this generalizes the classic CLT of Goncharov for the number of cycles of a single random permutation. We also consider the case where tuples are weighted by a factor other than one, per joint orbit. We view this as an analogue of the Ewens measure, for tuples of commuting permutations, where our CLT generalizes the CLT by Hansen. Our proof uses saddle point analysis, in a context related to the Hardy-Ramanujan asymptotics and the theorem of Meinardus, but concerns a multiple pole situation. The proof is written in a self-contained manner, and hopefully in a manner accessible to a wider audience. We also indicate several open directions of further study related to probability, combinatorics, number theory, an elusive theory of random commuting matrices, and perhaps also geometric group theory.</description>

      <title>Spectra of high-dimensional sparse random geometric graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06556v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the spectral properties of the high-dimensional random geometric graph $\mathcal G(n, d, p)$, formed by sampling $n$ i.i.d vectors $\{v_i\}_{i=1}^{n}$ uniformly on a $d$-dimensional unit sphere and connecting each pair $\{i,j\}$ whenever $\langle v_i, v_j \rangle \geq \tau$ so that $p=\mathbb P(\langle v_i,v_j\rangle \geq \tau)$. This model defines a nonlinear random matrix ensemble with dependent entries. We show that if $d =\omega( np\log^{2}(1/p))$ and $np\to\infty$, the limiting spectral distribution of the normalized adjacency matrix $\frac{A}{\sqrt{np(1-p)}}$ is the semicircle law. To our knowledge, this is the first such result for $G(n, d, p)$ in the sparse regime. In the constant sparsity case $p=\alpha/n$, we further show that if $d=\omega(\log^2(n))$ the limiting spectral distribution of $A$ in $G(n,\alpha/n)$ coincides with that of the Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi graph $\mathcal G(n,\alpha/n)$.
  Our approach combines the classical moment method in random matrix theory with a novel recursive decomposition of closed-walk graphs, leveraging block-cut trees and ear decompositions, to control the moments of the empirical spectral distribution. A refined high trace analysis further yields a near-optimal bound on the second eigenvalue when $np=\Omega(\log^4 (n))$, removing technical conditions previously imposed in (Liu et al. 2023). As an application, we demonstrate that this improved eigenvalue bound sharpens the parameter requirements on $d$ and $p$ for spontaneous synchronization on random geometric graphs in (Abdalla et al. 2024) under the homogeneous Kuramoto model.</description>

      <title>Parametric Methods for G-Expectations and G-SDEs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13675v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a systematic study of the parametric representation framework for $G$-expectations, exploring its connections with classical stochastic analysis. We examine the established parametric interpretation of $G$-random variables as families of classical random variables and its value for understanding stochastic systems under model uncertainty.
  Our investigation focuses on the detailed construction of the homomorphism between $G$-expectation spaces and parameterized families, demonstrating how this mapping preserves essential mathematical structures. Notably, this representation naturally incorporates analytical topologies that provide the foundation for applying classical analytical tools to problems in the $G$-expectation framework.
  A key aspect of our work involves identifying and analyzing the consistency conditions required for coherent interpretation of parameterized solutions within the $G$-expectation framework. We further explore how this parametric perspective enables the direct application of classical stochastic analysis techniques, provided appropriate uniform estimates are maintained. Preliminary connections with path-space formulations are also examined, suggesting potential geometric interpretations of the framework.
  This systematic examination of the parametric representation aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of $G$-expectation theory and its relationships with classical probability, while providing insights that may facilitate both theoretical developments and practical applications.</description>

Abstract: We study the Ising model with an external magnetic field on random tetravalent planar maps and investigate its critical behavior. Explicit expressions for spontaneous magnetization and the susceptibility are computed and the critical exponents $\alpha=-1$ (third order phase transition), $\beta=\frac{1}{2}$ (spontaneous magnetization), $\gamma=2$ (susceptibility at zero external magnetic field) and $\delta=5$ (magnetization at critical temperature) are derived. To do so, we study the asymptotic behavior of the partition function of the model in the case of a weak external magnetic field using analytic combinatorics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2106.14870v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The price of a financial derivative can be expressed as an iterated conditional expectation, where the inner term conditions on the future of an auxiliary process. We show that this inner conditional expectation solves an SPDE (a 'conditional Feynman-Kac formula'). The problem requires conditioning on a backward filtration generated by the noise of the auxiliary process and enlarged by its terminal value, leading us to search for a backward Brownian motion here. This adds a source of irregularity to the SPDE which we tackle with new techniques. Lastly, we establish a new class of mixed Monte-Carlo PDE numerical methods.</description>

Abstract: This paper studies the pricing and hedging of derivatives in frictionless and competitive, but incomplete jump-diffusion markets. A unique equivalent martingale measure (EMM) is obtained using filtration reduction to a fictitious complete market. This unique EMM in the fictitious market is uplifted to the original economy using the notion of consistency. For pedagogical purposes, we begin with simple setups and progressively extend to models of increasing generality.</description>

Abstract: The conditional backward sampling particle filter (CBPF) is a powerful Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler for general state space hidden Markov model (HMM) smoothing. It was proposed as an improvement over the conditional particle filter (CPF), which has an $O(T^2)$ complexity under a general `strong' mixing assumption, where $T$ is the time horizon. Empirical evidence of the superiority of the CBPF over the CPF has never been theoretically quantified. We show that the CBPF has $O(T \log T)$ time complexity under strong mixing: its mixing time is upper bounded by $O(\log T)$, for any sufficiently large number of particles $N$ independent of $T$. This $O(\log T)$ mixing time is optimal. To prove our main result, we introduce a novel coupling of two CBPFs, which employs a maximal coupling of two particle systems at each time instant. The coupling is implementable and we use it to construct unbiased, finite variance, estimates of functionals which have arbitrary dependence on the latent state's path, with a total expected cost of $O(T \log T)$. We use this to construct unbiased estimates of the HMM's score function, and also investigate other couplings which can exhibit improved behaviour. We demonstrate our methods on financial and calcium imaging applications.</description>

      <title>Non-asymptotic Estimates for Markov Transition Matrices via Spectral Gap Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05963v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish non-asymptotic error bounds for the classical Maximal Likelihood Estimation of the transition matrix of a given Markov chain. Meanwhile, in the reversible case, we propose a new reversibility-preserving online Symmetric Counting Estimation of the transition matrix with non-asymptotic deviation bounds. Our analysis is based on a convergence study of certain Markov chains on the length-2 path spaces induced by the original Markov chain.</description>

      <title>Canonical Correlation Analysis: review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15625v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For over a century canonical correlations, variables, and related concepts have been studied across various fields, with contributions dating back to Jordan [1875] and Hotelling [1936]. This text surveys the evolution of canonical correlation analysis, a fundamental statistical tool, beginning with its foundational theorems and progressing to recent developments and open research problems. Along the way we introduce and review methods, notions, and fundamental concepts from linear algebra, random matrix theory, and high-dimensional statistics, placing particular emphasis on rigorous mathematical treatment.
  The survey is intended for technically proficient graduate students and other researchers with an interest in this area. The content is organized into five chapters, supplemented by six sets of exercises found in Chapter 6. These exercises introduce additional material, reinforce key concepts, and serve to bridge ideas across chapters. We recommend the following sequence: first, solve Problem Set 0, then proceed with Chapter 1, solve Problem Set 1, and so on through the text.</description>

      <title>Assessing Risk Heterogeneity through Heavy-Tailed Frequency and Severity Mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04795v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The analysis of risk typically involves dividing a random damage-generation process into separate frequency (event-count) and severity (damage-magnitude) components. In the present article, we construct canonical families of mixture distributions for each of these components, based on a Negative Binomial kernel for frequencies and a Gamma kernel for severities. These mixtures are employed to assess the heterogeneity of risk factors underlying an empirical distribution through the shape of the implied mixing distribution. From the duality of the Negative Binomial and Gamma distributions, we first derive necessary and sufficient conditions for heavy-tailed (i.e., inverse power-law) canonical mixtures. We then formulate flexible 4-parameter families of mixing distributions for Geometric and Exponential kernels to generate heavy-tailed 4-parameter mixture models, and extend these mixtures to arbitrary Negative Binomial and Gamma kernels, respectively, yielding 5-parameter mixtures for detecting and measuring risk heterogeneity. To check the robustness of such heterogeneity inferences, we show how a fitted 5-parameter model may be re-expressed in terms of alternative Negative Binomial or Gamma kernels whose associated mixing distributions form a "calibrated" family.</description>

      <title>Explicit Density Approximation for Neural Implicit Samplers Using a Bernstein-Based Convex Divergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04700v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rank-based statistical metrics, such as the invariant statistical loss (ISL), have recently emerged as robust and practically effective tools for training implicit generative models. In this work, we introduce dual-ISL, a novel likelihood-free objective for training implicit generative models that interchanges the roles of the target and model distributions in the ISL framework, yielding a convex optimization problem in the space of model densities. We prove that the resulting rank-based discrepancy $d_K$ is i) continuous under weak convergence and with respect to the $L^1$ norm, and ii) convex in its first argument-properties not shared by classical divergences such as KL or Wasserstein distances. Building on this, we develop a theoretical framework that interprets $d_K$ as an $L^2$-projection of the density ratio $q = p/\tilde p$ onto a Bernstein polynomial basis, from which we derive exact bounds on the truncation error, precise convergence rates, and a closed-form expression for the truncated density approximation. We further extend our analysis to the multivariate setting via random one-dimensional projections, defining a sliced dual-ISL divergence that retains both convexity and continuity. We empirically show that these theoretical advantages translate into practical ones. Specifically, across several benchmarks dual-ISL converges more rapidly, delivers markedly smoother and more stable training, and more effectively prevents mode collapse than classical ISL and other leading implicit generative methods-while also providing an explicit density approximation.</description>

      <title>On zeros and algorithms for disordered systems: mean-field spin glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15616v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spin glasses are fundamental probability distributions at the core of statistical physics, the theory of average-case computational complexity, and modern high-dimensional statistical inference. In the mean-field setting, we design deterministic quasipolynomial-time algorithms for estimating the partition function to arbitrarily high accuracy for all inverse temperatures in the second moment regime. In particular, for the Sherrington--Kirkpatrick model, our algorithms succeed for the entire replica-symmetric phase. To achieve this, we study the locations of the zeros of the partition function. Notably, our methods are conceptually simple, and apply equally well to the spherical case and the case of Ising spins.</description>

      <title>Wasserstein convergence rates in the invariance principle for nonuniformly hyperbolic flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07657v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We obtain $q$-Wasserstein convergence rates in the invariance principle for nonuniformly hyperbolic flows, where $q\ge1$ depends on the degree of nonuniformity. Utilizing a martingale-coboundary decomposition for nonuniformly expanding semiflows, we extend techniques from the discrete-time setting to the continuous-time case. Our results apply to uniformly hyperbolic (Axiom A) flows, nonuniformly hyperbolic flows that can be modelled by suspensions over Young towers with exponential tails (such as dispersing billiard flows and the classical Lorenz attractor), and intermittent solenoidal flows.</description>

      <title>Products of Infinite Countable Groups Have Fixed Price One</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08325v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the product of any two infinite countable groups has fixed price one. This resolves a problem posed by Gaboriau. The proof uses the propagation method to construct a Poisson horoball process as a weak limit of a sequence of factors of i.i.d. An essential tool for avoiding any growth conditions is the convergence in the sense of point processes of closed pointed subsets, which is a notion from stochastic geometry. Then, a graphing of the horoball process is constructed with arbitrarily small expected degree, by connecting the points of each horoball first, and then adding a percolation with small intensity. The connectedness of this graphing is ensured by proving that the resulting horoballs have the infinite touching property almost surely, if the metric and the other parameters of the construction are chosen carefully. Direct simple proofs are given that do not rely on sophisticated results like amenability and double-recurrence, which are used in related works. Also, to manage the overlapping of the horoballs, a generalization of the induction lemma is presented for random multisets of a group.</description>

      <title>A non-exchangeable mean field control problem with controlled interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00288v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces and analyzes a new class of mean-field control (\textsc{MFC}) problems in which agents interact through a \emph{fixed but controllable} network structure. In contrast with the classical \textsc{MFC} framework -- where agents are exchangeable and interact only through symmetric empirical distributions -- we consider systems with heterogeneous and possibly asymmetric interaction patterns encoded by a structural kernel, typically of graphon type. A key novelty of our approach is that this interaction structure is no longer static: it becomes a genuine \emph{control variable}. The planner therefore optimizes simultaneously two distinct components: a \emph{regular control}, which governs the local dynamics of individual agents, and an \emph{interaction control}, which shapes the way agents connect and influence each other through the fixed structural kernel.
  \medskip We develop a generalized notion of relaxed (randomized) control adapted to this setting, prove its equivalence with the strong formulation, and establish existence, compactness, and continuity results for the associated value function under minimal regularity assumptions. Moreover, we show that the finite $n$-agent control problems with general (possibly asymmetric) interaction matrices converge to the mean-field limit when the corresponding fixed step-kernels converge in cut-norm, with asymptotic consistency of the optimal values and control strategies. Our results provide a rigorous framework in which the \emph{interaction structure itself is viewed and optimized as a control object}, thereby extending mean-field control theory to non-exchangeable populations and controlled network interactions.</description>

      <title>Arithmetic Properties of Several Generalized-Constant Sequences, with Implications for ${\Gamma^{\left(n\right)}\left(1\right)}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01849v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neither the Euler-Mascheroni constant, $\gamma = 0.577215...$, nor the Euler-Gompertz constant, $\delta = 0.596347...$, is currently known to be irrational. However, it has been proved that at least one of them is transcendental. The two constants are related by a well-known equation of Hardy, equivalent to $\gamma + \delta/e = \mathrm{Ein}(1)$, which recently has been generalized to $\gamma^{(n)} + \delta^{(n)}/e = \eta^{(n)}$; $n \ge 0$ for sequences of constants $\gamma^{(n)}$, $\delta^{(n)}$, and $\eta^{(n)}$ (given respectively by full, conditional, and partial moments of the Gumbel(0,1) probability distribution). We first investigate the $\gamma^{(n)}$ through recurrence relations, revealing that at least one of the pair {$\gamma,\gamma^{(2)}$} and at least two of the set {$\gamma,\gamma^{(n)},\gamma^{(n+1)},\ldots,\gamma^{(2n)}$} (for all $n \ge 2$) are transcendental. This result implies $\Gamma^{(n)}(1)$ is transcendental infinitely often for $n \ge 1$. We then show, via a theorem of Shidlovskii, that the $\eta^{(n)}$ are algebraically independent (and therefore transcendental) for all $n \ge 0$, implying further that at least one of each pair, {$\gamma^{(n)},\delta^{(n)}/e$} and {$\gamma^{(n)},\delta^{(n)}$}, and at least two of the triple {$\gamma^{(n)},\delta^{(n)}/e,\delta^{(n)}$}, are transcendental for all $n \ge 1$. Finally, we provide parallel results for the sequences $\tilde{\delta}^{(n)}$ and $\tilde{\eta}^{(n)}$ satisfying the "non-alternating analogue" equation $\gamma^{(n)} + \tilde{\delta}^{(n)}/e = \tilde{\eta}^{(n)}$.</description>
