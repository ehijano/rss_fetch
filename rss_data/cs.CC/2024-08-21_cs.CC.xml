      <title>Revisiting Tree Canonization using polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Isomorphism (GI) is a fundamental algorithmic problem. Amongst graph classes for which the computational complexity of GI has been resolved, trees are arguably the most fundamental. Tree Isomorphism is complete for deterministic logspace, a tiny subclass of polynomial time, by Lindell's result. Over three decades ago, he devised a deterministic logspace algorithm that computes a string which is a canon for the input tree -- two trees are isomorphic precisely when their canons are identical. Inspired by Miller-Reif's reduction of Tree Isomorphism to Polynomial Identity Testing, we present a new logspace algorithm for tree canonization fundamentally different from Lindell's algorithm. Our algorithm computes a univariate polynomial as canon for an input tree, based on the classical Eisenstein's criterion for the irreducibility of univariate polynomials. This can be implemented in logspace by invoking the well known Buss et al. algorithm for arithmetic formula evaluation. This algorithm is conceptually very simple, avoiding the delicate case analysis and complex recursion that constitute the core of Lindell's algorithm. We illustrate the adaptability of our algorithm by extending it to a couple of other classes of graphs.</description>

      <title>Rejection in Abstract Argumentation: Harder Than Acceptance?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Abstract argumentation is a popular toolkit for modeling, evaluating, and comparing arguments. Relationships between arguments are specified in argumentation frameworks (AFs), and conditions are placed on sets (extensions) of arguments that allow AFs to be evaluated. For more expressiveness, AFs are augmented with \emph{acceptance conditions} on directly interacting arguments or a constraint on the admissible sets of arguments, resulting in dialectic frameworks or constrained argumentation frameworks. In this paper, we consider flexible conditions for \emph{rejecting} an argument from an extension, which we call rejection conditions (RCs). On the technical level, we associate each argument with a specific logic program. We analyze the resulting complexity, including the structural parameter treewidth. Rejection AFs are highly expressive, giving rise to natural problems on higher levels of the polynomial hierarchy.</description>

      <title>A Wild Sheep Chase Through an Orchard</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Orchards are a biologically relevant class of phylogenetic networks as they can describe treelike evolutionary histories augmented with horizontal transfer events. Moreover, the class has attractive mathematical characterizations that can be exploited algorithmically. On the other hand, undirected orchard networks have hardly been studied yet. Here, we prove that deciding whether an undirected, binary phylogenetic network is an orchard -- or equivalently, whether it has an orientation that makes it a rooted orchard -- is NP-hard. For this, we introduce a new characterization of undirected orchards which could be useful for proving positive results.</description>

      <title>Multiwinner Temporal Voting with Aversion to Change</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study two-stage committee elections where voters have dynamic preferences over candidates; at each stage, a committee is chosen under a given voting rule. We are interested in identifying a winning committee for the second stage that overlaps as much as possible with the first-stage committee. We show a full complexity dichotomy for the class of Thiele rules: this problem is tractable for Approval Voting (AV) and hard for all other Thiele rules (including, in particular, Proportional Approval Voting and the Chamberlin-Courant rule). We extend this dichotomy to the greedy variants of Thiele rules. We also explore this problem from a parameterized complexity perspective for several natural parameters. We complement the theory with experimental analysis: e.g., we investigate the average number of changes in the committee as a function of changes in voters' preferences and the role of ties.</description>

      <title>Approval-Based Committee Voting under Incomplete Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.14847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2103.14847v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate approval-based committee voting with incomplete information about the approval preferences of voters. We consider several models of incompleteness where each voter partitions the set of candidates into approved, disapproved, and unknown candidates, possibly with ordinal preference constraints among candidates in the latter category. This captures scenarios where voters have not evaluated all candidates and/or it is unknown where voters draw the threshold between approved and disapproved candidates. We study the complexity of some fundamental computational problems for a number of classic approval-based committee voting rules including Proportional Approval Voting and Chamberlin-Courant. These problems include determining whether a given set of candidates is a possible or necessary winning committee and whether a given candidate is possibly or necessarily a member of the winning committee. We also consider proportional representation axioms and the problem of deciding whether a given committee is possibly or necessarily representative.</description>

      <title>Almost Tight Approximation Hardness for Single-Source Directed k-Edge-Connectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.13088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.13088v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the $k$-connected directed Steiner tree problem ($k$-DST), we are given an $n$-vertex directed graph $G=(V,E)$ with edge costs, a connectivity requirement $k$, a root $r\in V$ and a set of terminals $T\subseteq V$. The goal is to find a minimum-cost subgraph $H\subseteq G$ that has $k$ internally disjoint paths from the root vertex $r$ to every terminal $t\in T$.
  In this paper, we show the approximation hardness of $k$-DST for various parameters, which thus close some long-standing open problems.
  - $\Omega\left(|T|/\log |T|\right)$-approximation hardness, which holds under the standard assumption $\mathrm{NP}\neq \mathrm{ZPP}$. The inapproximability ratio is tightened to $\Omega\left(|T|\right)$ under the Strongish Planted Clique Hypothesis [Manurangsi, Rubinstein and Schramm, ITCS 2021].
  The latter hardness result matches the approximation ratio of $|T|$ obtained by a trivial approximation algorithm, thus closing the long-standing open problem.
  - $\Omega\left(\sqrt{2}^k / k\right)$-approximation hardness for the general case of $k$-DST under the assumption $\mathrm{NP}\neq\mathrm{ZPP}$. This is the first hardness result known for survivable network design problems with an inapproximability ratio exponential in $k$.
  - $\Omega\left((k/L)^{L/4}\right)$-approximation hardness for $k$-DST on $L$-layered graphs for $L\le O\left(\log n\right)$. This almost matches the approximation ratio of $O(k^{L-1}\cdot L \cdot \log |T|)$ achieving in $O\left(n^L\right)$-time due to Laekhanukit [ICALP`16].</description>

      <title>Spatial Voting with Incomplete Voter Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.08929v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider spatial voting where candidates are located in the Euclidean $d$-dimensional space, and each voter ranks candidates based on their distance from the voter's ideal point. We explore the case where information about the location of voters' ideal points is incomplete: for each dimension, we are given an interval of possible values. We study the computational complexity of finding the possible and necessary winners for positional scoring rules. Our results show that we retain tractable cases of the classic model where voters have partial-order preferences. Moreover, we show that there are positional scoring rules under which the possible-winner problem is intractable for partial orders, but tractable in the one-dimensional spatial setting. We also consider approval voting in this setting. We show that for up to two dimensions, the necessary-winner problem is tractable, while the possible-winner problem is hard for any number of dimensions.</description>

      <title>On the Number of Quantifiers Needed to Define Boolean Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00688v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The number of quantifiers needed to express first-order (FO) properties is captured by two-player combinatorial games called multi-structural games. We analyze these games on binary strings with an ordering relation, using a technique we call parallel play, which significantly reduces the number of quantifiers needed in many cases. Ordered structures such as strings have historically been notoriously difficult to analyze in the context of these and similar games. Nevertheless, in this paper, we provide essentially tight upper bounds on the number of quantifiers needed to characterize different-sized subsets of strings. The results immediately give bounds on the number of quantifiers necessary to define several different classes of Boolean functions. One of our results is analogous to Lupanov's upper bounds on circuit size and formula size in propositional logic: we show that every Boolean function on $n$-bit inputs can be defined by a FO sentence having $(1 + \varepsilon)n\log(n) + O(1)$ quantifiers, and that this is essentially tight. We reduce this number to $(1 + \varepsilon)\log(n) + O(1)$ when the Boolean function in question is sparse.</description>

      <title>Character Complexity: A Novel Measure for Quantum Circuit Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09641v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of quantum computing, quantifying circuit complexity remains a critical challenge. This paper introduces Character Complexity, a novel measure that bridges Group-theoretic concepts with practical quantum computing concerns. By leveraging tools from representation theory, I prove several key properties of character complexity and establish a surprising connection to the classical simulability of quantum circuits. This new measure offers a fresh perspective on the complexity landscape of quantum algorithms, potentially reshaping our understanding of quantum-classical computational boundaries. I present innovative visualization methods for character complexity, providing intuitive insights into the structure of quantum circuits. The empirical results reveal intriguing scaling behaviors with respect to qubit and gate counts, opening new avenues for quantum algorithm design and optimization. This work not only contributes to the theoretical foundations of quantum complexity but also offers practical tools for the quantum computing community. As quantum hardware continues to advance, character complexity could play a crucial role in developing more efficient quantum algorithms and in exploring the fundamental limits of quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Topics in Algebra of Synchronous Games, Algebraic Graph Identities and Quantum NP-hardness Reductions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10114v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We review the correspondence between a synchronous game and its associated game algebra. We slightly develop the work of Helton et al.[HMPS17] by proposing results on algebraic and locally commuting graph identities. Based on the theoretical works on noncommutative Nullstellens\"atze [BWHK23], we build computational tools involving Gr\"obner basis method and semidefinite programming to check the existence of perfect strategies with specific models. We prove the equivalence between the hereditary and $C^*$ models proposed in [HMPS17]. We also extend Ji's reduction $\texttt{3-Coloring}^* \leq_p \texttt{3-SAT}^*$ [Ji13] and exhibit another instance of quantum-version NP-hardness reduction $\texttt{Clique}^* \leq_p \texttt{3-SAT}^*$.</description>
