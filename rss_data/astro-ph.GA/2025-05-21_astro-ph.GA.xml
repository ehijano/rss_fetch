      <title>Formation and evolution of boxy/peanut bulges in the Auriga cosmological simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Boxy/peanut (b/p) or X-shaped bulges have been extensively explored with theory and numerical simulations of isolated galaxies. However, it is only recently that advances in hydrodynamical cosmological simulations have made it possible to explore b/p bulges in a cosmological setting, with much remaining to be understood about their formation and evolution. By using the Auriga magneto-hydrodynamical cosmological zoom-in simulations, we characterise the structural parameters of b/p bulges and how they form and evolve throughout cosmic history. We develop a method for estimating the b/p strength that allows us to identify the formation time and size of these structures. We find that b/p bulges in Auriga form between $\sim 1.1-1.6\, \mathrm Gyr$ after bar formation, following a `buckling' episode; some galaxies undergo multiple bucklings and events of b/p growth, with some b/p structures `dissolving' between buckling events. We find that at $z=0$, the b/p bulges have an extent of almost half the bar length. Finally, we analyse the evolution of the b/p fraction over redshift, finding that at $z=0$, two thirds of galaxies host a bar, and of these, $45$ per cent have a b/p. This b/p fraction is within the observed range at $z=0$, although on the low end as compared to some observational studies. The b/p fraction decreases to $20$ per cent at $z=0.5$, and falls to zero at $z \sim 1$; this is in line with the observed trend of declining b/p fraction with redshift. We discuss possible culprits for the apparent mismatch in b/p occurrence between observations and cosmological simulations, what causes them to form (or not) in these simulations, and what this might reveal about models of galaxy formation and evolution.</description>

      <title>The High-redshift Blazar MG3 J163554+3629: Physical Properties and the Enigma of Its Unexpected Supermassive Black Hole Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is general consensus that active galactic nuclei (AGNs) derive their radiating power from a supermassive black hole (SMBH) that accretes matter. Yet, their precise powering mechanisms and the resulting growth of the SMBH are poorly understood, especially for AGNs at high redshift. Blazars are AGNs pointing their jet toward the observer, thus being detectable from radio through gamma rays at high redshift due to Doppler boosting. The blazar MG3 J163554+3629 is located at redshift z=3.65 and it is a flat spectrum radio quasar (FSRQ). In this work, we show the results of the modeling of its spectral energy distribution (SED) from radio to gamma rays with a one-zone leptonic model. We estimate the uncertainties through a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach. As a result, we infer the black hole mass M_BH = 1.1(+0.2,-0.1) x 10^9 Msun and a modest magnetic field of B = 6.56(+0.13,-0.09) x 10^-2 G in line with the Compton dominance observed in high-redshift FSRQs. The emitting region is outside the broad line region but within the region of the dust torus radius. The rather small accretion efficiency of eta=0.083 is not solely inferred through the SED modeling but also through the energetics. An evolution study suggests that in an Eddington-limited accretion process the SMBH did not have time enough to grow from an initial seed mass of ~10^6 Msun at z~30 into a mass of M_BH ~ 10^9 Msun at z=3.65. Faster mass growth might be obtained in a super-Eddington process throughout frequent episodes. Alternative scenarios propose that the existence of the jet itself can facilitate a more rapid growth.</description>

      <title>Revealing the intricacies of radio galaxies and filaments in the merging galaxy cluster Abell 2255. I. Insights from deep LOFAR-VLBI sub-arcsecond resolution images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High sensitivity of modern interferometers is revealing a plethora of filaments surrounding radio galaxies, especially in galaxy cluster environments. The morphology and spectral characteristics of these thin structures require the combination of high-resolution and low frequency observations, which is best obtained using the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR) international stations. In this paper, we aim to detect and characterize non-thermal filaments observed close or as part of the radio galaxies in Abell 2255 using deep, LOFAR-VLBI observations at 144 MHz. These structures can be used to disentangle possible scenarios for the origin of the non-thermal filaments and connection to the motion of the host galaxy within the dense and turbulent intracluster medium (ICM), and consequent interaction between the ICM and radio jets. Combining multiple observations, we produced the deepest images ever obtained with LOFAR-VLBI targeting a galaxy cluster, using 56 hours of observations, reaching $0.3-0.5"$ resolution. We detailed throughout the paper the calibration and imaging strategy for the different targets, as well as the multitude of morphological features discovered. Thanks to the high-sensitivity of LOFAR-VLBI, we revealed unprecedented details for the main cluster radio galaxies, recovering in most cases also their more extended structure observed only at such low frequencies. In particular, we focused on the Original Tailed Radio Galaxy (Original TRG) where we distinguished many filaments constituting its tail with varying lengths ($80-110$ kpc) and widths ($3-10$ kpc). The final radio images showcase the potential of deep, high-resolution observations for galaxy clusters. With such approach, we enabled the study of these thin, elongated radio filaments: after being discovered, these filaments now require spectral studies to determine their formation mechanisms.</description>

      <title>FAUST XXIV. Large dust grains in the protostellar outflow cavity walls of the Class I binary L1551 IRS5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planet formation around young stars requires the growth of interstellar dust grains from mm-sized particles to km-sized planetesimals. Numerical simulations have shown that large ($\sim$mm-sized) grains found in the inner envelope of young protostars could be lifted from the disc via winds. However we are still lacking unambiguous evidence for large grains in protostellar winds/outflows. We investigate dust continuum emission in the envelope of the Class I binary L1551 IRS5 in the Taurus molecular cloud, aiming to identify observational signatures of grain growth, such as variations in the dust emissivity index ($\beta_{\rm mm}$). In this context, we present new, high-angular resolution (50 au), observations of thermal dust continuum emission at 1.3 mm and 3 mm in the envelope ($\sim$3000 au) of L1551 IRS5 , obtained as part of the ALMA-FAUST Large Program. We analyse dust emission along the cavity walls of the CO outflow, extended up to $\sim$1800 au. We find an H$_2$ volume density $&gt;2\times10^5$ cm$^{-3}$, a dust mass of $\sim$58 M$_\oplus$, and $\beta_{\rm mm}$&lt;1, implying the presence of grains $\sim$10$^3$ times larger than the typical ISM sizes. We provide the first spatially resolved observational evidence of large grains within an outflow cavity wall. Our results suggest that these grains have been transported from the inner disc to the envelope by protostellar winds and may subsequently fall back into the outer disc by gravity and/or via accretion streamers. This cycle provides longer time for grains to grow, playing a crucial role in the formation of planetesimals.</description>

      <title>Constraining cosmic ray transport models using circumgalactic medium properties and observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic rays (CRs) are a pivotal non-thermal component of galaxy formation and evolution. However, the intricacies of CR physics, particularly how they propagate in the circumgalactic medium (CGM), remain largely unconstrained. In this work, we study CGM properties in FIRE-2 (Feedback In Realistic Environments) simulations of the same Milky Way (MW)-mass halo at $z=0$ with different CR transport models that produce similar diffuse $\sim$ GeV $\gamma$-ray emission. We study the gas morphology and thermal properties, and generate synthetic observations of rest-frame UV ion absorption columns and X-ray emission. CRs lower galaxy masses and star formation rates (SFRs) while supporting more cool CGM gas, which boosts the HI and OVI column densities in the CGM, bringing simulations more in line with observations, but there can be large differences between CR transport models and resolution levels. X-ray emission within and close to galaxies is consistent with thermal (free-free and metal-line) emission plus X-ray binaries, while more extended ($\sim 100\,$kpc) CGM emission is potentially dominated by inverse Compton (IC) scattering, motivating future work on the spatially resolved X-ray profiles. Although comparisons with observations are sensitive to sample selection and mimicking the details of observations, and our analysis did not result in strong constraints on CR models, the differences between simulations are significant and could be used as a framework for future studies.</description>

      <title>Deep galaxy stellar mass functions as a function of star formation rate in the Virgo cluster environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze deep ($M_*\gtrsim10^7~{M}_{\odot}$) galaxy stellar mass functions (SMFs) of the Virgo cluster using stellar masses derived as part of the Next Generation Virgo Survey (NGVS). The total SMF has a slope of $\alpha=-1.35^{+0.02}_{-0.02}$ which is similar to or steeper than typical field values. Using deep \ha{} data from the Virgo Environmental Survey Tracing Ionised Gas Emission (VESTIGE) we separate out star-forming galaxies, quiescent galaxies with no ongoing star formation, and low-SFR galaxies that are intermediate between these two populations. For each of these populations, the shape of the SMF is found to be universal throughout the cluster, from the core to the outskirts. The star-forming and quiescent SMFs show stark differences with values seen in field galaxies. The relative fraction of quiescent galaxies is highest in the core of the cluster, with low-SFR and star-forming galaxies more significant in the outer regions of the cluster. At low stellar masses ($M_*\lesssim10^9~{M}_{\odot}$), the quiescent fraction in the main cluster is significantly higher than that of the field and even satellites of massive groups. At high stellar masses, the quiescent fraction is similar to other studies of cluster galaxies. We model the quiescent population in the infall region of the cluster as a combination of backsplash and field quiescent galaxies, and find that the backsplash fractions needed to explain the observed population are unrealistically high. This suggests the existence of a third population of low-mass galaxies that are pre-processed outside the virial radius of the cluster, possibly in groups prior to infall.</description>

      <title>Large databases of metal-poor stars corrected for three-dimensional and/or non-local thermodynamic equilibrium effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Early chemical enrichment processes can be revealed by the careful study of metal-poor stars. In our Local Group, we can obtain spectra of individual stars to measure their precise, but not always accurate, chemical abundances. Unfortunately, stellar abundances are typically estimated under the simplistic assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE). This can systematically alter both the abundance patterns of individual stars and global trends of chemical enrichment. The SAGA database compiles the largest catalogue of metal-poor stars in the Milky Way. For the first time, we provide the community with the SAGA catalogue fully corrected for non-LTE (NLTE) effects, using state-of-the-art publicly available grids. In addition, we present an easy-to-use online tool NLiTE that quickly provides NLTE corrections for large stellar samples. For further scientific exploration, NLiTE facilitates the comparison of different NLTE grids to investigate their intrinsic uncertainties. Finally, we compare the NLTE-SAGA catalogue with our cosmological galaxy formation and chemical evolution model, NEFERTITI. By accounting for NLTE effects, we can solve the long-standing discrepancy between models and observations in the abundance ratio of [C/Fe], the best tracer of the first stellar populations. At low [Fe/H]&lt;-3.5, models are unable to reproduce the high measured [C/Fe] in LTE, which are lowered in NLTE, aligning with simulations. Other elements are a mixed bag: some show improved agreement with models (e.g. Na) and others worse (e.g. Co). Few elemental ratios do not change significantly (e.g. [Mg/Fe], [Ca/Fe]). Properly accounting for NLTE effects is fundamental for interpreting the chemical abundances of metal-poor stars. Our NLiTE tool thus enables a meaningful comparison of stellar samples with stellar and chemical evolution models and low-metallicity gaseous environments at higher redshift.</description>

      <title>INSPIRE: INvestigating Stellar Populations In RElics. IX. KiDS J0842+0059: the first fully confirmed relic beyond the local Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relics are massive, compact and quiescent galaxies that assembled the majority of their stars in the early Universe and lived untouched until today, completely missing any subsequent size-growth caused by mergers and interactions. They provide the unique opportunity to put constraints on the first phase of mass assembly in the Universe with the ease of being nearby. While only a few relics have been found in the local Universe, the {\tt INSPIRE} project has confirmed 38 relics at higher redshifts ($z \sim 0.2-0.4$), fully characterising their integrated kinematics and stellar populations. However, given the very small sizes of these objects and the limitations imposed by the atmosphere, structural parameters inferred from ground-based optical imaging are possibly affected by systematic effects that are difficult to quantify. In this paper, we present the first high-resolution image obtained with Adaptive Optics Ks-band observations on SOUL-LUCI@LBT of one of the most extreme {\tt INSPIRE} relics, KiDS~J0842+0059 at $z \sim 0.3$. We confirm the disky morphology of this galaxy (axis ratio of $0.24$) and its compact nature (circularized effective radius of $\sim 1$ kpc) by modelling its 2D surface brightness profile with a PSF-convolved S\'ersic model. We demonstrate that the surface mass density profile of KiDS~J0842+0059 closely resembles that of the most extreme local relic, NGC~1277, as well as of high-redshift red nuggets. We unambiguously conclude that this object is a remnant of a high-redshift compact and massive galaxy, which assembled all of its mass at $z&gt;2$, and completely missed the merger phase of the galaxy evolution.</description>

      <title>SALT spectroscopic follow-up of the G4Jy Sample</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The GLEAM 4-Jy (G4Jy) Sample is a thorough compilation of the 'brightest' radio sources in the southern sky (Declination &lt; 30 deg), as measured at 151 MHz (S &gt; 4.0 Jy) with the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA), through the GaLactic and Extragalactic All-sky MWA (GLEAM) Survey. In addition to flux-density measurements, the G4Jy catalogue provides host-galaxy identifications (through careful visual-inspection) and four sets of spectral indices. Despite their brightness in the radio, many of these sources are poorly-studied, with the vast majority lacking a spectroscopic redshift in published work. This is crucial for studying the intrinsic properties of the sources, and so we conduct a multi-semester observing campaign on the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT), with optical spectroscopy enabling us to provide new redshifts to the astronomical community. Initial results show that not all of the host galaxies exhibit emission-line spectra in the optical (~4500-7500 Ang), which illustrates the importance of radio-frequency selection (rather than optical selection) for creating an unbiased sample of active galactic nuclei. By combining SALT redshifts with those from the 6-degree Field Galaxy Survey (6dFGS) and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), we calculate radio luminosities and linear sizes for 299 G4Jy sources (which includes one newly-discovered giant radio-galaxy, G4Jy 604). Furthermore, with the highest redshift acquired (so far) being z ~ 2.2 from SDSS, we look forward to evolution studies of this complete sample, as well as breaking degeneracies in radio properties with respect to, for example, the galaxy environment.</description>

      <title>UGC 10043 in Depth: Dissecting the Polar Bulge and Subtle LSB Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxies with polar structures -- of which polar-ring galaxies (PRGs) are a prominent subclass -- contain components that are kinematically decoupled and highly inclined relative to the host galaxy's major axis. Modern deep optical surveys provide a powerful means of detecting low surface brightness (LSB) features around galaxies, offering critical insights into the formation and evolution of galaxies with polar structures. UGC 10043 is an edge-on galaxy notable for its prominent bulge, which extends orthogonally to the disk plane. In addition, the galaxy displays a well-defined integral-shaped disk warp and multiple dust features crossing the bulge along the minor galaxy axis. In this work, we present new deep optical photometry of UGC 10043 down to 29.5 mag arcsec$^{-2}$ and perform a detailed analysis of its LSB and polar structures. The observations reveal a stellar stream aligned along the polar axis, alongside other signatures of tidal interaction, including a flat, tilted LSB envelope that extends toward the neighboring galaxy MCG +04-37-035, with which UGC 10043 is connected by an HI bridge. Our results suggest that the polar component of UGC 10043 comprises and older, triaxial polar bulge and a younger, forming polar structure, likely originating from the ongoing disruption of a dwarf satellite galaxy, while also participating in active interaction with MCG +04-37-035.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Electron Density Profile in Nearby Galaxies using SDSS MaNGA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most observational studies of galactic-scale magnetic fields using Faraday rotation rely on estimates of thermal electron densities in galaxies and their radial variations. However, the spatial distribution of electrons in the interstellar medium (ISM) is not clearly known. In this study, we propose and utilize collision-excited doublet emission line ratios of [S\,\textsc{ii}] $\lambda\lambda$ 6716, 6731 \AA~and [O\,\textsc{ii}] $\lambda\lambda$ 3726, 3729 \AA \ to estimate the electron densities ($n_e$). To map their distribution in the galaxies, we employ Integral Field Unit (IFU) spectroscopic observations from the SDSS Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA) survey, utilising data products from both the \texttt{Pipe3D} and MaNGA Data Analysis Pipeline (DAP). We present a spatially resolved analysis of $13$ face-on galaxies (inclination, $i \leq 10^\circ$), including $9$ star-forming galaxies (SFGs) and $4$ Non-SFGs. Azimuthally averaged radial profiles of $n_e$ are obtained using two different binning schemes: linear and non-linear. For the \texttt{Pipe3D} case, both SFGs and non-SFGs exhibit $n_e$ gradients, with higher densities of $n_e$(S\,\textsc{ii}) = $165.6 \pm 20.8$ cm$^{-3}$ in the inner disk region (r/R$_e$ $\leq$ 1.5), which decrease to $31 \pm 4.5$ cm$^{-3}$ in the outer disk region (r/R$_e$ $&gt;$ 1.5). We also translate $n_e$ to the electron column density $N_e$ assuming an evenly distributed thin disk profile, fairly excluding the central bulge regions. These electron density estimates at different radii provide valuable insights for resolving ambiguities in current and future studies of magnetic fields in galaxies.</description>

      <title>CHANG-ES: XXXVI. The thin and thick radio discs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Edge-on spiral galaxies give us an outsiders' view of the radio halo, which envelops these galaxies. The radio halos are caused by extra-planar cosmic-ray electrons that emit synchrotron emission in magnetic fields. Aims. We aim to study the origin of radio halos around galaxies and infer the role of cosmic-rays in supporting the gaseous discs. We would like to test the influence of star formation as the main source of cosmic rays as well as other fundamental galaxy properties such as mass and size. Methods. We present a study of radio continuum scale heights in 22 nearby edge-on galaxies from the CHANG-ES survey. We employ deep observations with the Jansky Very Large Array in the S-band (2-4 GHz), imaging at 7" angular resolution. We measure scale heights in three strips within the effective radio continuum radius, correcting for the influence of angular resolution and inclination angle. We include only galaxies where a distinction between the two disc components can be made in at least one of the strips, providing us with robust measurements of both scale heights. Results. We find a strong positive correlation between scale heights of the thin and thick discs and star-forming radius as well as star-formation rate (SFR); moderately strong correlations are found for the mass surface density and the ratio of SFR-to-mass surface density; no correlation is found with SFR surface density alone. Yet the SFR surface density plays a role as well: galaxies with high SFR surface densities have a rather roundish shape, whereas galaxies with little star formation show only a relatively small vertical extent in comparison to their size. Conclusions. Thick gaseous discs are partially supported by cosmic-ray pressure. Our results are a useful benchmark for simulations of galaxy evolution that include cosmic rays.</description>

      <title>OGHReS: Star formation in the Outer Galaxy II ($\ell = 180^\circ$-$280^\circ$)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Outer Galaxy High-Resolution Survey (OGHReS) covers 100 square degrees ($180^\circ &lt; \ell &lt; 280^\circ$) in the (2--1) transitions of three CO-isotopologues. We use the spectra to refine the velocities and physical properties to 6706 \higal\ clumps located in the OGHReS region. In a previous paper, we analysed 3584 clumps between $\ell = 250^\circ$ and $280^\circ$. Here, we cover a further 3122 clumps ($180^\circ &lt; \ell &lt; 250^\circ$) and determine reliable velocities for \withVLSR\ of these, finding good agreement with the previously assigned velocities ($\sim$80 percent within 5 \kms). We update velocities for 288 clumps and provide new values for an additional 411. Combining these with the previous results, we have velocities and physical properties for 6193 clumps (92.3 percent). The \allnonDetections\ non-detections are low surface density clumps or likely contamination by evolved stars and galaxies. Key findings: i) improved correlation between clumps and spiral arm loci, and the discovery of clumps beyond the outer arm supports the existence of a new spiral structure; ii) decreasing trend in the $L/M$-ratio consistent with less high-mass star formation in the outer Galaxy; iii) increase in the star formation fraction (SFF) in the outer Galaxy, suggesting that more clumps are forming stars despite their lower mass; iv) discrepancies in velocity assignments across different surveys that could affect $\sim$10000 clumps, especially in the fourth quadrant.</description>

      <title>Galaxy And Mass Assembly: A new approach to quantifying dust in galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new approach to quantifying dust in galaxies by combining information from the Balmer decrement (BD) and the dust mass ($M_d$). While there is no explicit correlation between these two properties, they jointly probe different aspects of the dust present in galaxies. We explore two new parameters that link BD with $M_d$ by using star formation rate sensitive luminosities at several wavelengths (ultraviolet, H$\alpha$, and far-infrared). This analysis shows that combining the BD and $M_d$ in these ways provides new metrics that are sensitive to the degree of optically thick dust affecting the short wavelength emission. We show how these new ''dust geometry'' parameters vary as a function of galaxy mass, star formation rate, and specific star formation rate. We demonstrate that they are sensitive probes of the dust geometry in galaxies, and that they support the ''maximal foreground screen'' model for dust in starburst galaxies.</description>

      <title>The Initial Mass Function of the Galactic Early-type Field Stars Based on the LAMOST Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Research on the high-mass end of the initial mass function (IMF) has been limited due to a scarcity of samples. Recently, Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST), as the most efficient spectroscopic telescope, has provided new opportunities for related research. In this study, based on approximately 70,000 main-sequence early-type stars from the LAMOST survey, we investigated the IMF of Galactic field stars at the high-mass end (1.5 &lt; M/Msun &lt; 7.1). First, we derived the slope of the present-day mass function (PDMF), finding after correcting for selection effect in the observed sample. We then accounted for the effects of stellar evolution and unresolved binaries to correct the PDMF back to the IMF, resulting in {\alpha}ini = 2.70 - 2.82. Notably, we corrected both stellar evolution and unresolved binary effects simultaneously by using binary-Star evolution code, which enhances the robustness of our results. Additionally, we investigated how different mass-ratio (q) distributions of binaries and different star formation histories of the Milky Way impact the IMF. Finally, we tested samples across different spatial scales and found that {\alpha}ini may exhibit a decreasing trend as the spatial scale increases, which could be attributed to variations in metallicity.</description>

      <title>WALLABY pilot survey: Spatially resolved gas scaling relations within the stellar discs of nearby galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The scatter in global atomic hydrogen (HI) scaling relations is partly attributed to differences in how HI and stellar properties are measured, with HI reservoirs typically extending beyond the inner regions of galaxies where star formation occurs. Using pilot observations from the WALLABY survey, we present the first measurements of HI mass enclosed within the stellar-dominated regions of galaxies for a statistical sample of 995 local gas-rich systems, investigating the factors driving its variation. We examine how global HI scaling relations change when measurements are restricted to R25 and R24 -- the isophotal radii at 25 and 24 mag arcsec$^{-2}$ in the i-band -- and explore how the fraction of HI mass and HI surface density within these radii correlate with other galaxy properties. On average, 68% of the total HI mass is enclosed within R25 and 54% within R24, though significant variation exists between galaxies. The fraction of HI mass within R25 shows a mild correlation with stellar properties, with galaxies of higher stellar mass, greater stellar surface density, or redder colours enclosing a larger fraction of their HI reservoirs. These correlations do not significantly strengthen when considering R24. Conversely, global HI surface densities show no significant correlation with stellar mass or stellar surface density, but trends start emerging when these are measured within the inner regions of galaxies. The strongest correlation is observed with optical colour, with bluer galaxies having higher average HI surface densities within R25. This trend strengthens when we restrict from R25 to R24, suggesting a closer connection between inner HI reservoirs and star formation. This study underscores the value of (at least marginally) resolved HI surveys of statistical samples for advancing our understanding of the gas-star formation cycle in galaxies.

      <title>XXII. Accurate stellar velocity dispersions of the SL2S lens sample and the lensing mass fundamental plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We reanalyze spectra taken as part of the SL2S lens galaxy survey, with the goal to obtain stellar velocity dispersion with precision and accuracy sufficient for time-delay cosmography. In order to achieve this goal, we impose stringent cuts on signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and employ recently developed methods to mitigate and quantify residual systematic errors due to template libraries and fitting process. We also quantify the covariance across the sample. For galaxies with spectra with SNR &gt; 20/{\AA}, our new measurements have average random uncertainty of 3-4%, average systematic uncertainty of 2%, and covariance across the sample of 1%. We find negligible covariance between spectra taken with different instruments. The systematic uncertainty and covariance need to be included when the sample is used as an external dataset in time-delay cosmography. We revisit empirical scaling relations of lens galaxies based on the improved kinematics. We show that the SLS2 sample, the TDCOSMO time-delay lens sample, and the lower redshift SLACS sample follow the same correlation between effective radius, stellar velocity dispersion and lensing mass, known as the lensing mass fundamental plane, as that derived by Auger et al. (2010) assuming isothermal mass profiles for the deflectors. We also derive for the first time the lensing mass fundamental plane assuming free power-law mass density profiles, and show that the three samples also follow the same correlation. This is consistent with a scenario in which massive galaxies evolve by growing their radii and mass, but staying within the plane.</description>

      <title>Quasar identifications from the slitless spectra: a test from 3D-HST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Slitless spectroscopy is a traditional method for selecting quasars. In this paper, we develop a procedure for selecting quasars (QSOs) using the 3D-HST G141 slitless spectra. We initially identify over 6,000 sources with emission lines broader than those typically found in emission line galaxies (ELGs) by analyzing the 1D spectra. These ``broad'' emission lines may originate from actual QSO broad lines ($\rm FWHM\geq1200~\rm km/s$) or the convolved narrow lines ($\rm FWHM = 200\sim 300\rm km/s$) in ELGs with effective radii $\geq$0.3" (2.5Kpc at z=1). We then propose a criterion based on the reliability of the QSO component in the forward modeling results. Using the known QSOs, ELGs, and simulation spectra, we find that our criterion successfully selects about 90\% of known QSOs with H$\alpha$ or H$\beta$ line detection and point-like structures, with an ELG contamination rate of about 5\%. We apply this method to emission line sources without significant contamination and select 19 QSO candidates at redshift $z=0.12-1.56$. 12 of these candidates have Chandra X-ray detections. This sample covers a broader range of the rest-frame UV colors and has redder optical slopes compared to the SDSS QSOs, yet it is more likely to be composed of normal QSOs rather than little red dots. Through spectral analysis, the estimated black hole masses of the sample are $10^{6.9}-10^{8.3} M_{\odot}$. Our new candidates improve the completeness of the QSO sample at $z=0.8-1.6$ in the 3D-HST field. The proposed method will also be helpful for QSO selections via slitless spectroscopy in Euclid and the Chinese Space Station Telescope.</description>

      <title>The JCMT BISTRO-3 Survey: Variation of magnetic field orientations on parsec and sub-parsec scales in the massive star-forming region G28.34+0.06</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic fields play a significant role in star-forming processes on core to clump scales. We investigate magnetic field orientations and strengths in the massive star-forming clump P2 within the filamentary infrared dark cloud G28.34+0.06 using dust polarization observations made using SCUBA-2/POL-2 on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope as part of the B-field In STar-forming Region Observations (BISTRO) survey. We compare the magnetic field orientations at the clump scale of ~2 parsecs from these JCMT observations with those at the core scale of ~0.2 parsecs from archival ALMA data, finding that the magnetic field orientations on these two different scales are perpendicular to one another. We estimate the distribution of magnetic field strengths, which range from 50 to 430 {\mu}G over the clump. The region forming the core shows the highest magnetic field strength. We also obtain the distribution of mass-to-flux ratios across the clump. In the region surrounding the core, the mass-to-flux ratio is larger than 1, which indicates the magnetic field strength is insufficient to support the region against gravitational collapse. Therefore, the change in the magnetic field orientation from clump to core scales may be the result of gravitational collapse, with the field being pulled inward along with the flow of material under gravity.</description>

      <title>Zangetsu: A Candidate of Isolated, Quiescent, and Backsplash Ultra-Diffuse Galaxy in the COSMOS Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep imaging surveys have changed our view of the low surface brightness (LSB) Universe. The "renaissance" of the low surface brightness dwarf galaxy population, as the prime example of such recent development, continues to challenge our understanding of galaxy formation. Here, We report the serendipitous discovery of Zangetsu, an isolated, quiescent, and distorted ultra-diffuse galaxy (UDG) candidate in the COSMOS field, using images from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP). Zangetsu exhibits an extremely low central surface brightness ($\mathrm{\mu_{0,g}}=26.60\pm0.01$ mag arcsec$^{-2}$), a very shallow inner surface brightness profile ($\mathrm{n}_{\rm Sersic}=0.40\pm0.01$), and a large angular size ($\mathrm{R_e}\approx 10.44$ arcsec). Surprisingly, Zangetsu also has a quiescent stellar population ($\mathrm{g-i}=0.96$), an unusually elongated shape ($\mathrm{b/a}\sim 0.25$), and mild morphological asymmetry, making it a rare case among known UDGs. Surface brightness fluctuation analysis of HSC and Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images only provides a distance lower limit of $D&gt;25.4$ Mpc (thus $\mathrm{R_e}&gt;1.38$ kpc). However, Zangetsu remains an extreme outlier in the luminosity-size relation of known LSB galaxies, suggesting that it could be an exceptionally large and/or diffuse system. Classic internal or external UDG formation mechanisms alone struggle to explain such a system. A backsplash origin may account for its isolation and quiescent nature. This finding also raises the possibility that current works may overlook similarly extreme, elongated systems that could further our understanding of the LSB Universe.</description>

      <title>A JWST View of the Overmassive Black Hole in NGC 4486B</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new stellar dynamical measurement of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) in the compact elliptical galaxy NGC 4486B, based on integral field spectroscopy with JWST/NIRSpec. The two-dimensional kinematic maps reveal a resolved double nucleus and a velocity dispersion peak offset from the photometric center. Utilizing two independent methods-Schwarzschild orbit-superposition and Jeans Anisotropic Modeling-we tightly constrain the black hole mass by fitting the full line-of-sight velocity distribution. Our axisymmetric Schwarzschild models yield a best-fit black hole mass of $M_{BH} = 3.6^{+0.6}_{-0.6} \times 10^8 \, M_{\odot}$, slightly lower but significantly more precise than previous estimates. However, since our models do not account for the non-equilibrium nature of the double nucleus, this value may represent a lower limit. The inferred black hole mass corresponds to approximately 4-13% of the total stellar mass, providing robust evidence for an overmassive SMBH in NGC 4486B. Combined with the galaxy's location deep within the Virgo Cluster, our results support the interpretation that NGC 4486B is the tidally stripped remnant core of a formerly massive galaxy. As the JWST/NIRSpec field of view is insufficient to constrain the dark matter halo, we incorporate archival ground-based long-slit kinematics extending to 5 arcsec. While this provides some leverage on the dark matter content, the constraints remain relatively weak. We place only an upper limit on the dark matter fraction, with $M_{DM}/M_{*} &lt; 0.5$ within 1 kpc-well beyond the effective radius. The inferred black hole mass remains unchanged with or without a dark matter halo.</description>

Abstract: Simulation-based inference (SBI) has emerged as a powerful tool for extracting cosmological information from galaxy surveys deep into the non-linear regime. Despite its great promise, its application is limited by the computational cost of running simulations that can describe the increasingly-large cosmological datasets. Recent work proposed a hybrid SBI framework (HySBI), which combines SBI on small-scales with perturbation theory (PT) on large-scales, allowing information to be extracted from high-resolution observations without large-volume simulations. In this work, we lay out the HySBI framework for galaxy clustering, a key step towards its application to next-generation datasets. We study the choice of priors on the parameters for modeling galaxies in PT analysis and in simulation-based analyses, as well as investigate their cosmology dependence. By jointly modeling large- and small-scale statistics and their associated nuisance parameters, we show that HySBI can obtain 20\% and 60\% tighter constraints on $\Omega_m$ and $\sigma_8$, respectively, compared to traditional PT analyses, thus demonstrating the efficacy of this approach to maximally extract information from upcoming spectroscopic datasets.</description>

      <title>Methods to Test the Source of the Extreme Gas Motions in WS 35</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present theoretical arguments toward the plausibility of a stellar wind}to explain the 16000\,km\,$s^{-1}$ line broadening in the optical spectra of WS 35, the central star in the Pa 30 nebula. The wind model is discussed in the context of super-Eddington flows. We argue that WS 35 potentially occupies a new regime of wind driving theory as the first metal-only wind. While this framework provides a promising avenue for explaining the high speed flow, questions remain about the source's true nature. We further describe how future radio observations can provide an independent test of the spherical wind scenario. A magnetically channeled wind would likely produce a relatively flat and bright radio spectral energy distributions. By contrast a spherical wind should result in a thermal radio spectrum with a canonical continuum slope of $\nu^{0.6}$, and a brightness level consistent with the currently predicted mass-loss rate.</description>

      <title>Mass of Cepheid V350 Sgr Incorporating Interferometry and the Companion Mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The system V350 Sgr has a classical Cepheid for the primary. Interferometry is presented for the system and the full orbit is determined. The mass of the companion has been determined from an {\it IUE} spectrum and comparison with the mass-temperature relation from Detached Eclipsing Binaries. Combined with the mass of the companion (2.6 $\pm$ 0.2 M$_\odot$), the mass of the Cepheid is determined to be 4.7 $\pm$ 0.8 M$_\odot$. For systems with less complete information, Cepheid masses can be determined from a single-lined spectroscopic orbit, {\it Gaia} proper motion anomalies, and the mass of the companion from the ultraviolet. Uncertainties resulting from different approaches to mass determination are discussed, and are expected to be reduced after the {\it Gaia} DR4 release. Temperatures for Morgan Keenan (MK) standard stars from the ultraviolet are also provided.</description>

      <title>Oort Cloud Ecology. III. The Sun left the parent star cluster shortly after the giant planets formed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Sun was born in a clustered environment with 10,000 other stars. Being an isolated star today, the Sun must have left the nest. We do not directly know when that happened, how violent the ejection was, or how far the Solar siblings have drifted apart. The mass of the fragile outer Opic-Oort cloud, (between $r_{\rm inner} \sim 30,000$\,au and $200\,000$au from the Sun) and the orbital distribution of planetesimals in the inner Hills-Oort cloud (between $\sim 1000$\,au and $\sim 30\,000$ au) are sensitive to the dynamical processes involving the Sun in the parent cluster. We aim at understanding the extend to which observing the Oort cloud constrains the Sun's birth environment. This is achieved by a combination of theoretical arguments and N-body simulations. We show that the current mass of the Opic-Oort cloud (between 0.2 and $2.0$ Earth masses) is best explained if the Sun left the nest within $\sim 20$\,Myr after the giant planets formed and migrated. As a consequence, the possible dynamical encounter with another star carving the Kuiper belt, the Sun's abduction of Sedna, and other perturbations induced by nearby stars then must have happened shortly after the giant planets in the Solar system formed, but before the Sun left the parent cluster. Signatures of the time spend in the parent cluster must still be visible in the outer parts of the Solar system today. The strongest constraints will be the discovery of a population of relatively low-eccentricity ($e &lt; 0.9$) inner Oort-cloud (but $500 &lt; a &lt; 10^4$\,au) objects.</description>

      <title>XRISM Reveals a Remnant Torus in the Low-Luminosity AGN M81*</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Up to 40% of galaxies in the local universe host a low-luminosity active galactic nucleus (LLAGN), making it vital to understand this mode of black hole accretion. However, the presence or absence of Seyfert-like geometries - an accretion disk close to the black hole, an optical broad line region (BLR), and a molecular torus - remains uncertain owing to the low flux levels of sources within this class. Herein, we present an analysis of a XRISM/Resolve spectrum of M81*, the LLAGN in the heart of the nearby spiral galaxy M81. A weak, neutral Fe K emission line is detected and resolved into K$_{\alpha,1}$ and K$_{\alpha,2}$ components. It shows a negligible velocity shift, and weak broadening (FWHM$=460^{+260}_{-160}~{\rm km}~{\rm s}^{-1}$) that corresponds to an inner emission radius of ${\rm r} \geq 2.7\times 10^{4}~GM/c^{2}$ for likely inclinations. The Fe K$_{\alpha}$ line likely traces a torus. The upper limit on additional splitting of the Fe K$_{\alpha}$ line components translates to a limit on the local magnetic field of ${\rm B} \leq 3.5\times 10^{8}$ Gauss, assuming Zeeman splitting. The spectra also reveal ionized plasma(s) through He-like Fe XXV and H-like Fe XXVI emission lines. These can be fit equally well assuming photoionization and collisional excitation. The H-like Fe XXVI line is better described when a second component is included with a red-shift of ${\rm v} = 1600~{\rm km}~{\rm s}^{-1}$, but this addition is of marginal statistical significance. We discuss these results in the context of radiatively inefficient accretion flow models, magnetically arrested disks, and possible links to the Fermi bubbles in the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>The dynamics of the parsec-scale jet in the neutrino blazar PKS 0735+178</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies of individual track-like TeV-PeV IceCube neutrino events suggest that strongly jetted AGNs, blazars, can be plausible sources of extragalactic high-energy neutrinos. Although the broadband emission and neutrinos from such blazars can be modeled by hadronic jets with inverse Compton processes, various models show degeneracies. One of the reasons is the lack of high-resolution observations pinpointing the location and physical conditions of neutrino-emitting plasma. Here, we present a VLBI study of PKS 0735+178 that was recently associated with a high energy neutrino event IceCube-211208A (IC211208) as well as alerts from other neutrino observatories. We analyzed publicly available VLBA 15 and 43 GHz data of 0735+178 during 2020-2024, resolving the mas-scale jet and tracing its time evolution in flux and structure, before and after IC211208. We find significant enhancements in the radio flux density, apparent brightness temperature, and synchrotron opacity at 15-43 GHz of the VLBI nuclear region after IC211208, strengthening the temporal correlation between 0735+178 and IC211208. Furthermore, we find that the source ejected a new VLBI component C2 from the VLBI core before IC211208. C2 traveled further downstream at ~4.2c apparent speed, close to the historical maximum speed for this object. C2 then passed a subluminally moving feature in the jet C1 located at ~0.13 mas (~0.77 pc) downstream the core at the time of IC211208. The time of this apparent passage is statistically coincident with the time of IC211208 within 1sigma uncertainty, suggesting the location of this apparent passage to be a probable spatial origin of IC211208. We discuss the physical implications of these findings.</description>

      <title>Selected open cluster sample for validating atmospheric parameters: Application to Gaia and other surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reliable stellar atmospheric parameters are essential for probing stellar structure and evolution, and for stellar population studies. However, various deviations appear in comparisons with different ground-based spectroscopic surveys. We aim to select high-quality open cluster members and employ the atmospheric parameters provided by the theoretical isochrones of open clusters as a benchmark to assess the quality of stellar atmospheric parameters from Gaia DR3 and other ground-based spectroscopic surveys, such as LAMOST DR11, APOGEE DR17, and GALAH DR4. We selected 130 open clusters with well-defined main sequences within 500 pc of the solar neighborhood as a benchmark sample to estimate the reference atmospheric parameters of the members from the best-fit isochrones of those clusters. By comparing the atmospheric parameters provided by different spectroscopic surveys to the theoretical parameters, we found that the atmospheric parameter deviation and the corresponding dispersions exhibit different variations. The atmospheric parameter deviations of F, G, and K-type stars are smaller than those of B, A, and M-type stars for most surveys. For most samples, the dispersion of Teff decreases as temperature decreases, whereas the dispersion of logg shows the opposite trend.</description>

      <title>The first direct imaging of the silhouette of a damped Lyman $\alpha$ system along the line-of-sight to a background galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The H~{\sc i} gas distribution in damped Lyman $\alpha$ absorbers (DLAs) has remained elusive due to the point-source nature of background quasar emission. Observing DLAs against spatially extended background galaxies provides a new method for constraining their size and structure. Using the Keck Cosmic Web Imager, we present the first ``silhouette'' image of a DLA at $z=3.34$, identified in the spectrum of a background galaxy at $z=3.61$. Although the silhouette remains unresolved due to limited spatial resolution, this represents a successful proof-of-concept for studying DLA morphology using extended background sources. Possible residual emission in the DLA trough suggests an optical depth contrast exceeding $10^7$ in the internal structure, implying a sharp edge or patchy structure. A Lyman $\alpha$ emitter (LAE) at $z_{\rm LAE}=3.3433\pm0.0005$, consistent with the DLA redshift, is detected at an angular separation of $1.''73\pm0.''28$ ($12.9\pm2.1$ kpc). The DLA is surrounded by three galaxies within 140 kpc in projected distance and 500 km s$^{-1}$ in line-of-sight velocity, indicating that it resides in the circumgalactic medium of the LAE or within a galaxy group/protocluster environment. An O~{\sc i} $\lambda1302$ absorption at $z_{\rm OI}=3.3288\pm0.0004$ is also detected along the line of sight. This absorber may trace metal-enriched outflow from the LAE or a gas-rich galaxy exhibiting the highest star formation activity among the surrounding galaxies. Future large spectroscopic surveys of galaxies will expand such a DLA sample, and three-dimensional spectroscopy for it will shed new light on the role of intergalactic dense gas in galaxy formation and evolution.</description>

      <title>Classifying metal-poor stars with machine learning using nucleosynthesis calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply the capabilities of machine learning (ML) to discern patterns in order to classify metal-poor stars. To do so, we train an ML model on a bank of nucleosynthesis calculations derived from hydrodynamic simulations for events such as neutron star mergers where the rapid ($r$) neutron capture process can take place. Likewise we consider a bank of calculations from simulations of the slow ($s$) neutron capture process and also consider a few calculations for the intermediate ($i$) neutron capture process. We demonstrate that the ML does well overall in recognizing the $s$ process from the $r$ process, and after training on theoretical calculations ML stellar assignments match conventional labels 87% of the time. We highlight that this method then points to stars that could benefit from additional observational measurements. We also demonstrate that the ML assigns some of the presently considered $i$-process stars to instead be of $r$ or $s$ in origin, but likewise, finds stars currently labeled as $s$ to be potentially more aligned with $i$ enrichment. This first application of ML to classify metal-poor star enrichment using theoretical nucleosynthesis calculations thus reveals the promise, and some challenges, associated with this new data-driven path forward.</description>

      <title>HDO ice detected toward an isolated low-mass protostar with JWST</title>

Abstract: Water is detected in environments representing every stage of star and solar system formation, but its chemical evolution throughout these stages remains poorly constrained. Deuterium ratios offer a means of probing chemical links between water in different cosmic regions because of their sensitivity to physicochemical conditions. Here, we present the first detection of the 4.1 $\mu$m HDO ice feature with JWST toward L1527 IRS, an isolated low-mass protostar that may eventually grow to a sun-like mass. We measure an ice HDO/H$_{2}$O ratio of 4.4$^{+3.7}_{-1.7}$$\times$10$^{-3}$, where the reported error is dominated by uncertainties in continuum definition and ice band strengths. This fraction is similar to the gas HDO/H$_{2}$O ratios measured in the warm ($&gt;$100 K) inner cores of other low-mass protostellar envelopes and protoplanetary disks found in comparably isolated star-forming regions. Such a similarity tentatively supports the assumption that water vapor detected in these regions is not significantly altered by gas-phase reactions following ice sublimation. It also supports the hypothesis that pre- and protostellar water ice is largely inherited in a chemically unaltered state by outer protoplanetary disks. However, the fraction is a factor of $\sim$4-10 times higher than the gas HDO/H$_{2}$O ratios measured toward comets and low-mass protostars in clustered star-forming regions. This difference may be due to either gas-phase water reprocessing in protostellar envelopes and protoplanetary disks, or differences between prestellar conditions of isolated dense cores and the clustered star-forming regions that are more analogous to the environment in which our Sun formed.</description>

      <title>The impact of mass-dependent stochasticity at cosmic dawn</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13108v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: JWST is unveiling a surprising lack of evolution in the number densities of ultraviolet-selected (UV) galaxies at redshift $z\gtrsim 10$. At the same time, observations and simulations are providing evidence for highly bursty star formation in high-$z$ galaxies, resulting in significant scatter in their UV luminosities. Galaxies in low-mass dark matter halos are expected to experience most stochasticity due to their shallow potential wells. Here, we explore the impact of a mass-dependent stochasticity using a simple analytical model. We assume that scatter in the $M_\mathrm{UV}-M_h$ relation increases towards lower halo masses, following the decrease in halo escape velocity, $\sigma_\mathrm{UV} \sim M_h^{-1/3}$, independent of redshift. Since low-mass halos are more dominant in the early universe, this model naturally predicts an increase in UV luminosity functions (LFs) at high redshifts compared to models without scatter. We make predictions for additional observables which would be affected by stochasticity and could be used to constrain its amplitude, finding: (i) galaxies are less clustered compared to the no-scatter scenario, with the difference increasing at higher-$z$; (ii) assuming star-bursting galaxies dominate the ionizing photon budget implies reionization starts earlier and is more gradual compared to the no-scatter case, (iii) at fixed UV magnitude galaxies should exhibit wide ranges of UV slopes, nebular emission line strengths and Balmer breaks. Comparing to observations, the mass-dependent stochasticity model successfully reproduces the observed LFs up to $z\sim12$. However, the model cannot match the observed $z\sim14$ LFs, implying additional physical processes enhance star formation efficiency in the earliest galaxies.</description>

Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope is revolutionising our ability to understand the host galaxies and local environments of high-z quasars. Here we obtain a comprehensive understanding of the host galaxy of the z=7.08 quasar J1120+0641 by combining NIRSpec integral field spectroscopy with NIRCam photometry of the host continuum emission. Our emission line maps reveal that this quasar host is undergoing a merger with a bright companion galaxy. The quasar host and the companion have similar dynamical masses of $\sim10^{10}M_\odot$, suggesting that this is a major galaxy interaction. Through detailed quasar subtraction and SED fitting using the NIRCam data, we obtain an estimate of the host stellar mass of $M_{\ast}=(3.0^{+2.5}_{-1.4})\times10^9M_\odot$, with $M_{*}=(2.7^{+0.5}_{-0.5})\times10^9M_\odot$ for the companion galaxy. Using the H$\beta$ Balmer line we estimate a virial black hole mass of $M_{\rm{BH}}=(1.9^{+2.9}_{-1.1})\times10^9 M_\odot$. Thus, J1120+0641 has an extreme black hole-stellar mass ratio of $M_{\rm{BH}}/M_\ast=0.63^{+0.54}_{-0.31}$, which is ~3 dex larger than expected by the local scaling relations between black hole and stellar mass. J1120+0641 is powered by an overmassive black hole with the highest reported black hole-stellar mass ratio, in a quasar host that is currently undergoing a major merger -- these new insights highlight the power of JWST for measuring and understanding these extreme first quasars.</description>

Abstract: Over the years, photometric redshift estimation (photo-z) has advanced through various methods. This study evaluates four distinct photo-z estimators-ANNz2, BPZ, ENF, and DNF-using the Dark Energy Survey Y3 BAO Sample. Unlike most studies, we explore selecting optimal galaxies based on their redshift Probability Distribution Function (PDF) by either reducing noise or identifying those approximating a Gaussian distribution. We cross-matched 25,760 galaxies drawn from four spectroscopic surveys with the photo-z sample to comprehend redshift bias and its 68th percentile $\sigma_{68}$. The lowest $\sigma$ for all estimators was found in the range $0.79&lt;z_p&lt;0.85$. Among the estimators, DMF exhibited the greatest bias, while ENF, ANNz2, and BPZ showed decreased precision outside 0.7 to 0.9 redshift range. To select galaxies with minimal bias, ANNz2 emerged as the most reliable algorithm across all criteria. PDFs selection significantly improves colour representation over the spectroscopic sample, underscoring the role of magnitude space in selection. While ANNz2 achieved superior precision, ENF poorly selected Gaussian PDFs, leaving few galaxies for LSS evaluation. Despite smooth PDFs, catastrophic redshift errors were present. Though DNF had the poorest precision, it offered enough galaxies for cosmological use. Subsampling galaxies with secondary peaks less than 30\% of the main peak height, termed Small Peaks, showed ANNz2 excelled. The catalogs produced have been published as Pz Cats within the ZENODO repository.</description>

      <title>The FAST Ursa Major supergroup HI survey (FUMaS): catalog and HI mass function</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07836v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST), we have performed an Ursa Major supergroup HI Survey (FUMaS) covering the entire UMa region centered at RA=11$^h$59$^m$28$^s$.3, DEC=49$^\circ$05'18" with a radius of 7.5$^\circ$. We have obtained the most complete catalog of HI sources in the UMa supergroup, containing 178 HI sources with velocities in the range 625-1213.4 km s$^{-1}$ and masses in the range 10$^{6.0}$-10$^{10.1}$ M$_{\odot}$ assuming a distance of 17.4 Mpc. Among them, 55 HI sources were detected for the first time, of which 32 do not have known optical redshifts. For these 32 sources, we have searched the DESI Legacy Surveys and found optical counterparts for 25 of them (with optical images, but no redshifts), with the remaining 7 sources to be pure HI clouds without an optical counterpart. We detected HI distributions in some interacting systems and discussed four small groups in detail. We computed the HIMF of the UMa supergroup using the 1/V$_\mathrm{max}$ method and fitting it with the non-linear least squares (NLLS) and modified maximum likelihood (MML) methods. We obtained the following HIMF parameters: log$_{10}$($\phi_*$/Mpc$^{-3}$) = -0.78 $\pm$ 0.15, $\alpha$ = -1.05 $\pm$ 0.07 and log$_{10}$($M_*$/$M_{\odot}$) = 9.87 $\pm$ 0.19 for the NLLS method, and log$_{10}$($\phi_*$/Mpc$^{-3}$) = -0.70 $\pm$ 0.11, $\alpha$ = -1.05 $\pm$ 0.05 and log$_{10}$($M_*$/$M_{\odot}$) = 9.77 $\pm$ 0.13 for the MML method. This result is similar to that derived from the VLA blind survey, but the slope is steeper because we detected more low-mass galaxies. The slope is flatter than that of the global HIMF, which agrees with the theoretical prediction that galaxies in high-density regions are stripped of gas due to interactions.</description>

      <title>The JWST EXCELS survey: an extremely metal-poor galaxy at $z=8.271$ hosting an unusual population of massive stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11099v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an analysis of the rest-frame optical ($\lambda \simeq 3100-5600 \,$\r{A}) spectrum of a $\mathrm{log}_{10}(M_*/\mathrm{M_\odot}) = 8.6$ star-forming galaxy at $z=8.271$ (EXCELS-63107) from JWST/NIRSpec medium-resolution observations taken as part of the EXCELS survey. EXCELS-63107 is a compact object consistent with the size of local star-forming cluster complexes ($r_e &lt; 200 \, \rm{pc}$) and has an extremely steep UV continuum measured from JWST/NIRCam photometry ($\beta=-3.3\pm0.3$). The JWST/NIRSpec G395M spectrum of EXCELS-63107 is notable for its strong [OIII]$\lambda4363$ auroral-line emission relative to the [OIII]$\lambda5007$ forbidden line. Via a detailed emission-line and photoionization-modelling analysis, we find that the the observed properties of EXCELS-63107 are consistent with the presence of an ionizing source with an effective temperature of $T_{\rm eff} \gtrsim 80 \, 000\,\rm{K}$ heating ionized gas with a density of $n_e &lt; 10^4 \, \rm{cm}^{-3}$ to a volume-averaged electron temperature of $T_e \simeq 34 \, 000\,\rm{K}$. Crucially, we find that stellar population models assuming a standard IMF are not capable of producing the required heating. We determine an oxygen abundance of ${12+\mathrm{log(O/H)}= 6.89^{+0.26}_{-0.21}}$ which is one of the lowest directly constrained oxygen abundances measured in any galaxy to date, and $\simeq 10 \times$ lower than is typical for $z\simeq8$ galaxies with the same stellar mass. The extremely low metallicity of EXCELS-63107 places it in a regime in which theoretical models expect a transition to a top-heavy IMF, and we speculate that a $\simeq 10-30 \, \times$ excess of $M &gt; 50 \, \rm{M}_{\odot}$ stars is one plausible explanation for its observed properties. However, more exotic scenarios, such as Pop III star formation within a mildly enriched halo, are also consistent with the observations.</description>

      <title>On The Very Bright Dropouts Selected Using the James Webb Space Telescope NIRCam Instrument</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05751v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The selection of candidate high-redshift galaxies using the dropout technique targeting the Lyman-break signature sometimes yields very bright objects that are too luminous to be easily explained if they are indeed at the expected redshifts. Here we present a systematic study of very bright dropouts selected through successive bands of the NIRCam instrument onboard the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Using the public NIRCam data in four blank fields over 500~arcmin$^2$, 300 such objects were found. They have F356W magnitudes $&lt;25.1$~mag or $&lt;26.0$~mag depending on the dropout passband, and the majority of them ($&gt;80\%$) have very red F115W$-$F356W colors $&gt; 2.0$~mag, qualifying them as ``extremely red objects'' (EROs). We focus on 137 objects that also have mid-IR observations from the JWST MIRI instrument. Their spectral energy distribution analysis shows that these objects are dominated by low-redshift ($z\sim1$--4) galaxies ($\gtrsim67\%$). However, a non-negligible fraction ($\gtrsim7\%$) could be at high redshifts. Seven of our objects have secure spectroscopic redshifts from JWST NIRSpec identifications, and the results confirm this picture: while six are low-redshift galaxies ($z\approx3$), one is a known galaxy at $z=8.679$ {(with $M_{\rm UV}=-22.4$~mag and stellar mass $M_*=10^{9.1}M_\odot$)} recovered in our sample. In light of recent theoretical models on early galaxy formation, this confirmed high-redshift galaxy does not pose a challenge. However, as our sample contains very luminous high-redshift candidates in the regime still underexplored ($M_{\rm UV}\leq -23$~mag and $M_*&gt;10^{10.5}M_\odot$), spectroscopic identifications are necessary to ensure they do not create tension with these new models.</description>

      <title>A Full AGN Feedback Prescription for Numerical Models: Negative, Positive and Hot Gas-Ejection Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19503v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We build upon the state-of-the-art semi-analytic model \texttt{FEGA24} (Formation and Evolution of GAlaxies, \citealt{contini2024d}), which integrates the latest prescriptions relevant to galaxy formation and evolution, alongside a comprehensive AGN feedback model. This model incorporates three modes of feedback: negative (preventing excessive cooling), positive (enhancing star formation), and hot gas ejection (expelling gas beyond the virial radius of halos). These modes operate in a coordinated manner: the negative mode regulates the cooling process, the positive mode promotes bursts of star formation, and the hot gas ejection mode expels gas beyond the virial radius when the AGN is sufficiently powerful. Our updated semi-analytic model, \texttt{FEGA25}, retains the qualitative and quantitative consistency of the analyses presented in \cite{contini2024d}, while delivering more robust results. Notably, \texttt{FEGA25} provides a more detailed characterization of the fraction of passive galaxies as a function of stellar mass and redshift, predicts a main sequence of star-forming galaxies more consistent with observations and a more accurate cosmic star formation rate density with redshift. Moreover, it estimates the fraction of hot gas in halos closer to observed values. These findings underscore the importance of a physical mechanism capable of ejecting hot gas beyond the virialized region of dark matter halos without significantly altering the stellar and cold gas components. Such a mechanism is crucial to ensure the proper functioning of other processes, such as cooling and star formation. Since supernova feedback is already modeled at its maximum efficiency, AGN feedback emerges as the natural candidate for this role.</description>

      <title>The mass-metallicity relation at z&gt;3 down to M_*= 10^4 M_Sun. A local perspective using the metallicity distribution of RR Lyrae stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04925v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mass-metallicity relation (MZR) is a fundamental scale law of galaxies. It is observed to evolve with redshift in unresolved galaxies up to z&gt;6. However, observational constraints limits our view at such early epochs to galaxies with M_* &gt;= 10^7 M_Sun. On the other hand, in the local Universe the MZR can be traced down to the faintest end of the galaxy luminosity function (M_*= 10^2 M_Sun) but we have access only to its present-day realization. We propose to use RR Lyrae stars to get the mean metallicity of local dwarf galaxies at the early epoch in which these variable stars were formed (z&gt;~3), opening a new window on the evolution of the MZR across cosmic times down to the lowest mass. We use available data for a sample of Milky Way satellites to show that indeed the evolution of the MZR from the epoch of the formation of RR Lyrae to the present day can be traced with this approach, with results broadly compatible with those inferred from high z galaxies from nebular emission lines. The limitations of the approach as well as possible ways to refine the analysis are also briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Where Have All the Little Red Dots Gone? Supermassive Black Hole Binary Dynamics and its Impact on Galaxy Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07711v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent James Webb Space Telescope observations have revealed a peculiar class of galaxies at redshifts $z \gtrsim 6$, characterized by extremely high central stellar densities and overmassive central supermassive black holes (SMBHs), "little red dots" (LRDs). A critical question remains: If LRDs were common at high redshifts, how would they evolve into local elliptical galaxies with significantly lower central densities? To address this, we performed direct $N$-body simulations of LRD mergers, focusing on the coevolution of host galaxies and central SMBHs. We track the complete evolution of SMBH binaries into the three-body hardening and gravitational-wave (GW) emission phase. Our results demonstrate that during galaxy mergers, the central SMBHs can eject a substantial amount of mass from the galactic core via the three-body slingshot effect, leading to a decrease in central stellar surface density by an order of magnitude. Additionally, GW recoil can further contribute in making the galaxy centers less dense and more in alignment with low-redshift quiescent galaxies. This transformation occurs on a relatively short timescale of a few $\sim$100 Myr, implying that LRDs can evolve into lower-redshift elliptical galaxies by $z&lt;4$. The timescales for our SMBH mergers vary between 100 Myr and 800 Myr, depending on the initial orbital parameters of the merging galaxies and the mass ratio of the SMBHs. Our findings provide a plausible mechanism for the transformation of LRDs into elliptical galaxies while highlighting the efficiency of SMBH mergers in such high-density environments, which plays a crucial role in SMBH growth.</description>

      <title>Detection for Intermediate-mass Binary Black Holes in Population III Star Clusters with TianQin</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15907v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context. Population III star clusters are predicted to form in unenriched dark matter halos. Direct N-body simulation of Pop III clusters implies the possible formation and merger of intermediate-mass binary black holes (IMBBHs). The gravitational wave signals could be detected by space-borne gravitational wave detectors like TianQin. Aims. This study evaluates the potential of TianQin in detecting IMBBHs from Pop III star clusters, focusing on key factors such as the detection horizon, detection number, and Fisher uncertainty. Methods. A Monte Carlo simulation is employed to derive IMBBH sources, utilizing the IMRPhenomD waveform model to simulate catalogs of observable IMBBH mergers. The mass and redshift distributions are derived from direct N-body simulations of IMBBHs in Population III star clusters. Detection numbers are determined by calculating the signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) of the simulated signals and applying thresholds for detection. Fisher uncertainty is obtained through Fisher information matrix analysis. Results. The findings suggest that TianQin could achieve detection numbers within 5 years ranging from 1 in the most pessimistic scenario to 253 in the most optimistic scenario. Furthermore, TianQin can precisely constrain the IMBBH mass with a relative uncertainty of $10^{-6}$, coalescence time $t_c$ within 1 second, and sky location $\bar{\Omega}_S$ within 1 $\rm{deg}^2$. However, the luminosity distance $D_L$ and inclination angle $\iota$ exhibit substantial degeneracies, limiting their precise estimation.</description>

      <title>The Galactic-Centre Arms inferred from ACES (ALMA CMZ Exploration Survey)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03331v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Analyzing longitude-velocity diagrams (LVDs) in the CS(J=2-1) and H13CN(J=1-0) molecular lines from the internal release data of the ALMA Central-Molecular-Zone Exploration Survey (ACES) and in the 13CO (J=1-0) line from the Nobeyama Galactic-Centre (GC) survey, we identify six GC Arms as prominent straight LV ridges. In addition to the currently known Arms I to IV, we identify a new inner arm, Arm V, and further highlight the circum-nuclear disc (CND) as Arm VI. Integrated intensity maps of the Arms on the sky suggest that most of the Arms compose ring-like structures inclined from the Galactic plane. We determine the radii (curvatures) of the Arms using the velocity-gradient ($dv/dl$) method, assuming that the arms are rotating on circular orbits at a constant velocity of $\sim 150$ km/s. We show that Arms I and II compose the main ring structure of the CMZ with radii $\sim 100$--120 pc; Arm III is a dense arm 42 pc from the GC; Arm IV is a clear and narrow arm 20 pc from the GC; and Arm V is a faint, long arm of 8.2 pc radius. We show that the circum-nuclear disc (CND) composes the sixth arm, Arm VI, of radius $\sim 2.3$ pc associated with bifurcated spiral fins. We also discuss the association of the 20- and 50-km/s clouds with these Arms. The radii of the arms fall on an empirical relation $R\sim 630 (2/5)^N$ for $N=1$ (Arm I) to 6 (VI), suggesting either discrete rings or a logarithmic spiral with pitch angle $\sim 22^\circ$. The vertical full extent of the arm increases with radius and is represented by $z\sim 0.7 (R/1 {\rm pc})^{0.7}$ pc. The tilt angle of the arms from the Galactic plane, or the warping, increases rapidly toward the GC.</description>

      <title>A weak Ly$\alpha$ halo for an extremely bright Little Red Dot. Indications of enshrouded SMBH growth</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09542v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The abundant population of "Little Red Dots" (LRDs)-compact objects with red UV to optical colors and broad Balmer lines at high redshift-is unveiling new insights into the properties of early active galactic nuclei (AGN). Perhaps the most surprising features of this population are the presence of Balmer absorption and ubiquitous strong Balmer breaks. Recent models link these features to an active supermassive black hole (SMBH) cocooned in very dense gas ($N_{\rm H}\sim10^{24}\,\rm cm^{-2}$). We present a stringent test of such models using VLT/MUSE observations of A2744-45924, the most luminous LRD known to date ($L_{\rm H\alpha}\approx10^{44}~\rm erg\,s^{-1}$), located behind the Abell-2744 lensing cluster at $z=4.464$ ($\mu=1.8$). We detect a moderately extended Ly$\alpha$ nebula ($h\approx5.7$ pkpc), spatially offset from the point-like H$\alpha$ seen by JWST. The Ly$\alpha$ emission is narrow ($\rm FWHM=270\pm 15~km\,s^{-1}$), spatially offset to H$\alpha$, and faint ($\rm Ly\alpha=0.07H\alpha$) compared to Ly$\alpha$ nebulae typically observed around quasars of similar luminosity. We detect compact N$\,$IV]$\lambda$1486 emission, spatially aligned with H$\alpha$, and a spatial shift in the far-UV continuum matching the Ly$\alpha$ offset. We discuss that H$\alpha$ and Ly$\alpha$ have distinct physical origins: H$\alpha$ originates from the AGN, while Ly$\alpha$ is powered by star formation. In the environment of A2744-45924, we identify four extended Ly$\alpha$ halos ($\Delta z&lt;0.02$, $\Delta r&lt;100$ pkpc). Their Ly$\alpha$ luminosities match expectations based on H$\alpha$ emission, indicating no evidence for radiation from A2744-45924 affecting its surroundings. The lack of strong, compact, and broad Ly$\alpha$ and the absence of a luminous extended halo, suggest that the UV AGN light is obscured by dense gas cloaking the SMBH with covering factor close to unity.</description>

Abstract: Recent observations from the ESA Gaia satellite and with the ESO VLT, have identified the presence of a population of young, 0.5 to 2 Gyr old, stars in the halo and in dwarf spheroidal galaxies surrounding the Milky Way. It suggests that MW dwarf galaxies, currently devoid of gas, had, until recent times, enough gas to sustain a burst of star formation. The recent loss of gas coincides with their arrival in the vicinity of the Milky Way, in agreement with orbital predictions from Gaia that indicate that most dwarf galaxies reached the Milky Way halo less than 3 Gyr years ago. This completely changes the interpretation of their dynamics, mass, and dark matter content.</description>

      <title>Jet Tilt Instability from Stream-Disk Interactions in MAD Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.20592v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetically arrested accretion disks (MADs) around a rapidly rotating black hole (BH) have been proposed as a model for jetted tidal disruption events (TDEs). However, the stream and disk interact strongly at times, and this will lead to different dynamics than expected in the standard MAD model. Here we employ global GRMHD simulations of a MAD disk interacting with an injected stream with a penetrating pericenter $R_p\sim 10 r_g$ and a range of density contrasts $f_\rho\equiv \rho_d/\rho_s$, or how dense the disk is relative to the stream. We demonstrate for the first time that a MAD or semi-MAD state can be sustained and jets powered by the BH spin can be produced even when the stream is much denser than the disk, i.e. in the first month(s) of a jetted TDE. We also demonstrate that the strength of the self-intersection shock decreases as $f_\rho$, and time, increases. The jet or funnel can become significantly tilted (by $10-30^\circ$) due to the self-intersection outflow when $f_\rho \leq 0.1$. In models with a powerful jet and $f_\rho\leq 0.01$, the tilted jet interacts with and ultimately tilts the disk by as much as 23 degrees from the incoming stream and this tilted state is stable for the duration of the simulation. As $f_\rho$ increases, the tilt of the jet and disk is expected to realign with the BH spin once $f_\rho \geq 0.1$. The jet tilt could rapidly realign due to outer disk collapse or the self-intersection radius increasing. Our results provide an alternative explanation for the observed X-ray jet shut-off in days-weeks in jetted TDEs.</description>

      <title>Detecting Exomoons in Free-Floating-Planet Events from Space-based Microlensing Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04083v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When a planet is ejected from its star-planet system due to dynamical interactions, its satellite may remain gravitationally bound to the planet. The Chinese Space Station Telescope (CSST) will be capable of detecting a large number of low-mass free-floating planet events (FFPs) from a bulge microlensing survey. We assess the feasibility of detecting satellites (a.k.a., exomoons) orbiting FFPs by simulating CSST light curves and calculating the detection efficiency as a function of satellite-to-planet mass ratios (q) and projected separations (s) in units of the Einstein radius. For a Neptune-class FFP in the Galactic disk with a Sun-like star as the microlensed source, CSST can detect Earth-mass satellites over a decade of separations (from ~0.01 to ~0.1 AU) and has sensitivity down to Moon-mass satellites (q~1e-3) at s~1. CSST also has some sensitivity to detect Moon-mass satellites at s~2 (~0.02 AU) orbiting an Earth-mass FFP in the disk. CSST has substantially reduced sensitivity for detecting satellites when the source star is an M dwarf, compared to a Sun-like source. We also calculate the satellite detection efficiency for the dedicated microlensing survey of the Roman Space Telescope (Roman), which demonstrates greater sensitivity than CSST, particularly for M-dwarf sources. Notably, some of the Neptune-Earth systems detectable by CSST and Roman may exhibit significant tidal heating.</description>

      <title>Commissioning and Performance of the Trinity Demonstrator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11864v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Trinity Demonstrator is a proof of concept prototype for the Trinity Neutrino Observatory, which is sensitive to astrophysical neutrinos above PeV energies. The Demonstrator is a one-square meter class imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescope deployed on Frisco Peak, Utah, and remotely operated. The light-collection surface is equipped with 77 mirror facets with 15 cm diameter, and its $3.87^\circ\times3.87^\circ$ field of view is instrumented with a 256-pixel camera yielding a $0.24^\circ$ angular resolution. The camera signals are digitized with a 100 MS/s, and 12-bit resolution switched capacitor array readout. We discuss the Demonstrator's design, the telescope's deployment on Frisco Peak, and its commissioning.</description>
