      <title>Free Lunches with Vanishing Risks Most Likely Exist</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hypothesis that there do not exist free lunches with vanishing risk (FLVRs) in the real market underpins the popular risk-neutral pricing and hedging methodology in quantitative finance. The paper documents the fact that this hypothesis can be safely rejected. It performs extremely accurately the hedging of an extreme-maturity zero-coupon bond (ZCB). This hedge is part of a portfolio that starts with zero initial wealth and invests dynamically in a total return stock market index and the savings account to generate at the maturity date of the extreme-maturity ZCB a strictly positive amount with strictly positive probability, which represents an FLVR. The fact that FLVRs naturally exist in the real market can be accommodated theoretically under the benchmark approach.</description>

      <title>American Option Pricing Under Time-Varying Rough Volatility: A Signature-Based Hybrid Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a modular framework that extends the signature method to handle American option pricing under evolving volatility roughness. Building on the signature-pricing framework of Bayer et al. (2025), we add three practical innovations. First, we train a gradient-boosted ensemble to estimate the time-varying Hurst parameter H(t) from rolling windows of recent volatility data. Second, we feed these forecasts into a regime switch that chooses either a rough Bergomi or a calibrated Heston simulator, depending on the predicted roughness. Third, we accelerate signature-kernel evaluations with Random Fourier Features (RFF), cutting computational cost while preserving accuracy. Empirical tests on S&amp;P 500 equity-index options reveal that the assumption of persistent roughness is frequently violated, particularly during stable market regimes when H(t) approaches or exceeds 0.5. The proposed hybrid framework provides a flexible structure that adapts to changing volatility roughness, improving performance over fixed-roughness baselines and reducing duality gaps in some regimes. By integrating a dynamic Hurst parameter estimation pipeline with efficient kernel approximations, we propose to enable tractable, real-time pricing of American options in dynamic volatility environments.</description>

      <title>Hedging with memory: shallow and deep learning with signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the use of path signatures in a machine learning context for hedging exotic derivatives under non-Markovian stochastic volatility models. In a deep learning setting, we use signatures as features in feedforward neural networks and show that they outperform LSTMs in most cases, with orders of magnitude less training compute. In a shallow learning setting, we compare two regression approaches: the first directly learns the hedging strategy from the expected signature of the price process; the second models the dynamics of volatility using a signature volatility model, calibrated on the expected signature of the volatility. Solving the hedging problem in the calibrated signature volatility model yields more accurate and stable results across different payoffs and volatility dynamics.</description>

      <title>Proactive Market Making and Liquidity Analysis for Everlasting Options in DeFi Ecosystems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Everlasting options, a relatively new class of perpetual financial derivatives, have emerged to tackle the challenges of rolling contracts and liquidity fragmentation in decentralized finance markets. This paper offers an in-depth analysis of markets for everlasting options, modeled using a dynamic proactive market maker. We examine the behavior of funding fees and transaction costs across varying liquidity conditions. Using simulations and modeling, we demonstrate that liquidity providers can aim to achieve a net positive PnL by employing effective hedging strategies, even in challenging environments characterized by low liquidity and high transaction costs. Additionally, we provide insights into the incentives that drive liquidity providers to support the growth of everlasting option markets and highlight the significant benefits these instruments offer to traders as a reliable and efficient financial tool.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper considers the ruin problem with random premiums, whose densities have rational Laplace transforms, and investments in a risky asset whose price follows a geometric Brownian motion. The asymptotic behavior of the ruin probability for large initial capital values is investigated.</description>

Abstract: We study regularity properties of the unique solution of a mean-field $G$-SDE. More precisely, we consider a mean-field $G$-SDE with square-integrable random initial condition and establish its first and second order Fr\'echet differentiability in the random initial condition and specify the $G$-SDEs of the respective Fr\'echet derivatives.</description>

      <title>Optimal Dividend, Reinsurance, and Capital Injection Strategies for an Insurer with Two Collaborating Business Lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper considers an insurer with two collaborating business lines, and the risk exposure of each line follows a diffusion risk model. The manager of the insurer makes three decisions for each line: (i) dividend payout, (ii) (proportional) reinsurance coverage, and (iii) capital injection (from one line into the other). The manager seeks an optimal dividend, reinsurance, and capital injection strategy to maximize the expected weighted sum of the total dividend payments until the first ruin. We completely solve this problem and obtain the value function and optimal strategies in closed form. We show that the optimal dividend strategy is a threshold strategy, and the more important line always has a lower threshold to pay dividends. The optimal proportion of risk ceded to the reinsurer is decreasing with respect to the aggregate reserve level for each line, and capital injection is only used to prevent the ruin of a business line. Finally, numerical examples are presented to illustrate the impact of model parameters on the optimal strategies.</description>

      <title>Hilbert Space-Valued LQ Mean Field Games: An Infinite-Dimensional Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01012v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive study of linear-quadratic (LQ) mean field games (MFGs) in Hilbert spaces, generalizing the classic LQ MFG theory to scenarios involving $N$ agents with dynamics governed by infinite-dimensional stochastic equations. In this framework, both state and control processes of each agent take values in separable Hilbert spaces. All agents are coupled through the average state of the population which appears in their linear dynamics and quadratic cost functional. Specifically, the dynamics of each agent incorporates an infinite-dimensional noise, namely a $Q$-Wiener process, and an unbounded operator. The diffusion coefficient of each agent is stochastic involving the state, control, and average state processes. We first study the well-posedness of a system of $N$ coupled semilinear infinite-dimensional stochastic evolution equations establishing the foundation of MFGs in Hilbert spaces. We then specialize to $N$-player LQ games described above and study the asymptotic behaviour as the number of agents, $N$, approaches infinity. We develop an infinite-dimensional variant of the Nash Certainty Equivalence principle and characterize a unique Nash equilibrium for the limiting MFG. Finally, we study the connections between the $N$-player game and the limiting MFG, demonstrating that the empirical average state converges to the mean field and that the resulting limiting best-response strategies form an $\epsilon$-Nash equilibrium for the $N$-player game in Hilbert spaces.</description>

      <title>Learning to Optimally Stop Diffusion Processes, with Financial Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09242v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study optimal stopping for diffusion processes with unknown model primitives within the continuous-time reinforcement learning (RL) framework developed by Wang et al. (2020), and present applications to option pricing and portfolio choice. By penalizing the corresponding variational inequality formulation, we transform the stopping problem into a stochastic optimal control problem with two actions. We then randomize controls into Bernoulli distributions and add an entropy regularizer to encourage exploration. We derive a semi-analytical optimal Bernoulli distribution, based on which we devise RL algorithms using the martingale approach established in Jia and Zhou (2022a). We establish a policy improvement theorem and prove the fast convergence of the resulting policy iterations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithms in pricing finite-horizon American put options, solving Merton's problem with transaction costs, and scaling to high-dimensional optimal stopping problems. In particular, we show that both the offline and online algorithms achieve high accuracy in learning the value functions and characterizing the associated free boundaries.</description>
