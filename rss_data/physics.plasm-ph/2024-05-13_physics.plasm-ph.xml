      <title>Data-driven discovery of a model equation describing self-oscillations of direct current discharge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data-driven techniques developed in recent years for the discovery of equations describing complex physical phenomena open unique opportunities for plasma physics. These methods allow getting insights into the processes difficult for analytical description. Since gas discharges can be represented as complex electrical circuits consisting of impedances and capacitances, it looks natural to use the data-driven techniques to study their complex dynamics. In the present paper, the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) method is applied to analyze the self-oscillations of direct current discharge in argon. It is obtained that the third order polynomials describe best the oscillations of the discharge voltage and current. They allow an accurate capturing of the oscillations amplitudes as well as the harmonics of these oscillations. To understand the physical meaning of each term, an analytical model is presented which describes the discharge self-oscillations.</description>

      <title>Optimised stellarators with a positive radial electric field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We draw attention to an interesting possibility in the design and operation of stellarator fusion reactors, which has hitherto been considered unrealistic under burning-plasma conditions. Thanks to recent advances in stellarator optimisation theory, it appears possible to create a positive (outward-pointing) radial electric field in the plasma core by carefully tailoring the geometry of the magnetic field. This electric field is likely to expel highly charged impurities from the centre of the plasma through neoclassical transport and thus eliminate, or at least mitigate, a long-standing problem in stellarator physics. Further out, the electric field is expected to suddenly change sign from positive to negative, thus creating a region of strongly sheared flow, which could locally suppress turbulent transport and enhance overall energy confinement.</description>

      <title>Two-Plasmon-Decay Instability Stimulated by a Normal- and Large-Angle-Incidence Laser Pair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The two-plasmon-decay instability (TPD) is a critical target preheating risk in direct-drive inertial confinement fusion. In this paper, TPD collectively driven by a normal-incidence laser beam (Beam-N) and a large-angle-incidence laser beam (Beam-L) is investigated via particle-in-cell simulations. Significant TPD growth is found able to develop in this regime at previously unexpected low laser intensities if the intensity of Beam-L exceeds the large-angle-incidence threshold. Both beams contribute to the growth of TPD in a "seed-amplification" manner where the absolute instability driven by Beam-L provides the seeds that get convectively amplified by Beam-N, making TPD energetically important and causing significant pump depletion and hot electron generation.</description>

      <title>Piecewise omnigenous stellarators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In omnigeneous magnetic fields, charged particles are perfectly confined in the absence of collisions and turbulence. For this reason, the magnetic configuration is optimized to be close to omnigenity in any candidate for a stellarator fusion reactor. However, approaching omnigenity imposes severe constraints on the spatial variation of the magnetic field. In particular, the topology of the contours of constant magnetic-field-strength on each magnetic surface must be such that there are no particles transitioning between different types of wells. This, in turn, usually leads to complicated plasma shapes and coils. This Letter presents a new family of optimized fields that display tokamak-like collisional energy transport while having transitioning particles. This result radically broadens the space of accessible reactor-relevant configurations.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Structured Spin-Manipulation of Relativistic Lepton Beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relativistic spin-polarized (SP) lepton beams are important for investigating spin-dependent interaction processes. In particular, spatially structured spin-polarized (SSP) lepton beams may find new applications in material, atomic, nuclear, high-energy physics and new physics beyond the Standard Model. However, realizing ultrafast generation and spin-manipulation of relativistic SSP lepton beams pose significant challenges. Here, we put forward a novel method of ultrafast (picosecond-timescale) generation of a relativistic SSP lepton beam via employing a moderate terahertz (THz) wave in a dielectric-lined waveguide (DWL). We first find that lepton beams with customizable spin-polarization structures can be generated by utilizing different electromagnetic modes, and optimizing the lepton velocity and THz phase velocity can improve efficiency of spin-manipulation and visibility of the SP structure. These SSP beams play a profound role in studying magnetic effects in material physics, chiral-selective chemistry, generation of structured $\gamma$-rays, etc., and open a new avenue for research on relativistic SP particles.</description>

      <title>Conservative dielectric functions and electrical conductivities from the multicomponent Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A considerable number of semi-empirical and first-principles models have been created to describe the dynamic response of a collisionally damped charged-particle system. However, known challenges persist for established dynamic structure factors (DSF), dielectric functions, and conductivities. For instance, the semi-empirical Drude-Smith conductivity [N.M. Smith, Phys. Rev. B 64, 155106 (2001)] lacks interpretability, and the first-principles Mermin dielectric function [N.D. Mermin, Phys. Rev. B, 1, 2362 (1970)] does not satisfy the frequency sum rule [G.S. Atwal and N.W. Ashcroft, Phys. Rev. B 65, 115109 (2002)]. In this work, starting from the multicomponent Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) kinetic equation, we produce a multi-species susceptibility that conserves number and momentum, which we refer to as the ``completed Mermin'' susceptibility, and we explore its properties and uses. We show that the completed Mermin susceptibility satisfies the frequency sum (f-sum) rule. We compute the associated DSF and find that momentum conservation qualitatively impacts the DSF's shape for a carbon-contaminated deuterium and tritium plasma under NIF hot-spot conditions. In the appendices, we provide numerical implementations of the completed Mermin susceptibility, for the reader's convenience. Further, we produce a new non-Drude conductivity model, by taking the single-species limit and introducing free parameters in the terms that enforce number and momentum conservation. To illustrate how number and momentum conservation impact the dynamical conductivity shape, we apply our conductivity model to dynamical gold conductivity measurements [Z. Chen, et al., Nature communications, 12.1, 1638, (2021)]. Finally, comparing our model to the Drude-Smith conductivity model, we conclude that Smith's phenomenological parameter violates local number conservation.</description>

      <title>Particle acceleration in relativistic Alfv\'enic turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong magnetically dominated Alfv\'enic turbulence is an efficient engine of non-thermal particle acceleration in a relativistic collisionless plasma. We argue that in the limit of strong magnetization, the type of energy distribution attained by accelerated particles depends on the relative strengths of turbulent fluctuations $\delta B_0$ and the guide field $B_0$. If $\delta B_0\ll B_0$, the particle magnetic moments are conserved and the acceleration is provided by magnetic curvature drifts. Curvature acceleration energizes particles in the direction parallel to the magnetic field lines, resulting in log-normal tails of particle energy distribution functions. Conversely, if $\delta B_0 \gtrsim B_0$, interactions of energetic particles with intense turbulent structures can scatter particles, creating a population with large pitch angles. In this case, magnetic mirror effects become important, and turbulent acceleration leads to power-law tails of the energy distribution functions.</description>

      <title>Small-Signal Model for Inhomogeneous Helix Traveling-Wave Tubes using Transfer Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a practical method for modeling the small-signal behavior of dispersive and inhomogeneous helix-type traveling-wave tube (TWT) amplifiers based on a generalization of the one-dimensional Pierce model. Our model is applicable to both single-stage and multi-stage TWTs. Like the Pierce model, we assume that electrons flow linearly in one direction, parallel and in proximity to a slow-wave structure (SWS) which guides a single dominant electromagnetic mode. Realistic helix TWTs are modeled with position dependent and frequency-dependent SWS characteristics, such as loss, phase velocity, plasma frequency reduction factor, and interaction impedance. For the multi-stage helix TWT, we provide a simple lumped element circuit model for combining the stages separated by a sever, or gap, which attenuates the guided circuit mode while allowing the space-charge wave on the beam to pass freely to the next stage. The dispersive SWS characteristics are accounted for using full-wave eigenmode simulations for a realistic helix SWS supported by dielectric rods in a metal barrel, all of which contribute to the distributed circuit loss. We compare our computed gain vs frequency, computed using transfer matrices, to results found through particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations and the 1D TWT code LATTE to demonstrate the accuracy of our model. Furthermore, we demonstrate the ability of our model to reproduce gain ripple due to mismatches at the input and output ports of the TWT.</description>

      <title>Acceleration of electrons and ions by an "almost" astrophysical shock in the heliosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collisionless shock waves, ubiquitous in the universe, are crucial for particle acceleration in various astrophysical systems. Currently, the heliosphere is the only natural environment available for their in situ study. In this work, we showcase the collective acceleration of electrons and ions by one of the fastest in situ shocks ever recorded, observed by the pioneering Parker Solar Probe at only 34.5 million kilometers from the Sun. Our analysis of this unprecedented, near-parallel shock shows electron acceleration up to 6 MeV amidst intense multi-scale electromagnetic wave emissions. We also present evidence of a variable shock structure capable of injecting and accelerating ions from the solar wind to high energies through a self-consistent process. The exceptional capability of the probe's instruments to measure electromagnetic fields in a shock traveling at 1% the speed of light has enabled us, for the first time, to confirm that the structure of a strong heliospheric shock aligns with theoretical models of strong shocks observed in astrophysical environments. This alignment offers viable avenues for understanding astrophysical shock processes and the acceleration of charged particles.</description>

      <title>The impact of electron inertia on collisional laser absorption for high energy density plasmas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.02415v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-power lasers are at the forefront of science in many domains. While their fields are still far from reaching the Schwinger limit, they have been used in extreme regimes, to successfully accelerate particles at high energies, or to reproduce phenomena observed in astrophysical settings. However, our understanding of laser plasma interactions is limited by numerical simulations, which are very expensive to run as short temporal and spatial scales need to be resolved explicitly. Under such circumstances, a non-collisional approach to model laser-plasma interactions becomes numerically expensive. Even a collisional approach, modeling the electrons and ions as independent fluids, is slow in practice. In both cases, the limitation comes from a direct computation of electron motion. In this work, we show how the generalized Ohm's law captures collisional absorption phenomena through the macroscopic interactions of laser fields, electron flows, and ion dynamics. This approach replicates several features usually associated with explicit electron motion, such as cut-off density, reflection and absorption. As the electron dynamics is now solved implicitly, the spatial and temporal scales of this model fit well between multi-fluid and standard magnetohydrodynamics scales, allowing to study a new class of problems that would be too expensive to solve numerically with other methods.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the role of cosmic-ray driven Alfv\'en waves in pre-existing magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. I. Turbulent damping rates and feedback on background fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02901v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Alfv\'en waves (AWs) excited by the cosmic-ray (CR) streaming instability (CRSI) are a fundamental ingredient for CR confinement. The effectiveness of self-confinement relies on a balance between CRSI growth rate and damping mechanisms acting on quasi-parallel AWs excited by CRs. One relevant mechanism is the so-called turbulent damping, in which an AW packet injected in pre-existing turbulence undergoes a cascade process due to its nonlinear interaction with fluctuations of the background. The turbulent damping of an AW packet in pre-existing magnetohydrodynamic turbulence is re-examined, revised, and extended to include most-recent theories of MHD turbulence that account for dynamic alignment and reconnection-mediated regime. The case in which the role of feedback of CR-driven AWs on pre-existing turbulence is important will also be discussed. Particular attention is given to the nonlinearity parameter $\chi^w$ that estimates the strength of nonlinear interaction between CR-driven AWs and background fluctuations. We point out the difference between $\chi^w$ and $\chi^z$ that instead describes the strength of nonlinear interactions between pre-existing fluctuations. When $\chi^w$ is properly taken into account, one finds that (i) the turbulent damping rate of quasi-parallel AWs in anisotropic turbulence depends on the background-fluctuations' amplitude to the third power, hence is strongly suppressed, and (ii) the dependence on the AW's wavelength (and thus on the CR gyro-radius from which it is excited) is different from what has been previously obtained. Finally, (iii) when dynamic alignment of cascading fluctuations and the possibility of a reconnection-mediated range is included in the picture, the turbulent damping rate exhibits novel regimes and breaks. Finally, a criterion for CR-feedback is derived and simple phenomenological models of CR-modified turbulent scaling are provided.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08694v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A stellarator design is described with the purpose of achieving three goals: (1) Enhance the confinement time of tritium. (2) Have a sufficient density of high-Z impurities to radiate the thermal power escaping from the core while having an extremely low impurity density in the core. (3) Maintain a large fraction of the plasma in a burning plasma state with a 50/50 deuterium tritium ratio. Some features of this design could be used in tokamaks. Although having three confinement zones is natural for stellarators, it is not for tokamaks.</description>

      <title>Exploring relaxation dynamics in warm dense plasmas by tailoring non-thermal electron distributions with a free electron laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04240v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Knowing the characteristic relaxation time of free electrons in a dense plasma is crucial to our understanding of plasma equilibration and transport. However, experimental investigations of electron relaxation dynamics have been hindered by the ultra-fast, sub-femtosecond time scales on which these interactions typically take place. Here we propose a novel approach that uses x-rays from a free electron laser to generate well-defined non-thermal electron distributions, which can then be tracked via emission spectroscopy from radiative recombination as they thermalize. Collisional radiative simulations reveal how this method can enable the measurement of electron relaxation time scales {\it in situ}, shedding light on the applicability and accuracy of the Coulomb Logarithm framework for modelling collisions in dense plasmas.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09379v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an efficient semi-Lagrangian characteristic mapping method for solving the one+one-dimensional Vlasov-Poisson equations with high precision on a coarse grid. The flow map is evolved numerically and exponential resolution in linear time is obtained. Global third-order convergence in space and time is shown and conservation properties are assessed. For benchmarking, we consider linear and nonlinear Landau damping and the two-stream instability. We compare the results with a Fourier pseudo-spectral method. The extreme fine-scale resolution features are illustrated showing the method's capabilities to efficiently treat filamentation in fusion plasma simulations.</description>
