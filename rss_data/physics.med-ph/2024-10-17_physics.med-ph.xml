      <title>AutoSimTTF: A Fully Automatic Pipeline for Electric Field Simulation and Treatment Planning of Tumor Treating Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective: Tumor Treating Fields (TTFields) is an emerging approach for cancer therapy that inhibits tumor cell proliferation by applying alternating electric fields (EF) of intermediate frequency and low intensity. The TTFields-induced electric field intensity at the tumor site is closely related to the therapeutic efficacy. Therefore, the EF simulation based on realistic head models have been utilized for the dosage analysis and treatment optimization of TTFields. However, current modeling methods require manual segmentation of tumors and rely on commercial software, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Approach: We introduce AutoSimTTF, a fully automatic pipeline for simulating and optimizing the EF distribution for TTFields. The main steps of AutoSimTTF utilize open-source toolkits, enabling fully automated processing of individual MRI data for TTFields. Additionally, AutoSimTTF allows for parameter optimization based on individual anatomical information, thereby achieving a more focused and higher EF distribution at the tumor site. Main results: Compared to conventional EF calculation processes, deviations in AutoSimTTF are below 20%. The optimal treatment parameters generated by AutoSimTTF produces a higher EF intensity at the tumor site (111.9%) and better focality (19.4%) compared to traditional TTFields settings. Significance: AutoSimTTF provides significant reference value and guidance for the clinical application and treatment planning of TTFields.</description>

      <title>Radiation damage and recovery of plastic scintillators under ultra-high dose rate 200 MeV electrons at CERN CLEAR facility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The FLASH effect holds significant potential in improving radiotherapy treatment outcomes. Very high energy electrons (VHEEs) can effectively target tumors deep in the body and can be accelerated to achieve ultra-high dose rates (UHDR), making them a promising modality for delivering FLASH radiotherapy in the clinic. However, apart from suitable VHEE sources, clinical translation requires accurate dosimetry, which is challenging due to the limitation of standard dosimeters under UHDR. Water-equivalent and real-time plastic scintillation dosimeters (PSDs) may offer a solution. In this study, a 4-channel PSD, consisting of polystyrene-based BCF12 and Medscint proprietary scintillators, polyvinyltoluene (PVT)-based EJ-212 and a clear plastic fiber channel for Cherenkov subtraction was exposed to the 200 MeV VHEE UHDR beam at the CLEAR CERN facility. The Hyperscint RP200 platform was used to assess linearity to dose pulses of up to 90 Gy and dose rates up to 4.6x10$^9$ Gy/s, and to investigate radiation damage and recovery after dose accumulation of 37.2 kGy. While clear fiber response was linear across the entire dose range studied, light output saturated above ~50 Gy/pulse for scintillators. Despite radiation damage, linearity was preserved, though it resulted in a decrease of scintillator and clear fiber light output of &lt;1.85 %/kGy and a shift in spectra towards longer wavelengths. Short-term recovery (&lt;100h) of these changes was observed and depended on rest duration and accumulated dose. After long-term rest (&lt;172 days), light output recovery was partial, with 6-22% of residual permanent damage remaining, while spectral recovery was complete. We showed that PSDs are sensitive to radiation damage, but maintain dose linearity even after accumulated dose of 37.2 kGy, and exhibit significant response recovery. This work highlights the potential of PSDs for dosimetry in UHDR conditions.</description>

      <title>Segmented readout for Cherenkov time-of-flight positron emission tomography detectors based on bismuth germanate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Positron emission tomography (PET) is the most sensitive biomedical imaging modality for non-invasively detecting and visualizing positron-emitting radiopharmaceuticals within a subject. In PET, measuring the time-of-flight (TOF) information for each pair of 511-keV annihilation photons improves effective sensitivity but requires high timing resolution. Hybrid materials that emit both scintillation and Cherenkov photons, such as bismuth germanate (BGO), recently offer the potential for more precise timing information from Cherenkov photons while maintaining adequate energy resolution from scintillation photons. However, a significant challenge in using such hybrid materials for TOF PET applications lies in the event-dependent timing spread caused by the mixed detection of Cherenkov and scintillation photons due to relatively lower production of Cherenkov photons. This study introduces an innovative approach by segmenting silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) pixels coupled to a single crystal, rather than using traditional SiPMs that are as large as or larger than the crystals they read. We demonstrated that multiple time stamps and photon counts obtained from the segmented SiPM can classify events by providing temporal photon density, effectively addressing this challenge. The approach and findings would lead to new opportunities in applications that require precise timing and photon counting, spanning the fields of medical imaging, high-energy physics, and optical physics.</description>

      <title>In-vivo high-resolution \chi-separation at 7T</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12239v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A recently introduced quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) technique, $\chi$-separation, offers the capability to separate paramagnetic ($\chi_{\text{para}}$) and diamagnetic ($\chi_{\text{dia}}$) susceptibility distribution within the brain. In-vivo high-resolution mapping of iron and myelin distribution, estimated by $\chi$-separation, could provide a deeper understanding of brain substructures, assisting the investigation of their functions and alterations. This can be achieved using 7T MRI, which benefits from a high signal-to-noise ratio and susceptibility effects. However, applying $\chi$-separation at 7T presents difficulties due to the requirement of an $R_2$ map, coupled with issues such as high specific absorption rate (SAR), large $B_1$ transmit field inhomogeneities, and prolonged scan time.
  To address these challenges, we developed a novel deep neural network, R2PRIMEnet7T, designed to convert a 7T $R_2^*$ map into a 3T $R_2'$ map. Building on this development, we present a new pipeline for $\chi$-separation at 7T, enabling us to generate high-resolution $\chi$-separation maps from multi-echo gradient-echo data. The proposed method is compared with alternative pipelines, such as an end-to-end network and linearly-scaled $R_2'$, and is validated against $\chi$-separation maps at 3T, demonstrating its accuracy. The 7T $\chi$-separation maps generated by the proposed method exhibit similar contrasts to those from 3T, while 7T high-resolution maps offer enhanced clarity and detail. Quantitative analysis confirms that the proposed method surpasses the alternative pipelines. The proposed method results well delineate the detailed brain structures associated with iron and myelin. This new pipeline holds promise for analyzing iron and myelin concentration changes in various neurodegenerative diseases through precise structural examination.</description>

      <title>Imaging neutrons with a position-sensitive monolithic CLYC detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we have developed and characterized a position-sensitive CLYC detector that acts as the neutron imaging layer and $\gamma$-ray Compton scatterer of the novel dual \g-ray and neutron imaging system GN-Vision, which aims at simultaneously obtaining information about the spatial origin of \g-ray and neutron sources. We first investigated the performance of large 50$\times$50~mm$^{2}$ monolithic CLYC crystals coupled to a pixelated SiPM in terms of energy resolution and neutron-gamma discrimination. The response of two different 95\% $^{6}$Li-enriched CLYC detectors coupled to an array of 8$\times$8 SiPMs was studied in comparison to the results of a conventional photo-multiplier tube. Energy resolution ranging from 6-8\% for the $^{137}$Cs peak and a figure of merit of 3-4 for the neutron-gamma discrimination have been obtained. The spatial response of the CLYC-SiPM detector to $\gamma$-rays and neutrons has also been characterized using charge modulation-based multiplexing techniques based on a diode-coupled charge division circuit. Average resolutions close to 5~mm FWHM with good linearity are obtained in the transverse crystal plane. Last, this work presents the first proof-of-concept experiments of the neutron imaging capability using a neutron pinhole collimator attached to the developed position sensitive CLYC detector.</description>

      <title>Exploring Smartphone-based Spectrophotometry for Nutrient Identification and Quantification</title>

Abstract: Imbalanced nutrition is a global health issue with significant downstream effects. Current methods of assessing nutrient levels face several limitations, with accessibility being a major concern. In this paper, we take a step towards accessibly measuring nutrient status within the body. We explore the potential of smartphone-based spectrophotometry for identifying and quantifying nutrients in a solution by building and testing two prototype devices. We compared the prototypes and found that the limitations posed by the initial, simpler prototype were well addressed in the more portable and reliable second-generation device. With the second-generation prototype, we created and implemented a semi-automatic signal processing and analysis pipeline for analyzing absorption spectra. We thoroughly evaluated the prototypes by analyzing the effect of four different light sources and three reference spectra strategies. Results demonstrate that an LED bulb light source performed best, and all reference spectra strategies performed similarly. We then compared the second-generation prototype to a benchtop laboratory spectrophotometer to further validate the device. We applied the Beer-Lambert Law to demonstrate that our prototype is able to quantify the amount of vitamin B12 in a solution with an accuracy of up to 91.3%. Our in-depth analyses, discussions, and results demonstrate the potential use of smartphone-based spectrophotometry as an accessible method to identify and quantify nutrients and pave the way for future developments that can apply this approach to the human body.</description>
