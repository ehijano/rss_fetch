      <title>Efficient handover based on Near-field and Far-field RIS for seamless connectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) is becoming a transformative technology for the upcoming 6G communication networks, providing a way for smartly maneuvering the electromagnetic waves to enhance coverage and connectivity. This paper presents an efficient handover (HO) management scheme leveraging RIS in the Fresnel region i.e., in both the near-field (NF) and far-field (FF) regions to reduce signaling overhead and optimize mobility management. For this, we analyzed the signal strength variations in the considered RIS-aided networks, considering the radiative NF and FF regions, and derive the probability density function (PDF) of the RIS-UE distance in the NF region to quantify RIS reflection gains along the user equipment (UE) trajectory. We propose a new HO algorithm incorporating several HO categories like hard handover (HHO), soft handover (SHO), RIS-aided cell breathing (RIS-CB), and RIS-aided ping-pong avoidance (RIS-PP) strategies. The proposed algorithm uses bit error rate (BER) as a key parameter to predict the minimization of unnecessary HOs by using RIS-aided pathways to retain connectivity with the serving base station (BS), which minimizes the requirement for frequent target BS searching and ultimately optimizes the HO. By restricting measurement reports and HO requests, the suggested method improves spectrum efficiency (SE) and energy efficiency (EE), especially in crowded cellular networks. Numerical results highlight significant reductions in HO rates and signaling load, ensuring seamless connectivity and improved quality of service (QoS) in 6G systems.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning for Gradient and BCG Artifacts Removal in EEG During Simultaneous fMRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simultaneous EEG-fMRI recording combines high temporal and spatial resolution for tracking neural activity. However, its usefulness is greatly limited by artifacts from magnetic resonance (MR), especially gradient artifacts (GA) and ballistocardiogram (BCG) artifacts, which interfere with the EEG signal. To address this issue, we used a denoising autoencoder (DAR), a deep learning framework designed to reduce MR-related artifacts in EEG recordings. Using paired data that includes both artifact-contaminated and MR-corrected EEG from the CWL EEG-fMRI dataset, DAR uses a 1D convolutional autoencoder to learn a direct mapping from noisy to clear signal segments. Compared to traditional artifact removal methods like principal component analysis (PCA), independent component analysis (ICA), average artifact subtraction (AAS), and wavelet thresholding, DAR shows better performance. It achieves a root-mean-squared error (RMSE) of 0.0218 $\pm$ 0.0152, a structural similarity index (SSIM) of 0.8885 $\pm$ 0.0913, and a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) gain of 14.63 dB. Statistical analysis with paired t-tests confirms that these improvements are significant (p&lt;0.001; Cohen's d&gt;1.2). A leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) cross-validation protocol shows that the model generalizes well, yielding an average RMSE of 0.0635 $\pm$ 0.0110 and an SSIM of 0.6658 $\pm$ 0.0880 across unseen subjects. Additionally, saliency-based visualizations demonstrate that DAR highlights areas with dense artifacts, which makes its decisions easier to interpret. Overall, these results position DAR as a potential and understandable solution for real-time EEG artifact removal in simultaneous EEG-fMRI applications.</description>

      <title>Robust Filtering and Learning in State-Space Models: Skewness and Heavy Tails Via Asymmetric Laplace Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State-space models are pivotal for dynamic system analysis but often struggle with outlier data that deviates from Gaussian distributions, frequently exhibiting skewness and heavy tails. This paper introduces a robust extension utilizing the asymmetric Laplace distribution, specifically tailored to capture these complex characteristics. We propose an efficient variational Bayes algorithm and a novel single-loop parameter estimation strategy, significantly enhancing the efficiency of the filtering, smoothing, and parameter estimation processes. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our methods provide consistently robust performance across various noise settings without the need for manual hyperparameter adjustments. In stark contrast, existing models generally rely on specific noise conditions and necessitate extensive manual tuning. Moreover, our approach uses far fewer computational resources, thereby validating the model's effectiveness and underscoring its potential for practical applications in fields such as robust control and financial modeling.</description>

      <title>Green One-Bit Quantized Precoding in Cell-Free Massive MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cell-free massive MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) is expected to be one of the key technologies in sixth-generation (6G) and beyond wireless communications, offering enhanced spectral efficiency for cell-edge user equipments by employing joint transmission and reception with a large number of antennas distributed throughout the region. However, high-resolution RF chains associated with these antennas significantly increase power consumption. To address this issue, the use of low-resolution analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog converters (ADCs/DACs) has emerged as a promising approach to balance power efficiency and performance in massive MIMO networks. In this work, we propose a novel quantized precoding algorithm tailored for cell-free massive MIMO systems, where the proposed method dynamically deactivates unnecessary antennas based on the structure of each symbol vector, thereby enhancing energy efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms existing methods such as squared-infinity norm Douglas-Rachford splitting (SQUID) and regularized zero forcing (RZF), achieving superior performance while effectively reducing power consumption.</description>

      <title>PINN and GNN-based RF Map Construction for Wireless Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio frequency (RF) map is a promising technique for capturing the characteristics of multipath signal propagation, offering critical support for channel modeling, coverage analysis, and beamforming in wireless communication networks. This paper proposes a novel RF map construction method based on a combination of physics-informed neural network (PINN) and graph neural network (GNN). The PINN incorporates physical constraints derived from electromagnetic propagation laws to guide the learning process, while the GNN models spatial correlations among receiver locations. By parameterizing multipath signals into received power, delay, and angle of arrival (AoA), and integrating both physical priors and spatial dependencies, the proposed method achieves accurate prediction of multipath parameters. Experimental results demonstrate that the method enables high-precision RF map construction under sparse sampling conditions and delivers robust performance in both indoor and complex outdoor environments, outperforming baseline methods in terms of generalization and accuracy.</description>

      <title>Exploration of Low-Cost but Accurate Radar-Based Human Motion Direction Determination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work is completed on a whim after discussions with my junior colleague. The motion direction angle affects the micro-Doppler spectrum width, thus determining the human motion direction can provide important prior information for downstream tasks such as gait recognition. However, Doppler-Time map (DTM)-based methods still have room for improvement in achieving feature augmentation and motion determination simultaneously. In response, a low-cost but accurate radar-based human motion direction determination (HMDD) method is explored in this paper. In detail, the radar-based human gait DTMs are first generated, and then the feature augmentation is achieved using feature linking model. Subsequently, the HMDD is implemented through a lightweight and fast Vision Transformer-Convolutional Neural Network hybrid model structure. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified through open-source dataset. The open-source code of this work is released at: https://github.com/JoeyBGOfficial/Low-Cost-Accurate-Radar-Based-Human-Motion-Direction-Determination.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Limits of Rigid Body Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a novel approach to formulate the Cram\'er-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) for the rigid body localization (RBL) problem, which allows us to assess the fundamental accuracy limits on the estimation of the translation and rotation of a rigid body with respect to a known reference. To that end, we adopt an information-centric construction of the Fisher information matrix (FIM), which allows to capture the contribution of each measurement towards the FIM, both in terms of input measurement types, as well as of their error distributions. Taking advantage of this approach, we derive a generic framework for the CRLB formulation, which is applicable to any type of rigid body localization scenario, extending the conventional FIM formulation suitable for point targets to the case of a rigid body whose location include both translation vector and the rotation matrix (or alternative the rotation angles), with respect to a reference. Closed-form expressions for all CRLBs are given, including the bound incorporating an orthonormality constraint onto the rotation matrix. Numerical results illustrate that the derived expression correctly lower-bounds the errors of estimated localization parameters obtained via various related state-of-the-art (SotA) estimators, revealing their accuracies and suggesting that SotA RBL algorithms can still be improved.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Scale Spatial Attention Network for Near-field MIMO Channel Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The deployment of extremely large-scale array (ELAA) brings higher spectral efficiency and spatial degree of freedom, but triggers issues on near-field channel estimation.
  Existing near-field channel estimation schemes primarily exploit sparsity in the transform domain.
  However, these schemes are sensitive to the transform matrix selection and the stopping criteria.
  Inspired by the success of deep learning (DL) in far-field channel estimation, this paper proposes a novel spatial-attention-based method for reconstructing extremely large-scale MIMO (XL-MIMO) channel.
  Initially, the spatial antenna correlations of near-field channels are analyzed as an expectation over the angle-distance space, which demonstrate correlation range of an antenna element varies with its position.
  Due to the strong correlation between adjacent antenna elements, interactions of inter-subchannel are applied to describe inherent correlation of near-field channels instead of inter-element.
  Subsequently, a multi-scale spatial attention network (MsSAN) with the inter-subchannel correlation learning capabilities is proposed tailed to near-field MIMO channel estimation.
  We employ the multi-scale architecture to refine the subchannel size in MsSAN.
  Specially, we inventively introduce the sum of dot products as spatial attention (SA) instead of cross-covariance to weight subchannel features at different scales in the SA module.
  Simulation results are presented to validate the proposed MsSAN achieves remarkable the inter-subchannel correlation learning capabilities and outperforms others in terms of near-field channel reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Compressive Near-Field Wideband Channel Estimation for THz Extremely Large-scale MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the channel acquisition problem for a wideband terahertz (THz) communication system, where an extremely large-scale array is deployed to mitigate severe path attenuation. In channel modeling, we account for both the near-field spherical wavefront and the wideband beam-splitting phenomena, resulting in a wideband near-field channel. We propose a frequency-independent orthogonal dictionary that generalizes the standard discrete Fourier transform (DFT) matrix by introducing an additional parameter to capture the near-field property. This dictionary enables the wideband near-field channel to be efficiently represented with a two-dimensional (2D) block-sparse structure. Leveraging this specific sparse structure, the wideband near-field channel estimation problem can be effectively addressed within a customized compressive sensing framework. Numerical results demonstrate the significant advantages of our proposed 2D block-sparsity-aware method over conventional polar-domain-based approaches for near-field wideband channel estimation.</description>

      <title>Decoding Neural Signatures of Semantic Evaluations in Depression and Suicidality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Depression and suicidality profoundly impact cognition and emotion, yet objective neurophysiological biomarkers remain elusive. We investigated the spatiotemporal neural dynamics underlying affective semantic processing in individuals with varying levels of clinical severity of depression and suicidality using multivariate decoding of electroencephalography (EEG) data. Participants (N=137) completed a sentence evaluation task involving emotionally charged self-referential statements while EEG was recorded. We identified robust, neural signatures of semantic processing, with peak decoding accuracy between 300-600 ms -- a window associated with automatic semantic evaluation and conflict monitoring. Compared to healthy controls, individuals with depression and suicidality showed earlier onset, longer duration, and greater amplitude decoding responses, along with broader cross-temporal generalization and increased activation of frontocentral and parietotemporal components. These findings suggest altered sensitivity and impaired disengagement from emotionally salient content in the clinical groups, advancing our understanding of the neurocognitive basis of mental health and providing a principled basis for developing reliable EEG-based biomarkers of depression and suicidality.</description>

      <title>802.11bf Multiband Passive Sensing: Reusing Wi-Fi Signaling for Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel multiband passive sensing system that leverages IEEE 802.11bf Wi-Fi signals for environmental sensing, focusing on both sub-7 GHz and millimeter-wave (mmWave) bands. By combining Channel State Information (CSI) from multiple bands, the system enhances accuracy and reliability in detecting human presence, movement, and activities in indoor environments. Utilizing a novel model, called MILAGRO, the system demonstrates robust performance across different scenarios, including monitoring human presence in workspaces and tracking movement in corridors. Experimental results show high accuracy (95-100%), with improved performance by integrating multiband data. The system also addresses key security concerns associated with passive sensing, proposing measures to mitigate potential risks. This work advances the use of Wi-Fi for passive sensing by reducing reliance on active sensing infrastructure and extending the capabilities of low-cost, non-intrusive environmental monitoring.</description>

      <title>Distributed Average Consensus in Wireless Multi-Agent Systems with Over-the-Air Aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the average consensus problem of multi-agent systems over wireless networks. We propose a distributed average consensus algorithm by invoking the concept of over-the-air aggregation, which exploits the signal superposition property of wireless multiple-access channels. The proposed algorithm deploys a modified version of the well-known Ratio Consensus algorithm with an additional normalization step for compensating for the arbitrary channel coefficients. We show that, when the noise level at the receivers is negligible, the algorithm converges asymptotically to the average for time-invariant and time-varying channels. Numerical simulations corroborate the validity of our results.</description>

      <title>Ambiguity-Aware Segmented Estimation of Mutual Coupling in Large RIS: Algorithm and Experimental Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimizing a real-life RIS-parametrized wireless channel with a physics-consistent multiport-network model necessitates prior remote estimation of the mutual coupling (MC) between RIS elements. The number of MC parameters grows quadratically with the number of RIS elements, posing scalability challenges. Because of inevitable ambiguities, independently estimated segments of the MC matrix cannot be easily stitched together. Here, by carefully handling the ambiguities, we achieve a separation of the full estimation problem into three sequentially treated sets of smaller problems. We partition the RIS elements into groups. First, we estimate the MC for one group as well as the characteristics of the available loads. Second, we separately estimate the MC for each of the remaining groups, in each case with partial overlap with an already characterized group. Third, we separately estimate the MC between each distinct pair of groups. Full parallelization is feasible within the second and third sets of problems, and the third set of problems can furthermore benefit from efficient initialization. We experimentally validate our algorithm for a 4x4 MIMO channel parametrized by a 100-element RIS inside a rich-scattering environment. Our experimentally calibrated 5867-parameter multiport-network model achieves an accuracy of 40.5 dB, whereas benchmark models with limited or no MC awareness only reach 17.0 dB and 13.8 dB, respectively. Based on the experimentally calibrated models, we optimize the RIS for five wireless performance indicators. Experimental measurements with the optimized RIS configurations demonstrate only moderate benefits of MC awareness in RIS optimization in terms of the achieved performance. However, we observe that limited or no MC awareness markedly erodes the reliability of model-based predictions of the expected performance.</description>

      <title>Morph: ChirpTransformer-based Encoder-decoder Co-design for Reliable LoRa Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose Morph, a LoRa encoder-decoder co-design to enhance communication reliability while improving its computation efficiency in extremely-low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) situations. The standard LoRa encoder controls 6 Spreading Factors (SFs) to tradeoff SNR tolerance with data rate. SF-12 is the maximum SF providing the lowest SNR tolerance on commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) LoRa nodes. In Morph, we develop an SF-configuration based encoder to mimic the larger SFs beyond SF-12 while it is compatible with COTS LoRa nodes. Specifically, we manipulate four SF configurations of a Morph symbol to encode 2-bit data. Accordingly, we recognize the used SF configuration of the symbol for data decoding. We leverage a Deep Neural Network (DNN) decoder to fully capture multi-dimensional features among diverse SF configurations to maximize the SNR gain. Moreover, we customize the input size, neural network structure, and training method of the DNN decoder to improve its efficiency, reliability, and generalizability. We implement Morph with COTS LoRa nodes and a USRP N210, then evaluate its performance on indoor and campus-scale testbeds. Results show that we can reliably decode data at -28.8~dB SNR, which is 6.4~dB lower than the standard LoRa with SF-12 chirps. In addition, the computation efficiency of our DNN decoder is about 3x higher than state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>Mutual Coupling-Aware Channel Estimation and Beamforming for RIS-Assisted Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04110v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work studies the problems of channel estimation and beamforming for active reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication, incorporating the mutual coupling (MC) effect through an electromagnetically consistent model. We first demonstrate that MC can be incorporated into a compressed sensing (CS) formulation, albeit with an increase in the dimensionality of the sensing matrix. To overcome this increased complexity, we propose a two-stage strategy. Initially, a low-complexity MC-unaware CS estimation is performed to obtain a coarse channel estimate, which is then used to implement a dictionary reduction (DR) for the MC-aware estimation, effectively reducing the dimensionality of the sensing matrices. This method achieves estimation accuracy close to the direct MC-aware CS method with less overall computational complexity. Furthermore, we consider the joint optimization of RIS configuration, base station precoding, and user combining in a single-user MIMO system. We employ an alternating optimization strategy to optimize these three beamformers. The primary challenge lies in optimizing the RIS configuration, as the MC effect renders the problem non-convex and intractable. To address this, we propose a novel algorithm based on the successive convex approximation (SCA) and the Neumann series expansion. Within the SCA framework, we propose a surrogate function that rigorously satisfies both convexity and equal-gradient conditions to update the iteration direction. Numerical results validate our proposal, demonstrating that the proposed channel estimation and beamforming methods effectively manage the MC in RIS, achieving higher spectral efficiency compared to state-of-the-art approaches.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis of Communication Signals for Localization in Underwater Sensor Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13330v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficient localization in underwater sensor networks faces challenges due to limited bandwidth, energy constraints, and hardware complexity. Traditional systems separate sensing and communication, often resulting in inefficient resource usage. To address this, integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has emerged, leveraging shared waveforms for both functions. This paper investigates the feasibility of using communication-centric waveforms for underwater localization. Specifically, we evaluate the performance of super-permutated frequency shift keying and multiple frequency shift keying signals using a Cramer-Rao lower bound framework in a simplified bistatic scenario. Simulations incorporate temporally correlated autoregressive AR(1) noise and varying signal-to-noise ratio levels to assess localization accuracy. A comparative analysis with a traditional sonar waveform, linear frequency modulated signal, highlights the potential of communication signals for dual-purpose ISAC applications in bistatic sonar configurations in underwater environments.</description>

      <title>Chirp-Permuted AFDM: A New Degree of Freedom for Next-Generation Versatile Waveform Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20825v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel multicarrier waveform, termed chirp-permuted affine frequency division multiplexing (CP-AFDM), which introduces a unique chirp-permutation domain on top of the chirp subcarriers of the conventional AFDM. Rigorous analysis of the signal model and waveform properties, supported by numerical simulations, demonstrates that the proposed CP-AFDM preserves all core characteristics of affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) - including robustness to doubly-dispersive channels, peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), and full delay-Doppler representation - while further enhancing ambiguity function resolution and peak-to-sidelobe ratio (PSLR) in the Doppler domain. These improvements establish CP-AFDM as a highly attractive candidate for emerging sixth generation (6G) use cases demanding both reliability and sensing-awareness. Moreover, by exploiting the vast degree of freedom in the chirp-permutation domain, two exemplary multifunctional applications are introduced: an index modulation (IM) technique over the permutation domain which achieves significant spectral efficiency gains, and a physical-layer security scheme that ensures practically perfect security through permutation-based keying, without requiring additional transmit energy or signaling overhead.</description>

      <title>Uncovering the role of semantic and acoustic cues in normal and dichotic listening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11308</link>

Abstract: Speech comprehension is an involuntary task for the healthy human brain, yet the understanding of the mechanisms underlying this brain functionality remains obscure. In this paper, we aim to quantify the role of acoustic and semantic information streams in complex listening conditions. We propose a paradigm to understand the encoding of the speech cues in electroencephalogram (EEG) data, by designing a match-mismatch (MM) classification task. The MM task involves identifying whether the stimulus (speech) and response (EEG) correspond to each other. We build a multimodal deep-learning based sequence model STEM, which is input with acoustic stimulus (speech envelope), semantic stimulus (textual representations of speech), and the neural response (EEG data).
  We perform extensive experiments on two separate conditions, i) natural passive listening and, ii) a dichotic listening requiring auditory attention. Using the MM task as the analysis framework, we observe that - a) speech perception is fragmented based on word boundaries, b) acoustic and semantic cues offer similar levels of MM task performance in natural listening conditions, and c) semantic cues offer significantly improved MM classification over acoustic cues in dichotic listening task. The comparison of the STEM with previously proposed MM models shows significant performance improvements for the proposed approach. The analysis and understanding from this study allows the quantification of the roles played by acoustic and semantic cues in diverse listening tasks and in providing further evidences of right-ear advantage in dichotic listening.</description>

      <title>ECG-Byte: A Tokenizer for End-to-End Generative Electrocardiogram Language Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14373v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional versatility across domains, including applications to electrocardiograms (ECGs). A growing body of work focuses on generating text from multi-channeled ECG signals and corresponding textual prompts. Existing approaches often involve a two-stage process: pretraining an ECG-specific encoder with a self-supervised learning (SSL) objective, followed by finetuning an LLM for natural language generation (NLG) using encoder-derived features. However, these methods face two key limitations: inefficiency due to multi-stage training and challenges in interpreting encoder-generated features. To overcome these issues, we propose ECG-Byte, an adapted byte pair encoding (BPE) tokenizer pipeline for autoregressive language modeling of ECGs. ECG-Byte compresses and encodes ECG signals into tokens, enabling direct end-to-end LLM training by combining ECG and text tokens. This approach enhances interpretability, as ECG tokens can be directly mapped back to the original signals. Leveraging ECG-Byte, we achieve competitive NLG performance while training 3 times faster and using just 48\% of the data required by traditional two-stage methods.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Learning in Echo State Networks for Input Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11409v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Echo state networks (ESNs) are a class of recurrent neural networks in which only the readout layer is trainable, while the recurrent and input layers are fixed. This architectural constraint enables computationally efficient processing of time-series data. Traditionally, the readout layer in ESNs is trained using supervised learning with target outputs. In this study, we focus on input reconstruction (IR), where the readout layer is trained to reconstruct the input time series fed into the ESN. We show that IR can be achieved through unsupervised learning (UL), without access to supervised targets, provided that the ESN parameters are known a priori and satisfy invertibility conditions. This formulation allows applications relying on IR, such as dynamical system replication and noise filtering, to be reformulated within the UL framework via straightforward integration with existing algorithms. Our results suggest that prior knowledge of ESN parameters can reduce reliance on supervision, thereby establishing a new principle: not only by fixing part of the network parameters but also by exploiting their specific values. Furthermore, our UL-based algorithms for input reconstruction and related tasks are suitable for autonomous processing, offering insights into how analogous computational mechanisms might operate in the brain in principle. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the mathematical foundations of ESNs and their relevance to models in computational neuroscience.</description>

      <title>Exploring Textual Semantics Diversity for Image Transmission in Semantic Communication Systems using Visual Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19386v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the rapid development of machine learning has brought reforms and challenges to traditional communication systems. Semantic communication has appeared as an effective strategy to effectively extract relevant semantic signals semantic segmentation labels and image features for image transmission. However, the insufficient number of extracted semantic features of images will potentially result in a low reconstruction accuracy, which hinders the practical applications and still remains challenging for solving. In order to fill this gap, this letter proposes a multi-text transmission semantic communication (Multi-SC) system, which uses the visual language model (VLM) to assist in the transmission of image semantic signals. Unlike previous image transmission semantic communication systems, the proposed system divides the image into multiple blocks and extracts multiple text information from the image using a modified large language and visual assistant (LLaVA), and combines semantic segmentation tags with semantic text for image recovery. Simulation results show that the proposed text semantics diversity scheme can significantly improve the reconstruction accuracy compared with related works.</description>

      <title>Quantum Meets SAR: A Novel Range-Doppler Algorithm for Next-Gen Earth Observation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01832v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) plays a vital role in remote sensing due to its ability to capture high-resolution images regardless of weather conditions or daylight. However, to transform the raw SAR signals into interpretable imagery, advanced data processing techniques are essential. A widely used technique for this purpose is the Range Doppler Algorithm (RDA), which takes advantage of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to convert signals into the frequency domain for further processing. However, the computational cost of this approach becomes significant when dealing with large datasets. This paper presents a Quantum Range Doppler Algorithm (QRDA) that utilizes the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) to accelerate processing compared to the classical FFT. Furthermore, it introduces a quantum implementation of the Range Cell Migration Correction (RCMC) in the Fourier domain, a critical step in the RDA pipeline that realigns the received echoes so that the energy from a target is concentrated in a single range bin across all azimuth positions. The performance of the quantum RCMC is evaluated and compared against its classical counterpart, demonstrating the potential of quantum computing in advanced SAR imaging.</description>

      <title>Delay-Doppler Diversity Analysis of ODDM Modulation in Satellite Communication Systems</title>

Abstract: Orthogonal delay-Doppler division multiplexing (ODDM) modulation offers a promising solution to the problem of severe Doppler effects in low earth orbit (LEO) satellites communications. It has been suggested in the recent literature that ODDM modulation can extract full delay-Doppler (DD) diversity, yet a rigorous analysis has not been presented. In this paper, we present a formal analysis of the DD diversity achieved by ODDM modulation along with supporting simulations. Specifically, the analysis and simulations reveal that the asymptotic DD diversity order of ODDM modulation is one, and this order is achieved at lower bit error rate (BER) values for increased frame sizes. We also present low-complexity detector for ODDM modulation based on the Orthogonal approximate message passing (OAMP) algorithm, and show that this detector extracts full DD diversity with the reduced complexity.</description>

      <title>Efficient Pain Recognition via Respiration Signals: A Single Cross-Attention Transformer Multi-Window Fusion Pipeline</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21886v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pain is a complex condition affecting a large portion of the population. Accurate and consistent evaluation is essential for individuals experiencing pain, and it supports the development of effective and advanced management strategies. Automatic pain assessment systems provide continuous monitoring and support clinical decision-making, aiming to reduce distress and prevent functional decline. This study has been submitted to the \textit{Second Multimodal Sensing Grand Challenge for Next-Gen Pain Assessment (AI4PAIN)}. The proposed method introduces a pipeline that leverages respiration as the input signal and incorporates a highly efficient cross-attention transformer alongside a multi-windowing strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that respiration is a valuable physiological modality for pain assessment. Moreover, experiments revealed that compact and efficient models, when properly optimized, can achieve strong performance, often surpassing larger counterparts. The proposed multi-window approach effectively captures both short-term and long-term features, as well as global characteristics, thereby enhancing the model's representational capacity.</description>
