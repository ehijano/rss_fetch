      <title>Que r\'ev\`ele l'activit\'e de validation de d\'emonstration circulaire sur la compr\'ehension de d\'emonstration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This communication contributes to research on proof validation as a lens for uncovering didactical phenomena related to proof and proving. We revisit the puzzling case of lower secondary students in France who validate circular proofs. That is proofs in which the conclusion is used within a step of the proof itself. While these 12--13-year-old students accurately identify the final statement of such proofs as a reformulation of the conclusion of the claim, they encounter difficulties in interpreting how the condition of the claim is taken up within the proof. Our analysis challenges Miyazaki and al.'s interpretation of this phenomenon, which attributes students' acceptation of the validity of circular reasoning to a misunderstanding of modus ponens when there are two in a row. Instead, we propose an alternative explanation grounded in the distinction between the operative and theoretical statuses of mathematical propositions. This distinction provides both a theoretical rationale for the invalidity of circular proofs and a didactical tool for examining students' argumentative activity when they attempt to reject such proofs.</description>

      <title>Catalan's conjecture is Mih\u{a}ilescu's theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This text evolves from the lecture notes for my course on Catalan's conjecture in winter term 2025/26. The ultimate goal is to give full details of Mih\u{a}ilescu's proof. Current chapters: 1. Euler's theorem: $x^2-y^3=1$; 2. V. Lebesgue's theorem: $x^m-y^2=1$; 3. Chao Ko's theorem: $x^2-y^q=1$ with $q\ge5$; 4. Two relations of Cassels: $p\,|\,y$ and $q\,|\,x$; 5. Mih\u{a}ilescu's theorem: $x^p-y^q=1$ with $p&gt;q&gt;2$; 6. An obstruction group; 7. Super-Cassels relations: $p^2\,|\,y$ and $q^2\,|\,x$; 8. Theorem M4: $p=3,5$ or $q=3,5$; A Results from mathematical anlysis; and B Results from algebra.</description>

      <title>Role of (periodic as well as aperiodic) tessellations in contemporary composition. The cases of Tesselles sonores and Le Chapeau \`a douze cornes by Marisa Acu\~na</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent discovery of a family of aperiodic monotiles, which includes David Smith's famous Hat, has shaken the field of plane tessellations. Music composers have already utilised the visual representation of plane tilings in their artwork (Tom Johnson through his use of Vuza's canons, talea and color in isorhythmic motets...). Constructions of the Hat from elementary geometric polygons provide a different perspective, for example through the sound transformation of microtonal intervals, as seen in Marisa Acu\~na's piece Le Chapeau \`a douze cornes.</description>

      <title>The Inverse Function Fallacy: On Sign Determination and Forgotten Fundamentals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19357v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although inverse functions are introduced early in algebra, many students remain unaware that an inverse expression may legitimately involve a negative root. Instead, they default to assuming a positive root, overlooking the role of domain restrictions in determining the correct solution. This paper identifies this misconception as the "inverse function fallacy" and introduces a systematic approach, the Inverse Function Point method, that establishes sign determination to a single domain-based reference point. In a study of 69 STEM students at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, only 19% solved a sign-determination problem correctly on their first attempt. Those students were not re-tested. Of the remaining 56 who answered incorrectly, I was able to re-test 40 after teaching the proposed method. In this subgroup, accuracy rose to 80%. These results highlight both the fragility of assumed mathematical knowledge and the potential of simple, intuitive procedures to reinforce conceptual understanding.</description>

      <title>AI for Mathematics: Progress, Challenges, and Prospects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13209v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: AI for Mathematics (AI4Math) has emerged as a distinct field that leverages machine learning to navigate mathematical landscapes historically intractable for early symbolic systems. While mid-20th-century symbolic approaches successfully automated formal logic, they faced severe scalability limitations due to the combinatorial explosion of the search space. The recent integration of data-driven approaches has revitalized this pursuit. In this review, we provide a systematic overview of AI4Math, highlighting its primary focus on developing AI models to support mathematical research. Crucially, we emphasize that this is not merely the application of AI to mathematical activities; it also encompasses the development of stronger AI systems where the rigorous nature of mathematics serves as a premier testbed for advancing general reasoning capabilities. We categorize existing research into two complementary directions: problem-specific modeling, involving the design of specialized architectures for distinct mathematical tasks, and general-purpose modeling, focusing on foundation models capable of broader reasoning, retrieval, and exploratory workflows. We conclude by discussing key challenges and prospects, advocating for AI systems that go beyond facilitating formal correctness to enabling the discovery of meaningful results and unified theories, recognizing that the true value of a proof lies in the insights and tools it offers to the broader mathematical landscape.</description>
