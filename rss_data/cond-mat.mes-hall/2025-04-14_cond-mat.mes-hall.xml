      <title>Exciton fractional Chern insulators in moir\'e heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Moir\'e materials have emerged as a powerful platform for exploring exotic quantum phases. While recent experiments have unveiled fractional Chern insulators exhibiting the fractional quantum anomalous Hall effect based on electrons or holes, the exploration of analogous many-body states with bosonic constituents remains largely uncharted. In this work, we predict the emergence of bosonic fractional Chern insulators arising from long-lived excitons in a moir\'e superlattice formed by twisted bilayer WSe$_2$ stacked on monolayer MoSe$_2$. Performing exact diagonalization on the exciton flat Chern band present in this structure, we establish the existence of Abelian and non-Abelian phases at band filling $\frac{1}{2}$ and $1$, respectively, through multiple robust signatures including ground-state degeneracy, spectral flow, many-body Chern number, and particle-cut entanglement spectrum. The obtained energy gap of $\sim 10$ meV for the Abelian states suggests a remarkably high stability of this phase. Our findings not only introduce a highly tunable and experimentally accessible platform for investigating bosonic fractional Chern insulators but also open a new pathway for realizing non-Abelian anyons.</description>

      <title>Light-Induced Spin Slanting in 2D Multiferroic Magnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling spin orientation of two-dimensional (2D) materials has emerged as a frontier of condensed-matter physics, resulting in the discovery of various phases of matter. However, in most cases, spin orientation can be stablished only at specific directions of out-of-plane and in-plane, which is a drawback compared with three-dimensional systems, limiting exploration of novel physics. Here, we introduce a methodology for manipulating spin slanting in 2D multiferroic materials through ultrafast pulses of light. Based on model analysis, we find that simultaneous triggering spin-orbit coupling induced interactions from in-plane and out-of-plane orbitals can generate spin slanting. By choosing 2D multiferroic materials with specific low-energy composition endowed by symmetry, such triggering can be readily achieved through ultrafast light illumination, leading to light-induced spin slanting. Using real-time time-dependent density-functional theory, we demonstrate this approach in multiferroic single-layer CuCr2Se4. This study provides an efficient way to manipulate spin orientation in 2D materials and establishes a general platform to explore physics and applications associated with spin slanting.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Hall Effect in Type IV 2D Collinear Magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify a previously unrecognized class of two-dimensional (2D) collinear magnetic phase that extends beyond the established categories of ferromagnets, antiferromagnets, and altermagnets. These type IV 2D collinear magnets exhibit spin-degenerate bands in the nonrelativistic limit, yet support time-reversal symmetry-breaking responses, such as the anomalous Hall effect (AHE), despite having zero net magnetization. Based on spin layer group analysis, we derive the symmetry criteria for this phase and perform first-principles calculations to screen viable candidate materials from 2D databases. Using monolayer Hf2S as a prototype, we demonstrate that in the absence of spin-orbit coupling, the bands are spin degenerate, while its inclusion induce an AHE driven by spin-polarized and even spin-neutral currents, accompanied by a symmetry-protected, truly full-space persistent spin texture. These findings expand the classification of magnetic phases and broaden avenues for realizing unconventional spintronic functionalities in two dimensions.</description>

      <title>Significant ballistic thermal transport across graphene layers: effect of nanoholes and lithium intercalation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Porous graphene and graphite are increasingly utilized in electrochemical energy storage and solar-thermal applications due to their unique structural and thermal properties. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the lattice thermal transport and spectral phonon characteristics of holey graphite and multilayer graphene. Our results reveal that phonon modes propagating obliquely with respect to the graphene basal planes are the primary contributors to cross-plane thermal transport. These modes exhibit a predominantly ballistic nature, resulting in an almost linear increase in cross-plane thermal conductivity with the number of layers. The presence of nanoholes in graphene induces a broadband suppression of cross-plane phonon transport, whereas lithium ion intercalation shows potential to enhance it. These findings provide critical insights into the mechanisms governing cross-plane heat conduction in key graphene-based structures, offering valuable guidance for thermal management and engineering of van der Waals materials.</description>

      <title>Positive Terahertz Photoconductivity in CdHgTe Under Hydrostatic Pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Positive terahertz photoconductivity is observed at room temperature in CdHgTe thin films with different Cd contents. We show that electron gas heating caused by Drude-like absorption results in positive photoconductivity because of the interband activation mechanism specific for undoped narrow-gap semiconductors and semimetals. Applying intense terahertz radiation, we observed that the photoconductivity saturates at high intensities, which was found to be caused by absorption bleaching. Both the magnitude of the photoconductivity and the saturation intensity are shown to exhibit an exponential dependence on the hydrostatic pressure. We show that this is a consequence of the fact that both phenomena are controlled by the ratio of energy and momentum relaxation times.</description>

      <title>Designing atomic-scale resistive circuits in topological insulators through vacancy-induced localized modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that vacancies can induce topologically protected localized electronic excitations within the bulk of a topological insulator, and when sufficiently close, give rise to one-dimensional propagating chiral bulk modes. We show that the dynamics of these modes can be effectively described by a tight-binding Hamiltonian, with the hopping parameter determined by the overlap of electronic wave functions between adjacent vacancies, accurately predicting the low-energy spectrum. Building on this phenomenon, we propose that vacancies in topological materials can be utilized to design atomic-scale resistive circuits, and estimate the associated resistance as a function of the vacancy distribution's geometric properties.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of surface electrons in a topological insulator: cyclotron resonance at room temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to manipulate the surface states of topological insulators using electric or magnetic fields under ambient conditions is a key step toward their integration into future electronic and optoelectronic devices. Here, we demonstrate - using cyclotron resonance measurements on a tin-doped BiSbTe$_2$S topological insulator - that moderate magnetic fields can quantize massless surface electrons into Landau levels even at room temperature. This finding suggests that surface-state electrons can behave as long-lived quasiparticles at unexpectedly high temperatures.</description>

      <title>Towards quantitative understanding of quantum dot ensemble capacitance-voltage spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inhomogeneous ensembles of quantum dots (QDs) coupled to a charge reservoir are widely studied by using, e.g., electrical methods like capacitance-voltage spectroscopy. We present experimental measurements of the QD capacitance as a function of varying parameters such as ac frequency and bath temperature. The experiment reveals distinct shifts in the position of the capacitance peaks. While temperature-induced shifts have been explained by previous models, the observation of frequency-dependent shifts has not been explained so far. Given that existing models fall short in explaining these phenomena, we propose a refined theoretical model based on a master equation approach which incorporates energy-dependent tunneling effects. This approach successfully reproduces the experimental data. We highlight the critical role of energy-dependent tunneling in two distinct regimes: at low temperatures, ensemble effects arising from energy-level dispersion in differently sized QDs dominate the spectral response; at high temperatures and frequencies, we observe a peak shift of a different nature, which is best described by optimizing the conjoint probability of successive in- and out-tunneling events. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of tunnel processes and the physical properties of QD ensembles coupled to a common reservoir, with implications for their development in applications such as single-photon sources and spin qubits.</description>

      <title>Control of atomic reconstruction and quasi-1D excitons in strain-engineered moir\'e heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In two-dimensional nearly commensurate heterostructures, strain plays a critical role in shaping electronic behavior. While previous studies have focused on random strain introduced during fabrication, achieving controlled structural design has remained challenging. Here, we demonstrate the deterministic creation of one-dimensional arrays from initially zero-dimensional triangular moir\'e patterns in MoSe$_2$-WSe$_2$ heterobilayers. This transformation, driven by the interplay of uniaxial strain and atomic reconstruction, results in one-dimensional confinement of interlayer excitons within domain walls, exhibiting near-unity linearly polarized emission related to the confinement-induced symmetry breaking. The width of the domain walls--and consequently the degree of exciton confinement--can be precisely tuned by the interlayer twist angle. By applying out-of-plane electric field, the confined excitons exhibit energy shifts exceeding 100~meV and changes in the fine-structure splitting by up to a factor of two. Our work demonstrates the potential of strain engineering for constructing designer moir\'e systems with programmable quantum properties, paving the way for future optoelectronic applications.</description>

      <title>Localized plasmonic meron-antimeron pairs in doubly degenerate orbitals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological defects are pivotal in elucidating kaleidoscopic topological phenomena in different physical systems. Meron-antimeron pairs are a type of topological defects firstly found as soliton solutions to SU(2) Yang-Mills equations in gauge theory, and then identified in condensed matter physics as a type of magnetic quasiparticles created in the context of topological charge conservation. Here, we show that isolated meron-antimeron pairs constitute a new form of optical topological quasiparticles that naturally emerge in doubly degenerate orbitals of plasmonic systems, including fundamental and higher-order ones, and their target-type counterparts. We demonstrate that their topological charges are strictly imposed by orbital indices from the doubly degenerate irreducible representations (irreps) of groups consisting of rotational symmetries, and thus are upper-bounded by the orbital indices imposed by group theory. In addition, we find that there exist highly-localized isolated (anti)merons in plasmonic spin textures, which were previously observed mostly in the form of lattices or clusters. We further demonstrate a locking effect between the chirality of the (anti)merons and the parity of the irreps. Then, the topological origins of the revealed topological quasiparticles, i.e., phase, V-point and L-line singularities in plasmonic fields, are investigated. Finally, a complete symmetry classification of the topological quasiparticles is provided. Generalizing the meron-antimeron pairs to photonic systems provides various possibilities for the applications in optical vectorial imaging, deep-subwavelength sensing and metrology.</description>

      <title>Magnon and photon blockade in an antiferromagnet-cavity hybrid quantum system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate both magnon and photon blockade for an antiferromagnetic insulator coupled to a linearly polarized cavity mode. We focus on the cross-Kerr nonlinearity between the two magnon modes, which can be large in antiferromagnets with a weak easy-axis magnetic anisotropy. By numerically solving the Lindblad master equations, we demonstrate that the resulting bright and dark modes, i.e., system eigenmodes that couple strongly and weakly to photons, respectively, exhibit distinct behaviors. The bright mode exhibits both magnon and photon blockade due to a weak effective nonlinearity, while the dark mode only exhibits magnon blockade for a detuned cavity photon. The blockade efficiency can further be optimized by appropriately tuning the competing interactions in the system. In addition, we show that applying a DC magnetic field, which lifts the degeneracy of antiferromagnetic chiral magnon eigenmodes, destroys the dark mode and leads to an unconventional photon blockade. These findings provide a pathway for generating single magnon and photon states useful for quantum information technology based on the underlying large squeezing of antiferromagnetic magnons.</description>

      <title>Schottky anomaly in a cavity-coupled double quantum well</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theoretical study of a mesoscopic two-dimensional electron gas confined in a double quantum well that is coupled to a uniform quasi-static cavity mode via fluctuations of the dipole moment. We focus on the regime of large number of electrons participating in the virtual inter-subband transitions. In this regime, the effective photonic potential is no longer quadratic but, instead, it contains large number of minima. Each minimum represents a nearly harmonic oscillator with the renormalized cavity frequency that is much greater than its bare value. The energy offset of a minimum scales quadratically with respect to the photon coordinate corresponding to this minimum. These energy offsets determine the statistical weight of each minimum, and altogether they result in the additive correction to the heat capacity of the system. This correction exhibits a Schottky anomaly and a 0.5k_B plateau at low temperatures. This behavior can be associated with the emergence of a new degree of freedom. This degree of freedom does not manifest in the optical conductivity and can only be observed via the heat capacity measurement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a mechanism and develop a theory for nonreciprocal Coulomb drag resistance. This effect arises in electron double-layer systems in the presence of an in-plane magnetic field in noncentrosymmetric conductors or in bilayers with spontaneously broken time-reversal symmetry and without Galilean invariance. We demonstrate the significance of this effect by examining the hydrodynamic regime of the electron liquid. The nonreciprocal component of the transresistance is shown to sensitively depend on the intrinsic conductivity, viscosity of the fluid, and the emergent nonreciprocity parameter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the development of a Bloch transistor (BT) for the emerging platform of cryogenic quantum electronics. The BT is a fully quantum non-dissipative device facilitating precise delivery of the quantized current to the circuit, I=2efn (where n is an integer, e is the charge of an electron and f is the microwave frequency). It does not have an analogue in classical electronics, but it is required for quantum ones. The amplitude of the quantized current is adjustable through four controls: the gate or bias voltage and the frequency or amplitude of the microwave. The device features Josephson junctions operating in the regime of Bloch oscillations, an isolating electromagnetic circuit and microwave feeding leads. BT operates at a bias of 5 {\mu}V, and can deliver the quantized currents up to 10 nA.</description>

      <title>Semimetallic two-dimensional defective graphene networks with periodic 4-8 defect lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present theoretical simulations of the electronic properties of graphene-like two-dimensional (2D) carbon networks with a periodic arrangement of defect lines formed by alternating four- and eight-membered rings. These networks can be seen as arrays of armchair-edged nanoribbons (AGNRs), which are covalently connected at the edges. Using a combination of density functional theory and a simple tight binding model, we show that the electronic properties of these networks can be understood to arise from the family behaviour of the constituting AGNRs, plus a rigid shift due to an 'inter-ribbon' coupling across the defect lines. As a result, we find one class of zero-band-gap semiconducting 2D networks, and two classes of semimetallic networks with quasi-linear band close to the Fermi energy. The formation of closed-ring electron- and hole-like Fermi surfaces due to hybridization across the defect lines offers interesting perspectives of using such defective 2D networks for transport applications or the realization of carbon-based nodal line semimetals.</description>

      <title>Preparation and coherent manipulation of toroidal moments in molecules</title>

Abstract: Molecules with an odd number of electrons are expected to display paramagnetic behaviour in a uniform magnetic field. Instead, a vanishing magnetization is often measured in a family of lanthanide complexes known as Single Molecule Toroics. The anomaly can be explained in terms of degenerate quantum states in which electron spins and orbital currents give rise to time-odd and space-odd magnetic vortices known as toroidal moments, carrying a vanishing magnetic dipole. Resilient to stray magnetic fields and susceptible to electric manipulation, toroidal moments are sparking growing interest for applications in spintronics, magnonics, and photonics. While macroscopic toroidal moments have been observed in extended systems such as bulk low-dimensional non-collinear ferromagnets, theoretically predicted quantum toroidal states in molecules are yet to be observed, as it is currently unclear how to split degenerate states carrying counter-rotating vortices via existing experimental setups. Here we propose a realistic experimental protocol to polarize and observe molecular toroidal moments using pulsed microwave radiation. Modelling the spin-dynamics in a pulsed MW-field, we find that three resonant MW-pulses, delivered either sequentially or simultaneously, to a class of MDy$_6$ (M = Al$^{3+}$, Cr$^{3+}$) molecules consisting of coupled Dy$_3$ toroidal moieties, can selectively and coherently transfer population to a long-lived polarized toroidal state. The ensuing magneto-electric properties can then be used as a read-out mechanism. Our results provide a strategy to measure and coherently manipulate toroidal states in molecular systems, which is expected to trigger applications of molecular toroidal states to quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Unifying adiabatic state-transfer protocols with $(\alpha, \beta)$-hypergeometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adiabatic optimal control schemes are essential for advancing the practical implementation of quantum technologies. However, the vast array of possible adiabatic protocols, combined with their dependence on the particular quantum system and function-specific parameter ranges, complicates the task of discerning their respective strengths and limitations in arbitrary operations. In this work, we provide a unifying framework, called $(\alpha,\beta)$-hypergeometries, that allows for flexible, noise-resistant, and easy-to-use implementation of enforced adiabatic dynamics for any multi-level quantum system. Moreover, this framework provides a comprehensive mapping of all adiabatic protocols through a universal cost function and offers an exact analytical characterization of the adiabatic dynamics. In particular, we derive precise expressions for infidelity resonances and establish performance guarantees in the adiabatic limit for any choice of $(\alpha,\beta)$. We also discuss in detail the experimental feasibility of the resulting pulse shapes through analytical and numerical methods. Finally, we test our method for the optimal control of coherent information transfer through spin shuttling in silicon quantum dots with small valley splittings.</description>

      <title>Hybridization of edge modes with substrate phonons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surface plasmons or phonons propagating on a two-dimensional (2D) material can exhibit coupling with resonant excitations in its substrate, and the resulting coupled modes were extensively studied. Similar coupling of edge modes propagating along a boundary of 2D material with the substrate excitations remains unexplored. This paper aims to bridge this gap by investigating the edge-substrate hybrid modes using the exact Wiener-Hopf analytical approach. We analyze dispersions, decay rate, and confinement of such hybrid modes both without magnetic field (plasmon-phonon and phonon-phonon hybrid modes) and in quantizing magnetic field where edge magnetoplasmons hybridize with substrate phonons. The hybrid modes are predicted to occur in THz and far-IR ranges for several combinations of quasi-2D materials (single- and bilayer graphene, quantum wells, thin-film semiconductors) and substrates with polar-phonon resonances.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast dynamics of ferroelectric polarization of NbOI$_{2}$ captured with femtosecond electron diffraction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) ferroelectric materials like NbOI$_{2}$ have garnered significant interest, yet their temporal response and synergetic interaction with light remain underexplored. Previous studies on the polarization of oxide ferroelectrics have relied on time-resolved optical second harmonic generation or ultrafast X-ray scattering. Here, we probe the laser-induced polarization dynamics of 2D NbOI$_{2}$ nanocrystals using ultrafast transmission electron diffraction and deflectometry. The deflection of the electron pulses is directly sensitive to the changes in the polarization, while the diffraction signal captures the structural evolution. Excited with a UV laser pulse, the polarization of NbOI$_{2}$ is initially suppressed for two picoseconds, then it recovers and overshoots, leading to a transiently enhanced polarization persisting for over 200 ps. This recovery coincides with coherent acoustic phonon generation, triggering a piezoresponse in the NbOI$_{2}$ nanocrystals. Our results offer a new method for sensing the ferroelectric order parameter in femtosecond time scales.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional perovskites with maximum symmetry enable exciton diffusion length exceeding 2 micrometers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Realizing semiconductors with high symmetry of their crystallographic structures has been a virtue of inorganic materials and has resulted in novel physical behaviors. In contrast, hybrid (organic and inorganic) crystals such as two-dimensional metal halide perovskites exhibit much lower crystal symmetry due to in-plane or out of plane octahedral distortions. Despite their amazing ability for photoinduced light emission at room temperature, the Achilles' heel of this attractive class of 2D materials for optoelectronics remains the poor control and lack of performance for charge carrier transport. Inspired by the tremendous charge carrier properties of the 3D cubic perovskite phase of FAPbI3 and combining the use of the appropriate cage cation, the spacer molecule and the temperature and rate of crystallization, we report a new series of FA-based layered two-dimensional perovskites that exhibits the highest theoretically predicted symmetry with a tetragonal P4/mmm space group, resulting in no octahedral distortion in both in-plane and out-of-plane directions. These 2D perovskites present the shortest interlayer distances (4 angstrom), which results in systematically lower bandgaps (1.7 to 1.8 eV). Finally, the absence of octahedral distortions, results in an exciton diffusion length of 2.5 {\mu}m, and a diffusivity of 4.4 cm2s-1, both of which are an order of magnitude larger compared to previously reported 2D perovskites and on par with monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides.</description>

      <title>Structural Control of Atomic Silicon Wires</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bare Si(100)-2$\times$1 surface atoms exhibit a buckled structure where one Si atom in a dimer is lowered while the other is raised, leading to two possible buckling configurations equivalent in energy. The relatively low energy barrier between these configurations allows dimers to flip rapidly and uncontrollably unless stabilized by surface defects or observed at low temperatures due to reduced thermal energy using Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM). This rapid flipping results in a time-averaged symmetric appearance under STM. In this study, we investigated variable length buckled dimer wires on the hydrogenated Si(100) surface composed of silicon dangling bonds for the first time. We demonstrate that on degenerate p-type silicon at 4.5 K, the rapid switching of these dimers can be frozen at low scanning biases. It is shown that the stability of a fixed buckled configuration increases with wire length. Such buckled wires can however be controllably flipped using a bias pulse. A line as long as 37 dimers was repeatedly uniformly flipped by a single pulse delivered near one terminus of the wire. The tip-directed flipping of a particular wire does not switch adjacent wires, suggesting binary wires can make well isolated rewritable binary memory elements. Furthermore, at sufficiently high biases switching generates telegraph noise that could be of utility for random number generation. The integration and encapsulation of these wires with previously described silicon dangling bond-made logic gates and binary wires might allow for self contained actuation and readout without requiring any role of an STM tip.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single-shot all-optical helicity independent switching processes are investigated using advanced micromagnetic modeling in a ferrimagnetic thin film embedded in a multilayer stack. Building on recent experimental findings, our multiscale simulations realistically account for heat transport in the stack, focusing on the influence of a metallic copper underlayer with varying thickness. We analyze how this thermal transport affects the final magnetic state of the ferrimagnet as a function of both the laser pulse duration and fluence. Our results reproduce the experimentally observed switching behaviors and elucidate the physical mechanisms that govern the emergence of three distinct final magnetic states. In particular, we demonstrate how these states are critically influenced by the thickness of the underlying copper layer.</description>

      <title>Manifestation of critical effects in environmental parameter estimation using a quantum sensor under dynamical control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum probes offer a powerful platform for exploring environmental dynamics, particularly through their sensitivity to decoherence processes. In this work, we investigate the emergence of critical behavior in the estimation of the environmental memory time $\tau_c$, modeled as an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process characterized by a Lorentzian spectral density. Using dynamically controlled qubit-based sensors -- realized experimentally via solid-state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and supported by numerical simulations -- we implement tailored filter functions to interrogate the environmental noise spectrum and extract $\tau_c$ from its spectral width. Our results reveal a sharp transition in estimation performance between short-memory (SM) and long-memory (LM) regimes, reflected in a non-monotonic estimation error that resembles a phase transition. This behavior is accompanied by an avoided-crossing-like structure in the estimated parameter space, indicative of two competing solutions near the critical point. These features underscore the interplay between control, decoherence, and inference in open quantum systems. Beyond their fundamental significance, these critical phenomena offer a practical diagnostic tool for identifying dynamical regimes and optimizing quantum sensing protocols. By exploiting this criticality, our findings pave the way for adaptive control strategies aimed at enhancing precision in quantum parameter estimation -- particularly in complex or structured environments such as spin networks, diffusive media, and quantum materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent experiments engineered special spin-degenerate Andreev states in atomic cages of adatoms on superconductors, the Machida-Shibata states, revealing a promising building block for quantum matter. Here, we investigate the formation of time-reversal symmetric bands by hybridizing multiple such states and analyzing their electronic topological properties. The low-energy theory shows that competing emerging singlet and triplet superconducting pairings drive the formation of topologically non-trivial phases in symmetry class DIII. Therefore, Kramers pairs of Majorana zero modes appear at the ends of Machida-Shibata chains, while two-dimensional lattices host helical Majorana edge modes. Additionally, we discover extended regions in the Brillouin zone with vanishing superconducting pairings, which can be lifted by repulsive electron interactions. Our findings offer new perspectives for manipulating topological superconductivity and pairings in non-magnetic adatom systems.</description>

Abstract: The superconducting diode effect has garnered significant interest due to its prospective applications in cryogenic electronics and computing, characterized by zero resistance and no energy dissipation. This phenomenon has been demonstrated across various superconducting platforms, which typically necessitate unconventional materials with broken spatial symmetries or external magnetic fields, posing scalability and integration challenges. This work introduces an innovative method to realize the superconducting diode effect by disrupting spatio-temporal symmetries in a conventional Josephson junction utilizing a biharmonic AC drive signal. We achieve wireless modulation of the diode's polarity and efficiency with an antenna. Our findings indicate a diode efficiency reaching the ideal $100\%$ over a broad frequency range, with a temperature resilience up to 800 mK, and efficient AC signal rectification. This versatile and platform-independent superconducting diode signifies a promising component for advancing future superconducting digital electronics, including efficient logic gates, ultra-fast switches, and dynamic half-wave supercurrent rectifiers.</description>

Abstract: Achieving self-consistent convergence with the conventional effective-mass approach at ultra-low temperatures (below $4.2~K$) is a challenging task, which mostly lies in the discontinuities in material properties (e.g., effective-mass, electron affinity, dielectric constant). In this article, we develop a novel self-consistent approach based on cell-centered Finite-Volume discretization of the Sturm-Liouville form of the effective-mass Schr{\"o}dinger equation and generalized Poisson's equation (FV-SP). We apply this approach to simulate the one-dimensional electron gas (1DEG) formed at the Si-SiO$_2$ interface via a top gate. We find excellent self-consistent convergence from high to extremely low (as low as $50~mK$) temperatures. We further examine the solidity of FV-SP method by changing external variables such as the electrochemical potential and the accumulative top gate voltage. Our approach allows for counting electron-electron interactions. Our results demonstrate that FV-SP approach is a powerful tool to solve effective-mass Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Direction-dependent conductivity in planar Hall set-ups with tilted Weyl/multi-Weyl semimetals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10203v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the magnetoelectric conductivity tensors in planar Hall set-ups, which are built with tilted Weyl semimetals (WSMs) and multi-Weyl semimetals (mWSMs), considering all possible relative orientations of the electromagnetic fields ($\mathbf E $ and $\mathbf B $) and the direction of the tilt. The non-Drude part of the response arises from a nonzero Berry curvature in the vicinity of the WSM/mWSM node under consideration. Only in the presence of a nonzero tilt do we find linear-in-$ | \mathbf B| $ terms in set-ups where the tilt-axis is not perpendicular to the plane spanned by $\mathbf E $ and $ \mathbf B $. The advantage of the emergence of the linear-in-$ | \mathbf B| $ terms is that, unlike the various $| \mathbf B|^2 $-dependent terms that can contribute to experimental observations, they have purely a topological origin, and they dominate the overall response-characteristics in the realistic parameter regimes. The important signatures of these terms are that they (1) change the periodicity of the response from $\pi $ to $2\pi$, when we consider their dependence on the angle $\theta $ between $\mathbf E $ and $\mathbf B $; and (2) lead to an overall change in sign of the conductivity depending on $\theta$, when measured with respect to the $\mathbf B =0$ case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11849v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strong coupling between vacuum fields and quantum matter occurs at the nanoscale and broadens the horizon of light-matter interaction. Nanoscale Casimir force, as an exhibition of vacuum fields, inevitably experiences the influence of surface electrons due to their quantum character, which are ignorable in micron Casimir force. Here, we develop a three-dimensional conformal map method to tackle typical experimental configurations with surface electron contributions to Casimir force purposely and delicately included. Based on this method, we reveal that surface electrons can either enhance or suppress the nanoscale Casimir force, depending on materials and crystal facets. The mechanism is demonstrated to be the Casimir force softening, which results from surface electrons effectively altering the distance seen by the Casimir interaction. Our findings not only highlight the interaction between surface electrons and vacuum fields but also provide a recipe for theoretical and experimental investigation of nanoscale fluctuation-type problems.</description>

Abstract: The advent of organic polaritonics has led to the realisation of all-optical transistors, logic gates, and single photon-switches operating at room temperature. In this Letter, we develop a microscopic theory accounting for thermalisation, vibron-relaxation, and radiative and ballistic polariton losses to investigate the intrinsic limitations of the temporal separation of consecutive polariton condensates. We test and verify our theoretical predictions using an optical pump-pump configuration with different pulse width and unravel the importance of lateral ballistic losses in defining the upper limit of the temporal bandwidth, reaching ~240 GHz.</description>

      <title>Gating monolayer and bilayer graphene with a two-dimensional semiconductor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06432v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Metals are commonly used as electrostatic gates in devices due to their abundant charge carrier densities that are necessary for efficient charging and discharging. A semiconducting gate can be beneficial for certain fabrication processes, in low light conditions, and for specific gating properties. We determine the effectiveness and limitations of a semiconducting gate in graphene and bilayer graphene devices. Using the semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), molybdenum diselenide (MoSe2), tungsten disulfide (WS2), and tungsten diselenide (WSe2), we show that two-dimensional semiconductors can be used to suitably gate the graphene devices under appropriate operating conditions. For single-gated devices, semiconducting gates are comparable to metallic gates below liquid helium temperatures but include resistivity features resulting from gate voltage clamping of the semiconductor. In dual-gated devices, we pin down the parameter range of effective operation and find that the semiconducting depletion regime results in clamping and hysteresis from defect-state charge trapping.</description>

Abstract: Point-gap topological phases of non-Hermitian systems exhibit exotic boundary states that have no counterparts in Hermitian systems. Here, we develop classification of second-order point-gap topological phases protected by reflection symmetry. Based on this classification, we propose exceptional second-order topological insulators, exhibiting second-order boundary states stabilized by point-gap topology. As an illustrative example, we uncover a two-dimensional exceptional second-order topological insulator with point-gapless corner states. Furthermore, we identify a three-dimensional exceptional second-order topological insulator that features hinge states with isolated exceptional points, representing second-order topological phases intrinsic to non-Hermitian systems. Our work enlarges the family of point-gap topological phases in non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <title>Stretched-exponential stress dynamics in chain of springs and masses model of crystals: analytical results and MD simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07633v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The model of a chain of springs and masses (CSM), originating from the works of Schr\"odinger (1914), and Pater (1974), is found suitable as an analytical description of the dynamics of layers in orientated FCC crystals. An analytical extension of that model has been developed for the case of linear-in-time ramp pressure applied to a sample surface. Examples are provided of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, confirming the usefulness of the model in the description of dynamic effects on steel 310S under pressure. Qualitatively the same results have been obtained by us for several other medium-entropy alloys CoNiCr (with EAM and MEAM inter-atomic potentials), and CoNiV (with MEAM potential). For studies of dynamic stability on large sizes of samples and for long times, the proposed earlier table-style harmonic interlayer potential has been used. The results of MD simulations suggest that the dynamics of the CSM model of perfectly ordered matter is described by stretched-exponential time functions, and it is characterised by simple scaling relations in time and size of the sample.</description>

      <title>Pb-intercalated epitaxial graphene on SiC: Full insight into band structure and orbital character of interlayer Pb, and charge transfer into graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08172v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Intercalation is a robust approach for modulating the properties of epitaxial graphene on SiC and stabilizing two-dimensional (2D) intercalant layers at the graphene/SiC interface. In this work, we present synchrotron-based angle resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements focussing on the band structure of intercalated Pb under a single layer of epitaxial graphene. The interlayer Pb exhibits a metallic character, a $(1 \times 1)$ registry with respect to SiC, and free electron-like bands to a first order. Divergences from the free electron approximation include various band splittings and gaps throughout the Pb Brillouin zone. Light polarization dependent ARPES measurements indicate a predominant out-of-plane orbital character for the Pb bands, suggesting potential interactions between the interlayer Pb and graphene's $\pi$ orbitals that may induce proximity effects in graphene. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations for a $(1 \times 1)$ Pb monolayer on SiC show a reasonable qualitative agreement with the experimentally observed interlayer bands as well as the polarization dependent measurements. Finally, temperature dependent ARPES measurements reveal that the nearly charge-neutral graphene layer involves charge transfer from both the interlayer Pb and the substrate SiC.</description>

      <title>Dissipative quantum phase transitions in electrically driven lasers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10997v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Embedding quantum dot circuits into microwave cavities has emerged as a novel platform for controlling photon emission statistics by electrical means. With such a circuit version of the Rabi model, we reveal previously undefined quantum phase transitions in electrically driven lasing regimes, which do not require deep strong light-matter couplings. For one-photon interaction, the scaling analysis indicates that the system undergoes a continuous phase transition from thermal to coherent photon emissions. Going beyond this, a discontinuous quantum phase transition from superbunched to coherent states in two-photon processes, accompanied by the bistability within a mean-field theory, is predicted. Both the order of phase transitions and the critical electron-photon coupling can be easily controlled by an electric field, while the tunneling current can be used as a fingerprint of such transitions. Our prediction, along with its extension to multiphoton processes, represents a key step towards accessing lasing phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the creation of negatively charged boron vacancies in He-ion irradiated hexagonal boron nitride</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18481v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) hosts luminescent defects possessing spin qualities compatible with quantum sensing protocols at room temperature. Vacancies, in particular, are readily obtained via exposure to high-energy ion beams. While the defect creation mechanism via such irradiation is well understood, the occurrence rate of optically active negatively charged vacancies ($V_B^-$) is an open question. In this work, we exploit focused helium ions to systematically generate optically active vacancy defects in hBN flakes at varying density. By comparing the density-dependent spin splitting measured by magnetic resonance to calculations based on a microscopic charge model, in which we introduce a correction term due to a constant background charge, we are able to quantify the number of $V_B^-$ defects generated by the ion irradiation. We find a lower bound for the fraction (0.2%) of all vacancies in the optically active, negatively charged state. Our results provide a protocol for measuring the generation efficiency of $V_B^-$, which is necessary for understanding and optimizing luminescent centers in hBN.</description>

      <title>Equivalent Electric Model of a Macrospin</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20811v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamics of a ferromagnetic macrospin (e.g., a free layer of a magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ)) can be described in terms of equivalent capacitor charge $Q$ and inductor flux $\Phi$, in a manner similar to a standard electric LC circuit, but with strongly nonlinear and coupled capacitance and inductance. This description allows for the inclusion of Gilbert damping and spin transfer torques and yields a relatively simple equivalent electric circuit, which can be easily modeled in LTspice or other electrical engineering software. It allows one to easily simulate advanced electrical circuits containing MTJs and conventional electronic components in standard simulation software.</description>

      <title>Realizing string-net condensation: Fibonacci anyon braiding for universal gates and sampling chromatic polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12820v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The remarkable complexity of the vacuum state of a topologically-ordered many-body quantum system encodes the character and intricate braiding interactions of its emergent particles, the anyons.} Quintessential predictions exploiting this complexity use the Fibonacci string-net condensate (Fib-SNC) and its Fibonacci anyons to go beyond classical computing. Sampling the Fib-SNC wavefunction is expected to yield estimates of the chromatic polynomial of graph objects, a classical task that is provably hard. At the same time, exchanging anyons of Fib-SNC is expected to allow fault-tolerant universal quantum computation. Nevertheless, the physical realization of Fib-SNC and its anyons remains elusive. Here, we introduce a scalable dynamical string-net preparation (DSNP) approach, suitable even for near-term quantum processors, which dynamically prepares Fib-SNC and its anyons through reconfigurable graphs. Using a superconducting quantum processor, we couple the DSNP approach with composite error-mitigation on deep circuits to successfully create, measure, and braid anyons of Fib-SNC in a scalable manner. We certify the creation of anyons by measuring their `anyon charge', finding an average experimental accuracy of $94\%$. Furthermore, we validate that exchanging these anyons yields the { expected} golden ratio~$\phi$ with~$98\%$ average accuracy and~$8\%$ measurement uncertainty. Finally, we sample the Fib-SNC to estimate the chromatic polynomial at~$\phi+2$ for {several} graphs. Our results establish the proof of principle for using Fib-SNC and its anyons for fault-tolerant universal quantum computation and {for aiming at} a classically-hard problem.</description>

      <title>Discovery of an ultrastable antiferromagnetic two-dimensional CrF3 phase with anisotropic quasi-one-dimensional mechanical, electronic, and thermal properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19118v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the discovery of an ultra-stable antiferromagnetic two-dimensional (2D) CrF3 phase that is energetically more favorable than the traditionally assumed hexagonal structure. Using first-principles calculations and evolutionary structure searches, we identify a new low-energy rectangular configuration of CrF3 with remarkable anisotropic properties. Mechanically, this phase exhibits zero in-plane Poisson's ratio, a rare negative out-of-plane Poisson's ratio, and quasi-one-dimensional (quasi-1D) behavior characterized by minimal coupling between orthogonal directions. Electronically, CrF3 shows quasi-1D transport with two independent conduction bands near the Fermi level, tunable via uniaxial strain. The calculated bandgap is 3.05 eV, which can be modulated under strain, enabling control over its electronic properties. The material also displays out-of-plane antiferromagnetic ordering with a magnetic anisotropy energy of 0.098 meV per Cr atom and an estimated Neel temperature of 20 K. Additionally, we investigate the thermal conductivity of monolayer rectangular CrF3 (r-CrF3), revealing significant anisotropy in heat transport. The thermal conductivity along the y-axis is approximately 60.5 W/mK at 300 K, much higher than along the x-axis at 13.2 W/mK. The thermal anisotropic factor is 4.58, surpassing that of other 2D materials like black phosphorene, WTe2, and arsenene, highlighting r-CrF3's potential for advanced directional heat management. Consequently, the rectangular CrF3 phase is a promising candidate for applications in spintronics, strain-engineered nanoelectronics, mechanical metamaterials, and thermal management technologies.</description>

      <title>In-plane Ising superconductivity revealed by exchange interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19599v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional superconductors with spin-textured Fermi surfaces can be a platform for realizing unconventional pairing states and are of substantial interest in the context of quantum information science, and superconducting spintronics/orbitronics. We observed an unusual in-plane Ising like uniaxial anisotropy in the superconducting 2D electron gas (2DEG) formed at EuOx/KTaO3 (110) interfaces, where the EuOx is magnetic. This anisotropy is not evident in AlOx/KTaO3 (110) where the overlayer is non-magnetic. Our results are consistent with a highly anisotropic spin-textured Fermi surface in 2DEGs formed at the KTaO3 (110) interface that is hidden from external magnetic fields due to a near cancellation between orbital and spin moments but revealed by exchange interactions of the electrons in the 2DEG with Eu moments near the EuOx/KTaO3 (110) interface. The interactions between the uniaxial spin texture and the magnetic overlayer offer new ways to explore the interplay between magnetism and 2D superconductivity.</description>
