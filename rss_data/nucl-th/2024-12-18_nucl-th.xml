      <title>Radiative Capture Reaction $d(\alpha,\gamma)^{6}\mathrm{Li} $ in Cluster Effective Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we focus on the radiative capture process of the deuteron on alpha particle leading to the formation of $^6{\textrm{Li}}$ in the two-body formalism through the cluster effective field theory~(CEFT). It was the primitive nuclear reaction to produce ${^6 \textrm{Li}}$ in a few minutes after the Big Bang. In detail, we outline the calculation of the dominant $E1$ and $E2$ electromagnetic transition amplitudes of $d(\alpha,\gamma ){^6\textrm{Li}}$. Then, we obtain the astrophysical S-factor by fitting it to the experimental data. Finally, we compare the obtained CEFT results for the astrophysical S-factor with the other theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Neutron Star Properties and Femtoscopic Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct the equation of state of hypernuclear matter and study the structure of neutron stars employing a chiral hyperon-nucleon interaction of the J\"{u}lich--Bonn group tuned to femtoscopic $\Lambda p$ data of the ALICE collaboration, and $\Lambda\Lambda$ and $\Xi$N interactions determined from Lattice QCD calculations by the HAL QCD collaboration that reproduce the femtoscopic $\Lambda\Lambda$ and $\Xi^-p$ data. We employ the ab-initio microscopic Brueckner--Hartree--Fock theory extended to the strange baryon sector. A special focus is put on the uncertainties of the hyperon interactions and how they are effectively propagated to the composition, equation of state, and mass-radius relation of neutron stars. To such end, we consider the uncertainty due to the experimental error of the femtoscopic $\Lambda p$ data used to fix the chiral hyperon-nucleon interaction and the theoretical uncertainty, estimated from the residual cut-off dependence of this interaction. We find that the final maximum mass of a neutron star with hyperons is in the range $1.3-1.4$ $M_\odot$, in agreement with previous works. The hyperon puzzle, therefore, remains still an open issue if only two-body hyperon-nucleon and hyperon-hyperon interactions are considered.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic jet broadening and jet shape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the use of jet substructure as a way of probing phenomena which break the isotropic behavior of jets, such as jet propagation through an anisotropically flowing quark-gluon plasma or spin correlations. We introduce two novel observables for this purpose: the azimuthal-dependent jet broadening and the azimuthal-dependent jet shape, which generalize the traditional isotropic substructure studies. Using Soft-Collinear Effective Theory, we explicitly calculate the jet functions associated with these observables with a standard jet axis and with a Winner-Take-All jet axis in both the resummed and fixed order limits. While our analysis first and foremost establishes the formalism for the azimuthal-dependent jet substructure, it also brings to light new results for jet substructure in the azimuthally integrated case, such as the semi-inclusive jet function and the exclusive jet shape for the Winner-Take-All axis, and the jet broadening in the fixed order region. As an illustrative example for the new formalism we demonstrate that the azimuthal-dependent jet broadening can be used as a direct probe of the transversity parton distribution function in deep inelastic scattering.</description>

      <title>QCD factorization with multihadron fragmentation functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Important aspects of QCD factorization theorems are the properties of the objects involved that can be identified as universal. One example is that the definitions of parton densities and fragmentation functions for different types of hadrons differ only in the identity of the nonperturbative states that form the matrix elements, but are otherwise the same. This leads to independence of perturbative calculations on nonperturbative details of external states. It also lends support to interpretations of correlation functions as encapsulations of intrinsic nonperturbative properties. These characteristics have usually been presumed to still hold true in fragmentation functions even when the observed nonperturbative state is a small-mass cluster of $n$ hadrons rather than simply a single isolated hadron. However, the multidifferential aspect of cross sections that rely on these latter types of fragmentation functions complicates the treatment of kinematical approximations in factorization derivations. That has led to recent claims that the operator definitions for fragmentation functions need to be modified from the single hadron case with nonuniversal prefactors. With such concerns as our motivation, we retrace the steps for factorizing the unpolarized semi-inclusive $e^+e^-$ annihilation cross section and confirm that they do apply without modification to the case of a small-mass multihadron observed in the final state. In particular, we verify that the standard operator definition from single hadron fragmentation, with its usual prefactor, remains equally valid for the small-mass $n$-hadron case with the same hard parts and evolution kernels, whereas the more recently proposed definitions with nonuniversal prefactors do not. Our results reaffirm the reliability of most past phenomenological applications of dihadron fragmentation functions.</description>

      <title>Exact charged and rotating toroidal black hole in the Einstein $SU(N)$-Skyrme model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct an exact solution of the Einstein $SU(N)$-Skyrme model in $D=4$ space-time dimensions describing a charged and rotating black hole with toroidal horizon. Rotation is added by applying an improper coordinate transformation to the known static toroidal black hole with Skyrme hair, while the electric charge is supplemented by considering a $U(1)$ gauge field interacting with Einstein gravity. We perform the thermal analysis in the grand canonical ensemble, explicitly showing the role that the flavor number plays. Some discussions about stability are also considered.</description>

      <title>Light-by-light scattering in ultraperipheral heavy ion collisions -- new possibilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Light-by-light scattering is a relatively new area of experimental physics. Our recent, theoretical research shows that studying two photon measurements in regions with lower transverse momentum ($p_{t,\gamma}$) and invariant mass ($M_{\gamma\gamma}$) allows us to observe not only the main contribution of photon scattering, known as fermionic loops but also mechanisms like the VDM-Regge (double-photon hadronic fluctuation). In addition, diphoton measurements at low diphoton masses are crucial for studies of light meson resonance contributions in $\gamma\gamma \to \gamma\gamma$ scattering. We also focus on the interference between different contributions. For future experiments with the ALICE FoCal and ALICE-3 detectors, we have calculated background contamination and have explored possibilities to minimize their impact.</description>

      <title>Constraining the $DDD^*$ three-body bound state via the $Z_c(3900)$ pole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we propose using the $Z_c(3900)$ pole position to constrain the existence of the $DDD^*$ three-body bound state within the one-boson-exchange (OBE) model. The existence of the $DDD^*$ bound state remains uncertain due to significant variations in the OBE interaction, particularly in the strength of scalar-meson-exchange interactions, which can differ by a factor about 20 between two commonly used OBE models. This discrepancy renders the $DDD^*$ system highly model-dependent. To address this issue, we constrain the scalar-meson-exchange interaction using the $Z_c(3900)$ pole position, where the pseudoscalar-meson coupling is well-determined, and the $\rho$- and $\omega$-exchange interactions nearly cancel each other out, leaving the coupling constant of the $\sigma$-exchange as the only unknown parameter. Our results indicate that the isospin-$\frac{1}{2}$ $DDD^*$ bound states exist when $Z_c(3900)$ is a virtual state of $D\bar{D}^*/\bar{D}D^*$ located within approximately $-15$ MeV of the threshold. However, the three-body bound state is gone when the $Z_c(3900)$ virtual state pole is more than $20$ MeV away from the threshold. Each experimental progress, either on the $DDD^*$ state or the $Z_c(3900)$, can shed light on the nature of the other state. Another significant outcome is a refined set of OBE model parameters calibrated using the pole positions of $X(3872)$, $T_{cc}(3875)$, and $Z_c(3900)$, rigorously addressing the cutoff dependence. These parameters provide a valuable resource for more accurate calculations of systems involving few-body $D$, $D^*$ and their antiparticles. Additionally, we find no evidence of the $DDD^*$ three-body resonances after extensive search using a combination of the Gaussian expansion method and the complex scaling method.</description>

Abstract: We generalize the chirally motivated $\pi\Sigma - \bar{K}N$ coupled channels model to the cubic finite volume and use it to calculate the stationary energy spectrum that appears in a nice agreement with the spectrum obtained in the lattice QCD simulations by the BaSc collaboration. Several other comparisons with the BaSc results are made, in particular relating their pole positions of the meson-baryon scattering matrix to the two-pole picture of $\Lambda(1405)$ generated by our chiral model in the infinite volume.</description>

      <title>Competition between allowed and first-forbidden $\beta$ decay in $r$-process waiting-point nuclei within a relativistic beyond-mean-field approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17115v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute $\beta$-decay half-lives of isotonic nuclear chains located at neutron shell closures $N=50$, $82$, $126$ and $184$, which are of particular importance for the $r$-process nucleosynthesis, and study the role of first-forbidden transitions in a framework that includes complex nucleonic correlations beyond the quasiparticle random phase approximation. Such correlations are accounted for by coupling single nucleons to collective degrees of freedom (nuclear vibrations), and are found essential to reproduce available experimental $\beta$-decay rates and more precise many-body methods. We find that the nucleon-vibration correlations tend to decrease the probability of decay via first-forbidden transition near stability, as they enhance Gamow-Teller transitions at low energy. While in the lighter systems allowed transitions dominate, the decay of $N=126$ and $N=184$ nuclei is found to occur to a large extent via first-forbidden transitions, and in particular those induced by $1^-$ and $0^-$ operators. Overall the many-body method based on nucleon-vibration coupling provides an ideal framework for future large-scale calculations. Upcoming experimental measurements of $\beta$-decay rates in the $N=126$ region by radioactive-beam facilities will be crucial in order to validate the approach.</description>

      <title>A simple model to investigate jet quenching and correlated errors for centrality-dependent nuclear-modification factors in relativistic heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03724v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply Bayesian techniques to compare a simple, empirical model for jet-quenching in heavy-ion collisions to centrality-dependent jet-$R_{AA}$ measured by ATLAS for Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=5.02$~TeV. We find that the $R_{AA}$ values for central collisions are adequately described with a model for the mean $p_T$-dependent jet energy-loss using only 2-parameters. This model is extended by incorporating 2D initial geometry information from TRENTO and compared to centrality-dependent $R_{AA}$ values. We find that the results are sensitive to value of the jet-quenching formation time, $\tau_f$, and that the optimal value of $\tau_f$ varies with the assumed path-length dependence of the energy-loss. We construct a covariance error matrix for the data from the $p_T$ dependent contributions to the ATLAS systematic errors and perform Bayesian calibrations for several different assumptions for the systematic error correlations. We show that most-probable functions and $\chi^2$ values are sensitive to assumptions made when fitting to correlated errors.</description>

      <title>Ground-state properties and structure evolutions of odd-$A$ transuranium Bk isotopes by deformed relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov theory in continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08077v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The studies of transuranium nuclei are of vital significance in exploring the existence of the ``island of superheavy nuclei". This work presents the systematic investigations for the ground-state properties and structure evolutions of odd-$A$ transuranium Bk isotopes taking the deformed relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov theory in continuum~(DRHBc) with PC-PK1 density functional, in comparison with those by spherical relativistic continuum Hartree-Bogoliubov~(RCHB) theory. The DRHBc calculations offer improved descriptions of the binding energies, closely aligning with the experimental data. The incorporation of deformation effects in DRHBc results in enhanced nuclear binding energies and a notable reduction in $\alpha$-decay energies. With the rotational corrections further incorporated, the theoretical deviation by DRHBc from the experimental data is further reduced. Based on the two-neutron gap $\delta_{\rm 2n}$ and the neutron pairing energy $E_{\rm pair}^n$, prominent shell closures at $N=184$ and $258$, as well as potential sub-shell structures at $N=142, 150, 162, 178, 218$, and $230$ are exhibited. A quasi-periodic variation among prolate, oblate, and spherical shapes as well as prolate deformation predominance have been shown in the evolutions of the quadrupole deformation. Possible shape coexistence is predicted in $^{331}$Bk with the oblate and prolate minima in close energies, which is further supported by the triaxial relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov theory in continuum~(TRHBc) calculations.</description>

      <title>Nuclear density dependence of polarization transfer in quasi-elastic ${\rm A}(\vec{e},e' \vec{p})$ reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01935v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ratio of the transverse and longitudinal component of polarization transfer to protons in the quasi-elastic $(\vec{e}, e^{\prime} \vec{p}\,)$ reaction, $P^{\prime}_x/P^{\prime}_z$, is sensitive to the proton's electromagnetic form factor ratio, $G_E/G_M$. To explore density-dependent in-medium modifications, a comparison of polarization transfer ratios involving protons from distinct nuclear shells, each with different local nuclear densities, has been proposed. In this study, we present such comparisons between four shells, $1s_{1/2}$, $1p_{3/2}$ in $^{12}\mathrm{C}$ and $1d_{3/2}$, $2s_{1/2}$ in $^{40}\mathrm{Ca}$. In an effort to account for other many-body effects that may differ between shells, we use a state-of-the-art relativistic distorted-wave impulse-approximation (RDWIA) calculation and present the double ratios, $(P^{\prime}_x/P^{\prime}_z)_{\rm Data}/(P^{\prime}_x/P^{\prime}_z)_{\rm RDWIA}$ as well as the super ratios, $\left[(P^{\prime}_x/P^{\prime}_z)_{\rm A}/(P^{\prime}_x/P^{\prime}_z)_{\rm B}\right]_{\rm Data}/\left[(P^{\prime}_x/P^{\prime}_z)_{\rm A}/(P^{\prime}_x/P^{\prime}_z)_{\rm B}\right]_{\rm RDWIA}$, for chosen shells A and B, as a function of effective local nuclear densities. We find that double ratios for individual shells show a dependence on the probed effective nuclear densities. Studying the ratios, we observed a systematic variation between pairs of higher- and lower-density shells.</description>

      <title>The Ghent Hybrid Model in NuWro: a new neutrino single-pion production model in the GeV regime</title>

Abstract: Neutrino-induced single-pion production constitutes an essential interaction channel in modern neutrino oscillation experiments, with its products building up a significant fraction of the observable hadronic final states. Frameworks of oscillation analyses strongly rely on Monte Carlo neutrino event generators, which provide theoretical predictions of neutrino interactions on nuclear targets. Thus, it is crucial to integrate state-of-the-art single-pion production models with Monte Carlo simulations to prepare for the upcoming systematics-dominated landscape of neutrino measurements. In this work, we present the implementation of the Ghent Hybrid model for neutrino-induced single-pion production in the NuWro Monte Carlo event generator. The interaction dynamics includes coherently-added contributions from nucleon resonances and a non-resonant background, merged into the pythia branching predictions in the deep-inelastic regime, as instrumented by NuWro. This neutrino-nucleon interaction model is fully incorporated into the nuclear framework of the generator, allowing it to account for the influence of both initial- and final-state nuclear medium effects. We compare the predictions of this integrated implementation with recent pion production data from accelerator-based neutrino experiments. The results of the novel model show improved agreement of the generator predictions with the data and point to the significance of the refined treatment of the description of pion-production processes beyond the $\Delta$ region.</description>

      <title>Hybrid approach to perfect and dissipative spin hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03106v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A hybrid framework of spin hydrodynamics is proposed that combines the results of kinetic theory for particles with spin 1/2 with the Israel-Stewart method of introducing nonequilibrium dynamics. The framework of kinetic theory is used to define the perfect-fluid description that conserves baryon number, energy, linear momentum and spin part of angular momentum. This leads to the entropy conservation although, in the presence of spin degrees of freedom, the perfect-fluid formalism includes extra terms whose structure is usually attributed to dissipation. The genuine dissipative terms appear from the condition of positive entropy production in nonequilibrium processes. They are responsible for the transfer between the spin and orbital parts of angular momentum, with the total angular momentum being conserved.</description>

      <title>Renormalization-group consistent treatment of color superconductivity in the NJL model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06704v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model and specifically its extension to color superconductivity (CSC) is a popular effective model for investigating dense quark matter. However, the reliability of its results is challenged by cutoff artifacts, which emerge if temperature or chemical potential are of the order of the cutoff energy scales. In this work, we generalize an idea from [Braun et al. SciPost Phys., 6:056, 2019], which is based on the requirement of renormalization-group (RG) consistency and has successfully been applied to the two-flavor Quark-Meson-Diquark model, to the NJL model for electrically and color-neutral three-flavor color-superconducting quark matter. To this end, we analyze the medium divergences of the model and eliminate them by appropriate counterterms, introducing three different schemes. We show that the RG-consistent treatment removes the cutoff artifacts of the conventional regularization and enables the investigation of CSC matter at higher densities by the model. Our studies reveal the emergence of a so-called d-quark superconducting (dSC) phase within the melting pattern of the Color-Flavor Locked (CFL) phase at high chemical potentials, consistent with earlier Ginzburg-Landau analyses.</description>

      <title>How the QCD trace anomaly behaves at the core of twin stars?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11614v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the behavior of the dense and cold (normalized) QCD trace anomaly, $\Delta$, in the interior of twin neutron stars (obtained from several sets of equations of state in agreement with modern compact-star and multimessenger data) satisfying static and dynamic stability conditions. We scan the formed twin-star parameter space in order to look for effects caused by the presence of a strong first-order phase transition connecting hadron and quark phases by means of a Maxwell construction. We found robustly that $\Delta$ suffers an abrupt decrease around the transition point, even reaching large negative values ($\Delta\simeq-0.35$), in marked contrast to current studies pointing out a smooth behavior with $\Delta\gtrsim 0$ at all densities. Besides, we characterize the behavior of {the recently defined} conformal factor, $d_{c}$, in our four categories of twin stars for which we perform comparisons with theoretical constraints put, e.g. by Bayesian studies sometimes adjusted to agree with perturbative QCD at high densities. These analyses allow us to hypothesize modifications in the strong QCD coupling in dense nuclear matter with a strong thermodynamic discontinuity.</description>

      <title>Heavy-quark diffusion in 2+1D and Glasma-like plasmas: evidence of a transport peak</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12646v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine how plasma excitations affect the heavy-quark diffusion coefficient in 2+1 dimensional and Glasma-like plasmas, akin to the pre-equilibrium matter describing relativistic heavy-ion collisions at early times. We find that the transport coefficient $2\kappa$ transverse to and $\kappa_z$ along the beam direction display a qualitatively different evolution. We attribute this to the underlying excitation spectra of these systems, thus providing evidence for the existence of non-perturbative properties in the spectrum. This is accomplished by first reconstructing the diffusion coefficients using gauge-fixed correlation functions, which accurately reproduces the time evolution of $2\kappa$ and $\kappa_z$. We then modify these excitation spectra to study the impact of their non-perturbative features on the transport coefficients. In particular, we find evidence for a novel transport peak in the low-frequency spectrum that is crucial for heavy-quark diffusion. We also demonstrate that gluonic excitations are broad while scalar excitations associated with $\kappa_z$ are narrow and strongly enhanced at low momenta. Our findings indicate that the large values and dynamical properties of transport coefficients in the Glasma could originate from genuinely non-perturbative features in the spectrum.</description>

      <title>A Quantum Annealing Protocol to Solve the Nuclear Shell Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06954v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The nuclear shell model accurately describes the structure and dynamics of atomic nuclei. However, the exponential scaling of the basis size with the number of degrees of freedom hampers a direct numerical solution for heavy nuclei. In this work, we present a quantum annealing protocol to obtain nuclear ground states. We propose a tailored driver Hamiltonian that preserves a large gap and validate our approach in a dozen nuclei with basis sizes up to $10^5$ using classical simulations of the annealing evolution. We explore the relation between the spectral gap and the total time of the annealing protocol, assessing its accuracy by comparing the fidelity and energy relative error to classical benchmarks. While the nuclear Hamiltonian is non-local and thus challenging to implement in current setups, the estimated computational cost of our annealing protocol on quantum circuits is polynomial in the many-body basis size, paving the way to study heavier nuclei.</description>

      <title>Simple Scaling Laws for Energy Correlators in Nuclear Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15298v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Collider experiments involving nuclei provide a direct means of studying exotic states of nuclear matter. Recent measurements of energy correlators in both proton-nucleus (p-A) and nucleus-nucleus (A-A) collisions reveal sizable modifications, attributable to nuclear effects, compared to proton-proton (p-p) collisions. Energy correlators, and their associated light-ray operator product expansion (OPE), allow scaling behaviors of the measured spectrum to be directly mapped to properties of the underlying quantum field theory. Here, we demonstrate for the first time how this mapping occurs in nuclear collisions, and highlight how the light-ray OPE characterizes leading nuclear effects. We show that the leading modification to the energy correlator distribution is characterized by an enhancement of the expectation value of twist-4 light-ray operators, resulting in a scaling for the ratio of the two-point correlator in nuclear matter to that in vacuum of $\sim 1+a\theta^2$ up to quantum corrections. We verify that this leading twist-4 correction accurately describes recent A-A and p-A data, and is thus sufficient to capture the scaling behavior within the angular range measured for jet radii used in nuclear experiments. Our light-ray OPE based approach lays the groundwork for a rigorous characterization of nuclear modification to energy correlator observables.</description>
