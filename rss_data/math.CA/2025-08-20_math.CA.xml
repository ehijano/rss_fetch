      <title>Algebraization of infinite summation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An algebraic framework in which to study infinite sums is proposed, complementing and augmenting the usual topological tools. The framework subsumes numerous examples in the literature. It is developed using many varied examples, with a particular emphasis on infinitizing the usual group and ring axioms. Comparing these examples reveals that a few key algebraic properties play a crucial role in the behaviors of different forms of infinite summation. Special attention is given to associativity, which is particularly difficult to properly infinitize. In that context, there is an important technique called the Eilenberg-Mazer swindle that is studied and greatly generalized.
  Some special properties are singled out as potential axioms. Interactions between these potential axioms are analyzed, and numerous results explore how to impose new axioms while retaining old ones. In some cases the axioms classify or categorize a given example. Surprisingly, such axiomatizations are very concise, relying on only a handful of natural conditions.
  These investigations reveal more precisely the part that topology plays in the formation of infinite sums. Special attention is given to the methods of partial summation and unconditional summation. In the opposite direction, it is proved that from the infinite sums alone one can create a refined topology, lying between the original topology and its sequential coreflection. Another especially interesting application of these ideas is the construction of new algebraic quotient structures that retain the ability to handle infinite summation.</description>

      <title>The It{\^o}-F\"ollmer formula -- nonstandard cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this note is to prove the It{\^o}-F\"ollmer formula for the c\`adl\`ag paths possessing quadratic variation in a possibly ``weakest'' sense along some sequence of partitions. By this we mean, for example, that we do not require the jumps of the quadratic variation to occur exactly at the times when the path itself jumps or that the quadratic variation exists at all time instances. Moreover, we deal with more general partitions than partitions with vanishing mesh used by F\"ollmer, also relaxing restrictions imposed on a sequence of partitions in other related literature.</description>

      <title>Fourier decay and absolute continuity for typical homogeneous self-similar measures in ${\mathbb R}^d$ for $d\ge 3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider iterated function systems (IFS) in ${\mathbb R}^d$ for $d\ge 3$ of the form $\{f_j(x) = \lambda {\mathcal O} x + a_j\}_{j=0}^m$, with $a_0=0$ and $m\ge 1$. Here $\lambda\in (0,1)$ is the contraction ratio and ${\mathcal O}$ is an orthogonal matrix. Given a positive probability vector $p$, there is a unique invariant (stationary) measure for the IFS, called (in this case) a homogeneous self-similar measure, which we denote $\mu(\lambda {\mathcal O}, {\mathcal D}, p)$, where ${\mathcal D} = \{a_0,\ldots,a_m\}$ is the set of ``vector digits''. We obtain two results on Fourier decay for such measures. First we show that if ${\mathcal D}$ spans ${\mathbb R}^d$, then for every fixed ${\mathcal O}$ and $p$ the measure $\mu(\lambda {\mathcal O}, {\mathcal D}, p)$ has power Fourier decay (equivalently, positive Fourier dimension) for all but a zero-Hausdorff dimension set of $\lambda$. In our second result we do not impose any restrictions on ${\mathcal D}$, other than the necessary one of affine irreducibility, and obtain power Fourier decay for almost all homogeneous self-similar measures; however, only for even $d\ge 4$. Combined with recent work of Corso and Shmerkin [arXiv:2409.04608] , these results imply absolute continuity for almost all self-similar measures under the same assumptions, in the super-critical parameter region.</description>

      <title>Spectrality of a class of moran measures on $\mathbb{R}^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11200v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate spectral properties of planar Moran measures $\mu_{\{M_n\},\{D_n\}}$ generated by sequences of expanding matrices $\{M_n\}\subset GL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ and digit sets $\{D_n\}\subset\mathbb{Z}^2$, where each digit set has the form
  $$
  D_n = \left\{
  \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix},
  \begin{pmatrix} \alpha_{n_1} \\ \alpha_{n_2} \end{pmatrix},
  \begin{pmatrix} \beta_{n_1} \\ \beta_{n_2} \end{pmatrix},
  \begin{pmatrix} -\alpha_{n_1}-\beta_{n_1} \\ -\alpha_{n_2}-\beta_{n_2} \end{pmatrix}
  \right\}
  $$
  satisfying $\alpha_{n_1}\beta_{n_2}-\alpha_{n_2}\beta_{n_1} \ne 0 \pmod{2}$. Under the hypotheses $|\det(M_n)| &gt; 4$ for all $n\geq 1$, $\sup_{n\geq 1}\|M_n^{-1}\| &lt; 1$, and $\{D_n\}$ is finite, we establish the following characterization:
  $$
  \mu_{\{M_n\},\{D_n\}} \text{ is a spectral measure} \Longleftrightarrow M_n \in GL(2,2\mathbb{Z}) \text{ for all } n\geq 2.
  $$
  Furthermore, for the critical case $|\det(M_n)| = 4$, we derive a complete spectral criterion for a significant class of Moran measures through combinatorial analysis of digit sets. These results extend current understanding of spectral self-affine measures to Moran-type constructions.</description>

      <title>On the extremal eigenvalues of Jacobi ensembles at zero temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01369v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For the $\beta$-Hermite, Laguerre, and Jacobi ensembles of dimension $N$ there exist central limit theorems for the freezing case $\beta\to\infty$ such that the associated means and covariances can be expressed in terms of the associated Hermite, Laguerre, and Jacobi polynomials of order $N$ respectively as well as via the associated dual polynomials in the sense of de Boor and Saff. In this paper we derive limits for $N\to\infty$ for the covariances of the $r\in\mathbb N$ largest (and smallest) eigenvalues for these frozen Jacobi ensembles in terms of Bessel functions. These results correspond to the hard edge analysis in the frozen Laguerre cases by Andraus and Lerner-Brecher and to known results for finite $\beta$.</description>

      <title>H\"older continuous mappings, differential forms and the Heisenberg groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11506v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop analysis of H\"older continuous mappings with applications to geometry and topology of the Heisenberg groups. We cover the theory of distributional Jacobians of H\"older continuous mappings and pullbacks of differential forms under H\"older continuous mappings. That includes versions of the change of variables formula and the Stokes theorem for H\"older continuous mappings. The main applications are in the setting of the Heisenberg groups, where we provide a simple proof of a generalization of the Gromov non-embedding theorem, and new results about the H\"older homotopy groups of the Heisenberg groups.</description>

      <title>On the Algebraic Independence of a Set of Generalized Constants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12123v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neither the Euler-Mascheroni constant, $\gamma=0.577215\ldots$, nor the Euler-Gompertz constant, $\delta=0.596347\ldots$, is currently known to be irrational. However, it has been proved that these two numbers are disjunctively transcendental; that is, at least one of them must be transcendental. The two constants are related through a well-known equation of Hardy, which recently has been generalized to a pair of infinite sequences ($\gamma^{\left(n\right)}$,$\delta^{\left(n\right)}$) based on moments of the Gumbel(0,1) probability distribution. In the present work, we demonstrate the algebraic independence of the set $\{\tfrac{\delta^{\left(n\right)}}{e}+\gamma^{\left(n\right)}\}_{n\geq0}$, and thus the transcendence of $\tfrac{\delta^{\left(n\right)}}{e}+\gamma^{\left(n\right)}$ for all $n\geq0$. This further implies the disjunctive-transcendence of each pair ($\gamma^{\left(n\right)}$,$\tfrac{\delta^{\left(n\right)}}{e}$).</description>

      <title>Amplitude maximization in stable systems, Schur positivity, and some conjectures on polynomial interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13554v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For $r &gt; 0$ and integers $t \ge n &gt; 0$, we consider the following problem: maximize the amplitude $|x_t|$ at time $t$, over all complex solutions $x = (x_0, x_1, \dots)$ of arbitrary homogeneous linear difference equations of order $n$ with the characteristic roots in the disc $\{z \in \mathbb{C}: |z| \le r\}$, and with initial values $x_0, \dots, x_{n-1}$ in the unit disc. We find that for any triple $t,n,r$, the maximum is attained with coinciding roots on the boundary circle; in particular, this implies that the peak amplitude $\sup_{t \ge n} |x_t|$ can be maximized explicitly, by studying a unique equation with the characteristic polynomial $(z-r)^n$. Moreover, the optimality of the cophase root configuration holds for origin-centered polydiscs. To prove this result, we first reduce the problem to a certain interpolation problem over monomials, then solve the latter by leveraging the theory of symmetric functions and identifying the associated Schur positivity structure. We also discuss the implications for more general Reinhardt domains. Finally, we study the problem of estimating the derivatives of a real entire function from its values at $n/2$ pairs of complex conjugate points in the unit disc. We propose conjectures on the extremality of the monomial $z^n$, and restate them in terms of Schur polynomials.</description>
