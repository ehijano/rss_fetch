      <title>Anatomy of Machines for Markowitz: Decision-Focused Learning for Mean-Variance Portfolio Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Markowitz laid the foundation of portfolio theory through the mean-variance optimization (MVO) framework. However, the effectiveness of MVO is contingent on the precise estimation of expected returns, variances, and covariances of asset returns, which are typically uncertain. Machine learning models are becoming useful in estimating uncertain parameters, and such models are trained to minimize prediction errors, such as mean squared errors (MSE), which treat prediction errors uniformly across assets. Recent studies have pointed out that this approach would lead to suboptimal decisions and proposed Decision-Focused Learning (DFL) as a solution, integrating prediction and optimization to improve decision-making outcomes. While studies have shown DFL's potential to enhance portfolio performance, the detailed mechanisms of how DFL modifies prediction models for MVO remain unexplored. This study aims to investigate how DFL adjusts stock return prediction models to optimize decisions in MVO, addressing the question: "MSE treats the errors of all assets equally, but how does DFL reduce errors of different assets differently?" Answering this will provide crucial insights into optimal stock return prediction for constructing efficient portfolios.</description>

      <title>Robust Reinforcement Learning with Dynamic Distortion Risk Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a reinforcement learning (RL) setting, the agent's optimal strategy heavily depends on her risk preferences and the underlying model dynamics of the training environment. These two aspects influence the agent's ability to make well-informed and time-consistent decisions when facing testing environments. In this work, we devise a framework to solve robust risk-aware RL problems where we simultaneously account for environmental uncertainty and risk with a class of dynamic robust distortion risk measures. Robustness is introduced by considering all models within a Wasserstein ball around a reference model. We estimate such dynamic robust risk measures using neural networks by making use of strictly consistent scoring functions, derive policy gradient formulae using the quantile representation of distortion risk measures, and construct an actor-critic algorithm to solve this class of robust risk-aware RL problems. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm on a portfolio allocation example.</description>
