      <title>Provenance Analysis and Semiring Semantics for First-Order Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A provenance analysis for a query evaluation or a model checking computation extracts information on how its result depends on the atomic facts of the model or database. Traditional work on data provenance was, to a large extent, restricted to positive query languages or the negation-free fragment of first-order logic and showed how provenance abstractions can be usefully described as elements of commutative semirings -- most generally as multivariate polynomials with positive integer coefficients. We describe and evaluate here a provenance approach for dealing with negation, based on quotient semirings of polynomials with dual indeterminates. This not only provides a semiring provenance analysis for full first-order logic (and other logics and query languages with negation) but also permits a reverse provenance analysis, i.e., finding models that satisfy various properties under given provenance tracking assumptions. We describe the potential for applications to explaining missing query answers or failures of integrity constraints, and to using these explanations for computing repairs. This approach also is the basis of a systematic study of semiring semantics in a broad logical context.</description>

      <title>Safe Composition of Systems of Communicating Finite State Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Participants-as-Interfaces (PaI) approach to system composition suggests that participants of a system may be viewed as interfaces. Given a set of systems,one participant per system is chosen to play the role of an interface. When systems are composed, the interface participants are replaced by gateways which communicate to each other by forwarding messages. The PaI-approach for systems of asynchronous communicating finite state machines (CFSMs) has been exploited in the literature for binary composition only, with a  (necessarily)  unique forwarding policy. In this paper we consider the case of multiple system composition when forwarding gateways are not uniquely determined and their interactions depend on specific connection policies complying with a connection model. We represent connection policies as CFSM systems and prove that a bunch of relevant  communication properties (deadlock-freeness, reception-error-freeness, etc.) are preserved by PaI multicomposition, with the proviso that also the used connection policy does enjoy the communication property taken into account.</description>

      <title>Intrinsically Correct Sorting in Cubical Agda</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper "Sorting with Bialgebras and Distributive Laws" by Hinze et al. uses the framework of bialgebraic semantics to define sorting algorithms. From distributive laws between functors they construct pairs of sorting algorithms using both folds and unfolds. Pairs of sorting algorithms arising this way include insertion/selection sort and quick/tree sort.
  We extend this work to define intrinsically correct variants in cubical Agda. Our key idea is to index our data types by multisets, which concisely captures that a sorting algorithm terminates with an ordered permutation of its input list. By lifting bialgebraic semantics to the indexed setting, we obtain the correctness of sorting algorithms purely from the distributive law.</description>

      <title>Efficient and Verified Continuous Double Auctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuous double auctions are commonly used to match orders at currency, stock, and commodities exchanges. A verified implementation of continuous double auctions is a useful tool for market regulators as they give rise to automated checkers that are guaranteed to detect errors in the trade logs of an existing exchange if they contain trades that violate the matching rules. We provide an efficient and formally verified implementation of continuous double auctions that takes $O(n \log n)$ time to match $n$ orders. This improves an earlier $O(n^2)$ verified implementation. We also prove a matching $\Omega(n\log n)$ lower bound on the running time for continuous double auctions. Our new implementation takes only a couple of minutes to run on ten million randomly generated orders as opposed to a few days taken by the earlier implementation. Our new implementation gives rise to an efficient automatic checker.
  We use the Coq proof assistant for verifying our implementation and extracting a verified OCaml program. While using Coq's standard library implementation of red-black trees to obtain our improvement, we observed that its specification has serious gaps, which we fill in this work; this might be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>A Gentle Overview of Asynchronous Session-based Concurrency: Deadlock Freedom by Typing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While formal models of concurrency tend to focus on synchronous communication, asynchronous communication is relevant in practice. In this paper, we will discuss asynchronous communication in the context of session-based concurrency, the model of computation in which session types specify the structure of the two-party protocols implemented by the channels of a communicating process. We overview recent work on addressing the challenge of ensuring the deadlock-freedom property for message-passing processes that communicate asynchronously in cyclic process networks governed by session types. We offer a  gradual presentation of three typed process frameworks and outline how they may be used to guarantee deadlock freedom for a concurrent functional language with sessions.</description>

      <title>A Principled Solution to the Disjunction Problem of Diagrammatic Query Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finding unambiguous diagrammatic representations for first-order logical formulas and relational queries with arbitrarily nested disjunctions has been a surprisingly long-standing unsolved problem. We refer to this problem as the disjunction problem (of diagrammatic query representations).
  This work solves the disjunction problem. Our solution unifies, generalizes, and overcomes the shortcomings of prior approaches for disjunctions. It extends the recently proposed Relational Diagrams and is identical for disjunction-free queries. However, it can preserve the relational patterns and the safety for all well-formed Tuple Relational Calculus (TRC) queries, even with arbitrary disjunctions. Additionally, its size is proportional to the original TRC query and can thus be exponentially more succinct than Relational Diagrams.</description>

      <title>Unifying cubical and multimodal type theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.13000v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we combine the principled approach to modalities from multimodal type theory (MTT) with the computationally well-behaved realization of identity types from cubical type theory (CTT). The result -- cubical modal type theory (Cubical MTT) -- has the desirable features of both systems. In fact, the whole is more than the sum of its parts: Cubical MTT validates desirable extensionality principles for modalities that MTT only supported through ad hoc means. We investigate the semantics of Cubical MTT and provide an axiomatic approach to producing models of Cubical MTT based on the internal language of topoi and use it to construct presheaf models. Finally, we demonstrate the practicality and utility of this axiomatic approach to models by constructing a model of (cubical) guarded recursion in a cubical version of the topos of trees. We then use this model to justify an axiomatization of L\"ob induction and thereby use Cubical MTT to smoothly reason about guarded recursion.</description>

      <title>Crash-Stop Failures in Asynchronous Multiparty Session Types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11851v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Session types provide a typing discipline for message-passing systems. However, their theory often assumes an ideal world: one in which everything is reliable and without failures. Yet this is in stark contrast with distributed systems in the real world. To address this limitation, we introduce a new asynchronous multiparty session types (MPST) theory with crash-stop failures, where processes may crash arbitrarily and cease to interact after crashing. We augment asynchronous MPST and processes with crash handling branches, and integrate crash-stop failure semantics into types and processes. Our approach requires no user-level syntax extensions for global types, and features a formalisation of global semantics, which captures complex behaviours induced by crashed/crash handling processes.
  Our new theory covers the entire spectrum, ranging from the ideal world of total reliability to entirely unreliable scenarios where any process may crash, using optional reliability assumptions. Under these assumptions, we demonstrate the sound and complete correspondence between global and local type semantics, which guarantee deadlock-freedom, protocol conformance, and liveness of well-typed processes by construction, even in the presence of crashes.</description>

      <title>Interpretation of Inaccessible Sets in Martin-L\"{o}f Type Theory with One Mahlo Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15074v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Martin-L\"{o}f type theory $\mathbf{MLTT}$ was extended by Setzer with the so-called Mahlo universe types. The extension of $\mathbf{MLTT}$ with one Mahlo universe is called $\mathbf{MLM}$ and was introduced to develop a variant of $\mathbf{MLTT}$ equipped with an analogue of a large cardinal. Another instance of constructive systems extended with an analogue of a large set was formulated in the context of Aczel's constructive set theory: $\mathbf{CZF}$. Rathjen, Griffor and Palmgren extended $\mathbf{CZF}$ with inaccessible sets of all transfinite orders. While Rathjen proved that this extended system of $\mathbf{CZF}$ is interpretable in an extension of $\mathbf{MLM}$ with one usual universe type above the Mahlo universe, it is unknown whether it can be interpreted by the Mahlo universe without a universe type above it. We extend $\mathbf{MLM}$ not by a universe type but by the accessibility predicate, and show that $\mathbf{CZF}$ with inaccessible sets can be interpreted in $\mathbf{MLM}$ with the accessibility predicate. Our interpretation of this extension of $\mathbf{CZF}$ is the same as that of Rathjen, Griffor and Palmgren formulated by $\mathbf{MLTT}$ with second-order universe operators, except that we construct the inaccessible sets by using the Mahlo universe and the accessibility predicate. We formalised the main part of our interpretation in the proof assistant Agda.</description>

      <title>Hybrid-Dynamic Ehrenfeucht-Fraisse Games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02094v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ehrenfeucht-Fraisse games provide means to characterize elementary equivalence for first-order logic, and by standard translation also for modal logics. We propose a novel generalization of Ehrenfeucht- Fraisse games to hybrid-dynamic logics which is direct and fully modular: parameterized by the features of the hybrid language we wish to include, for instance, the modal and hybrid language operators as well as first-order existential quantification. We use these games to establish a new modular Fraisse-Hintikka Theorem for hybrid-dynamic propositional logic and its various fragments. We study the relationship between countable game equivalence (determined by countable Ehrenfeucht- Fraisse games) and bisimulation (determined by countable back-and-forth systems). In general, the former turns out to be weaker than the latter, but under certain conditions on the language, the two coincide. We also use games to prove that for reachable image-finite Kripke structures elementary equivalence implies isomorphism.</description>

      <title>Random Deterministic Automata With One Added Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06591v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Every language recognized by a non-deterministic finite automaton can be recognized by a deterministic automaton, at the cost of a potential increase of the number of states, which in the worst case can go from $n$ states to $2^n$ states. In this article, we investigate this classical result in a probabilistic setting where we take a deterministic automaton with $n$ states uniformly at random and add just one random transition. These automata are almost deterministic in the sense that only one state has a non-deterministic choice when reading an input letter. In our model, each state has a fixed probability to be final. We prove that for any $d\geq 1$, with non-negligible probability the minimal (deterministic) automaton of the language recognized by such an automaton has more than $n^d$ states; as a byproduct, the expected size of its minimal automaton grows faster than any polynomial. Our result also holds when each state is final with some probability that depends on $n$, as long as it is not too close to $0$ and $1$, at distance at least $\Omega(\frac1{\sqrt{n}})$ to be precise, therefore allowing models with a sublinear number of final states in expectation.</description>
