      <title>Markowitz Meets Bellman: Knowledge-distilled Reinforcement Learning for Portfolio Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Investment portfolios, central to finance, balance potential returns and risks. This paper introduces a hybrid approach combining Markowitz's portfolio theory with reinforcement learning, utilizing knowledge distillation for training agents. In particular, our proposed method, called KDD (Knowledge Distillation DDPG), consist of two training stages: supervised and reinforcement learning stages. The trained agents optimize portfolio assembly. A comparative analysis against standard financial models and AI frameworks, using metrics like returns, the Sharpe ratio, and nine evaluation indices, reveals our model's superiority. It notably achieves the highest yield and Sharpe ratio of 2.03, ensuring top profitability with the lowest risk in comparable return scenarios.</description>

      <title>The Life Care Annuity: enhancing product features and refining pricing methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02858v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The state-of-the-art proposes Life Care Annuities, that have been recently designed as variable annuity contracts with Long-Term Care payouts and Guaranteed Lifelong Withdrawal Benefits. In this paper, we propose more general features for these insurance products and refine their pricing methods. We name our proposed product ``GLWB-LTC''. In particular, as to the product features, we allow dynamic withdrawal strategies, including the surrender option. Furthermore, we consider stochastic interest rates, described by a Cox-Ingersoll-Ross process. As to the numerical methods, we solve the stochastic control problem involved by the selection of the optimal withdrawal strategy through a robust tree method, which outperforms the Monte Carlo approach. We name this method ``Tree-LTC'', and we use it to estimate the fair price of the product, as some relevant parameters vary, such as, for instance, the entry age of the policyholder. Furthermore, our numerical results show how the optimal withdrawal strategy varies over time with the health status of the policyholder. Our findings stress the important advantage of flexible withdrawal strategies in relation to insurance policies offering protection from health risks. Indeed, the policyholder is given more choice about how much to save for protection from the possible disability states at future times.</description>
