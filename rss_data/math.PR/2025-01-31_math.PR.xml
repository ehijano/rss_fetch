      <title>Cutoff for activated random walk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the mixing time of driven-dissipative activated random walk on an interval of length $n$ with uniform or central driving exhibits cutoff at $n$ times the critical density for activated random walk on the integers. The proof uses a new result for arbitrary graphs showing that the chain is mixed once activity is likely at every site.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation Correction and Global Solutions for the Stochastic Shigesada-Kawasaki-Teramoto System via Entropy-Based Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a noise term to account for fluctuation corrections based on the particle system approximation for the n-species Shigesada-Kawasaki-Teramoto (SKT) system. For the resulting system of stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs), we establish the existence of nonnegative, global, weak martingale solutions. Our approach utilizes the regularization technique, which is grounded in the entropy structure of the system.</description>

      <title>Convergence rates for an Adaptive Biasing Potential scheme from a Wasserstein optimization perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Free-energy-based adaptive biasing methods, such as Metadynamics, the Adaptive Biasing Force (ABF) and their variants, are enhanced sampling algorithms widely used in molecular simulations. Although their efficiency has been empirically acknowledged for decades, providing theoretical insights via a quantitative convergence analysis is a difficult problem, in particular for the kinetic Langevin diffusion, which is non-reversible and hypocoercive. We obtain the first exponential convergence result for such a process, in an idealized setting where the dynamics can be associated with a mean-field non-linear flow on the space of probability measures. A key of the analysis is the interpretation of the (idealized) algorithm as the gradient descent of a suitable functional over the space of probability distributions.</description>

      <title>Linear and uniform in time bound for the binary branching model with Moran type interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we recall the definition of the binary branching model with Moran type interactions (BBMMI) introduced in [8]. In this interacting particle system, particles evolve, reproduce and die independently and, with a probability that may depend on the configuration of the whole system, the death of a particle may trigger the reproduction of another particle, while a branching event may trigger the death of another particle. We recall its relation to the Feynman-Kac semigroup of the underlying Markov evolution and improve on the L 2 distance between their normalisations proved in [8], when additional regularity is assumed on the process.</description>

      <title>Generalised Lorden's Inequality and Convergence Rate Estimates for Non-regenerative Stochastic Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a generalisation of Lorden's inequality tailored for stochastic systems with dependent and non-identically distributed renewal times modelled as generalised renewal processes. This framework introduces the new concept of a generalised intensity, enabling the analysis of systems where classical renewal theory is inapplicable. The proposed approach is applied to a variety of complex systems, including reliability models, queueing networks and Markov-modulated processes, to establish ergodicity and derive convergence rate estimates. Unlike traditional methods relying on transition matrices or generators, our technique provides an alternative with some rigorous upper bounds, but computationally much more efficient than existent ones. This work offers a unified framework for analysing systems with dependencies and heterogeneities, bridging gaps in classical stochastic modelling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define multideterminantal probability measures, a family of probability measures on $[k]^n$ where $[k]=\{1,2,\dots,k\}$, generalizing determinantal measures (which correspond to the case $k=2$). We give examples coming from the positive Grassmannian, from the dimer model and from the spanning tree model.
  We also define and completely characterize determinantal probability measures on the permutation group $S_n$.</description>

      <title>Central limit theorems for branching processes under mild assumptions on the mean semigroup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish central limit theorems for a large class of supercritical branching Markov processes in infinite dimension with spatially dependent and non-necessarily local branching mechanisms. This result relies on a fourth moment assumption and the exponential convergence of the mean semigroup in a weighted total variation norm. This latter assumption is pretty weak and does not necessitate symmetric properties or specific spectral knowledge on this semigroup. In particular, we recover two of the three known regimes (namely the small and critical branching processes) of convergence in known cases, and extend them to a wider family of processes. To prove our central limit theorems, we use the Stein's method, which in addition allows us to newly provide a rate of convergence to this type of convergence.</description>

      <title>A random recursive tree model with doubling events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new model of random tree that grows like a random recursive tree, except at some exceptional "doubling events" when the tree is replaced by two copies of itself attached to a new root. We prove asymptotic results for the size of this tree at large times, its degree distribution, and its height profile. We also prove a lower bound for its height. Because of the doubling events that affect the tree globally, the proofs are all much more intricate than in the case of the random recursive tree in which the growing operation is always local.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear SPDEs and Maximal Regularity: An Extended Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this survey, we provide an in-depth exposition of our recent results on the well-posedness theory for stochastic evolution equations, employing maximal regularity techniques. The core of our approach is an abstract notion of critical spaces, which, when applied to nonlinear SPDEs, coincides with the concept of scaling invariant spaces. This framework leads to several sharp blow-up criteria and enables one to obtain instantaneous regularization results. Additionally, we refine and unify our previous results, while also presenting several new contributions.
  In the second part of the survey, we apply the abstract results to several concrete SPDEs. In particular, we give applications to stochastic perturbations of quasi-geostrophic equations, Navier-Stokes equations, and reaction-diffusion systems (including Allen--Cahn, Cahn--Hilliard and Lotka--Volterra models). Moreover, for the Navier--Stokes equations, we establish new Serrin-type blow-up criteria. While some applications are addressed using $L^2$-theory, many require a more general $L^p(L^q)$-framework. In the final section, we outline several open problems, covering both abstract aspects of stochastic evolution equations, and concrete questions in the study of linear and nonlinear SPDEs.</description>

      <title>The scaling limit of planar maps with large faces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that large Boltzmann stable planar maps of index $\alpha \in (1;2)$ converge in the scaling limit towards a random compact metric space $\mathcal{S}_{\alpha}$ that we construct explicitly. They form a one-parameter family of random continuous spaces ``with holes'' or ``faces'' different from the Brownian sphere. In the so-called dilute phase $\alpha \in [3/2;2)$, the topology of $\mathcal{S}_{\alpha}$ is that of the Sierpinski carpet, while in the dense phase $\alpha \in (1;3/2)$ the ``faces'' of $\mathcal{S}_{\alpha}$ may touch each-others. En route, we prove various geometric properties of these objects concerning their faces or the behavior of geodesics.</description>

      <title>L2 geometric ergodicity for the kinetic Langevin process with non-equilibrium steady states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In non-equilibrium statistical physics models, the invariant measure $\mu$ of the process does not have an explicit density. In particular the adjoint $L^*$ in $L^2(\mu)$ of the generator $L$ is unknown and many classical techniques fail in this situation. An important progress has been made in [5] where functional inequalities are obtained for non-explicit steady states of kinetic equations under rather general conditions. However in [5] in the kinetic case the geometric ergodicity is only deduced from the functional inequalities for the case with conservative forces, corresponding to explicit steady states. In this note we obtain $L^2$ convergence rates in the non-equilibrium case.</description>

      <title>An optimal level of Stubbornness to win a soccer match</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study conceptualizes stubbornness as an optimal feedback Nash equilibrium within a dynamic setting. To assess a soccer player's performance, we analyze a payoff function that incorporates key factors such as injury risk, assist rate, passing accuracy, and dribbling ability. The evolution of goal-related dynamics is represented through a backward parabolic partial stochastic differential equation (BPPSDE), chosen for its theoretical connection to the Feynman-Kac formula, which links stochastic differential equations (SDEs) to partial differential equations (PDEs). This relationship allows stochastic problems to be reformulated as PDEs, facilitating both analytical and numerical solutions for complex systems. We construct a stochastic Lagrangian and utilize a path integral control framework to derive an optimal measure of stubbornness. Furthermore, we introduce a modified Ornstein-Uhlenbeck BPPSDE to obtain an explicit solution for a player's optimal level of stubbornness.</description>

      <title>Triangle-free $d$-degenerate graphs have small fractional chromatic number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A well-known conjecture by Harris states that any triangle-free $d$-degenerate graph has fractional chromatic number at most $O\left(\frac{d}{\ln d}\right)$. This conjecture has gained much attention in recent years, and is known to have many interesting implications, including a conjecture by Esperet, Kang and Thomass\'e that any triangle-free graph with minimum degree $d$ contains a bipartite induced subgraph of minimum degree $\Omega(\log d)$. Despite this attention, Harris' conjecture has remained wide open with no known improvement on the trivial upper bound, until now.
  In this article, we give an elegant proof of Harris' conjecture. In particular, we show that any triangle-free $d$-degenerate graph has fractional chromatic number at most $(4+o(1))\frac{d}{\ln d}.$ The conjecture of Esperet et al. follows as a direct consequence. We also prove a more general result, showing that for any triangle-free graph $G$, there exists a random independent set in which each vertex $v$ is included with probability $\Omega(p(v))$, where $p:V(G)\rightarrow [0,1]$ is any function that satisfies a natural condition.</description>

      <title>The No-Underrun Sampler: A Locally-Adaptive, Gradient-Free MCMC Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce the No-Underrun Sampler (NURS): a locally-adaptive, gradient-free Markov chain Monte Carlo method that combines elements of Hit-and-Run and the No-U-Turn Sampler. NURS dynamically adapts to the local geometry of the target distribution without requiring gradient evaluations, making it especially suitable for applications where gradients are unavailable or costly. We establish key theoretical properties, including reversibility, formal connections to Hit-and-Run and Random Walk Metropolis, Wasserstein contraction comparable to Hit-and-Run in Gaussian targets, and bounds on the total variation distance between the transition kernels of Hit-and-Run and NURS. Finally, we demonstrate - through empirical experiments supported by theoretical insights - that NURS can effectively sample Neal's funnel, a challenging multi-scale distribution from Bayesian hierarchical inference.</description>

      <title>The replicator coalescent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.00998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.00998v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a stochastic model, called the replicator coalescent, describing a system of blocks of $k$ different types which undergo pairwise mergers at rates depending on the block types: with rate $C_{i,j}$ blocks of type $i$ and $j$ merge, resulting in a single block of type $i$. The replicator coalescent can be seen as generalisation of Kingman's coalescent death chain in a multi-type setting, although without an underpinning exchangeable partition structure. The name is derived from a remarkable connection we uncover between the instantaneous dynamics of this multi-type coalescent when issued from an arbitrarily large number of blocks, and the so-called replicator equations from evolutionary game theory. By dilating time arbitrarily close to zero, we see that initially, on coming down from infinity, the replicator coalescent behaves like the solution to a certain replicator equation. Thereafter, stochastic effects are felt and the process evolves more in the spirit of a multi-type death chain.</description>

      <title>The Gaussian free-field as a stream function: asymptotics of effective diffusivity in infra-red cut-off</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.14244v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the large-time asymptotics of a passive tracer with drift equal to the curl of the Gaussian free field in two dimensions with ultra-violet cut-off at scale unity. We prove that the mean-squared displacement scales like $t \sqrt{\ln t}$, as predicted in the physics literature and recently almost proved by the work of Cannizzaro, Haunschmidt-Sibitz, and Toninelli (2022), which uses mathematical-physics type analysis in Fock space. Our approach involves studying the effective diffusivity $\lambda_{L}$ of the process with an infra-red cut-off at scale $L$, and is based on techniques from stochastic homogenization.</description>

      <title>Second-Order Regular Variation and Second-Order Approximation of Hawkes Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02655v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper provides and extends second-order versions of several fundamental theorems on first-order regularly varying functions such as Karamata's theorem/representation and Tauberian's theorem. Our results are used to establish second-order approximations for the mean and variance of Hawkes processes with general kernels. Our approximations provide novel insights into the asymptotic behavior of Hawkes processes. They are also of key importance when establishing functional limit theorems for Hawkes processes.</description>

      <title>Eigenvector decorrelation for random matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10718v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the sensitivity of the eigenvectors of random matrices, showing that even small perturbations make the eigenvectors almost orthogonal. More precisely, we consider two deformed Wigner matrices $W+D_1$, $W+D_2$ and show that their bulk eigenvectors become asymptotically orthogonal as soon as $\mathrm{Tr}(D_1-D_2)^2\gg 1$, or their respective energies are separated on a scale much bigger than the local eigenvalue spacing. Furthermore, we show that quadratic forms of eigenvectors of $W+D_1$, $W+D_2$ with any deterministic matrix $A\in\mathbf{C}^{N\times N}$ in a specific subspace of codimension one are of size $N^{-1/2}$. This proves a generalization of the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis to eigenvectors belonging to two different spectral families.</description>

      <title>Density-valued solutions for the Boltzmann-Enskog process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21528v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The time evolution of moderately dense gas evolving in vacuum described by the Boltzmann-Enskog equation is studied. The associated stochastic process, the Boltzmann-Enskog process, was constructed by Albeverio, R\"udiger and Sundar (2017) and further studied by Friesen, R\"udiger and Sundar (2019, 2022). The process is given by the solution of a McKean-Vlasov equation driven by a Poisson random measure, the compensator depending on the distribution of the solution. The existence of a marginal probability density function at each time for the measure-valued solution is established here by using a functional-analytic criterion in Besov spaces Debussche and Romito (2014), and Fournier (2015). In addition to existence, the density is shown to reside in a Besov space. The support of the velocity marginal distribution is shown to be the whole of $\mathbb{R}^3$.</description>

      <title>Strict inequality between the time constants of first-passage percolation and directed first-passage percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20779v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the models of first-passage percolation and directed first-passage percolation on $\mathbb{Z}^d$, we consider a family of i.i.d. random variables indexed by the set of edges of the graph, called passage times. For every vertex $x \in \mathbb{Z}^d$ with nonnegative coordinates, we denote by $t(0,x)$ the shortest passage time to go from $0$ to $x$ and by $\vec t(0,x)$ the shortest passage time to go from $0$ to $x$ following a directed path. Under some assumptions, it is known that for every $x \in \mathbb{R}^d$ with nonnegative coordinates, $t(0,\lfloor nx \rfloor)/n$ converges to a constant $\mu(x)$ and that $\vec t(0,\lfloor nx \rfloor)/n$ converges to a constant $\vec\mu(x)$. With these definitions, we immediately get that $\mu(x) \le \vec{\mu}(x)$. In this paper, we get the strict inequality $\mu(x) &lt; \vec\mu(x)$ as a consequence of a new exponential bound for the comparison of $t(0,x)$ and $\vec{t}(0,x)$ when $\|x\|$ goes to $\infty$. This exponential bound is itself based on a lower bound on the number of edges of geodesics in first-passage percolation (where geodesics are paths with minimal passage time).</description>

      <title>Universal Liouville action as a renormalized volume and its gradient flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18767v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The universal Liouville action (also known as the Loewner energy for Jordan curves) is a K\"ahler potential on the Weil-Petersson universal Teichm\"uller space, which is identified with the family of Weil-Petersson quasicircles via conformal welding. Our main result shows that, under regularity assumptions, the universal Liouville action equals the renormalized volume of the hyperbolic $3$-manifold bounded by the two Epstein-Poincar\'e surfaces associated with the quasicircle. We also study the gradient descent flow of the universal Liouville action for the Weil-Petersson metric and show that the flow always converges to the origin (the circle). This provides a bound of the Weil-Petersson distance to the origin by the universal Liouville action.</description>

      <title>Risk measures on incomplete markets: a new non-solid paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05194v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study risk measures $\varphi:E\longrightarrow\mathbb{R}\cup\{\infty\}$, where $E$ is a vector space of random variables which a priori has no lattice structure$\unicode{x2014}$a blind spot of the existing risk measures literature. In particular, we address when $\varphi$ admits a tractable dual representation (one which does not contain non-$\sigma$-additive signed measures), and whether one can extend $\varphi$ to a solid superspace of $E$. The existence of a tractable dual representation is shown to be equivalent, modulo certain technicalities, to a Fatou-like property, while extension theorems are established under the existence of a sufficiently regular lift, a potentially non-linear mechanism of assigning random variable extensions to certain linear functionals on $E$. Our motivation is broadening the theory of risk measures to spaces without a lattice structure, which are ubiquitous in financial economics, especially when markets are incomplete.</description>

      <title>Constructing self-similar subsets within the fractal support of Lacunary Wavelet Series for their multifractal analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17712v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a fractal $\mathcal{I}$ whose Hausdorff dimension matches with the upper-box dimension, we propose a new method which consists in selecting inside $\mathcal{I}$ some subsets (called quasi-Cantor sets) of almost same dimension and with controled properties of self-similarties at prescribed scales. It allows us to estimate below the Hausdorff dimension $\mathcal{I}$ intersected to limsup sets of contracted balls selected according a Bernoulli law, in contexts where classical Mass Transference Principles cannot be applied. We apply this result to the computation of the increasing multifractal spectrum of lacunary wavelet series supported on $\mathcal{I}$.</description>
