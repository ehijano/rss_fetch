      <title>On the influence of powder particle size on single-track formation in laser powder bed fusion of AlSi10Mg alloy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present the results of single-track experiments conducted for different fractions of standard AlSi10Mg powder, which were sieved to achieve varying mean size of the particles. We observed strong differences in the melting behaviour of fractions at relatively low levels of input energy in laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) process. Namely, the remarkable particle size effect arises for the position of lack of fusion boundary, i.e. for the range of process parameters where the laser power becomes sufficient for complete through-thickness melting of the powder layer at given laser scanning speed. We established that this boundary corresponds to an approximately constant linear energy density at low levels of Peclet number (Pe &lt; 2), while the constant enthalpy density defines this boundary at the higher levels (Pe &gt; 2). Specifically, when the mean particle size ranges from 28 to 64 microns, the required linear energy density for stable track formation ranges from 50 to 167 J/m and the nominal enthalpy density ranges from 4.4 to 15 J/mm^3. Based on the scaling law analysis and numerical simulations, we show that observed phenomena can be attributed to the change of absorptivity of powder layer, which depends on particle size and packing density. Also, we show that the values of absorptivity identified based on the analysis of position of lack of fusion boundary (0.13-0.38 for powder size 64-28 microns) correlate well with those found from the analysis of melt pool width in the formed single-tracks.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Particle Swarm Optimization for Fast and Reliable Parameter Extraction in Thermoreflectance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Frequency-domain thermoreflectance (FDTR) is a widely used technique for characterizing thermal properties of multilayer thin films. However, extracting multiple parameters from FDTR measurements presents a nonlinear inverse problem due to its high dimensionality and multimodal, non-convex solution space. This study evaluates four popular global optimization algorithms: Genetic Algorithm (GA), Quantum Genetic Algorithm (QGA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and Fireworks Algorithm (FWA), for extracting parameters from FDTR measurements of a GaN/Si heterostructure. However, none achieve reliable convergence within 60 seconds. To improve convergence speed and accuracy, we propose an AI-driven hybrid optimization framework that combines each global algorithm with a Quasi-Newton local refinement method, resulting in four hybrid variants: HGA, HQGA, HPSO, and HFWA. Among these, HPSO outperforms all other methods, with 80% of trials reaching the target fitness value within 60 seconds, showing greater robustness and a lower risk of premature convergence. In contrast, only 30% of HGA and HQGA trials and 20% of HFWA trials achieve this threshold. We then evaluate the worst-case performance across 100 independent trials for each algorithm when the time is extended to 1000 seconds. Only HPSO, PSO, and HGA consistently reach the target accuracy, with HPSO converging five times faster than the others. HPSO provides a general-purpose solution for inverse problems in thermal metrology and can be readily extended to other model-fitting techniques.</description>

      <title>Probing Bound State Relaxation Dynamics in Systems Out-of-Equilibrium on Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pump-probe spectroscopy is a powerful tool for probing response dynamics of quantum many-body systems in and out-of-equilibrium. Quantum computers have proved useful in simulating such experiments by exciting the system, evolving, and then measuring observables to first order, all in one setting. Here, we use this approach to investigate the mixed-field Ising model, where the longitudinal field plays the role of a confining potential that prohibits the spread of the excitations, spinons, or domain walls into space. We study the discrete bound states that arise from such a setting and their evolution under different quench dynamics by initially pumping the chain out of equilibrium and then probing various non-equal time correlation functions. Finally, we study false vacuum decay, where initially one expects unhindered propagation of the ground state, or true vacuum, bubbles into the lattice, but instead sees the emergence of Bloch oscillations that are directly the reason for the long-lived oscillations in this finite-size model. Our work sets the stage for simulating systems out-of-equilibrium on classical and quantum computers using pump-probe experiments without needing ancillary qubits.</description>

      <title>Time-Dependent Parameters in Quantum Systems: Revisiting Berry Phase, Curvature and Gauge Connections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a reformulation of quantum adiabatic theory in terms of an emergent electromagnetic framework, emphasizing the physical consequences of geometric structures in parameter space. Contrary to conventional approaches, we demonstrate that a Berry electric field naturally arises in systems with dynamic Hamiltonian, when the full time-dependent wavefunction is used to define the gauge potentials. This surprising result bridges the gap between static and dynamical formulations and leads to a deeper understanding of how gauge structures manifest in quantum systems. Building on this, we construct Berry Maxwell equations by analogy with classical electrodynamics, defining Berry electric and magnetic fields as derivatives of scalar and vector potentials obtained from the full quantum state. We verify these equations explicitly and derive field-theoretic identities such as generalized continuity and vorticity relations. This field-based formulation reveals the topological charges, monopole structures, and gauge currents that underlie parameter space, and clarifies how Berry curvature corrections enter dynamical quantities like expectation values and particle velocities. Our results establish a new regime of emergent electromagnetism in parameter space, unifying time-independent and time-dependent geometric phases within a covariant formalism. The implications extend to quantum transport, polarization, and topological classification of phases, providing a robust and generalizable framework for quantum systems driven by adiabatic or nonadiabatic evolution.</description>

      <title>Enhanced negative capacitance in La-doped Pb(Zr$_{0.4}$Ti$_{0.6}$)O$_3$ ferroelectric capacitor by tuning bias voltage pulse to induce intrinsic domain switching kinetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a remarkable enhancement of specific negative capacitance in multidomain La-doped Pb(Zr$_{0.4}$Ti$_{0.6}$)O$_3$ (PLZT) ferroelectric capacitors when bias voltage pulse profile (amplitude and timescale) induces switching of the ferroelectric domains following intrinsic switching kinetics associated with minimum energy barrier. This is because of emergence of maximum domain wall density during ``switching" of the domains. Domain configuration changes from such an ``optimum" state if higher or lower bias voltage is applied at a much faster or slower rate. Phase-field simulation using time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equation shows dependence of the domain wall density during switching on the bias voltage amplitude and its maximization at a specific bias voltage amplitude. The radius of curvature of the resulting polarization ($P$) versus voltage ($V$) hysteresis loop at the coercive voltage ($V_C$) also turns out to be depending on whether or not intrinsic switching kinetics is followed. All these results indicate a close correlation among the bias voltage pulse profile (amplitude and time scale), domain wall density during switching, shape of the resulting ferroelectric hysteresis loop, and the transient negative capacitance. It may have important ramifications both in the context of physics behind negative capacitance in a multidomain ferroelectric capacitor and devices being developed by exploiting its advantages.</description>

      <title>Floquet Non-Bloch Formalism for a Non-Hermitian Ladder: From Theoretical Framework to Topolectrical Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Periodically driven systems intertwined with non-Hermiticity opens a rich arena for topological phases that transcend conventional Hermitian limits. The physical significance of these phases hinges on obtaining the topological invariants that restore the bulk-boundary correspondence, a task well explored for static non-Hermitian (NH) systems, while it remains elusive for the driven scenario. Here, we address this problem by constructing a generalized Floquet non-Bloch framework that analytically captures the spectral and topological properties of time-periodic NH systems. Em- ploying a high-frequency Magnus expansion, we analytically derive an effective Floquet Hamiltonian and formulate the generalized Brillouin zone for a periodically driven quasi-one-dimensional system, namely, the Creutz ladder with a staggered complex potential. Our study demonstrates that the skin effect remains robust (despite the absence of non-reciprocal hopping) across a broad range of driving parameters, and is notably amplified in the low-frequency regime due to emergent longer- range couplings. We further employ a symmetric time frame approach that generates chiral-partner Hamiltonians, whose invariants, when appropriately combined, account for the full edge-state struc- ture. To substantiate the theoretical framework, we propose a topolectrical circuit (TEC) that serves as a viable experimental setting. Apart from capturing the skin modes, the proposed TEC design faithfully reproduces the presence of distinct Floquet edge states, as revealed through the voltage and impedance profiles, respectively. Thus, our work not only offers a theoretical framework for exploring NH-driven systems, but also provides an experimentally feasible TEC architecture for realizing these phenomena stated above in a laboratory.</description>

      <title>Correlation functions for open XXZ spin 1/2 quantum chains with unparallel boundary magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.12870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.12870v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we continue our derivation of the correlation functions of open quantum spin 1/2 chains with unparallel magnetic fields on the edges; this time for the more involved case of the XXZ spin 1/2 chains. We develop our study in the framework of the quantum Separation of Variables (SoV), which gives us both the complete spectrum characterization and simple scalar product formulae for separate states, including transfer matrix eigenstates. Here, we leave the boundary magnetic field in the first site of the chain completely arbitrary, and we fix the boundary field in the last site $N$ of the chain to be a specific value along the $z$-direction. This is a natural first choice for the unparallel boundary magnetic fields. We prove that under these special boundary conditions, on the one side, we have a simple enough complete spectrum description in terms of homogeneous Baxter like $TQ$-equation. On the other side, we prove a simple enough description of the action of a basis of local operators on transfer matrix eigenstates as linear combinations of separate states. Thanks to these results, we achieve our main goal to derive correlation functions for a set of local operators both for the finite and half-infinite chains, with multiple integral formulae in this last case.</description>
