      <title>A Piecewise Lyapunov Analysis of Sub-quadratic SGD: Applications to Robust and Quantile Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08178v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by robust and quantile regression problems, we investigate the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm for minimizing an objective function $f$ that is locally strongly convex with a sub--quadratic tail. This setting covers many widely used online statistical methods. We introduce a novel piecewise Lyapunov function that enables us to handle functions $f$ with only first-order differentiability, which includes a wide range of popular loss functions such as Huber loss. Leveraging our proposed Lyapunov function, we derive finite-time moment bounds under general diminishing stepsizes, as well as constant stepsizes. We further establish the weak convergence, central limit theorem and bias characterization under constant stepsize, providing the first geometrical convergence result for sub--quadratic SGD. Our results have wide applications, especially in online statistical methods. In particular, we discuss two applications of our results. 1) Online robust regression: We consider a corrupted linear model with sub--exponential covariates and heavy--tailed noise. Our analysis provides convergence rates comparable to those for corrupted models with Gaussian covariates and noise. 2) Online quantile regression: Importantly, our results relax the common assumption in prior work that the conditional density is continuous and provide a more fine-grained analysis for the moment bounds.</description>

      <title>Deep Distributional Learning with Non-crossing Quantile Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a non-crossing quantile (NQ) network for conditional distribution learning. By leveraging non-negative activation functions, the NQ network ensures that the learned distributions remain monotonic, effectively addressing the issue of quantile crossing. Furthermore, the NQ network-based deep distributional learning framework is highly adaptable, applicable to a wide range of applications, from classical non-parametric quantile regression to more advanced tasks such as causal effect estimation and distributional reinforcement learning (RL). We also develop a comprehensive theoretical foundation for the deep NQ estimator and its application to distributional RL, providing an in-depth analysis that demonstrates its effectiveness across these domains. Our experimental results further highlight the robustness and versatility of the NQ network.</description>

      <title>Local Distance-Preserving Node Embeddings and Their Performance on Random Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning node representations is a fundamental problem in graph machine learning. While existing embedding methods effectively preserve local similarity measures, they often fail to capture global functions like graph distances. Inspired by Bourgain's seminal work on Hilbert space embeddings of metric spaces (1985), we study the performance of local distance-preserving node embeddings. Known as landmark-based algorithms, these embeddings approximate pairwise distances by computing shortest paths from a small subset of reference nodes (i.e., landmarks). Our main theoretical contribution shows that random graphs, such as Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graphs, require lower dimensions in landmark-based embeddings compared to worst-case graphs. Empirically, we demonstrate that the GNN-based approximations for the distances to landmarks generalize well to larger networks, offering a scalable alternative for graph representation learning.</description>

      <title>Gradient Descent Robustly Learns the Intrinsic Dimension of Data in Training Convolutional Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern neural networks are usually highly over-parameterized. Behind the wide usage of over-parameterized networks is the belief that, if the data are simple, then the trained network will be automatically equivalent to a simple predictor. Following this intuition, many existing works have studied different notions of "ranks" of neural networks and their relation to the rank of data. In this work, we study the rank of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained by gradient descent, with a specific focus on the robustness of the rank to image background noises. Specifically, we point out that, when adding background noises to images, the rank of the CNN trained with gradient descent is affected far less compared with the rank of the data. We support our claim with a theoretical case study, where we consider a particular data model to characterize low-rank clean images with added background noises. We prove that CNNs trained by gradient descent can learn the intrinsic dimension of clean images, despite the presence of relatively large background noises. We also conduct experiments on synthetic and real datasets to further validate our claim.</description>

      <title>Transformer Learns Optimal Variable Selection in Group-Sparse Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated remarkable success across various applications. However, the success of transformers have not been understood in theory. In this work, we give a case study of how transformers can be trained to learn a classic statistical model with "group sparsity", where the input variables form multiple groups, and the label only depends on the variables from one of the groups. We theoretically demonstrate that, a one-layer transformer trained by gradient descent can correctly leverage the attention mechanism to select variables, disregarding irrelevant ones and focusing on those beneficial for classification. We also demonstrate that a well-pretrained one-layer transformer can be adapted to new downstream tasks to achieve good prediction accuracy with a limited number of samples. Our study sheds light on how transformers effectively learn structured data.</description>

      <title>On the Practice of Deep Hierarchical Ensemble Network for Ad Conversion Rate Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The predictions of click through rate (CTR) and conversion rate (CVR) play a crucial role in the success of ad-recommendation systems. A Deep Hierarchical Ensemble Network (DHEN) has been proposed to integrate multiple feature crossing modules and has achieved great success in CTR prediction. However, its performance for CVR prediction is unclear in the conversion ads setting, where an ad bids for the probability of a user's off-site actions on a third party website or app, including purchase, add to cart, sign up, etc. A few challenges in DHEN: 1) What feature-crossing modules (MLP, DCN, Transformer, to name a few) should be included in DHEN? 2) How deep and wide should DHEN be to achieve the best trade-off between efficiency and efficacy? 3) What hyper-parameters to choose in each feature-crossing module? Orthogonal to the model architecture, the input personalization features also significantly impact model performance with a high degree of freedom. In this paper, we attack this problem and present our contributions biased to the applied data science side, including:
  First, we propose a multitask learning framework with DHEN as the single backbone model architecture to predict all CVR tasks, with a detailed study on how to make DHEN work effectively in practice; Second, we build both on-site real-time user behavior sequences and off-site conversion event sequences for CVR prediction purposes, and conduct ablation study on its importance; Last but not least, we propose a self-supervised auxiliary loss to predict future actions in the input sequence, to help resolve the label sparseness issue in CVR prediction.
  Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to previous single feature crossing modules with pre-trained user personalization features.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Power grid operation is becoming increasingly complex due to the rising integration of renewable energy sources and the need for more adaptive control strategies. Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach to power network control (PNC), offering the potential to enhance decision-making in dynamic and uncertain environments. The Learning To Run a Power Network (L2RPN) competitions have played a key role in accelerating research by providing standardized benchmarks and problem formulations, leading to rapid advancements in RL-based methods. This survey provides a comprehensive and structured overview of RL applications for power grid topology optimization, categorizing existing techniques, highlighting key design choices, and identifying gaps in current research. Additionally, we present a comparative numerical study evaluating the impact of commonly applied RL-based methods, offering insights into their practical effectiveness. By consolidating existing research and outlining open challenges, this survey aims to provide a foundation for future advancements in RL-driven power grid optimization.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an innovative design for an all-optical Echo State Network (ESN), an advanced type of reservoir computer known for its universal computational capabilities. Our design enables fully optical implementation of arbitrary ESNs, featuring complete flexibility in optical matrix multiplication and nonlinear activation. Leveraging the nonlinear characteristics of stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS), the architecture efficiently realizes measurement-free operations crucial for reservoir computing. The approach significantly reduces computational overhead and energy consumption compared to traditional software-based methods. Comprehensive simulations validate the system's memory capacity, nonlinear processing strength, and polynomial algebra capabilities, showcasing performance comparable to software ESNs across key benchmark tasks. Our design establishes a feasible, scalable, and universally applicable framework for optical reservoir computing, suitable for diverse machine learning applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper provides a practical introduction to Double/Debiased Machine Learning (DML). DML provides a general approach to performing inference about a target parameter in the presence of nuisance parameters. The aim of DML is to reduce the impact of nuisance parameter estimation on estimators of the parameter of interest. We describe DML and its two essential components: Neyman orthogonality and cross-fitting. We highlight that DML reduces functional form dependence and accommodates the use of complex data types, such as text data. We illustrate its application through three empirical examples that demonstrate DML's applicability in cross-sectional and panel settings.</description>

      <title>High-dimensional Clustering and Signal Recovery under Block Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies computationally efficient methods and their minimax optimality for high-dimensional clustering and signal recovery under block signal structures. We propose two sets of methods, cross-block feature aggregation PCA (CFA-PCA) and moving average PCA (MA-PCA), designed for sparse and dense block signals, respectively. Both methods adaptively utilize block signal structures, applicable to non-Gaussian data with heterogeneous variances and non-diagonal covariance matrices. Specifically, the CFA method utilizes a block-wise U-statistic to aggregate and select block signals non-parametrically from data with unknown cluster labels. We show that the proposed methods are consistent for both clustering and signal recovery under mild conditions and weaker signal strengths than the existing methods without considering block structures of signals. Furthermore, we derive both statistical and computational minimax lower bounds (SMLB and CMLB) for high-dimensional clustering and signal recovery under block signals, where the CMLBs are restricted to algorithms with polynomial computation complexity. The minimax boundaries partition signals into regions of impossibility and possibility. No algorithm (or no polynomial time algorithm) can achieve consistent clustering or signal recovery if the signals fall into the statistical (or computational) region of impossibility. We show that the proposed CFA-PCA and MA-PCA methods can achieve the CMLBs for the sparse and dense block signal regimes, respectively, indicating the proposed methods are computationally minimax optimal. A tuning parameter selection method is proposed based on post-clustering signal recovery results. Simulation studies are conducted to evaluate the proposed methods. A case study on global temperature change demonstrates their utility in practice.</description>

      <title>Entropic bounds for conditionally Gaussian vectors and applications to neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using entropic inequalities from information theory, we provide new bounds on the total variation and 2-Wasserstein distances between a conditionally Gaussian law and a Gaussian law with invertible covariance matrix. We apply our results to quantify the speed of convergence to Gaussian of a randomly initialized fully connected neural network and its derivatives - evaluated in a finite number of inputs - when the initialization is Gaussian and the sizes of the inner layers diverge to infinity. Our results require mild assumptions on the activation function, and allow one to recover optimal rates of convergence in a variety of distances, thus improving and extending the findings of Basteri and Trevisan (2023), Favaro et al. (2023), Trevisan (2024) and Apollonio et al. (2024). One of our main tools are the quantitative cumulant estimates established in Hanin (2024). As an illustration, we apply our results to bound the total variation distance between the Bayesian posterior law of the neural network and its derivatives, and the posterior law of the corresponding Gaussian limit: this yields quantitative versions of a posterior CLT by Hron et al. (2022), and extends several estimates by Trevisan (2024) to the total variation metric.</description>

      <title>Proofs as Explanations: Short Certificates for Reliable Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a model for explainable AI in which an explanation for a prediction $h(x)=y$ consists of a subset $S'$ of the training data (if it exists) such that all classifiers $h' \in H$ that make at most $b$ mistakes on $S'$ predict $h'(x)=y$. Such a set $S'$ serves as a proof that $x$ indeed has label $y$ under the assumption that (1) the target function $h^\star$ belongs to $H$, and (2) the set $S$ contains at most $b$ corrupted points. For example, if $b=0$ and $H$ is the family of linear classifiers in $\mathbb{R}^d$, and if $x$ lies inside the convex hull of the positive data points in $S$ (and hence every consistent linear classifier labels $x$ as positive), then Carath\'eodory's theorem states that $x$ lies inside the convex hull of $d+1$ of those points. So, a set $S'$ of size $d+1$ could be released as an explanation for a positive prediction, and would serve as a short proof of correctness of the prediction under the assumption of realizability.
  In this work, we consider this problem more generally, for general hypothesis classes $H$ and general values $b\geq 0$. We define the notion of the robust hollow star number of $H$ (which generalizes the standard hollow star number), and show that it precisely characterizes the worst-case size of the smallest certificate achievable, and analyze its size for natural classes. We also consider worst-case distributional bounds on certificate size, as well as distribution-dependent bounds that we show tightly control the sample size needed to get a certificate for any given test example. In particular, we define a notion of the certificate coefficient $\varepsilon_x$ of an example $x$ with respect to a data distribution $D$ and target function $h^\star$, and prove matching upper and lower bounds on sample size as a function of $\varepsilon_x$, $b$, and the VC dimension $d$ of $H$.</description>

      <title>PCA-RAG: Principal Component Analysis for Efficient Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for grounding large language models in external knowledge sources, improving the precision of agents responses. However, high-dimensional language model embeddings, often in the range of hundreds to thousands of dimensions, can present scalability challenges in terms of storage and latency, especially when processing massive financial text corpora. This paper investigates the use of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce embedding dimensionality, thereby mitigating computational bottlenecks without incurring large accuracy losses. We experiment with a real-world dataset and compare different similarity and distance metrics under both full-dimensional and PCA-compressed embeddings. Our results show that reducing vectors from 3,072 to 110 dimensions provides a sizeable (up to $60\times$) speedup in retrieval operations and a $\sim 28.6\times$ reduction in index size, with only moderate declines in correlation metrics relative to human-annotated similarity scores. These findings demonstrate that PCA-based compression offers a viable balance between retrieval fidelity and resource efficiency, essential for real-time systems such as Zanista AI's \textit{Newswitch} platform. Ultimately, our study underscores the practicality of leveraging classical dimensionality reduction techniques to scale RAG architectures for knowledge-intensive applications in finance and trading, where speed, memory efficiency, and accuracy must jointly be optimized.</description>

      <title>Standardization of Weighted Ranking Correlation Coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A relevant problem in statistics is defining the correlation of two rankings of a list of items. Kendall's tau and Spearman's rho are two well established correlation coefficients, characterized by a symmetric form that ensures zero expected value between two pairs of rankings randomly chosen with uniform probability. However, in recent years, several weighted versions of the original Spearman and Kendall coefficients have emerged that take into account the greater importance of top ranks compared to low ranks, which is common in many contexts. The weighting schemes break the symmetry, causing a non-zero expected value between two random rankings. This issue is very relevant, as it undermines the concept of uncorrelation between rankings. In this paper, we address this problem by proposing a standardization function $g(x)$ that maps a correlation ranking coefficient $\Gamma$ in a standard form $g(\Gamma)$ that has zero expected value, while maintaining the relevant statistical properties of $\Gamma$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion generative models have demonstrated remarkable success in visual domains such as image and video generation. They have also recently emerged as a promising approach in robotics, especially in robot manipulations. Diffusion models leverage a probabilistic framework, and they stand out with their ability to model multi-modal distributions and their robustness to high-dimensional input and output spaces. This survey provides a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art diffusion models in robotic manipulation, including grasp learning, trajectory planning, and data augmentation. Diffusion models for scene and image augmentation lie at the intersection of robotics and computer vision for vision-based tasks to enhance generalizability and data scarcity. This paper also presents the two main frameworks of diffusion models and their integration with imitation learning and reinforcement learning. In addition, it discusses the common architectures and benchmarks and points out the challenges and advantages of current state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a theoretically well-founded deep learning algorithm for nonparametric regression. It uses over-parametrized deep neural networks with logistic activation function, which are fitted to the given data via gradient descent. We propose a special topology of these networks, a special random initialization of the weights, and a data-dependent choice of the learning rate and the number of gradient descent steps. We prove a theoretical bound on the expected $L_2$ error of this estimate, and illustrate its finite sample size performance by applying it to simulated data. Our results show that a theoretical analysis of deep learning which takes into account simultaneously optimization, generalization and approximation can result in a new deep learning estimate which has an improved finite sample performance.</description>

      <title>Slicing the Gaussian Mixture Wasserstein Distance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) are widely used in machine learning for tasks such as clustering, classification, image reconstruction, and generative modeling. A key challenge in working with GMMs is defining a computationally efficient and geometrically meaningful metric. The mixture Wasserstein (MW) distance adapts the Wasserstein metric to GMMs and has been applied in various domains, including domain adaptation, dataset comparison, and reinforcement learning. However, its high computational cost -- arising from repeated Wasserstein distance computations involving matrix square root estimations and an expensive linear program -- limits its scalability to high-dimensional and large-scale problems. To address this, we propose multiple novel slicing-based approximations to the MW distance that significantly reduce computational complexity while preserving key optimal transport properties. From a theoretical viewpoint, we establish several weak and strong equivalences between the introduced metrics, and show the relations to the original MW distance and the well-established sliced Wasserstein distance. Furthermore, we validate the effectiveness of our approach through numerical experiments, demonstrating computational efficiency and applications in clustering, perceptual image comparison, and GMM minimization</description>

      <title>Bayesian optimization for mixed variables using an adaptive dimension reduction process: applications to aircraft design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multidisciplinary design optimization methods aim at adapting numerical optimization techniques to the design of engineering systems involving multiple disciplines. In this context, a large number of mixed continuous, integer and categorical variables might arise during the optimization process and practical applications involve a large number of design variables. Recently, there has been a growing interest in mixed variables constrained Bayesian optimization but most existing approaches severely increase the number of the hyperparameters related to the surrogate model. In this paper, we address this issue by constructing surrogate models using less hyperparameters. The reduction process is based on the partial least squares method. An adaptive procedure for choosing the number of hyperparameters is proposed. The performance of the proposed approach is confirmed on analytical tests as well as two real applications related to aircraft design. A significant improvement is obtained compared to genetic algorithms.</description>

      <title>Beyond Black-Box Predictions: Identifying Marginal Feature Effects in Tabular Transformer Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, deep neural networks have showcased their predictive power across a variety of tasks. Beyond natural language processing, the transformer architecture has proven efficient in addressing tabular data problems and challenges the previously dominant gradient-based decision trees in these areas. However, this predictive power comes at the cost of intelligibility: Marginal feature effects are almost completely lost in the black-box nature of deep tabular transformer networks. Alternative architectures that use the additivity constraints of classical statistical regression models can maintain intelligible marginal feature effects, but often fall short in predictive power compared to their more complex counterparts. To bridge the gap between intelligibility and performance, we propose an adaptation of tabular transformer networks designed to identify marginal feature effects. We provide theoretical justifications that marginal feature effects can be accurately identified, and our ablation study demonstrates that the proposed model efficiently detects these effects, even amidst complex feature interactions. To demonstrate the model's predictive capabilities, we compare it to several interpretable as well as black-box models and find that it can match black-box performances while maintaining intelligibility.

      <title>Surrogate-based optimization of system architectures subject to hidden constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The exploration of novel architectures requires physics-based simulation due to a lack of prior experience to start from, which introduces two specific challenges for optimization algorithms: evaluations become more expensive (in time) and evaluations might fail. The former challenge is addressed by Surrogate-Based Optimization (SBO) algorithms, in particular Bayesian Optimization (BO) using Gaussian Process (GP) models. An overview is provided of how BO can deal with challenges specific to architecture optimization, such as design variable hierarchy and multiple objectives: specific measures include ensemble infills and a hierarchical sampling algorithm. Evaluations might fail due to non-convergence of underlying solvers or infeasible geometry in certain areas of the design space. Such failed evaluations, also known as hidden constraints, pose a particular challenge to SBO/BO, as the surrogate model cannot be trained on empty results. This work investigates various strategies for satisfying hidden constraints in BO algorithms. Three high-level strategies are identified: rejection of failed points from the training set, replacing failed points based on viable (non-failed) points, and predicting the failure region. Through investigations on a set of test problems including a jet engine architecture optimization problem, it is shown that best performance is achieved with a mixed-discrete GP to predict the Probability of Viability (PoV), and by ensuring selected infill points satisfy some minimum PoV threshold. This strategy is demonstrated by solving a jet engine architecture problem that features at 50% failure rate and could not previously be solved by a BO algorithm. The developed BO algorithm and used test problems are available in the open-source Python library SBArchOpt.</description>

      <title>Wasserstein Gradient Flows for Moreau Envelopes of f-Divergences in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04613v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Commonly used $f$-divergences of measures, e.g., the Kullback-Leibler divergence, are subject to limitations regarding the support of the involved measures. A remedy is regularizing the $f$-divergence by a squared maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) associated with a characteristic kernel $K$. We use the kernel mean embedding to show that this regularization can be rewritten as the Moreau envelope of some function on the associated reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Then, we exploit well-known results on Moreau envelopes in Hilbert spaces to analyze the MMD-regularized $f$-divergences, particularly their gradients. Subsequently, we use our findings to analyze Wasserstein gradient flows of MMD-regularized $f$-divergences. We provide proof-of-the-concept numerical examples for flows starting from empirical measures. Here, we cover $f$-divergences with infinite and finite recession constants. Lastly, we extend our results to the tight variational formulation of $f$-divergences and numerically compare the resulting flows.</description>

      <title>Optimal Rates and Saturation for Noiseless Kernel Ridge Regression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15718v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kernel ridge regression (KRR), also known as the least-squares support vector machine, is a fundamental method for learning functions from finite samples. While most existing analyses focus on the noisy setting with constant-level label noise, we present a comprehensive study of KRR in the noiseless regime -- a critical setting in scientific computing where data are often generated via high-fidelity numerical simulations.
  We establish that, up to logarithmic factors, noiseless KRR achieves minimax optimal convergence rates, jointly determined by the eigenvalue decay of the associated integral operator and the target function's smoothness. These rates are derived under Sobolev-type interpolation norms, with the $L^2$ norm as a special case. Notably, we uncover two key phenomena: an extra-smoothness effect, where the KRR solution exhibits higher smoothness than typical functions in the native reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), and a saturation effect, where the KRR's adaptivity to the target function's smoothness plateaus beyond a certain level. Leveraging these insights, we also derive a novel error bound for noisy KRR that is noise-level aware and achieves minimax optimality in both noiseless and noisy regimes. As a key technical contribution, we introduce a refined notion of degrees of freedom, which we believe has broader applicability in the analysis of kernel methods. Extensive numerical experiments validate our theoretical results and provide insights beyond existing theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12481v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the transfer learning paradigm models learn useful representations (or features) during a data-rich pretraining stage, and then use the pretrained representation to improve model performance on data-scarce downstream tasks. In this work, we explore transfer learning with the goal of optimizing downstream performance. We introduce a simple linear model that takes as input an arbitrary pretrained feature transform. We derive exact asymptotics of the downstream risk and its \textit{fine-grained} bias-variance decomposition. We then identify the pretrained representation that optimizes the asymptotic downstream bias and variance averaged over an ensemble of downstream tasks. Our theoretical and empirical analysis uncovers the surprising phenomenon that the optimal featurization is naturally sparse, even in the absence of explicit sparsity-inducing priors or penalties. Additionally, we identify a phase transition where the optimal pretrained representation shifts from hard selection to soft selection of relevant features.</description>

      <title>Learning the Distribution Map in Reverse Causal Performative Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15172v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In numerous predictive scenarios, the predictive model affects the sampling distribution; for example, job applicants often meticulously craft their resumes to navigate through a screening systems. Such shifts in distribution are particularly prevalent in the realm of social computing, yet, the strategies to learn these shifts from data remain remarkably limited. Inspired by a microeconomic model that adeptly characterizes agents' behavior within labor markets, we introduce a novel approach to learn the distribution shift. Our method is predicated on a reverse causal model, wherein the predictive model instigates a distribution shift exclusively through a finite set of agents' actions. Within this framework, we employ a microfoundation model for the agents' actions and develop a statistically justified methodology to learn the distribution shift map, which we demonstrate to be effective in minimizing the performative prediction risk.</description>

      <title>Microfoundation Inference for Strategic Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08998v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Often in prediction tasks, the predictive model itself can influence the distribution of the target variable, a phenomenon termed performative prediction. Generally, this influence stems from strategic actions taken by stakeholders with a vested interest in predictive models. A key challenge that hinders the widespread adaptation of performative prediction in machine learning is that practitioners are generally unaware of the social impacts of their predictions. To address this gap, we propose a methodology for learning the distribution map that encapsulates the long-term impacts of predictive models on the population. Specifically, we model agents' responses as a cost-adjusted utility maximization problem and propose estimates for said cost. Our approach leverages optimal transport to align pre-model exposure (ex ante) and post-model exposure (ex post) distributions. We provide a rate of convergence for this proposed estimate and assess its quality through empirical demonstrations on a credit-scoring dataset.</description>

      <title>Generalization Error Bounds for Learning under Censored Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09247v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generalization error bounds from learning theory provide statistical guarantees on how well an algorithm will perform on previously unseen data. In this paper, we characterize the impacts of data non-IIDness due to censored feedback (a.k.a. selective labeling bias) on such bounds. Censored feedback is ubiquitous in many real-world online selection and classification tasks (e.g., hiring, lending, recommendation systems) where the true label of a data point is only revealed if a favorable decision is made (e.g., accepting a candidate, approving a loan, displaying an ad), and remains unknown otherwise. We first derive an extension of the well-known Dvoretzky-Kiefer-Wolfowitz (DKW) inequality, which characterizes the gap between empirical and theoretical data distribution CDFs learned from IID data, to problems with non-IID data due to censored feedback. We then use this CDF error bound to provide a bound on the generalization error guarantees of a classifier trained on such non-IID data. We show that existing generalization error bounds (which do not account for censored feedback) fail to correctly capture the model's generalization guarantees, verifying the need for our bounds. We further analyze the effectiveness of (pure and bounded) exploration techniques, proposed by recent literature as a way to alleviate censored feedback, on improving our error bounds. Together, our findings illustrate how a decision maker should account for the trade-off between strengthening the generalization guarantees of an algorithm and the costs incurred in data collection when future data availability is limited by censored feedback.</description>

      <title>Analytical Approximation of the ELBO Gradient in the Context of the Clutter Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10550v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an analytical solution for approximating the gradient of the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) in variational inference problems where the statistical model is a Bayesian network consisting of observations drawn from a mixture of a Gaussian distribution embedded in unrelated clutter, known as the clutter problem. The method employs the reparameterization trick to move the gradient operator inside the expectation and relies on the assumption that, because the likelihood factorizes over the observed data, the variational distribution is generally more compactly supported than the Gaussian distribution in the likelihood factors. This allows efficient local approximation of the individual likelihood factors, which leads to an analytical solution for the integral defining the gradient expectation. We integrate the proposed gradient approximation as the expectation step in an EM (Expectation Maximization) algorithm for maximizing ELBO and test against classical deterministic approaches in Bayesian inference, such as the Laplace approximation, Expectation Propagation and Mean-Field Variational Inference. The proposed method demonstrates good accuracy and rate of convergence together with linear computational complexity.</description>

Abstract: There have been many applications of deep neural networks to detector calibrations and a growing number of studies that propose deep generative models as automated fast detector simulators. We show that these two tasks can be unified by using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) from conditional generative models for energy regression. Unlike direct regression techniques, the MLE approach is prior-independent and non-Gaussian resolutions can be determined from the shape of the likelihood near the maximum. Using an ATLAS-like calorimeter simulation, we demonstrate this concept in the context of calorimeter energy calibration.</description>

Abstract: We consider the problem where an agent aims to combine the views and insights of different experts' models. Specifically, each expert proposes a diffusion process over a finite time horizon. The agent then combines the experts' models by minimising the weighted Kullback--Leibler divergence to each of the experts' models. We show existence and uniqueness of the barycentre model and prove an explicit representation of the Radon--Nikodym derivative relative to the average drift model. We further allow the agent to include their own constraints, resulting in an optimal model that can be seen as a distortion of the experts' barycentre model to incorporate the agent's constraints. We propose two deep learning algorithms to approximate the optimal drift of the combined model, allowing for efficient simulations. The first algorithm aims at learning the optimal drift by matching the change of measure, whereas the second algorithm leverages the notion of elicitability to directly estimate the value function. The paper concludes with an extended application to combine implied volatility smile models that were estimated on different datasets.</description>

      <title>Minimax-optimal and Locally-adaptive Online Nonparametric Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03363v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study adversarial online nonparametric regression with general convex losses and propose a parameter-free learning algorithm that achieves minimax optimal rates. Our approach leverages chaining trees to compete against H{\"o}lder functions and establishes optimal regret bounds. While competing with nonparametric function classes can be challenging, they often exhibit local patterns - such as local H{\"o}lder continuity - that online algorithms can exploit. Without prior knowledge, our method dynamically tracks and adapts to different H{\"o}lder profiles by pruning a core chaining tree structure, aligning itself with local smoothness variations. This leads to the first computationally efficient algorithm with locally adaptive optimal rates for online regression in an adversarial setting. Finally, we discuss how these notions could be extended to a boosting framework, offering promising directions for future research.</description>

      <title>A noise-corrected Langevin algorithm and sampling by half-denoising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05837v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Langevin algorithm is a classic method for sampling from a given pdf in a real space. In its basic version, it only requires knowledge of the gradient of the log-density, also called the score function. However, in deep learning, it is often easier to learn the so-called "noisy-data score function", i.e. the gradient of the log-density of noisy data, more precisely when Gaussian noise is added to the data. Such an estimate is biased and complicates the use of the Langevin method. Here, we propose a noise-corrected version of the Langevin algorithm, where the bias due to noisy data is removed, at least regarding first-order terms. Unlike diffusion models, our algorithm needs to know the noisy score function for one single noise level only. We further propose a simple special case which has an interesting intuitive interpretation of iteratively adding noise the data and then attempting to remove half of that noise.</description>

      <title>Achieving Group Fairness through Independence in Predictive Process Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04914v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predictive process monitoring focuses on forecasting future states of ongoing process executions, such as predicting the outcome of a particular case. In recent years, the application of machine learning models in this domain has garnered significant scientific attention. When using historical execution data, which may contain biases or exhibit unfair behavior, these biases may be encoded into the trained models. Consequently, when such models are deployed to make decisions or guide interventions for new cases, they risk perpetuating this unwanted behavior. This work addresses group fairness in predictive process monitoring by investigating independence, i.e. ensuring predictions are unaffected by sensitive group membership. We explore independence through metrics for demographic parity such as $\Delta$DP, as well as recently introduced, threshold-independent distribution-based alternatives. Additionally, we propose a composite loss function existing of binary cross-entropy and a distribution-based loss (Wasserstein) to train models that balance predictive performance and fairness, and allow for customizable trade-offs. The effectiveness of both the fairness metrics and the composite loss functions is validated through a controlled experimental setup.</description>

      <title>A partial likelihood approach to tree-based density modeling and its application in Bayesian inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11692v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tree-based priors for probability distributions are usually specified using a predetermined, data-independent collection of candidate recursive partitions of the sample space. To characterize an unknown target density in detail over the entire sample space, candidate partitions must have the capacity to expand deeply into all areas of the sample space with potential non-zero sampling probability. Such an expansive system of partitions often incurs prohibitive computational costs and makes inference prone to overfitting, especially in regions with little probability mass. Thus, existing models typically make a compromise and rely on relatively shallow trees. This hampers one of the most desirable features of trees, their ability to characterize local features, and results in reduced statistical efficiency. Traditional wisdom suggests that this compromise is inevitable to ensure coherent likelihood-based reasoning in Bayesian inference, as a data-dependent partition system that allows deeper expansion only in regions with more observations would induce double dipping of the data. We propose a simple strategy to restore coherency while allowing the candidate partitions to be data-dependent, using Cox's partial likelihood. Our partial likelihood approach is broadly applicable to existing likelihood-based methods and, in particular, to Bayesian inference on tree-based models. We give examples in density estimation in which the partial likelihood is endowed with existing priors on tree-based models and compare with the standard, full-likelihood approach. The results show substantial gains in estimation accuracy and computational efficiency from adopting the partial likelihood.</description>

      <title>From Small to Large Language Models: Revisiting the Federalist Papers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01869v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a long time, the authorship of the Federalist Papers had been a subject of inquiry and debate, not only by linguists and historians but also by statisticians. In what was arguably the first Bayesian case study, Mosteller and Wallace (1963) provided the first statistical evidence for attributing all disputed papers to Madison. Our paper revisits this historical dataset but from a lens of modern language models, both small and large. We review some of the more popular Large Language Model (LLM) tools and examine them from a statistical point of view in the context of text classification. We investigate whether, without any attempt to fine-tune, the general embedding constructs can be useful for stylometry and attribution. We explain differences between various word/phrase embeddings and discuss how to aggregate them in a document. Contrary to our expectations, we exemplify that dimension expansion with word embeddings may not always be beneficial for attribution relative to dimension reduction with topic embeddings. Our experiments demonstrate that default LLM embeddings (even after manual fine-tuning) may not consistently improve authorship attribution accuracy. Instead, Bayesian analysis with topic embeddings trained on ``function words" yields superior out-of-sample classification performance. This suggests that traditional (small) statistical language models, with their interpretability and solid theoretical foundation, can offer significant advantages in authorship attribution tasks.

      <title>Riemannian Optimization on Relaxed Indicator Matrix Manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20505v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The indicator matrix plays an important role in machine learning, but optimizing it is an NP-hard problem. We propose a new relaxation of the indicator matrix and prove that this relaxation forms a manifold, which we call the Relaxed Indicator Matrix Manifold (RIM manifold). Based on Riemannian geometry, we develop a Riemannian toolbox for optimization on the RIM manifold. Specifically, we provide several methods of Retraction, including a fast Retraction method to obtain geodesics. We point out that the RIM manifold is a generalization of the double stochastic manifold, and it is much faster than existing methods on the double stochastic manifold, which has a complexity of \( \mathcal{O}(n^3) \), while RIM manifold optimization is \( \mathcal{O}(n) \) and often yields better results. We conducted extensive experiments, including image denoising, with millions of variables to support our conclusion, and applied the RIM manifold to Ratio Cut, we provide a rigorous convergence proof and achieve clustering results that outperform the state-of-the-art methods.
