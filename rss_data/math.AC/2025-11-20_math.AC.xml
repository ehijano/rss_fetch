      <title>Smooth sequences and overring operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce smooth sequences of integral domains as well-ordered ascending chains that behave well at limit ordinals. Subsequently, we use this notion to give some conditions on the freeness of kernels of extension maps between groups of invertible ideals of Pr\"ufer domains. We also define overring operators to construct smooth sequences in a recursive way.</description>

      <title>Measure finite topology on the ring of measurable functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{M}(X,\mathcal{A},\mu)$ be the ring of all real-valued measurable functions constructed over a measure space $(X,\mathcal{A},\mu)$. A topology on $\mathcal{M}(X,\mathcal{A},\mu)$, called the {$F_\mu$-topology} weaker than the { $U_\mu$-topology} is introduced. It is realized that the {component}, the {quasi component} and the {path component }in this {$F_\mu$-topology} are identical. It turns out that the {$F_\mu$-topology} on $\mathcal{M}(X,\mathcal{A},\mu)$ becomes {connected} if and only if it is {path connected} if and only if $\mu$ is an {atomic measure} of a special type. It is also proved that the {$F_\mu$-topology} is {first countable} when and only when $\mu$ is a {hemifinite measure.} Finally, it is shown that the {second countability} of the {$F_\mu$-topology} is equivalent to the {hemifiniteness} of the measure $\mu$ together with the {countable chain condition} of the {$F_\mu$-topology}.</description>

      <title>Splitting vector bundles over real algebraic varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Suppose $X$ is a smooth affine real variety and $\mathscr{E}$ is a vector bundle over $X$. We analyze the problem of splitting off a free rank one summand from $\mathscr{E}$ in corank $0$ and $1$. The problem in corank $0$ can be viewed as the search for a real analog of Murthy's celebrating splitting theorem in the algebraically closed case: to wit, beyond the vanishing of the top Chern class in Chow theory, are the obstructions to splitting ``purely topological''? In a sense, the answer in this case is yes, and we give a proof, using motivic techniques, of a mild extension of the results of Bhatwadekar-Sridharan and Bhatwadekar-Das-Mandal.
  In corank $1$, in the algebraically closed situation, Murthy's splitting conjecture (now a theorem in characteristic $0$) predicts that the vanishing of the top Chern class in Chow theory is the only obstruction to splitting off a free rank $1$ summand, and we can search for a suitable ``real'' analog of this assertion. We observe that several natural guesses for a ``real'' analog of Murthy's splitting conjecture cannot be true, i.e., that the situation over the real numbers is rather complicated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05185v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we first prove a general result in topology which asserts that every quasi-component of a quasi-spectral space is connected. As an important application, the structure of all connected components of every quasi-compact quasi-separated (qcqs) scheme $X$ is fully characterized. They are exactly of the form ...</description>

      <title>Formalization of Auslander--Buchsbaum--Serre criterion in Lean4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24818v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive formalization in the Lean4 theorem prover of the Auslander--Buchsbaum--Serre criterion, which characterizes regular local rings as those Noetherian local rings with finite global dimension. Rather than following the well-known proof that computes the projective dimension of the residue field via quotient by regular sequences and uses the Koszul complex to bound the cotangent space dimension by the global dimension, our approach is built systematically on the formalization of depth defined via the vanishing of Ext functors. We establish key homological results including Rees' theorem, the Auslander--Buchsbaum formula, and Ischebeck's theorem, and further develop the theories of Cohen--Macaulay modules and rings, including a complete formalization of the unmixedness theorem for Cohen--Macaulay rings. To prove the Auslander--Buchsbaum--Serre criterion, we show that maximal Cohen--Macaulay modules over regular local rings are free and establish a weakened form of the Ferrand--Vasconcelos theorem specific for the unique maximal ideal. As corollaries, we deduce that regularity can be checked at maximal ideals and formalize Hilbert's Syzygy Theorem. This work demonstrates how homological algebra can be effectively employed in the formalization of commutative algebra, providing extensive infrastructure for future developments in the field.</description>

      <title>A Goldbach theorem for Laurent series semidomains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14888v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A semidomain is a subsemiring of an integral domain. One can think of a semidomain as an integral domain in which additive inverses are no longer required. A semidomain $S$ is additively reduced if $0$ is the only invertible element of the monoid $(S,+)$, while $S$ is additively atomic if the monoid $(S,+)$ is atomic (i.e., every non-invertible element $s \in S$ can be written as the sum of finitely many irreducibles of $(S,+)$). In this paper, we describe the additively reduced and additively atomic semidomains $S$ for which every Laurent series $f \in S[[x^{\pm 1} ]]$ that is not a monomial can be written as the sum of at most three multiplicative irreducibles. In particular, we show that, for each $k \in \mathbb{N}$, every polynomial $f \in \mathbb{N}[x_1^{\pm 1}, \ldots, x_k^{\pm 1}]$ that is not a monomial can be written as the sum of two multiplicative irreducibles provided that $f(1, \ldots, 1) &gt; 3$.</description>
