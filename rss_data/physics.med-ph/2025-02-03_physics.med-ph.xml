      <title>Evaluating the Efficacy and Safety of Stereotactic Arrhythmia Radioablation in Ventricular Tachycardia: A Comprehensive Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: Stereotactic arrhythmia radioablation (STAR) has emerged as a promising non-invasive treatment for refractory ventricular tachycardia (VT), offering a novel alternative for patients who are poor candidates for catheter ablation. This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluates the safety, efficacy, and technical aspects of STAR across preclinical studies, case reports, case series, and clinical trials. Methods and Materials: A systematic review identified 80 studies published between 2015 and 2024, including 12 preclinical studies, 47 case reports, 15 case series, and 6 clinical trials. Data on patient demographics, treatment parameters, and clinical outcomes were extracted. Meta-analyses were performed for pooled mortality rates, VT burden reduction, and acute toxicities, with subgroup analyses exploring cardiomyopathy type, age, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), and treatment modality. Results: The pooled 6- and 12-month mortality rates were 16% (95% CI: 11-21%) and 32% (95% CI: 26-39%), respectively. VT burden reduction at 6 months was 75% (95% CI: 73-77%), with significant heterogeneity (I^2 = 98.8%). Grade 3+ acute toxicities were observed in 7% (95% CI: 4-11%), with pneumonitis being the most common. Subgroup analyses showed comparable outcomes between LINAC- and CyberKnife-based treatments, with minor differences based on patient characteristics and cardiomyopathy type. Conclusions: STAR demonstrates significant potential in reducing VT burden and improving patient outcomes. While favorable acute safety profiles and efficacy support clinical adoption, variability in treatment protocols underscores the need for standardized practices. Future studies should aim to optimize patient selection, establish robust dosimetric standards, and evaluate long-term safety.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the sensitivity of tumor control probability in molecular radiotherapy to uncertainties in the dose rate curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we have investigated the sensitivity of the effectiveness (TCP) of molecular radiotherapy (MRT) treatment to uncertainties of the dose rate curves that may appear when reconstructing those curves.
  We generated different dose rate curves from experimental data, imposing the constraint of equal dose for each of them. Then, we computed TCPs and looked for correlations between metrics measuring the differences between the dose rate curves and differences in TCP. Finally, according to these results, we estimated the range of tolerable uncertainties in the dose rate curves. The study was performed for different radiopharmaceuticals and different radiosensitive parameters that can affect the dose rate response ($\alpha/\beta$, sub-lethal repair rate).
  The best correlation between differences in the dose rate curves and TCP was found for a metric that computes averaged linear differences between the curves. With this metric, we quantified differences in dose rate curves that would lead to differences in TCP of 0.02, a parameter denoted $m_{1,\: 0.02}$ that is a surrogate of the dependence of the TCP on the dose rate profile. The results showed that the sensitivity of the TCP to dose rate variations decreases (i.e. larger values of $m_{1,\: 0.02}$) with increasing $\alpha/\beta$ and sub-lethal damage repair rate of the tumor cells, and increasing biological half-life of the dose rate curves.
  The radiobiological effect of a MRT treatment on a tumor depends on the absorbed dose and the dose rate profile. Ideally, both magnitudes should be measured with accuracy in order to progress towards the optimization of individualized MRT treatments. Our study suggests that this would be more important for tumors with low $\alpha/\beta$ and moderately slow sub-lethal damage repair treated with fast-decaying radiopharmaceuticals.</description>

      <title>Assessing Sensitivity of Brain-to-Scalp Blood Flows in Laser Speckle Imaging by Occluding the Superficial Temporal Artery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cerebral blood flow is a critical metric for cerebrovascular monitoring, with applications in stroke detection, brain injury evaluation, aging, and neurological disorders. Non-invasively measuring cerebral blood dynamics is challenging due to the scalp and skull, which obstruct direct brain access and contain their own blood dynamics that must be isolated. We developed an aggregated seven-channel speckle contrast optical spectroscopy system to measure blood flow and blood volume non-invasively. Each channel, with distinct source-to-detector distance, targeted different depths to detect scalp and brain blood dynamics separately. By briefly occluding the superficial temporal artery, which supplies blood only to the scalp, we isolated surface blood dynamics from brain signals. Results on 20 subjects show that scalp-sensitive channels experienced significant reductions in blood dynamics during occlusion, while brain-sensitive channels experienced minimal changes. This provides experimental evidence of brain-to-scalp sensitivity in optical measurements, highlighting optimal configuration for preferentially probing brain signals non-invasively.</description>

      <title>Mechanical Properties of the Meninges: Large Language Model Assisted Systematic Review of over 25,000 Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate constitutive models and corresponding mechanical property values for the meninges are important for predicting mechanical damage to brain tissue due to traumatic brain injury. The meninges are often oversimplified in current finite element (FE) head models due to their complex anatomy and spatially-variant mechanical behavior. This study performed a systematic review (SR) on the mechanical properties of each individual layer of the meninges to obtain benchmark data for FE modeling and to identify gaps in the current literature. Relevant studies were filtered through three stages: a broad initial search filter, a large language model classifier, and manual verification by a human reviewer. Out of over 25,000 studies initially considered, this review ultimately included 47 studies on the dura mater, 8 on the arachnoid mater, and 7 on the pia mater, representing the largest and most comprehensive SR on the mechanical properties of the meninges. Each layer was found to exhibit nonlinear rate dependence that varies with species, age, location, and orientation. This study revealed that the elastic modulus of pia mater most often used in simplified linear elastic FE models is likely underestimated by an order of magnitude and fails to consider directional dependence. Future studies investigating the mechanical properties of the meninges should focus on a wider range of loading rates as well as age effects for the arachnoid mater and pia mater, as these features are relatively understudied and expected to affect the fidelity of FE predictions.</description>

      <title>LET measurements and simulation modelling of the charged particle field for the Clatterbridge ocular proton therapy beamline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17404v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Proton therapy can achieve a highly targeted treatment by utilising the advantageous dosimetric characteristics of the Bragg Peak. Protons traversing through a material will deposit their maximum energy at the Bragg Peak through ionisation and other interactions, transferring minimal excess dose to surrounding tissue and organs. This rate of energy loss is also quantified by the linear energy transfer (LET), which is indicative of radiation quality and radiobiological effects. However it is a challenging physical quantity to measure, as characterisation of radiation fields and the impact of LET on treatment requires advanced tools and technology. The MiniPIX-Timepix is a miniaturised, hybrid semiconductor pixel detector capable of high resolution spectrometric tracking, enabling wide-range detection of the deposited energy, position and direction of single particles. Experimental measurements were performed at a clinical facility, the Clatterbridge Cancer Centre which houses a 60 MeV ocular proton therapy beamline. A realistic end-to-end model of the facility was developed in the Monte Carlo code TOPAS (TOol for PArticle Simulation) and was used to simulate the experimental conditions. The detector was held at 45$^{\circ}$ and 60$^{\circ}$ perpendicular to the beam, and placed downstream of various thickness Polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) blocks to acquire data along the dose deposition depth. Empirical cluster data providing track length and the energy deposition distributions were used to obtain the LET spectra. The determined values for the LET in silicon and dose averaged LET across the BP show general agreement with simulated results, supporting the applicability of the TOPAS CCC model. This work explores the capability of the MiniPIX detector to measure physical quantities to resolve the LET, and discusses experimental considerations and further possibilities.</description>

      <title>Application of Spherical Convolutional Neural Networks to Image Reconstruction and Denoising in Nuclear Medicine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.03298v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work investigates use of equivariant neural networks as efficient and high-performance frameworks for image reconstruction and denoising in nuclear medicine. Our work aims to tackle limitations of conventional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which require significant training. We investigated equivariant networks, aiming to reduce CNN's dependency on specific training sets. Specifically, we implemented and evaluated equivariant spherical CNNs (SCNNs) for 2- and 3-dimensional medical imaging problems. Our results demonstrate superior quality and computational efficiency of SCNNs in both image reconstruction and denoising benchmark problems. Furthermore, we propose a novel approach to employ SCNNs as a complement to conventional image reconstruction tools, enhancing the outcomes while reducing reliance on the training set. Across all cases, we observed significant decrease in computational cost by leveraging the inherent inclusion of equivariant representatives while achieving the same or higher quality of image processing using SCNNs compared to CNNs. Additionally, we explore the potential of SCNNs for broader tomography applications, particularly those requiring rotationally variant representation.</description>

      <title>A novel perspective on denoising using quantum localization with application to medical imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12226v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Background noise in many fields such as medical imaging poses significant challenges for accurate diagnosis, prompting the development of denoising algorithms. Traditional methodologies, however, often struggle to address the complexities of noisy environments in high dimensional imaging systems. This paper introduces a novel quantum-inspired approach for image denoising, drawing upon principles of quantum and condensed matter physics. Our approach views medical images as amorphous structures akin to those found in condensed matter physics and we propose an algorithm that incorporates the concept of mode resolved localization directly into the denoising process. Notably, unlike previous studies that considered localization as a hindrance, our approach considers quantum localization as a fundamental component of image reconstruction which is used to differentiate between noisy and non-noisy modes based on diffusivity and localization measurements. This perspective eliminates the need for hyperparameter tuning, making the proposed method a standalone algorithm which can be implemented with minimal manual intervention and can perform automatic filtering of noise regardless of noise level. Through numerical validation, we showcase the effectiveness of our approach in addressing noise-related challenges in imaging and especially medical imaging, underscoring its relevance for possible quantum computing applications.</description>
