      <title>A Morse Mayer-Vietoris Sequence for Cosheaf Homology on Simplicial Complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the homology of cosheaves over finite simplicial complexes. After constructing the Mayer-Vietoris short exact sequence for this homology theory, we apply discrete Morse theory to this setting, defining the associated Morse chain complex. The main result is the construction of a Morse Mayer-Vietoris short exact sequence of Morse chain complexes, for which we establish a quasi-isomorphism to the standard Mayer-Vietoris sequence. Discussions relating poset-based (co)sheaf definitions to topological ones via Kan extensions and exploring a modern categorical perspective on discrete Morse theory are also included.</description>

      <title>Enriched model categories and the Dold-Kan correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The monoidal properties of the Dold-Kan correspondence have been studied in homotopy theory, notably by Schwede and Shipley. Changing the enrichment of an enriched, tensored, and cotensored category along the Dold-Kan correspondence does not preserve the tensoring nor the cotensoring. More generally, what happens to an enriched model category if we change the enrichment along a weak monoidal Quillen pair? We prove a change of base theorem that describes which properties are preserved and which are weakened.</description>

      <title>Homotopy classification of $S^{2k-1}$-bundles over $S^{2k}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we classify the homotopy types of the total spaces of $S^{2k-1}$-bundles (or fibrations) over $S^{2k}$ for $2\leq k\leq 6$ by listing the attaching map of the top cell of these as CW-complexes. The method is using the new necessary and sufficient conditions we gave in our previous work to determine whether a CW complex has the homotopy type of total space of these sphere bundles.</description>

      <title>On the homology of simplicial and cubical sets with symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the homology of simplicial and cubical sets with symmetries. These are simplicial and cubical sets with additional maps expressing the symmetries of simplices and cubes. We consider the chain complex computing the homology groups in either case. We show for coefficients in fields of characteristic $0$ that the sub-complex generated by degeneracies (simplicial case) or connections (cubical case) together with all $x - sgn(t)tx$ for symmetries $t$ and chains $x$ is acyclic. In particular, it follows that quotienting by this sub-complex yields a chain complex with isomorphic homology. The latter leads to structural insight and a speedup in explicit computations. We also exhibit examples which show that acyclicity does not hold for general coefficient rings $R$.</description>

      <title>Branching space of precubical set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the notion of short natural directed path, we introduce the homotopy branching space of a precubical set. It is unique only up to homotopy equivalence. We prove that, for any precubical set, it is homotopy equivalent to the branching space of any q-realization, any m-realization and any h-realization of the precubical set as a flow. As an application, we deduce the invariance of the homotopy branching space and of the branching homology up to cubical subdivision. By reversing the time direction, the same results are obtained for the merging space and the merging homology of a precubical set.</description>

      <title>The algebraic $K$-theory of Green functors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we develop computational tools to study the higher algebraic $K$-theory of Green functors. We construct a spectral sequence converging to the algebraic $\mathbb{G}$-theory of any $G$-Green functor, for $G$ a cyclic $p$-group. From the spectral sequence we deduce a complete calculation of the algebraic $K$-theory of the constant $C_2$-Green functor associated to the field with two elements, and a calculation of the $p$-completion of the algebraic $K$-theory of the constant $G$-Green functor associated to the integers when $G$ is a cyclic $p$-group. Additionally, we introduce the notion of a Green meadow to abstract the Green functor structure underlying clarified Tambara fields, and show, under mild conditions, that every finitely generated projective module over a $G$-Green meadow is free when $G$ is a cyclic $p$-group. This gives a computation of $K_0$ for such Green functors.</description>

      <title>Geometric, topological and dynamical properties of conformally symplectic systems, normally hyperbolic invariant manifolds, and scattering maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conformally symplectic diffeomorphisms $f:M \rightarrow M$ transform a symplectic form $\omega$ on a manifold $M$ into a multiple of itself, $f^* \omega = \eta \omega$. We assume $\omega$ is bounded, as some of the results may fail otherwise.
  We show that there are deep interactions between the topological properties of the manifold, the dynamical properties of the map, and the geometry of invariant manifolds.
  We show that, when the symplectic form is not exact, the possible conformal factors $\eta$ are related to topological properties of the manifold. For some manifolds the conformal factors are restricted to be algebraic numbers.
  We also find relations between dynamical properties (relations between growth rate of vectors and $\eta$) and symplectic properties.
  Normally hyperbolic invariant manifolds (NHIM) and their (un)stable manifolds are important landmarks that organize long-term dynamical behaviour. We prove that a NHIM is symplectic if and only if the rates satisfy certain pairing rules and if and only if the rates and the conformal factor satisfy certain (natural) inequalities.
  Homoclinic excursions to NHIMs are quantitatively described by scattering maps. These maps give the trajectory asymptotic in the future as a function of the trajectory asymptotic in the past. We prove that the scattering maps are symplectic even if the dynamics is dissipative. We also show that if the symplectic form is exact, then the scattering maps are exact, even if the dynamics is not exact. We give a variational interpretation of scattering maps in the conformally symplectic setting.
  We also show that similar properties of NHIMs and scattering maps hold in the case when $\omega$ is presymplectic. In dynamical systems with many rates (e.g., quasi-integrable systems near multiple resonances), pre-symplectic geometries appear naturally.</description>

      <title>Grothendieck Topologies and Sheaf Theory for Data and Graphs: An Approach Through Cech Closure Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.13867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.13867v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We initiate the study of sheaves on Cech closure spaces, providing a new, unified approach to sheaf theory on many of the major classes of spaces of interest to applications: topological spaces, finite simplicial complexes (seen as $T_0$ topological spaces), graphs and digraphs (both seen as closure spaces), and semi-pseudometric spaces, in particular those constructed from a pseudometric spaces decorated with a privileged scale, which are those typically used for topological data analysis. Our construction proceeds by constructing a Grothendieck topology on the category $\mathcal{M}(c_X)$ of finite intersections of subsets of $(X,c_X)$ with non-empty interior, which is the natural generalization to closure spaces of the category $\mathcal{O}(X,\tau)$ of open sets in a topological space. We continue by constructing the sheaf and Cech cohomologies on $\mathcal{M}(c_X)$, and standard constructions then give a spectral sequence between Cech cohomology and the sheaf cohomology on a site $(\mathcal{M}(c_X),J)$ which we use to identify several examples of non-topological closure spaces with non-trivial sheaf cohomology.</description>

Abstract: We survey decades of research identifying the (co)homology of configuration spaces with Lie algebra (co)homology. The different routes to this one proto-theorem offer genuinely different explanations of its truth, and we attempt to convey some sense of the conceptual core of each perspective.

      <description>arXiv:2507.08377v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the notion of short directed path, we introduce the branching space of a multipointed $d$-space. We prove that for any q-cofibrant multipointed $d$-space, it is homeomorphic to the branching space of the q-cofibrant flow obtained by applying the categorization functor. As an application, we deduce a purely topological proof of the invariance of the branching space and of the branching homology of cellular multipointed $d$-spaces up to globular subdivision. By reversing the time direction, the same results are obtained for the merging space and the merging homology.</description>
