      <title>Synchronization of coupled Stuart-Landau oscillators: How heterogeneity can facilitate synchronization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the collective dynamics of coupled Stuart--Landau oscillators, which model limit-cycle behavior near a Hopf bifurcation and serve as the amplitude-phase analogue of the Kuramoto model. Unlike the well-studied phase-reduced systems, the full Stuart--Landau model retains amplitude dynamics, enabling the emergence of rich phenomena such as amplitude death, quenching, and multistable synchronization. We provide a complete analytical classification of asymptotic behaviors for identical natural frequencies, but heterogeneous inherent amplitudes in the finite-$N$ setting. In the two-oscillator case, we classify the asymptotic behavior in all possible regimes including heterogeneous natural frequencies and inherent amplitudes, and in particular we identify and characterize a novel regime of \emph{leader-driven synchronization}, wherein one active oscillator can entrain another regardless of frequency mismatch. For general $N$, we prove exponential phase synchronization under sectorial initial data and establish sharp conditions for global amplitude death. Finally, we analyze a real-valued reduction of the model, connecting the dynamics to nonlinear opinion formation and consensus processes. Our results highlight the fundamental differences between amplitude-phase and phase-only Kuramoto models, and provide a new framework for understanding synchronization in heterogeneous oscillator networks.</description>

      <title>Generalized Pseudo-Hopf Bifurcation: Limit Cycle Position and Period</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate planar piecewise-smooth vector fields with a discontinuity line, focusing on the bifurcation of crossing limit cycles that arise when one of the vector fields is translated along the discontinuity set. We establish topological conditions under which such bifurcations occur and, under additional generic hypotheses, derive precise asymptotic expressions for both the position and the period of the resulting limit cycle in terms of the perturbation parameter. Our results extend the classical pseudo-Hopf bifurcation: they are not restricted to invisible folds or elementary monodromic singularities, but also apply to nilpotent centers/foci, half-monodromic singularities such as cusps, periodic orbits, and hyperbolic polycycles, thereby encompassing both local and non-local configurations. We show that the period function exhibits distinct asymptotic behaviors depending on the interacting objects. In particular, we provide a comprehensive table summarizing the leading terms of the period and position of the limit cycle for each possible configuration.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that every dynamically coherent plaque expansive partially hyperbolic diffeomorphism is topologically stable with respect to the central foliation (in short, {\em plaque topologically stable}). Next, we study partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms that are both expansive and topologically stable with respect to a central foliation. We show that the center chain recurrent set for such diffeomorphisms belongs to the closure of the center periodic points.</description>

      <title>Generalized $(C, \lambda)$-structure for nonlinear diffeomorphisms of Banach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a notion of generalized $(C, \lambda)$-structure for nonlinear diffeomorphisms in Banach spaces. It combines generalized hyperbolicity for linear operators in Banach spaces with $(C, \lambda)$-structure for diffeomorphisms on compact manifolds. The main differencies are that we allow the hyperbolic splitting to be discontinuous and in invariance condition assume only inclusions instead of equalities for both stable and unstable subspace, which allows us to cover Morse-Smale systems and generalized hyperbolicity. We suggest that the generalized $(C, \lambda)$-structure for infinite-dimensional dynamics plays a role similar to ``Axiom A and strong transversality condition'' for dynamics on compact manifolds. For diffeomorphisms in reflexive Banach space we showed that generalized $(C, \lambda)$-structure implies Lipschitz (periodic) shadowing and is robust under $C^1$-small perturbations. Assuming that generalized $(C, \lambda)$-structure is continuous for diffeomorphisms on an arbitrary Banach space we obtain a weak form of structural stability: the diffeomorphism is semiconjugated from both sides with any $C^1$-small perturbation.</description>

      <title>Low-energy dynamics in generic potential fields: Hyperbolic periodic orbits and non-ergodicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that, on each low energy level, the natural Hamiltonian system defined by a generic smooth potential on $\mathbf{T}^2$ exhibits an arbitrarily high number of hyperbolic periodic orbits and a positive-measure set of invariant tori. Hence, quasi-periodic motion and hyperbolic behavior typically coexist in the low-energy dynamics of natural Hamiltonian systems with two degrees of freedom.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the generating series associated with the degree sequence of a monomial self-map of a projective toric variety. We establish conditions under which this series has its circle of convergence as a natural boundary, and hence is a transcendental, non-holonomic function. In the case of toric surfaces, our results are sharp; moreover, we answer a question of Bell by proving that their reductions modulo $p$ are transcendental for all but finitely many prime numbers $p$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Higher-order interactions that nonlinearly couple more than two nodes are ubiquitous in networked systems. Here we provide an overview of the rapidly growing field of dynamical systems with higher-order interactions, and of the techniques which can be used to describe and analyze them. We focus in particular on new phenomena that emerge when nonpairwise interactions are considered. We conclude by discussing open questions and promising future directions on the collective dynamics of higher-order networks.</description>

      <title>Integrable systems with symmetries: toric, semitoric, and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article presents an overview of the theory of integrable systems with symmetries, focusing on toric systems, semitoric systems, and their classifications via decorated polygons. We discuss certain one-parameter families of integrable systems called semitoric families, and explain how deforming systems through controlled bifurcations in such families (and their generalizations) can be used to construct explicit semitoric systems with prescribed invariants. The first part of the paper serves as a quick introduction to integrable systems for newcomers to the field, such as graduate students, while the majority of the exposition surveys recent developments and technical details that will be of interest to experts. It closes with a look at future directions, including hypersemitoric systems and complexity one integrable systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish general criteria for a countable group $\Gamma$ to have fixed price 1 depending on a choice of left-invariant proper metric on $\Gamma$. We apply this criterion to show that if $\Gamma_1,\Gamma_2$ are two countable groups satisfying a certain growth condition then $\Gamma_1\times \Gamma_2$ has fixed price 1. For example, $\Gamma\times \Gamma$ has fixed price 1 for any countable group $\Gamma$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply the iterative nonlinear programming method, previously proposed in our earlier work, to optimize Schur test functions and thereby provide refined upper bounds for the norms of integral operators. As an illustration, we derive such bounds for transfer operators associated with twofold additive compound operators that arise in the study of delay equations. This is related to the verification of frequency inequalities that guarantee the global stability of nonlinear delay equations through the generalized Bendixson criterion.</description>

      <title>Transient almost-invariant sets reveal convective heat transfer patterns in plane-layer Rayleigh-B\'enard convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Horizontally extended plane-layer convection flows are characterized by characteristic patterns of turbulent heat transfer due to the convective fluid motion consisting of a nearly-regular ridge network where hot fluid rises and cold fluid sinks. Here, we analyse this transport behavior by the so-called inflated generator framework, which identifies quasi-stationary families of almost-invariant sets, derived from leading inflated generator eigenvectors. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this data-driven analysis framework in three-dimensional turbulent flow, by extracting transient characteristic heat transfer patterns as families of almost-invariant sets subject to a transient evolution, which contribute least to the convective heat transfer.</description>

      <title>Boundary actions of CAT(0) spaces: topological freeness and applications to $C^*$-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study topological dynamics on the visual boundary and several combinatorial boundaries associated to $\operatorname{CAT}(0)$ spaces. Through verifying the freeness of Myrberg points on the boundaries, we prove that a large class of these boundary actions are topologically free strong boundary actions. These include certain visual boundary actions obtained from proper isometric actions of groups on proper $\operatorname{CAT}(0)$ spaces with rank-one elements, horofunction boundary actions from actions of irreducible finitely generated infinite non-affine Coxeter groups on the Caylay graphs, and Roller-type boundary actions from certain group actions on irreducible $\operatorname{CAT}(0)$ cube complexes. This in particular leads to a new proof of Kar-Sageev's topological freeness result for Roller boundary actions of $\operatorname{CAT}(0)$ cube complexes and generalizes Klisee's topological freeness result on horofunction boundaries from hyperbolic and right angled Coxeter groups to the general case. As applications to $C^*$-algebras, our work yields new examples of $C^*$-selfless groups and of exact, purely infinite, simple reduced crossed product $C^\ast$-algebras.</description>

      <title>Phase locking and multistability in the topological Kuramoto model on cell complexes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The topological Kuramoto model generalizes classical synchronization models by including higher-order interactions, with oscillator dynamics defined on cells of arbitrary dimension within simplicial or cell complexes. In this article, we demonstrate multistability in the topological Kuramoto model and develop the topological nonlinear Kirchhoff conditions algorithm to identify all phase-locked states on arbitrary cell complexes. The algorithm is based on a generalization of Kirchhoff's laws to cell complexes of arbitrary dimension and nonlinear interactions between cells. By applying this framework to rings, Platonic solids, and simplexes, as minimal representative motifs of larger networks, we derive explicit bounds (based on winding number constraints) that determine the number of coexisting stable states. We uncover structural cascades of multistability, inherited from both lower and higher dimensions and demonstrate that cell complexes can generate richer multistability patterns than simplicial complexes of the same dimension. Moreover, we find that multistability patterns in cell complexes appear to be determined by the number of boundary cells, hinting a possible universal pattern.</description>

Abstract: We extend the computation of the invariant $\eta(\omega,C,a)$ defined in arXiv:2409.01751 to special points on the line at infinity and show that, as in the affine case, its value is determined purely by the geometry of the integral curve C. By incorporating points at infinity, the invariant $\eta$ yields effective geometric criteria that certify Darboux integrability in cases not covered by affine data alone. As an application we construct six new codimension-11 components of the degree-3 center variety</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16432v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Polygonal dynamics is a family of dynamical systems containing many studied systems, like the famous pentagram map. Similar collapsing phenomena seem to occur in most of these systems. We give a unifying, general definition of polygonal dynamics, and conjecture that a generic orbit collapses towards a predictable point. We manage to prove it in some setting. For the special case of ``closed polygons'', we show as a corollary that the collapse point depends algebraicly on the vertices of the starting polygon, using tools called scaling symmetry and infinitesimal monodromy. This generalizes previous results about the pentagram map. Then, we investigate the case of polygonal dynamics in $\mathbb{P}^1$ for which we give an explicit polynomial equation satisfied by the collapse point. Based on previous works, we define a new dynamical system, the ``staircase'' cross-ratio dynamics, for which we study particular configurations.</description>

      <title>Strong Lyapunov functions for rough systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14559v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of {\it strong Lyapunov functions} to investigate the long term behavior of autonomous ordinary differential equations under a multiplicative noise of H\"older continuity, using rough path calculus and the framework of random dynamical systems. We conclude that if such a function exists for the drift then the perturbed system admits the global random pullback attractor which is upper semi-continuous w.r.t. the noise intensity coefficient and the dyadic approximation of the noise. Moreover, in case the drift is globally Lipschitz continuous, then there exists also a numerical attractor for the discritization which is also upper semi-continuous w.r.t. the noise intensity and also converges to the continuous attractor as the step size tends to zero. Several applications are studied, including dissipative systems, the pendulum, Fitzhugh-Nagumo neuro-system and Lorenz system. We also prove that strong Lyapunov functions could be approximated in practice by Lyapunov neural networks.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we present a class of random Schr\"odinger cocycles showing that, for random cocycles with non-compact support, the presence of certain finite moment conditions is essential for establishing a specific modulus of continuity of the Lyapunov exponent. In particular, H\"older continuity of the Lyapunov exponent requires an exponential moment condition.</description>

      <title>On the Poisson Follower Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.04864v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a stochastic geometry dynamics inspired by opinion dynamics that captures the essence of modern asymmetric social networks with leaders and followers. Points in Euclidean space represent opinions, and the leader of an agent is the one with the closest opinion. In this dynamics, each follower updates its opinion by halving the distance to its leader. We demonstrate that this simple dynamics and its iterations exhibit several interesting purely geometric phenomena related to the evolution of leadership and opinion clusters, which resemble those observed in social networks. We also show that when the initial opinions are randomly distributed as a stationary Poisson point process, the likelihood of each of these phenomena can be expressed through an integral geometry formula involving semi-algebraic domains. Furthermore, we establish this property for step 0 and step 1 of the dynamics using percolation techniques. Finally, we analyze numerically the limiting behavior of this follower dynamics. In the Poisson case, the agents fall into two categories: ultimate followers, who continue updating their opinions indefinitely, and ultimate leaders, who adopt a fixed opinion after a finite time. Spatial discrete event simulations support all our findings.</description>

      <title>Homology and K-theory for self-similar actions of groups and groupoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02359v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nekrashevych associated to each self-similar group action an ample groupoid and a $\mathrm{C}^\ast$-algebra. We perform complete computations of the homology of the groupoid and the K-theory of the $\mathrm{C}^\ast$-algebra for a myriad of examples, including the Grigorchuk group, the Grigorchuk--Erschler group, Gupta--Sidki groups, and self-similar actions of free abelian groups and lamplighter groups. The key development is the construction, for arbitrary self-similar group actions, of long exact sequences which compute the homology and K-theory in terms of the homology of the group and K-theory of the group $\mathrm{C}^\ast$-algebra via the transfer map and the virtual endomorphism. Results are proved more generally for self-similar groupoids. As a consequence of our results and recent results of X.~Li, we are able to show that R\"over's simple group containing the Grigorchuk group and Thompson's group $V$ is rationally acyclic but has nontrivial Schur multiplier. We prove many more R\"over--Nekrashevych groups of self-similar groups are rationally acyclic.</description>

      <title>Adding a fecundity-survival trade-off to a discrete population model with maturation delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18765</link>

Abstract: Although maturation delays are frequently included in population models, researchers rarely account for mortality between birth and maturity. Previous discrete population models have included mortality of immature individuals during the maturation delay finding that increasing the delay decreases the equilibrium population size, eventually leading to extinction. Since maturation delays beyond one breeding cycle are often found in nature, they must also have a benefit leading to a trade-off. We derive a class of models to explore the trade-off between the benefit of a longer maturation delay on fecundity due to larger body sizes at maturity and the down-side on survival. We examine two scenarios: density independent survival and cohort density dependent survival of immature individuals. For the mature and immature individuals, we consider two different, but popular, survival functions: the Beverton--Holt model and the Ricker model. Across all models, we identify a positive maturation delay that maximizes the population size that we refer to as the ``optimal maturation delay'' and a critical delay threshold that results in extinction. We also find oscillatory dynamics with the Ricker survival function for certain ranges of maturation delay. Overall, our delay model sets up a useful phenomenological framework to test multiple combinations of trade-offs in parent survival, offspring survival, and reproductive investment.</description>

      <title>Detecting Invariant Manifolds in ReLU-Based RNNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03814v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have found widespread applications in machine learning for time series prediction and dynamical systems reconstruction, and experienced a recent renaissance with improved training algorithms and architectural designs. Understanding why and how trained RNNs produce their behavior is important for scientific and medical applications, and explainable AI more generally. An RNN's dynamical repertoire depends on the topological and geometrical properties of its state space. Stable and unstable manifolds of periodic points play a particularly important role: They dissect a dynamical system's state space into different basins of attraction, and their intersections lead to chaotic dynamics with fractal geometry. Here we introduce a novel algorithm for detecting these manifolds, with a focus on piecewise-linear RNNs (PLRNNs) employing rectified linear units (ReLUs) as their activation function. We demonstrate how the algorithm can be used to trace the boundaries between different basins of attraction, and hence to characterize multistability, a computationally important property. We further show its utility in finding so-called homoclinic points, the intersections between stable and unstable manifolds, and thus establish the existence of chaos in PLRNNs. Finally we show for an empirical example, electrophysiological recordings from a cortical neuron, how insights into the underlying dynamics could be gained through our method.</description>
