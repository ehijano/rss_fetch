      <title>Fluoride Frameworks as Potential Calcium Battery Cathodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Calcium batteries (CBs) are potential next-generation energy storage devices, offering a promising alternative to lithium-ion batteries due to their theoretically high energy density, better safety, and lower costs associated with the natural abundance of calcium. However, the limited availability of positive electrode (cathode) materials has constrained the development of CBs so far. Given the similar ionic radii of Na$^+$ and Ca$^{2+}$, structures that are effective at reversibly intercalating Na$^+$ may be able to reversibly intercalate Ca$^{2+}$ as well. In this context, transition metal fluorides (TMFs) exhibiting weberite and perovskite structures that are known for intercalating Na$^+$ form an interesting set of possible CB cathode frameworks. Thus, we use first principles calculations to explore weberite and perovskite TMFs as CB cathodes, of compositions Ca\textsubscript{x}M\textsubscript{2}F\textsubscript{7} and Ca\textsubscrpt{x}MF\textsubscript{3}, respectively, where M = Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, or Ni. We systematically evaluate key cathode properties, including ground state structure, average Ca-intercalation voltage, thermodynamic stability (at 0 K), theoretical capacity, and Ca$^{2+}$ migration barriers. Importantly, we identify Ca\textsubscript{x}Cr\textsubscript{2}F\textsubscript{7} and Ca\textsubscript{x}Mn\textsubscript{2}F\textsubscript{7} weberite frameworks as promising Ca-cathodes. Our study not only unveils potential CB cathodes but also paves the way for further advancement in TMF-based intercalation cathodes, diversifying the chemical space for next-generation energy storage systems.</description>

      <title>Self-Trapped Excitons in Metal-Halide Perovskites Investigated by Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theoretical study of the formation of self-trapped excitons (STEs) and the associated broadband emission in metal-halide perovskites Cs$_4$SnBr$_6$ and Cs$_2$AgInCl$_6$, using time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) with the dielectric-dependent hybrid (DDH) functional. Our approach allows for an accurate description of the excitonic effect and geometry relaxation in the electronic excited states and yields optical gap, STE emission energy, and emission spectra in reasonable agreement with experiments. We point out the significance of considering geometry relaxations in the electronic excited state by showing that the exciton-phonon coupling computed in the ground-state atomic geometry is insufficient to describe the physical properties of STEs. Overall, we find that TDDFT with the DDH hybrid functional is a suitable approach for the study of the formation of STEs in perovskite and provides insights for designing metal-halide perovskites with tailored emission properties.</description>

      <title>Excited-State Dynamics and Optically Detected Magnetic Resonance of Solid-State Spin Defects from First Principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) is an efficient and reliable method that enables initialization and readout of spin states through spin-photon interface. In general, high quantum efficiency and large spin-dependent photoluminescence (PL) contrast are desirable for reliable quantum information readout. However, reliable prediction of the ODMR contrast from first-principles requires accurate description of complex spin polarization mechanisms of spin defects. These mechanisms often include multiple radiative and nonradiative processes in particular intersystem crossing (ISC) among multiple excited electronic states. In this work we present our implementation of the first-principles ODMR contrast, by solving kinetic master equation with calculated rates from ab initio electronic structure methods then benchmark the implementation on the case of the negatively-charged nitrogen vacancy (NV) center in diamond. We show the importance of correct description of multi-reference electronic states for accurate prediction of excitation energy, spin-orbit coupling, and the rate of ISC. Moreover, we underscore the importance of pseudo Jahn-Teller effect for the spin-orbit coupling, and the dynamical Jahn-Teller effect for electron-phonon coupling, key factors determining ISC rates and ODMR contrast. We show good agreement between our first-principles calculations and the experimental ODMR contrast under magnetic field. We then demonstrate reliable predictions of magnetic field direction, pump power, and microwave frequency dependency, as important parameters for ODMR experiments. Our work clarifies the important excited-state relaxation mechanisms determining ODMR contrast and provides a predictive computational platform for spin polarization and optical readout of solid-state quantum defects from first principles.</description>

      <title>Vacancy enhanced cation ordering enables &gt;15% efficiency in Kesterite solar cells</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomic disorder, a widespread problem in compound crystalline materials, is a imperative affecting the performance of multi-chalcogenide Cu2ZnSn(S, Se)4 (CZTSSe) photovoltaic device known for its low cost and environmental friendliness. Cu-Zn disorder is particularly abundantly present in CZTSSe due to its extraordinarily low formation energy, having induced high-concentration deep defects and severe charge loss, while its regulation remains challenging due to the contradiction between disorder-order phase transition thermodynamics and atom-interchange kinetics. Herein, through introducing more vacancies in the CZTSSe surface, we explored a vacancy-assisted strategy to reduce the atom-interchange barrier limit to facilitate the Cu-Zn ordering kinetic process. The improvement in the Cu-Zn order degree has significantly reduced the charge loss in the device and helped us realize 15.4% (certified at 14.9%) and 13.5% efficiency (certified at 13.3%) in 0.27 cm2 and 1.1 cm2-area CZTSSe solar cells, respectively, thus bringing substantial advancement for emerging inorganic thin-film photovoltaics.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Hall effect and scaling law in Sb-doped topological insulator MnBi4Te7</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear Hall effect (NLHE), as a new member of Hall effect family, has been realized in many materials, attracting a great deal of attention. Here, we report the observation of NLHE in magnetic topological insulator Sb-doped MnBi4Te7 flakes. The NLHE generation efficiency can reach up to 0.06 V^-1, which is comparable to that observed in MnBi2Te4. Differently, the NLHE can survive up to 200 K, much larger than the magnetic transition temperature. We further study the scaling behavior of the NLHE with longitudinal conductivity. The linear relationship with opposite slope when temperature is below and above the magnetic transition temperature is uncovered. It reveals that the NLHE originates from skew scattering. Our work provides a platform to search NLHE with larger generation efficiency at higher temperatures.</description>

      <title>Magnetic field control of continuous N\'eel vector rotation and N\'eel temperature in a van der Waals antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a collinear antiferromagnet, spins tend to cant towards the direction of an applied magnetic field, thereby decreasing the energy of the system. The canting angle becomes negligible when the magnetic field is small so that the induced anisotropic energy is substantially lower than the exchange energy. However, this tiny anisotropy can play a significant role when the intrinsic anisotropy of the antiferromagnet is small. In our work, we conduct direct imaging of the N\'eel vector in a two-dimensional easy-plane antiferromagnet, MnPSe$_3$, with negligible spin canting under an external in-plane magnetic field. The small inherent in-plane anisotropy allows for the continuous rotation of the N\'eel vector by ramping up the magnetic field in samples from the bulk to the monolayer. In monolayer samples, the applied magnetic field elevates the N\'eel temperature 10$\%$ at 5 tesla, as the combination of intrinsic and field-induced anisotropies set a critical temperature scale for fluctuations of the otherwise disordered N\'eel vector field. Our study illuminates the contribution of field-induced anisotropy in two dimensional magnets with in-plane anisotropy. We also demonstrate that the strain can tune the spin flop transition field strength by one order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Transport resistance strikes back: unveiling its impact on fill factor losses in organic solar cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fill factor ($FF$) is a critical parameter for solar cell efficiency, yet its analytical description is challenging due to the interplay between recombination and charge extraction processes. An often overlooked yet significant factor contributing to $FF$ losses, beyond recombination, is the influence of charge transport. In most state-of-the-art organic solar cells, the primary limitation of the $FF$ arises not from recombination but rather from low conductivity, highlighting the need for refined models to predict the $FF$ accurately. Here, we extend the analytical model for transport resistance to a more general case. Drawing from a large set of experimental current-voltage and light intensity-dependent open-circuit voltage data, we systematically incorporate crucial details previously omitted in the model. Consequently, we introduce a straightforward set of equations to predict the $FF$ of a solar cell, enabling the differentiation of losses attributed to recombination and transport resistance. Our study provides valuable insights into strategies for mitigating $FF$ losses based on the experimentally validated analytical model, guiding the development of more efficient solar cell designs and optimization strategies.</description>

      <title>Size selection of crack front defects: Multiple fracture-plane interactions and intrinsic lengthscales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Material failure is mediated by the propagation of cracks, which in realistic 3D materials typically involve multiple coexisting fracture planes. Multiple fracture-plane interactions create poorly understood out-of-plane crack structures, such as step defects on tensile fracture surfaces. Steps form once a slowly moving, distorted crack front segments into disconnected overlapping fracture planes separated by a stabilizing distance $h_{\rm max}$. Our experiments on numerous brittle hydrogels reveal that $h_{\rm max}$ varies linearly with both a nonlinear elastic length $\Gamma(v)/\mu$ and a dissipation length $\xi$. Here, $\Gamma(v)$ is the measured crack velocity $v$-dependent fracture energy and $\mu$ is the shear modulus. These intrinsic lengthscales point the way to a fundamental understanding of multiple-crack interactions in 3D that lead to the formation of stable out-of-plane fracture structures.</description>

      <title>Hierarchy of Exchange-Correlation Functionals in Computing Lattice Thermal Conductivities of Rocksalt and Zincblende Semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lattice thermal conductivity ($\kappa_{\rm L}$) is a crucial characteristic of crystalline solids with significant implications for practical applications. While the higher order of anharmonicity of phonon gas model is commonly used for explaining extraordinary heat transfer behaviors in crystals, the impact of exchange-correlation (XC) functionals in DFT on describing anharmonicity has been largely overlooked. Most XC functionals in solids focus on ground state properties that mainly involve the harmonic approximation, neglecting temperature effects, and their reliability in studying anharmonic properties remains insufficiently explored. In this study, we systematically investigate the room-temperature $\kappa_{\rm L}$ of 16 binary compounds with rocksalt and zincblende structures using 8 XC functionals such as LDA, PBE, PBEsol, optB86b, revTPSS, SCAN, rSCAN, r$^2$SCAN in combination with three perturbation orders, including phonon within harmonic approximation (HA) plus three-phonon scattering (HA+3ph), phonon calculated using self-consistent phonon theory (SCPH) plus three-phonon scattering (SCPH+3ph), and SCPH phonon plus three- and four-phonon scattering (SCPH+3,4ph). Our results show that the XC functional exhibits strong entanglement with perturbation order and the mean relative absolute error (MRAE) of the computed $\kappa_{\rm L}$ is strongly influenced by both the XC functional and perturbation order, leading to error cancellation or amplification. The minimal (maximal) MRAE is achieved with revTPSS (rSCAN) at the HA+3ph level, SCAN (r$^2$SCAN) at the SCPH+3ph level, and PBEsol (rSCAN) at the SCPH+3,4ph level. Among these functionals, PBEsol exhibits the highest accuracy at the highest perturbation order. The SCAN-related functionals demonstrate moderate accuracy but are suffer from numerical instability and high computational costs.</description>

      <title>Deep-Learning Database of Density Functional Theory Hamiltonians for Twisted Materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Moir\'e-twisted materials have garnered significant research interest due to their distinctive properties and intriguing physics. However, conducting first-principles studies on such materials faces challenges, notably the formidable computational cost associated with simulating ultra-large twisted structures. This obstacle impedes the construction of a twisted materials database crucial for datadriven materials discovery. Here, by using high-throughput calculations and state-of-the-art neural network methods, we construct a Deep-learning Database of density functional theory (DFT) Hamiltonians for Twisted materials named DDHT. The DDHT database comprises trained neural-network models of over a hundred homo-bilayer and hetero-bilayer moir\'e-twisted materials. These models enable accurate prediction of the DFT Hamiltonian for these materials across arbitrary twist angles, with an averaged mean absolute error of approximately 1.0 meV or lower. The database facilitates the exploration of flat bands and correlated materials platforms within ultra-large twisted structures.</description>

      <title>Laue Indexing with Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laue tomography experiments retrieve the positions and orientations of crystal grains in a polycrystalline samples from diffraction patterns recorded at multiple viewing angles. The use of a broad wavelength spectrum beam can greatly reduce the experimental time, but poses a difficult challenge for the indexing of diffraction peaks in polycrystalline samples; the information about the wavelength of these Bragg peaks is absent and the diffraction patterns from multiple grains are superimposed. To date, no algorithms exist capable of indexing samples with more than about 500 grains efficiently. To address this need we present a novel method: Laue indexing with Optimal Transport (LaueOT). We create a probabilistic description of the multi-grain indexing problem and propose a solution based on Sinkhorn Expectation-Maximization method, which allows to efficiently find the maximum of the likelihood thanks to the assignments being calculated using Optimal Transport. This is a non-convex optimization problem, where the orientations and positions of grains are optimized simultaneously with grain-to-spot assignments, while robustly handling the outliers. The selection of initial prototype grains to consider in the optimization problem are also calculated within the Optimal Transport framework. LaueOT can rapidly and effectively index up to 1000 grains on a single large memory GPU within less than 30 minutes. We demonstrate the performance of LaueOT on simulations with variable numbers of grains, spot position measurement noise levels, and outlier fractions. The algorithm recovers the correct number of grains even for high noise levels and up to 70% outliers in our experiments. We compare the results of indexing with LaueOT to existing algorithms both on synthetic and real neutron diffraction data from well-characterized samples.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Increased interest in physics of graphene and other two-dimensional materials boosted investigations of band structure near nodal points and lines. In contrast, group theoretical explanation of simple bands (that do not touch other bands), is sporadically present in the literature. This paper presents electronic dispersions up to forth order in momentum, near Brillouin zone (BZ) high symmetry points of all eighty layer groups. The method applies to non magnetic materials both with or without spin-orbit coupling. Particular attention is devoted to Mexican-hat dispersion, showing that it can appear only at BZ center of hexagonal layer groups. Presented symmetry adapted Taylor expansion of bands can be used to fit ab-initio or experimental band structures, or for analytical calculation of crystal properties. The results presented here might serve also as a guiding tool for design of new two-dimensional materials.</description>

      <title>A Machine Learning Framework for the Prediction of Grain Boundary Segregation in Chemically Complex Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of complex concentrated alloys has unveiled materials with diverse atomic environments, prompting the exploration of solute segregation beyond dilute alloys. Data-driven methods offer promising for modeling segregation in such chemically complex environments, and are employed in this study to understand segregation behavior of a refractory complex concentrated alloy, NbMoTaW. A flexible methodology is developed that uses composable computational modules, with different arrangements of these modules employed to obtain site availabilities at absolute zero and the corresponding density of states beyond the dilute limit, resulting in an extremely large dataset containing 10 million data points. The artificial neural network developed here can rely solely on descriptions of local atomic environments to predict behavior at the dilute limit with very small errors, while the addition of negative segregation instance classification allows any solute concentration from zero up to the equiatomic concentration for ternary or quaternary alloys to be modeled at room temperature. The machine learning model thus achieves a significant speed advantage over traditional atomistic simulations, being four orders of magnitude faster, while only experiencing a minimal reduction in accuracy. This efficiency presents a powerful tool for rapid microstructural and interfacial design in unseen domains. Scientifically, our approach reveals a transition in the segregation behavior of Mo from unfavorable in simple systems to favorable in complex environments. Additionally, increasing solute concentration was observed to cause anti-segregation sites to begin to fill, challenging conventional understanding and highlighting the complexity of segregation dynamics in chemically complex environments.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective control of interlayer interactions is a key element in modifying the properties of van der Waals heterostructures and the next step toward their practical applications. Focusing on the phosphorene-WSe$_2$ heterostructure, we demonstrate, using first-principles calculations, how the spin-orbit coupling can be transferred from WSe$_2$, a strong spin-orbit coupling material, to phosphorene and further amplified by applying vertical pressure. We simulate external pressure by changing the interlayer distance between bilayer constituents and show that it is possible to tune the spin-orbit field of phosphorene holes in a controllable way. By fitting effective electronic states of the proposed Hamiltonian to the first principles data, we reveal that the spin-orbit coupling in phosphorene hole bands is enhanced more than two times for experimentally accessible pressures up to 17 kbar. Finally, we find that the pressure-enhanced spin-orbit coupling boosts the Dyakonov-Perel spin relaxation mechanism, reducing the spin lifetime of phosphorene holes by factor 4.</description>

This capacity offers exciting opportunities for boosting the research and development (R&amp;D) of new functional materials. Unfortunately, the previous models can only provide the prediction for existing materials in past literature, but cannot predict the applications of new materials. Here, we construct a model that can predict the applications of any stoichiometric inorganic material (regardless of whether it is a new material). Historical validation confirms the high reliability of our model. Key to our model is that it allows the generation of the word embedding of any stoichiometric inorganic material, which cannot be achieved by the previous models. This work constructs a powerful model, which can predict the future applications of any stoichiometric inorganic material using only a laptop, potentially revolutionizing the R&amp;D paradigm for new functional materials</description>

      <title>Copper doping effects on the superconducting properties of Sm-based oxypnictides</title>

Abstract: A systematic investigation has been performed by synthesis and comprehensive characterization of a series of SmFe1-xCuxAsO0.8F0.2 bulks (x = 0 to 0.2). These samples are well characterized by structural, Raman spectroscopy, microstructural, transport, magnetic measurements, and supplementary calculations within density functional theory (DFT). The parent compound, SmFeAsO0.8F0.2 (Sm1111), exhibits a superconducting transition temperature (Tc) of approximately 54 K. The lattice volume (V) is increased with Cu substitution (x) without observing any impurity phase related to copper, which confirms the successful incorporation of Cu at Fe sites in the superconducting FeAs layers. These analyses are also well in agreement with Raman spectroscopy measurements and relevant DFT results. The superconducting transition is decreased systematically with copper doping and completely suppressed for 7% Cu-doped Sm1111 (x = 0.07). A large amount of Cu substitution (x greater than 0.07) has demonstrated the metal to insulate transition in the low-temperature range, and no impurity phase was observed even at high Cu doping levels (x = 0.2). The calculated critical current density of the parent sample is suppressed with copper substitution, suggesting the reduced pinning centers, sample density, and grain connections, as confirmed by the microstructural analysis. Our studies suggest that the substitution of Cu in the superconducting FeAs layer, resulting the enlargement of the lattice volume, is a source of strong disorder scattering, leading to the suppression of Tc and the emergence of metal-to-insulator, unlike the more successful carrier doping by nickel (Ni) or cobalt (Co), as previously reported.</description>

      <title>Higher order topological defects in a moir\'e lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological defects are ubiquitous, they manifest in a wide variety of systems such as liquid crystals, magnets or superconductors. The recent quest for nonabelian anyons in condensed matter physics stimulates the interest for topological defects since they can be hosted in vortices in quantum magnets or topological superconductors. In addition to these vortex defects, in this study we propose to investigate edge dislocations in 2D magnets as new building blocks for topological physics since they can be described as vortices in the structural phase field. Here we demonstrate the existence of higher order topological dislocations within the higher order moir\'e pattern of the van der Waals 2D magnet CrCl3 deposited on Au(111). Surprizingly, these higher order dislocations arise from ordinary simple edge dislocations in the atomic lattice of CrCl3. We provide a theoretical framework explaining the higher order dislocations as vortex with a winding Chern number of 2. We expect that these original defects could stabilize some anyons either in a 2D quantum magnet or within a 2D superconductor coupled to it.</description>

      <title>Universal Deformations and Inhomogeneities in Isotropic Cauchy Elasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a given class of materials, \emph{universal deformations} are those deformations that can be maintained in the absence of body forces and by applying solely boundary tractions. For inhomogeneous bodies, in addition to the universality constraints that determine the universal deformations, there are extra constraints on the form of the material inhomogeneities -- \emph{universal inhomogeneity constraints}. Those inhomogeneities compatible with the universal inhomogeneity constraints are called \emph{universal inhomogeneities}. In a Cauchy elastic solid, stress at a given point and at an instance of time is a function of strain at that point and that exact moment in time, without any dependence on prior history. A Cauchy elastic solid does not necessarily have an energy function, i.e., Cauchy elastic solids are, in general, non-hyperelastic (or non-Green elastic). In this paper we characterize universal deformations in both compressible and incompressible inhomogeneous isotropic Cauchy elasticity. As Cauchy elasticity includes hyperelasticity, one expects the universal deformations of Cauchy elasticity to be a subset of those of hyperelasticity both in the compressible and incompressible cases. It is also expected that the universal inhomogeneity constraints to be more strict than those of hyperelasticity, and hence, the set of universal inhomogeneities to be smaller than that of hyperelasticity. We prove the unexpected result that the sets of universal deformations of isotropic Cauchy elasticity and isotropic hyperelasticity are identical, in both the compressible and incompressible cases. We also prove that their corresponding universal inhomogeneities are identical as well.</description>

      <title>Facilities and practices for linear response Hubbard parameters U and J in Abinit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Members of the DFT+U family of functionals are increasingly prevalent methods of addressing errors intrinsic to (semi-) local exchange-correlation functionals at minimum computational cost, but require their parameters U and J to be calculated in situ for a given system of interest, simulation scheme, and runtime parameters. The SCF linear response approach offers ab initio acquisition of the U and has recently been extended to compute the J analogously, which measures localized errors related to exchange-like effects. We introduce a renovated post-processor, the lrUJ utility, together with this detailed best-practices guide, to enable users of the popular, open-source Abinit first-principles simulation suite to engage easily with in situ Hubbard parameters and streamline their incorporation into material simulations of interest. Features of this utility, which may also interest users and developers of other DFT codes, include $n$-degree polynomial regression, error analysis, Python plotting facilities, didactic documentation, and avenues for further developments. In this technical introduction and guide, we place particular emphasis on the intricacies and potential pitfalls introduced by the projector augmented wave (PAW) method, SCF mixing schemes, and non-linear response, several of which are translatable to DFT+U(+J) implementations in other packages.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a fast generative modeling approach for resistive memories that reproduces the complex statistical properties of real-world devices. To enable efficient modeling of analog circuits, the model is implemented in Verilog-A. By training on extensive measurement data of integrated 1T1R arrays (6,000 cycles of 512 devices), an autoregressive stochastic process accurately accounts for the cross-correlations between the switching parameters, while non-linear transformations ensure agreement with both cycle-to-cycle (C2C) and device-to-device (D2D) variability. Benchmarks show that this statistically comprehensive model achieves read/write throughputs exceeding those of even highly simplified and deterministic compact models.</description>

Abstract: We present the formalism and implementation of quasi-particle self-consistent GW (qsGW) and eigenvalue only quasi-particle self-consistent GW (evGW) adapted to standard quantum chemistry packages. Our implementation is benchmarked against high-level quantum chemistry computations (coupled-cluster theory) and experimental results using a representative set of molecules. Furthermore, we compare the qsGW approach for five molecules relevant for organic photovoltaics to self-consistent GW results (scGW) and analyze the effects of the self-consistency on the ground state density by comparing calculated dipole moments to their experimental values. We show that qsGW makes a significant improvement over conventional G0W0 and that partially self-consistent flavors (in particular evGW) can be excellent alternatives.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2112.12850v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is common for the local inversion symmetry to break in crystals, even though the whole crystal has global inversion symmetry. This local inversion symmetry breaking allows for a local Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya interaction (DMI) in magnetic crystals. Here we show that the local DMI can stabilize a skyrmion as a metastable excitation or as a skyrmion crystal in equilibrium. We consider the crystal structure with layered structure as an example, where local inversion is violated in each layer but a global inversion center exists in the middle of the two layers. These skyrmions come in pairs that are related by inversion symmetry. The two skyrmions with opposite helicity in a pair form a bound state. We study the properties of a skyrmion pair in the ferromagnetic background and determine the equilibrium phase diagram, where a robust lattice of skyrmion pairs is stabilized. Our results point to a new direction to search for the skyrmion lattice in centrosymmetric magnets.</description>

      <title>Temperature-transferable tight-binding model using a hybrid-orbital basis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.08897v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Finite-temperature calculations are relevant for rationalizing material properties yet they are computationally expensive because large system sizes or long simulation times are typically required. Circumventing the need for performing many explicit first-principles calculations, tight-binding and machine-learning models for the electronic structure emerged as promising alternatives, but transferability of such methods to elevated temperatures in a data-efficient way remains a great challenge. In this work, we suggest a tight-binding model for efficient and accurate calculations of temperature-dependent properties of semiconductors. Our approach utilizes physics-informed modeling of the electronic structure in form of hybrid-orbital basis functions and numerically integrating atomic orbitals for the distance dependence of matrix elements. We show that these design choices lead to a tight-binding model with a minimal amount of parameters which are straightforwardly optimized using density functional theory or alternative electronic-structure methods. Temperature-transferability of our model is tested by applying it to existing molecular-dynamics trajectories without explicitly fitting temperature-dependent data and comparison to density functional theory. We utilize it together with machine-learning molecular dynamics and hybrid density functional theory for the prototypical semiconductor gallium arsenide. We find that including the effects of thermal expansion on the onsite terms of the tight-binding model is important in order to accurately describe electronic properties at elevated temperatures in comparison to experiment.</description>

      <title>Identifying Constitutive Parameters for Complex Hyperelastic Materials using Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.15640v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Identifying constitutive parameters in engineering and biological materials, particularly those with intricate geometries and mechanical behaviors, remains a longstanding challenge. The recent advent of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) offers promising solutions, but current frameworks are often limited to basic constitutive laws and encounter practical constraints when combined with experimental data. In this paper, we introduce a robust PINN-based framework designed to identify material parameters for soft materials, specifically those exhibiting complex constitutive behaviors, under large deformation in plane stress conditions. Distinctively, our model emphasizes training PINNs with multi-modal synthetic experimental datasets consisting of full-field deformation and loading history, ensuring algorithm robustness even with noisy data. Our results reveal that the PINNs framework can accurately identify constitutive parameters of the incompressible Arruda-Boyce model for samples with intricate geometries, maintaining an error below 5%, even with an experimental noise level of 5%. We believe our framework provides a robust modulus identification approach for complex solids, especially for those with geometrical and constitutive complexity.</description>

      <title>The geometry of high-dimensional phase diagrams: II. The duality between closed and open chemical systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05197v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern materials are often synthesized or operated in complex chemical environments, where there can be numerous elemental species, competing phases, and reaction pathways. When analyzing reactions using the Gibbs free energy, which has a natural variable of composition, it is often cumbersome to solve for the equilibrium states of a complicated heterogeneous mixture of phases. However, if one is interested only in the stability of a single target material, it may be easier to reframe the boundary conditions around only the target material-of-interest, with boundary conditions open to chemical exchange with an external reservoir. The corresponding phase diagram would thus have a chemical potential axis for the open volatile species, rather than a composition axis. Here we discuss how to derive, compute, and interpret phase diagrams with chemical potential axes, which are dual to the more common composition phase diagram.
  In our ambition to construct high-dimensional phase diagrams featuring any thermodynamic variable on its axes, here we examine the duality between extensive and intensive conjugate variables in equilibrium thermodynamics. This duality manifests from the distinction between closed and open boundary conditions of a thermodynamic system, to the relationship between the Internal Energy and its Legendre transformations, to the point-line duality in calculating convex hulls versus half-space intersections. Here we focus on the duality relationships of chemical work, with extensive composition variables, N, and intensive chemical potentials, {\mu}. In particular, we explore mixed composition-chemical potential diagrams for oxynitride synthesis, lithium-ion cathode stability, and oxidation of high-entropy alloys. We further illustrate how chemical potential diagrams reveal the driving forces for non-equilibrium growth and dissolution kinetics.</description>

      <title>The geometry of high-dimensional phase diagrams: III. Engineering relative stability in four dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05201v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Designing thermodynamic conditions to improve (or reduce) the stability of a target material is a key task in materials engineering. For example, during materials synthesis one aims to enhance the stability of a target phase relative to its precursors or competing byproduct phases. If an undesired phase forms in experiment, one aims to destabilize the undesired phase by dissolution or corrosion. When multiple thermodynamic knobs are available to engineer relative stability, it can be difficult to navigate the corresponding high-dimensional phase diagram to identify optimal pathways to promote or destabilize a target phase. We propose that instead of mapping the absolute phase boundaries of a target material, we can invoke a generalized Clausius-Clapeyron relation, which provides a 'compass' to point out which directions on a high-dimensional phase diagram are best to stabilize or destabilize a target phase.
  Phase boundaries on high-dimensional phase diagrams are also high-dimensional objects, and can represent phase coexistence between numerous phases simultaneously. On a 2D temperature-pressure phase diagram, phase boundaries are 1D lines separating two phases, with a slope given by the Clausius-Clapeyron relation, dP/dT = {\Delta}S/{\Delta}V. Here, we derive a parametric form of the Clausius-Clapeyron relation that readily scales to high-dimensional phase boundaries. The gradient of a phase boundary guides us on how to increase or decrease the relative stability of a target compound, meaning this generalized Clausius-Clapeyron relation enables us to engineer relative stability with respect to multiple thermodynamic conditions simultaneously. Using this approach, we analyze the acid stability of manganese oxide catalysts on a 4-dimensional Pourbaix diagram with axes of pH, redox potential, nanoparticle size, and aqueous [K+] ion concentration.</description>

      <title>The geometry of high-dimensional phase diagrams: I. Generalized Gibbs Phase Rule</title>

      <description>arXiv:2105.01337v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Phase diagrams are essential tools of the materials scientist, showing which phases are at equilibrium under a set of applied thermodynamic conditions. Essentially all phase diagrams today are two dimensional, typically constructed with axes of temperature-pressure or temperature-composition. For many modern materials, it would be valuable to construct phase diagrams that include additional forms of thermodynamic work--such as elastic, surface, electromagnetic or electrochemical work, etc.--which grows the free energy of materials into higher (&gt;3) dimensions. Here, we extend Gibbs' original arguments on phase coexistence to derive a generalized Phase Rule, based in the combinatorial geometry of high-dimensional convex polytopes. The generalized Phase Rule offers a conceptual and geometric foundation to describe phase boundaries on high-dimensional phase diagrams, which are relevant for understanding the stability of modern materials in complex chemical environments.
  We revisit Gibbs arguments on the equilibrium of heterogeneous substances and show that phase coexistence regions in high-dimensional Internal Energy space, U(S,Xi,...,Xj), are simplicial convex polytopes--which are N-dimensional analogues of triangles and tetrahedra. In the first of this three-part series, we examine how the combinatorial relationships between the vertices and facets of simplicial polytopes leads to a generalized high-dimensional description of Gibbs' Phase Rule. Because Gibbs' Phase Rule describes the nature of phase boundaries on phase diagrams, this isomorphism between the physical principles of equilibrium thermodynamics and the geometry of simplicial polytopes provides the foundation to construct generalized phase diagrams, which can exist in any dimension, with any intensive or extensive thermodynamic variable on the axes.</description>

Abstract: We explore numerically the intricate interplay between Berry phases in both real and momentum spaces within itinerant magnets. This interplay manifests as an emergent spin-orbit coupling, where charge carriers occupying a Berry-curved band generate an orbital magnetization, inducing a pseudo-magnetic field originating in chiral spin textures. Using density-matrix-renormalization-group techniques, we demonstrate that switching on a band Berry curvature in a metallic ferromagnetic phase results in chiral magnetic textures. Furthermore, employing a two-leg strip geometry, we establish a connection between charge and spin chirality, further supporting this emergent spin-orbit interaction.</description>

Abstract: Multidrug resistance (MDR) to conventional antibiotics is one of the most urgent global health threats, necessitating the development of effective and biocompatible antimicrobial agents that are less inclined to provoke resistance. Structurally Nanoengineered Antimicrobial Peptide Polymers (SNAPPs) are a novel and promising class of such alternatives. These star-shaped polymers are made of a dendritic core with multiple arms made of co-peptides with varying amino acid sequences. Through a comprehensive set of in vivo experiments, we (Nature Microbiology, 1, 16162, 2016) showed that SNAPPs with arms made of random blocks of lysine (K) and valine (V) residues exhibit sub-micron M efficacy against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria tested. Cryo-TEM images suggested pore formation by SNAPP with random block co-peptide arms as one of their mode of actions. However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for this mode of action of SNAPP were not fully understood. To address this gap, we employed atomistic molecular dynamics simulation technique to investigate the influence of three different sequences of amino acids, namely 1) alternating block KKV 2) random block and 3) di-block motifs on secondary structure of their arms and SNAPP's overall configuration as well as their interactions with lipid bilayer. We, for the first time identified a step-by-step mechanism through which alternating block and random SNAPPs interact with lipid bilayer and leads to pore formation, hence cell death. These insights provide a strong foundation for further optimization of the chemical structure of SNAPPs for maximum performance against MDR bacteria, therefore offering a promising avenue for addressing antibiotic resistance and development of effective antibacterial agents.</description>

Abstract: Impurities exist inevitably in two-dimensional materials as they spontaneously adsorb onto the surface during fabrication, usually exerting detrimental effects on electronic transport. Here, we focus on a special type of impurities that preferentially adsorb onto the hollow regions of graphene nanoribbons (GNRs), and study how they affect the quantum transport in GNRs. Contrary to previous knowledge that random adatoms should localize electrons, the so-called Anderson localization, noteworthy quantized conductance peaks (QCPs) are observed at specific electron energies. These QCPs are remarkably robust against variations in system size, GNR edge, and adatom properties, and they can reappear at identical energies following an arithmetic sequence of device width. Further investigation of wavefunction reveals a unique transport mode at each QCP energy which transmits through disordered GNRs reflectionlessly, while all the others become fully Anderson localized, indicating the survival of quantum ballistic transport in the localized regime. Our findings highlight the potential utility of hollow adatoms as a powerful tool to manipulate the conductivity of GNRs, and deepen the understanding of the interplay between impurities and graphene.</description>
