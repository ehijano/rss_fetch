      <title>Subgroup perfect codes of $ S_n $ in Cayley graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A perfect code in a graph $\Gamma = (V, E)$ is a subset $C$ of $V$ such that no two vertices in $C$ are adjacent and every vertex in $V \setminus C$ is adjacent to exactly one vertex in $C$. A subgroup $H$ of a group $G$ is called a subgroup perfect code of $G$ if there exists a Cayley graph of $G$ which admits $H$ as a perfect code. In this work, we present a classification of cyclic 2-subgroup perfect codes in $ S_n$. We analyze these subgroup codes, detailing their structure and properties. We extend our discussion to various classes of subgroup codes in the symmetric group $ S_n $, encompassing both commutative and non-commutative cases. We provide numerous examples to illustrate and support our findings.</description>

      <title>Clonoids over vector spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Clonoids are sets of finitary operations between two algebraic structures that are closed under composition with their term operations on both sides. We conjecture that, for finite modules $\mathbf A$ and $\mathbf B$ there are only finitely many clonoids from $\mathbf A$ to $\mathbf B$ if and only if $\mathbf A$, $\mathbf B$ are of coprime order.
  We confirm this conjecture for a broad class of modules $\mathbf A$. In particular we show that, if $\mathbf A$ is a finite $k$-dimensional vector space, then every clonoid from $\mathbf A$ to a coprime module $\mathbf B$ is generated by its $k$-ary functions (and arity $k-1$ does not suffice). In order to prove this results, we investigate `uniform generation by $(\mathbf A,\mathbf B)$-minors', a general criterion, which we show to apply to several other existing classifications results. Based on our analysis, we further prove that the subpower membership problem of certain 2-nilpotent Mal'cev algebras is solvable in polynomial time.</description>

      <title>Winning in the Limit: Average-Case Committee Selection with Many Candidates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the committee selection problem in the canonical impartial culture model with a large number of voters and an even larger candidate set. Here, each voter independently reports a uniformly random preference order over the candidates. For a fixed committee size $k$, we ask when a committee can collectively beat every candidate outside the committee by a prescribed majority level $\alpha$. We focus on two natural notions of collective dominance, $\alpha$-winning and $\alpha$-dominating sets, and we identify sharp threshold phenomena for both of them using probabilistic methods, duality arguments, and rounding techniques.
  We first consider $\alpha$-winning sets. A set $S$ of $k$ candidates is $\alpha$-winning if, for every outside candidate $a \notin S$, at least an $\alpha$-fraction of voters rank some member of $S$ above $a$. We show a sharp threshold at \[ \alpha_{\mathrm{win}}^\star = 1 - \frac{1}{k}. \] Specifically, an $\alpha$-winning set of size $k$ exists with high probability when $\alpha &lt; \alpha_{\mathrm{win}}^\star$, and is unlikely to exist when $\alpha &gt; \alpha_{\mathrm{win}}^\star$.
  We then study the stronger notion of $\alpha$-dominating sets. A set $S$ of $k$ candidates is $\alpha$-dominating if, for every outside candidate $a \notin S$, there exists a single committee member $b \in S$ such that at least an $\alpha$-fraction of voters prefer $b$ to $a$. Here we establish an analogous sharp threshold at \[ \alpha_{\mathrm{dom}}^\star = \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{2k}. \] As a corollary, our analysis yields an impossibility result for $\alpha$-dominating sets: for every $k$ and every $\alpha &gt; \alpha_{\mathrm{dom}}^\star = 1 / 2 - 1 / (2k)$, there exist preference profiles that admit no $\alpha$-dominating set of size $k$. This corollary improves the best previously known bounds for all $k \geq 2$.</description>

      <title>Weighted Treedepth is NP-complete on Graphs of Bounded Degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18584v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A treedepth decomposition of an undirected graph $G$ is a rooted forest $F$ on the vertex set of $G$ such that every edge $uv\in E(G)$ is in ancestor-descendant relationship in $F$. Given a weight function $w\colon V(G)\rightarrow \mathbb{N}$, the weighted depth of a treedepth decomposition is the maximum weight of any path from the root to a leaf, where the weight of a path is the sum of the weights of its vertices. It is known that deciding weighted treedepth is NP-complete even on trees. We prove that weighted treedepth is also NP-complete on bounded degree graphs. On the positive side, we prove that the problem is efficiently solvable on paths and on 1-subdivided stars.</description>

      <title>Algorithms and hardness for Metric Dimension on digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.09389v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the Metric Dimension problem, one asks for a minimum-size set $R$ of vertices such that for any pair of vertices of the graph, there is a vertex from $R$ whose two distances to the vertices of the pair are distinct. This problem has mainly been studied on undirected graphs and has gained a lot of attention in the recent years. We focus on directed graphs, and show how to solve the problem in linear time on digraphs whose underlying undirected graph (ignoring multiple edges) is a tree. This (non-trivially) extends a previous algorithm for oriented trees. We then extend the method to orientations of unicyclic graphs. We also give a fixed-parameter-tractable algorithm for digraphs when parameterized by the directed modular-width, extending a known result for undirected graphs. Finally, we show that Metric Dimension is NP-hard even on planar triangle-free acyclic digraphs of maximum degree 6.</description>

      <title>Multi-Excitation Projective Simulation with a Many-Body Physics Inspired Inductive Bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10192v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the impressive progress of deep learning, applications relying on machine learning are increasingly being integrated into daily life. However, most deep learning models have an opaque, oracle-like nature making it difficult to interpret and understand their decisions. This problem led to the development of the field known as eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI). One method in this field known as Projective Simulation (PS) models a chain-of-thought as a random walk of a particle on a graph with vertices that have concepts attached to them. While this description has various benefits, including the possibility of quantization, it cannot be naturally used to model thoughts that combine several concepts simultaneously. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Multi-Excitation Projective Simulation (mePS), a generalization that considers a chain-of-thought to be a random walk of several particles on a hypergraph. A definition for a dynamic hypergraph is put forward to describe the agent's training history along with applications to AI and hypergraph visualization. An inductive bias inspired by the remarkably successful few-body interaction models used in quantum many-body physics is formalized for our classical mePS framework and employed to tackle the exponential complexity associated with naive implementations of hypergraphs. We prove that our inductive bias reduces the complexity from exponential to polynomial, with the exponent representing the cutoff on how many particles can interact. We numerically apply our method to two toy environments and a more complex scenario modelling the diagnosis of a broken computer. These environments demonstrate the resource savings provided by an appropriate choice of inductive bias, as well as showcasing aspects of interpretability. A quantum model for mePS is also briefly outlined and some future directions for it are discussed.</description>

      <title>Planar graphs in blowups of fans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05936v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that every $n$-vertex planar graph is contained in the graph obtained from a fan by blowing up each vertex by a complete graph of order $O(\sqrt{n}\log^2 n)$. Equivalently, every $n$-vertex planar graph $G$ has a set $X$ of $O(\sqrt{n}\log^2 n)$ vertices such that $G-X$ has bandwidth $O(\sqrt{n}\log^2 n)$. We in fact prove the same result for any proper minor-closed class, and we prove more general results that explore the trade-off between $X$ and the bandwidth of $G-X$. The proofs use three key ingredients. The first is a new local sparsification lemma, which shows that every $n$-vertex planar graph $G$ has a set of $O((n\log n)/\delta)$ vertices whose removal results in a graph with local density at most $\delta$. The second is a generalization of a method of Feige and Rao that relates bandwidth and local density using volume-preserving Euclidean embeddings. The third ingredient is graph products, which are a key tool in the extension to any proper minor-closed class.</description>

      <title>Color Refinement for Relational Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16022v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Color Refinement, also known as Naive Vertex Classification, is a classical method to distinguish graphs by iteratively computing a coloring of their vertices. While it is mainly used as an imperfect way to test for isomorphism, the algorithm permeated many other, seemingly unrelated, areas of computer science. The method is algorithmically simple, and it has a well-understood distinguishing power: It is logically characterized by Cai, F\"urer and Immerman (1992), who showed that it distinguishes precisely those graphs that can be distinguished by a sentence of first-order logic with counting quantifiers and only two variables. A combinatorial characterization is given by Dvo\v{r}\'ak (2010), who shows that it distinguishes precisely those graphs that can be distinguished by the number of homomorphisms from some tree.
  In this paper, we introduce Relational Color Refinement (RCR, for short), a generalization of the Color Refinement method from graphs to arbitrary relational structures, whose distinguishing power admits the equivalent combinatorial and logical characterizations as Color Refinement has on graphs: We show that RCR distinguishes precisely those structures that can be distinguished by the number of homomorphisms from an acyclic relational structure. Further, we show that RCR distinguishes precisely those structures that can be distinguished by a sentence of the guarded fragment of first-order logic with counting quantifiers.
  Additionally, we show that for every fixed finite relational signature, RCR can be implemented to run on structures of that signature in time $O(N\cdot \log N)$, where $N$ denotes the number of tuples present in the structure.</description>

      <title>When Many Trees Go to War: On Sets of Phylogenetic Trees With Almost No Common Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21749v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is known that any two trees on the same $n$ leaves can be displayed by a network with $n-2$ reticulations, and there are two trees that cannot be displayed by a network with fewer reticulations. But how many reticulations are needed to display multiple trees? For any set of $t$ trees on $n$ leaves, there is a trivial network with $(t - 1)n$ reticulations that displays them. To do better, we have to exploit common structure of the trees to embed non-trivial subtrees of different trees into the same part of the network. In this paper, we show that for $t \in o(\sqrt{\lg n})$, there is a set of $t$ trees with virtually no common structure that could be exploited. More precisely, we show for any $t\in o(\sqrt{\lg n})$, there are $t$ trees such that any network displaying them has $(t-1)n - o(n)$ reticulations. For $t \in o(\lg n)$, we obtain a slightly weaker bound. We also prove that already for $t = c\lg n$, for any constant $c &gt; 0$, there is a set of $t$ trees that cannot be displayed by a network with $o(n \lg n)$ reticulations, matching up to constant factors the known upper bound of $O(n \lg n)$ reticulations sufficient to display \emph{all} trees with $n$ leaves. These results are based on simple counting arguments and extend to unrooted networks and trees.</description>

      <title>Refining the Complexity Landscape of Speed Scaling: Hardness and Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17663v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the computational complexity of scheduling jobs on a single speed-scalable processor with the objective of capturing the trade-off between the (weighted) flow time and the energy consumption. This trade-off has been extensively explored in the literature through a number of problem formulations that differ in the specific job characteristics and the precise objective function. Nevertheless, the computational complexity of four important problem variants has remained unresolved and was explicitly identified as an open question in prior work. In this paper, we settle the complexity of these variants.
  More specifically, we prove that the problem of minimizing the objective of total (weighted) flow time plus energy is NP-hard for the cases of (i) unit-weight jobs with arbitrary sizes, and (ii)~arbitrary-weight jobs with unit sizes. These results extend to the objective of minimizing the total (weighted) flow time subject to an energy budget and hold even when the schedule is required to adhere to a given priority ordering.
  In contrast, we show that when a completion-time ordering is provided, the same problem variants become polynomial-time solvable. The latter result highlights the subtle differences between priority and completion orderings for the problem.</description>

      <title>Erd\H{o}s Matching (Conjecture) Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01471v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a family of $k$-sized subsets of $[n]$ that does not contain $s$ pairwise disjoint subsets.
  The Erd\H{o}s Matching Conjecture, a celebrated and long-standing open problem in extremal combinatorics, asserts the maximum cardinality of $\mathcal{F}$ is upper bounded by
  $\max\left\{\binom{sk-1}{k}, \binom{n}{k}-\allowbreak \binom{n-s+1}{k}\right\}$.
  These two bounds correspond to the sizes of two canonical extremal families: one in which all subsets are contained within a ground set of $sk-1$ elements, and one in which every subset intersects a fixed set of $s-1$ elements.
  In this paper, we prove the conjecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.01499v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the tree-decomposition-based parameter totally $\Delta$-modular treewidth (TDM-treewidth) for matrices with two nonzero entries per row. We show how to solve integer programs whose matrices have bounded TDM-treewidth when variables are bounded. This extends previous graph-based decomposition parameters for matrices with at most two nonzero entries per row to include matrices with entries outside of $\{-1,0,1\}$. We also give an analogue of the Grid Theorem of Robertson and Seymour for matrices of bounded TDM-treewidth in the language of rooted signed graphs.</description>
