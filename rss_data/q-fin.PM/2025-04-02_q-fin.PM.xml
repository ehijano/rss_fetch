      <title>Automate Strategy Finding with LLM in Quant Investment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06289v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite significant progress in deep learning for financial trading, existing models often face instability and high uncertainty, hindering their practical application. Leveraging advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and multi-agent architectures, we propose a novel framework for quantitative stock investment in portfolio management and alpha mining. Our framework addresses these issues by integrating LLMs to generate diversified alphas and employing a multi-agent approach to dynamically evaluate market conditions. This paper proposes a framework where large language models (LLMs) mine alpha factors from multimodal financial data, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of market dynamics. The first module extracts predictive signals by integrating numerical data, research papers, and visual charts. The second module uses ensemble learning to construct a diverse pool of trading agents with varying risk preferences, enhancing strategy performance through a broader market analysis. In the third module, a dynamic weight-gating mechanism selects and assigns weights to the most relevant agents based on real-time market conditions, enabling the creation of an adaptive and context-aware composite alpha formula. Extensive experiments on the Chinese stock markets demonstrate that this framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple financial metrics. The results underscore the efficacy of combining LLM-generated alphas with a multi-agent architecture to achieve superior trading performance and stability. This work highlights the potential of AI-driven approaches in enhancing quantitative investment strategies and sets a new benchmark for integrating advanced machine learning techniques in financial trading can also be applied on diverse markets.</description>

      <title>Optimal Diversification and Leverage in a Utility-Based Portfolio Allocation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07498v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the problem of optimal portfolio allocation within the framework of utility theory. We apply exponential utility to derive the optimal diversification strategy and logarithmic utility to determine the optimal leverage. We enhance existing methodologies by incorporating compound probability distributions to model the effects of both statistical and non-stationary uncertainties. Additionally, we extend the maximum expected utility objective by including the variance of utility in the objective function, which we term generalized mean-variance. In the case of logarithmic utility, it provides a natural explanation for the half-Kelly criterion, a concept widely used by practitioners.</description>

      <title>A unifying view on the irreversible investment exercise boundary in a stochastic, time-inhomogeneous capacity expansion problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.09878v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper devises a way to apply the Bank and El Karoui Representation Theorem to find the investment boundary of a rich stochastic, continuous time capacity expansion problem with irreversible investment on the finite time interval $[0, T]$, despite the presence of a state dependent scrap value associated with the production facility at the terminal time $T$. Standard variational methods are not feasible for the proposed singular stochastic control problem but it admits some first order conditions, complicated however by an extra, non integral term involving the scrap value function and depending on the initial capacity $y$, which are solved by devising a way to apply the Representation Theorem. Such devise, new and of interest in its own right, provides the existence of the base capacity $l^{\star}_y(t)$, a positive level which the optimal investment process is shown to become active at. As far as we know the Representation Theorem has never been applied to this extent. In the special case of deterministic coefficients, under a further assumption specific to the scrap value case, a unifying view on the curve at which it is optimal to invest emerges: the base capacity equals the investment boundary ${\hat y}(t)$ obtained by variational methods.</description>

      <title>Optimal consumption under loss-averse multiplicative habit-formation preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.20063v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies a loss-averse version of the multiplicative habit formation preference and the corresponding optimal investment and consumption strategies over an infinite horizon. The agent's consumption preference is depicted by a general S-shaped utility function of her consumption-to-habit ratio. By considering the concave envelope of the S-shaped utility and the associated dual value function, we provide a thorough analysis of the HJB equation for the concavified problem via studying a related nonlinear free boundary problem. Based on established properties of the solution to this free boundary problem, we obtain the optimal consumption and investment policies in feedback form. Some new and technical verification arguments are developed to cope with generality of the utility function. The equivalence between the original problem and the concavified problem readily follows from the structure of the feedback controls. We also discuss some quantitative properties of the optimal policies, complemented by illustrative numerical examples and their financial implications.</description>
