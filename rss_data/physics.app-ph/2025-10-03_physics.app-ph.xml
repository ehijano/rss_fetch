      <title>Tensegrity structures and data-driven analysis for 3d cell mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cytoskeleton (CSK) plays an important role in many cell functions. Given the similarities between the mechanical behavior of tensegrity structures and the CSK, many studies have proposed different tensegrity-based models for simulating cell mechanics. However, the low symmetry of most tensegrity units has hindered the analysis of realistic 3D structures. As a result, tensegrity-based modeling in cell mechanics has been mainly focused on single cells or monolayers. In this paper, we propose a 3D tensegrity model based on the finite element method for simulating 3D cell mechanics. We show that the proposed model not only captures the nonlinearity of a single cell in an indentation test and a monolayer in stretch test but also the non-uniform stress distribution in multicellular spheroids upon non-uniform prestress design. Furthermore, we introduce a multiscale data-driven framework for cellular mechanics to optimize the computation, thus paving the way for modeling the mechanobiology of large cellular assemblies such as organs.</description>

      <title>Experimental Investigation of Skew Wind Effects on Vortex-Induced Vibration of Typical Bridge Decks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the skew wind effects on vortex-induced vibration (VIV) of two typical bridge decks-a closed-box girder and a twin-edge girder-through spring-suspended oblique section model tests. Experiments were conducted at various wind yaw angles and angles of attack. Results indicate that VIV amplitudes and lock-in ranges exhibit a clear variation with yaw angles, rendering the Independence Principle (IP) unsuitable for these configurations. A heave-torsion coupling phenomenon was observed in both heaving and torsional VIV, attributed to the eccentricity of the center of gravity due to asymmetric end segments. A novel numerical algorithm was introduced to correct peak VIV amplitudes for variations in structural mass-damping parameters across yaw angles. The most unfavorable VIV responses occurred under skew wind conditions, with maximum amplitudes increasing by approximately 20.1 percent for heaving VIV and 179.8 percent for torsional VIV in the closed-box girder, and by 3.9 percent for heaving VIV in the twin-edge girder, relative to normal wind conditions.</description>

      <title>Optimal smoothing parameter in Eilers-Wittaker smoother</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Eilers-Whittaker method for data smoothing effectiveness depends on the choice of the regularisation parameter, and automatic selection is a necessity for large datasets. Common methods, such as leave-one-out cross-validation, can perform poorly when serially correlated noise is present. We propose a novel procedure for selecting the control parameter based on the spectral entropy of the residuals. We define an S-curve from the Euclidean distance between points in a plot of the spectral entropy of the residuals versus that of the smoothed signal. The regularisation parameter corresponding to the absolute maximum of this S-curve is chosen as the optimal parameter. Using simulated data, we benchmarked our method against cross-validation and the V-curve. Validation was also performed on diverse experimental data. This robust and straightforward procedure can be a valuable addition to the available selection methods for the Eilers smoother.</description>

      <title>A rechargeable AA battery supporting Qi wireless charging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09852v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wireless power transfer is one of the key drivers in modern consumer electronics, as it allows one to enhance the convenience and usability of many devices. However, in most cases, wireless charging is accessible only to devices with incorporated receivers or at least to gadgets with standard charging connectors, such as USB Type-C, that allow to attach an external receiver. We propose a rechargeable battery that has the size and output voltage of a standard AA battery but supports wireless power transfer from charging stations of the widely used Qi standard. The proposed design uses a series resonant circuit with a curved receiving coil, as well as load modulation using detuning capacitors switched by a microcontroller unit to implement a receiver compatible with the Qi Baseline protocol. It also utilizes a number of DC-DC converters to store energy in a Li-ion cell and convert it to the 1.5 V voltage level. Our design is supported by numerical simulations of magnetic field distributions and scattering parameters of the introduced battery coupled to a planar transmitting coil. The performance of the proposed battery has been studied experimentally, including measurements of the maximal distance between the battery and a charging station that allows wireless charging at various rotation angles and the charge curve. The developed battery design facilitates the addition of wireless charging functionality to a wide range of electronic devices in a universal way.</description>

      <title>Kapitza-Inspired Stabilization of Non-Foster Circuits via Time Modulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12976v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With his formal analysis in 1951, the physicist Pyotr Kapitza demonstrated that an inverted pendulum with an externally vibrating base can be stable in its upper position, thus overcoming the force of gravity. Kapitza's work is an example that an originally unstable system can become stable after a minor perturbation of its properties or initial conditions is applied. Inspired by his ideas, we show how non-Foster circuits can be stabilized with the application of external \textit{electrical vibration}, i.e., time modulations. Non-Foster circuits are highly appreciated in the engineering community since their bandwidth characteristics are not limited by passive-circuits bounds. Unfortunately, non-Foster circuits are usually unstable and they must be stabilized prior to operation. Here, we focus on the study of non-Foster $L(t)C$ circuits with time-varying inductors and time-invariant negative capacitors. We find an intrinsic connection between Kapitza's inverted pendulum and non-Foster $L(t)C$ resonators. Moreover, we show how positive time-varying modulations of $L(t)&gt;0$ can overcome and stabilize non-Foster negative capacitances $C&lt;0$. These findings open up an alternative manner of stabilizing electric circuits with the use of time modulations, and lay the groundwork for application of, what we coin \textit{Vibrational Electromagnetics}, in more complex media.</description>

      <title>Photonic crystal cavities based on suspended yttrium iron garnet nanobeams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05361v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the fabrication and optical characterization of an air-suspended photonic crystal nanobeam cavity in yttrium-iron-garnet (YIG) realized by focused-ion-beam milling. YIG's combination of low optical loss and ferrimagnetism makes it highly attractive for quantum technologies, yet prior work has largely been focused on millimeter-scale spheres and simple microstructures, hindering true on-chip integration. Demonstrating nanometer-scale patterning in a suspended geometry therefore represents an important advance. Finite-element simulations predict that the same structure supports a flapping-type mechanical mode at $\Omega / 2\pi \approx 1.52 \,\text{GHz}$ and a backward-volume spin-wave mode at $\Omega / 2\pi = 11.59 \,\text{GHz}$ under an in-plane bias field. Although we measure only the photonic resonance (intrinsic $Q \sim 2 \times 10^{3}$) in this study, the device lays the groundwork for future exploration of coupled photon-phonon-magnon dynamics once higher optical quality factors are achieved.</description>

      <title>Modeling electrothermal feedback of superconducting nanowire single photon detectors in SPICE</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02791v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) exhibit complex switching behaviors due to electrothermal feedback during the detection process. Modeling and understanding these behaviors is integral for designing superconducting devices; however, many models often prioritize accuracy over computational speed and intuitive integration for circuit designers. Here, we build upon a growing architecture of SPICE tools for superconducting nanowire devices by capturing complex residual heating effects in a compact thermal model of an SNSPD. We demonstrate that our model is comparable to more complicated thermal models of superconducting nanowire devices, including finite-element simulations, and is applicable for the fast development of SNSPD circuits.</description>

      <title>A modular framework for collaborative human-AI, multi-modal and multi-beamline synchrotron experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22959v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-throughput materials discovery and studies of complex functional materials increasingly rely on multi-modal characterization performed at synchrotron light sources. However, measurements are typically done with no use of data until after an experiment, neglecting opportunities for data-driven insights to guide measurements. We developed a modular, open-source framework that incorporates artificial intelligence within the Bluesky control and data streaming infrastructure at NSLS-II, enabling real-time orchestration of multi-beamline, multi-modal experiments. AI agents perform on-the-fly reduction, clustering, Gaussian process modelling, and Bayesian optimization driven data acquisition, while users monitor agent behavior and visualize results live. Combinatorial libraries of the ternary Al-Ni-Pt system were spatially mapped by X-ray diffraction and X-ray absorption fine structure measurements at the PDF and BMM beamlines, respectively. Dynamic switching between AI-driven and conventional grid mapping strategies was achieved, demonstrating the flexible workflows possible through this framework. A digital twin constructed from a simulated Al-Li-Fe oxide dataset shows that AI-driven mapping strategies outperform conventional mapping as well as random sampling by prioritizing measurements that better resolve both phase boundaries and localized minority phases. This framework supports plug-and-play capabilities, and establishes a foundation for routine multi-modal, AI-assisted large-scale user-facility operations.</description>

      <title>Coupled micro-resonators for second-order integrated nonlinear optics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14959v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate second-order nonlinear processes in a system of two coupled identical optical micro-resonators. The double resonance and phase-matching conditions are simultaneously obtained thanks to the frequency splitting induced by the resonator coupling. The analysis made in the framework of the coupled mode theory is applied to the second harmonic generation process in two whispering gallery mode microdisks made in III-V materials.</description>

      <title>3-dimensional plasmonic nanomotors enabled by independent integration of Optical Pulling and Lateral Forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16811v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Light-matter interactions generally involve momentum exchange between incident photons and the target object giving rise to optical forces and torques. While typically weak, they become significant at the nanoscale, driving intense research interest in the exploitation of photon recoil to drive micro- and nanostructures. While great progress has been attained in controlling transversal degrees of freedom, three-dimensional movement remains challenging, particularly due to the impractical realization of pulling forces that oppose the direction of incident light. Here we theoretically present a novel nanomotor design that enables independent control over both transverse and longitudinal motion. This design exploits coupling between an azimuthally polarized Bessel beam and a dielectric glass cylinder to realistically achieve optical pulling forces. At the same time, asymmetric plasmonic dimers, embedded within the cylinder, provide lateral motion, through asymmetric scattering under plane wave illumination. We further demonstrate that unwanted displacements and rotations can be restrained, even at long illumination times. Our design unlocks a new degree of freedom in motion control, allowing for pulling, pushing, and lateral movement by simply tuning the polarization or switching between plane waves and Bessel beams.</description>
