      <title>Spatiotemporal Diffusion Metamaterials: Theories and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion metamaterials with artificial spatial structures have significant potential in controlling energy and mass transfer. Those static structures may lead to functionality and tunability constraints, impeding the application scope of diffusion metamaterials. Dynamic structures, adding the temporal dimension, have recently provided a new possibility for electric charge and heat diffusion regulation. This perspective introduces the fundamental theories and practical constructions of spatiotemporal diffusion metamaterials for achieving nonreciprocal, topological, or tunable properties. Compared with traditional static design, spatiotemporal modulation is promising to manipulate diffusion processes dynamically, with applications of real-time thermal coding and programming. Existing spatiotemporal diffusion explorations are primarily at macroscopic systems, and we may envision extending these results to microscale and other physical domains like thermal radiation and mass diffusion shortly.</description>

      <title>Silicon-integrated scandium-doped aluminum nitride electro-optic modulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scandium-doped aluminum nitride (AlScN) with an asymmetric hexagonal wurtzite structure exhibits enhanced second-order nonlinear and piezoelectric properties compared to aluminum nitride (AlN), while maintaining a relatively large bandgap. It provides a promising platform for photonic integration and facilitates the seamless integration of passive and active functional devices. Here, we present the design, fabrication, and characterization of AlScN EO micro-ring modulators, introducing active functionalities to the chip-scale AlScN platform. These waveguide-integrated EO modulators employ sputtered AlScN thin films as the light-guiding medium, and the entire fabrication process is compatible with complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology. We characterize the high-frequency performance of an AlScN modulator for the first time, extracting a maximum in-device effective EO coefficient of 2.86 pm/V at 12 GHz. The devices show a minimum half-wave voltage-length product of 3.12 V*cm and a 3-dB modulation bandwidth of approximately 22 GHz. Our work provides a promising modulation scheme for cost-effective silicon-integrated photonics systems.</description>

      <title>Multipacting mitigation by atomic layer deposition: the case study of Titanium Nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the use of Atomic Layer deposition (ALD) to mitigate multipacting phenomena inside superconducting radio frequency (SRF) cavities used in particle accelerators. The unique ALD capability to control the film thickness down to the atomic level on arbitrary complex shape objects enable the fine tuning of TiN film resistivity and total electron emission yield (TEEY) from coupons to devices. This level of control allows us to adequately choose a TiN film thickness that provide both a high resistivity to prevent Ohmic losses and low TEEY to mitigate multipacting for the application of interest. The methodology presented in this work can be scaled to other domain and devices subject to RF fields in vacuum and sensitive to multipacting or electron discharge processes with their own requirements in resistivities and TEEY values</description>

      <title>Gemini &amp; Physical World: Large Language Models Can Estimate the Intensity of Earthquake Shaking from Multi-Modal Social Media Posts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for estimating the ground shaking intensity using social media data and CCTV footage. Employing the Gemini Pro (Reid et al. 2024) model, a multi-modal language model, we demonstrate the ability to extract relevant information from unstructured data utilizing generative AI and natural language processing. The model output, in the form of Modified Mercalli Intensity (MMI) values, align well with independent observational data. Furthermore, our results suggest that beyond its advanced visual and auditory understanding abilities, Gemini appears to utilize additional sources of knowledge, including a simplified understanding of the general relationship between earthquake magnitude, distance, and MMI intensity, which it presumably acquired during its training, in its reasoning and decision-making processes. These findings raise intriguing questions about the extent of Gemini's general understanding of the physical world and its phenomena. The ability of Gemini to generate results consistent with established scientific knowledge highlights the potential of LLMs like Gemini in augmenting our understanding of complex physical phenomena such as earthquakes. More specifically, the results of this study highlight the potential of LLMs like Gemini to revolutionize citizen seismology by enabling rapid, effective, and flexible analysis of crowdsourced data from eyewitness accounts for assessing earthquake impact and providing crisis situational awareness. This approach holds great promise for improving early warning systems, disaster response, and overall resilience in earthquake-prone regions. This study provides a significant step toward harnessing the power of social media and AI for earthquake disaster mitigation.</description>

      <title>2D hydrodynamic simulation of TeraFETs beyond the gradual-channel approximation for transient, large-signal or ultrahigh-frequency simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the past decade, detection of THz radiation by plasma-wave-assisted frequency mixing in antenna-coupled field-effect transistors (TeraFETs) -- implemented in various semiconductor material systems (Si CMOS, GaN/AlGaN, GaAs/AlGaAs, graphene, etc.) -- has matured and led to a practically applied detector technology. This has been supported by the development of powerful device simulation tools which take into account relevant collective carrier dynamics and mixing processes in various approximations. These tools mostly model carrier transport in 1D and they are usually geared towards continuous-wave illumination of the device and small-signal response. Depending on their implementation, it may not be possible readily to simulate large-signal and pulsed operation. Another approximation which may lead to unsatisfactory results is the 1D restriction to calculate only the longitudinal electric field components. Especially at the edges of the gate electrode, solving of the 2D Poisson equation promises better results. This contribution introduces a stable way to solve the 2D Poisson equation self-consistently with the hydrodynamic transport equations including the numerically challenging convection term. We employ a well-balanced approximate Harten-Lax-van-Leer-Contact Riemann solver. The approach is well suited for a future treatment of transient and large-signal cases as well as the Dyakonov-Shur instability. The 2D treatment also generically extends the model beyond the gradual-channel approximation and allows to calculate the FET's response at high THz frequencies where the gate-to-channel potential acquires a non-local character. Model calculations are performed for the exemplary case of a 65-nm Si CMOS TeraFET in the isothermal approximation.</description>

      <title>Inverse Design of Promising Alloys for Electrocatalytic CO$_2$ Reduction via Generative Graph Neural Networks Combined with Bird Swarm Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Directly generating material structures with optimal properties is a long-standing goal in material design. One of the fundamental challenges lies in how to overcome the limitation of traditional generative models to efficiently explore the global chemical space rather than a small localized space. Herein, we develop a framework named MAGECS to address this dilemma, by integrating the bird swarm algorithm and supervised graph neural network to effectively navigate the generative model in the immense chemical space towards materials with target properties. As a demonstration, MAGECS is applied to design compelling alloy electrocatalysts for CO$_2$ reduction reaction (CO$_2$RR) and works extremely well. Specifically, the chemical space of CO$_2$RR is effectively explored, where over 250,000 promising structures with high activity have been generated and notably, the proportion of desired structures is 2.5-fold increased. Moreover, five predicted alloys, i.e., CuAl, AlPd, Sn$_2$Pd$_5$, Sn$_9$Pd$_7$, and CuAlSe$_2$ are successfully synthesized and characterized experimentally, two of which exhibit about 90% Faraday efficiency of CO$_2$RR, and CuAl achieved 76% efficiency for C$_2$ products. This pioneering application of inverse design in CO$_2$RR catalysis showcases the potential of MAGECS to dramatically accelerate the development of functional materials, paving the way for fully automated, artificial intelligence-driven material design.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a technique for integrating ultraclean carbon nanotubes into superconducting circuits, aiming to realize Josephson junctions based on one-dimensional elementary quantum conductors. This technique primarily involves depositing the nanotube in the final step, thus preserving it from the inherent contaminations of nanofabrication and maintaining contact solely with superconducting electrodes and a crystalline hBN substrate. Through transport measurements performed in both the normal and superconducting states, we demonstrate that our method yields high-quality junctions with Josephson energies suitable for quantum device applications, such as carbon nanotube-based superconducting qubits.</description>

      <title>Tunnel Junction-Enabled Monolithically Integrated GaN Micro-Light Emitting Transistor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05095v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: GaN/InGaN microLEDs are a very promising technology for next generation displays. Switching control transistors and their integration are key components in achieving high-performance, efficient displays. Monolithic integration of microLEDs with GaN switching devices provides an opportunity to control microLED output power with capacitive (voltage) control rather than current controlled schemes. This approach can greatly reduce system complexity for the driver circuit arrays while maintaining device opto-electronic performance. In this work, we demonstrate a 3-terminal GaN micro-light emitting transistor that combines a GaN/InGaN blue tunneling-based microLED with a GaN n-channel FET. The integrated device exhibits excellent gate control, drain current control and optical emission control. This work provides a promising pathway for future monolithic integration of GaN FETs with microLED to enable fast switching high efficiency microLED display and communication systems.</description>

      <title>A Neural Network Transformer Model for Composite Microstructure Homogenization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.07877v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Heterogeneity and uncertainty in a composite microstructure lead to either computational bottlenecks if modeled rigorously or to solution inaccuracies in the stress field and failure predictions if approximated. Although methods suitable for analyzing arbitrary and non-linear microstructures exist, their computational cost makes them impractical to use in large-scale structural analysis. Surrogate models or Reduced Order Models (ROMs) commonly enhance efficiencies but are typically calibrated with a single microstructure. Homogenization methods, such as the Mori-Tanaka method, offer rapid homogenization for a wide range of constituent properties. However, simplifying assumptions, like stress and strain averaging in phases, render the consideration of both deterministic and stochastic variations in microstructure infeasible. This paper illustrates a transformer neural network architecture that captures the knowledge of various microstructures and constituents, enabling it to function as a computationally efficient homogenization surrogate model. Given an image or an abstraction of an arbitrary composite microstructure of linearly elastic fibers in an elastoplastic matrix, the transformer network predicts the history-dependent, non-linear, and homogenized stress-strain response. Two methods for encoding microstructure features were tested: calculating two-point statistics using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and employing an autoencoder with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Both methods accurately predict the homogenized material response. The developed transformer neural network offers an efficient means for microstructure-to-property translation, generalizable and extendable to a variety of microstructures. The paper describes the network architecture, training and testing data generation, and performance under cycling and random loadings.</description>

      <title>Bound State in the Continuum Supported Asymmetric Dome-shaped Dielectric Metasurface: Crossing and Avoided Crossing of Transmission with Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00422v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work examines a symmetry-protected bound state in the continuum (BIC) supported unique all-dielectric dome-shaped metasurface (MS). The simple unit MS is made up of four dome-shaped nanobars of silicon in the top layer and silica glass as the substrate. Two strong transmission dips denoted as an electric dipole (ED) and magnetic dipole (MD) quasi-BIC with a high Q-factor that surpasses the value of 104 are observed after the symmetry between the nanobars is broken by a small angle from their initial position. A crossover between the ED and MD resonances is noticed when the periodicity of the MS is changed in the y direction. In addition, transmission spectra show the avoided-crossing phenomenon of dipole quasi-BIC resonances when the superstrate's refractive index (RI) is reduced from its initial value. Other widely used dielectric materials are additionally employed in dome-shaped nanobars to evaluate their performances in terms of sharpness and near-zero transmission. Moreover, Other forms of symmetry breakdown such as diagonal width and length asymmetry have been investigated for their impact on the Q-factor. Finally, we have demonstrated two significant applications, including refractometric glucose sensing and third harmonic generation (THG). Our dome-shaped MS is roughly 300 times more efficient at generating third harmonics than a flat rectangular silicon film MS. Our proposed BIC and q-BIC-facilitated MS may provide a method for enhancing the functionality of biological sensors, multimodal lasing, optical switches, and nonlinear optics.</description>
