      <title>Aligned Better, Listen Better for Audio-Visual Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Audio is essential for multimodal video understanding. On the one hand, video inherently contains audio, which supplies complementary information to vision. Besides, video large language models (Video-LLMs) can encounter many audio-centric settings. However, existing Video-LLMs and Audio-Visual Large Language Models (AV-LLMs) exhibit deficiencies in exploiting audio information, leading to weak understanding and hallucinations. To solve the issues, we delve into the model architecture and dataset. (1) From the architectural perspective, we propose a fine-grained AV-LLM, namely Dolphin. The concurrent alignment of audio and visual modalities in both temporal and spatial dimensions ensures a comprehensive and accurate understanding of videos. Specifically, we devise an audio-visual multi-scale adapter for multi-scale information aggregation, which achieves spatial alignment. For temporal alignment, we propose audio-visual interleaved merging. (2) From the dataset perspective, we curate an audio-visual caption and instruction-tuning dataset, called AVU. It comprises 5.2 million diverse, open-ended data tuples (video, audio, question, answer) and introduces a novel data partitioning strategy. Extensive experiments show our model not only achieves remarkable performance in audio-visual understanding, but also mitigates potential hallucinations.</description>

      <title>Causal Self-supervised Pretrained Frontend with Predictive Code for Speech Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech separation (SS) seeks to disentangle a multi-talker speech mixture into single-talker speech streams. Although SS can be generally achieved using offline methods, such a processing paradigm is not suitable for real-time streaming applications. Causal separation models, which rely only on past and present information, offer a promising solution for real-time streaming. However, these models typically suffer from notable performance degradation due to the absence of future context. In this paper, we introduce a novel frontend that is designed to mitigate the mismatch between training and run-time inference by implicitly incorporating future information into causal models through predictive patterns. The pretrained frontend employs a transformer decoder network with a causal convolutional encoder as the backbone and is pretrained in a self-supervised manner with two innovative pretext tasks: autoregressive hybrid prediction and contextual knowledge distillation. These tasks enable the model to capture predictive patterns directly from mixtures in a self-supervised manner. The pretrained frontend subsequently serves as a feature extractor to generate high-quality predictive patterns. Comprehensive evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets validated the effectiveness of the proposed pretrained frontend.</description>

      <title>VoiceCraft-Dub: Automated Video Dubbing with Neural Codec Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present VoiceCraft-Dub, a novel approach for automated video dubbing that synthesizes high-quality speech from text and facial cues. This task has broad applications in filmmaking, multimedia creation, and assisting voice-impaired individuals. Building on the success of Neural Codec Language Models (NCLMs) for speech synthesis, our method extends their capabilities by incorporating video features, ensuring that synthesized speech is time-synchronized and expressively aligned with facial movements while preserving natural prosody. To inject visual cues, we design adapters to align facial features with the NCLM token space and introduce audio-visual fusion layers to merge audio-visual information within the NCLM framework. Additionally, we curate CelebV-Dub, a new dataset of expressive, real-world videos specifically designed for automated video dubbing. Extensive experiments show that our model achieves high-quality, intelligible, and natural speech synthesis with accurate lip synchronization, outperforming existing methods in human perception and performing favorably in objective evaluations. We also adapt VoiceCraft-Dub for the video-to-speech task, demonstrating its versatility for various applications.</description>

      <title>Scaling Analysis of Interleaved Speech-Text Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing Speech Language Model (SLM) scaling analysis paints a bleak picture. They predict that SLMs require much more compute and data compared to text, leading some to question the feasibility of training high-quality SLMs. However, modern SLMs are often initialised from pre-trained TextLMs using speech-text interleaving to allow knowledge transfer. This raises the question - Do interleaved SLMs scale more efficiently than textless-SLMs? In this paper we answer a resounding, yes! We conduct scaling analysis of interleaved SLMs by training several dozen and analysing the scaling trends. We see that under this setup SLMs scale more efficiently with compute. Additionally, our results indicate that the scaling-dynamics are significantly different than textless-SLMs, suggesting one should allocate notably more of the compute budget for increasing model size over training tokens. We also study the role of synthetic data and TextLM model families in unlocking this potential. Results suggest, that our scaled up model achieves comparable performance with leading models on speech semantic metrics while using less compute and data than other approaches. We open source models, samples, and data - https://pages.cs.huji.ac.il/adiyoss-lab/sims.</description>

      <title>EvMic: Event-based Non-contact sound recovery from effective spatial-temporal modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When sound waves hit an object, they induce vibrations that produce high-frequency and subtle visual changes, which can be used for recovering the sound. Early studies always encounter trade-offs related to sampling rate, bandwidth, field of view, and the simplicity of the optical path. Recent advances in event camera hardware show good potential for its application in visual sound recovery, because of its superior ability in capturing high-frequency signals. However, existing event-based vibration recovery methods are still sub-optimal for sound recovery. In this work, we propose a novel pipeline for non-contact sound recovery, fully utilizing spatial-temporal information from the event stream. We first generate a large training set using a novel simulation pipeline. Then we designed a network that leverages the sparsity of events to capture spatial information and uses Mamba to model long-term temporal information. Lastly, we train a spatial aggregation block to aggregate information from different locations to further improve signal quality. To capture event signals caused by sound waves, we also designed an imaging system using a laser matrix to enhance the gradient and collected multiple data sequences for testing. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</description>

      <title>F5R-TTS: Improving Flow Matching based Text-to-Speech with Group Relative Policy Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present F5R-TTS, a novel text-to-speech (TTS) system that integrates Gradient Reward Policy Optimization (GRPO) into a flow-matching based architecture. By reformulating the deterministic outputs of flow-matching TTS into probabilistic Gaussian distributions, our approach enables seamless integration of reinforcement learning algorithms. During pretraining, we train a probabilistically reformulated flow-matching based model which is derived from F5-TTS with an open-source dataset. In the subsequent reinforcement learning (RL) phase, we employ a GRPO-driven enhancement stage that leverages dual reward metrics: word error rate (WER) computed via automatic speech recognition and speaker similarity (SIM) assessed by verification models. Experimental results on zero-shot voice cloning demonstrate that F5R-TTS achieves significant improvements in both speech intelligibility (relatively 29.5\% WER reduction) and speaker similarity (relatively 4.6\% SIM score increase) compared to conventional flow-matching based TTS systems. Audio samples are available at https://frontierlabs.github.io/F5R.</description>

      <title>Deep learning for music generation. Four approaches and their comparative evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces four different artificial intelligence algorithms for music generation and aims to compare these methods not only based on the aesthetic quality of the generated music but also on their suitability for specific applications. The first set of melodies is produced by a slightly modified visual transformer neural network that is used as a language model. The second set of melodies is generated by combining chat sonification with a classic transformer neural network (the same method of music generation is presented in a previous research), the third set of melodies is generated by combining the Schillinger rhythm theory together with a classic transformer neural network, and the fourth set of melodies is generated using GPT3 transformer provided by OpenAI. A comparative analysis is performed on the melodies generated by these approaches and the results indicate that significant differences can be observed between them and regarding the aesthetic value of them, GPT3 produced the most pleasing melodies, and the newly introduced Schillinger method proved to generate better sounding music than previous sonification methods.</description>

      <title>LinTO Audio and Textual Datasets to Train and Evaluate Automatic Speech Recognition in Tunisian Arabic Dialect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Developing Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems for Tunisian Arabic Dialect is challenging due to the dialect's linguistic complexity and the scarcity of annotated speech datasets. To address these challenges, we propose the LinTO audio and textual datasets -- comprehensive resources that capture phonological and lexical features of Tunisian Arabic Dialect. These datasets include a variety of texts from numerous sources and real-world audio samples featuring diverse speakers and code-switching between Tunisian Arabic Dialect and English or French. By providing high-quality audio paired with precise transcriptions, the LinTO audio and textual datasets aim to provide qualitative material to build and benchmark ASR systems for the Tunisian Arabic Dialect.

      <title>Ichigo: Mixed-Modal Early-Fusion Realtime Voice Assistant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15316v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing, but their application to speech-based tasks remains challenging due to the complexities of integrating audio and text modalities. This paper introduces Ichigo, a mixed-modal model that seamlessly processes interleaved sequences of speech and text. Utilizing a tokenized early-fusion approach, Ichigo quantizes speech into discrete tokens and employs a uniform transformer-based architecture for both speech and text modalities. This method enables joint reasoning and generation across modalities without the need for separate adapters. We present a comprehensive training methodology, including pre-training on multilingual speech recognition datasets and fine-tuning on a curated instruction dataset. Ichigo demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on speech question-answering benchmarks, outperforming existing open-source speech language models and achieving comparable results to cascaded systems. Notably, Ichigo exhibits a latency of just 111 ms to first token generation, significantly lower than current models. Our approach not only advances the field of multimodal AI but also provides a framework for smaller research teams to contribute effectively to open-source speech-language models.</description>

      <title>TSPE: Task-Specific Prompt Ensemble for Improved Zero-Shot Audio Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00398v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Audio-language models (ALMs) excel in zero-shot audio classification, a task where models classify previously unseen audio clips at test time by leveraging descriptive natural language prompts. We introduce TSPE (Task-Specific Prompt Ensemble), a simple, training-free hard prompting method that boosts ALEs' zero-shot performance by customizing prompts for diverse audio classification tasks. Rather than using generic template-based prompts like "Sound of a car" we generate context-rich prompts, such as "Sound of a car coming from a tunnel". Specifically, we leverage label information to identify suitable sound attributes, such as "loud" and "feeble", and appropriate sound sources, such as "tunnel" and "street" and incorporate this information into the prompts used by Audio-Language Models (ALMs) for audio classification. Further, to enhance audio-text alignment, we perform prompt ensemble across TSPE-generated task-specific prompts. When evaluated on 12 diverse audio classification datasets, TSPE improves performance across ALMs by showing an absolute improvement of 1.23-16.36% over vanilla zero-shot evaluation.</description>
