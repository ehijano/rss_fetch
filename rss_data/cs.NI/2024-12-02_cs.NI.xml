      <title>Geospatial sustainability assessment of universal Fiber-To-The-Neighborhood (FTTnb) broadband infrastructure strategies for Sub-Saharan Africa</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Broadband Internet access is an important way to help achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. Currently, fixed fiber infrastructure is essential for providing universal broadband, but has received relatively little research attention in low-income countries compared to other more cost-efficient wireless technologies. Yet, pushing out fiber broadband network to local areas is essential, even if the final access network is still wireless. Here, we design least-cost Fiber-To-The-Neighborhood (FTTnb) architectures using two spatial optimization Steiner Tree algorithms to jointly determine investment costs, environmental emissions, and Social Carbon Costs. We find that the average annualized per user emissions in low population density areas (&lt;9 people per km2) range from 0.18-9.6 kg CO2 eq./user, compared to 0.015-0.12 kg CO2 eq./user for high population density areas (&gt;958 people per km2). Moreover, Annualized Total Cost of Ownership per user is 12-90 times lower in high population density areas (&gt;958 people per km2) compared to sparsely populated regions (&lt;9 people per km2). Thus, 48% (about 550 million) of the total Sub-Saharan African population live in areas where FTTnb is viable within the next ten years.</description>

      <title>Perspectives on 6G Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mobile communications have been undergoing a generational change every ten years. While 5G network deployments are maturing, significant efforts are being made to standardize 6G, which is expected to be commercially introduced by 2030. This paper provides unique perspectives on the 6G network (radio and core) architecture(s) from the anticipated 6G use cases to meet the necessary performance requirements. To cater for the key 6G use cases, the 6G architecture must integrate different network-level functions in a multiplicity of virtual cloud environments, leveraging the advancements of distributed processing, artificial intelligence, and securely integrating different sub-networks e.g., terrestrial, and non-terrestrial networks into the overall 6G network. This paper characterizes the impact of 6G architectures from a deployment perspective with backwards compatibility in mind.</description>

      <title>ReputeStream: Mitigating Free-Riding through Reputation-Based Multi-Layer P2P Live Streaming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel algorithm for peer-to-peer (P2P) live streaming that addresses the limitations of single-layer systems through a multi-layered approach. The proposed solution adapts to diverse user capabilities and bandwidth conditions while tackling common P2P challenges such as free-riding, malicious behavior, churn, and flash crowds. By implementing a reputation-based system, the algorithm promotes fair resource sharing and active participation. The algorithm also incorporates a request-to-join mechanism to effectively manage flash crowds. In addition, a dynamic reputation system improves network efficiency by strategically positioning high-reputation peers closer to video sources or other significant contributors.</description>

      <title>Towards an Implementation of the Knowledge-Based Control Plane for Intelligent Swarm Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes the possibility of integrating Dynamic Knowledge Graph (DKG) with Software-Defined Networking (SDN). This new approach aims to assist the management and control capabilities of the swarm network. The DKG works as a unified network data view, capturing network information such as topology, flow rules, host information, switch information, link status, and in-band network telemetry (INT) data. Benefited from the deep programmability of SDN, the network information can be converted into RDF format constantly, and the DKG will be dynamically updated. This approach helps the network operators to control their network infrastructure, such as allocating resource effectively and decision making at the application layer. Potential use cases demonstrate the applicability and advantages of the proposed approach. Examples include access control in swarm network scenarios and applying adaptive routing strategies, etc. These use cases illustrate how DKG-based SDN can address swarm network management challenges effectively, optimizing performance and resource utilization.</description>

      <title>RF-3DGS: Wireless Channel Modeling with Radio Radiance Field and 3D Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precisely modeling radio propagation in complex environments has been a significant challenge, especially with the advent of 5G and beyond networks, where managing massive antenna arrays demands more detailed information. Traditional methods, such as empirical models and ray tracing, often fall short, either due to insufficient details or with challenges for real-time applications. Inspired by the newly proposed 3D Gaussian Splatting method in computer vision domain, which outperforms in reconstructing optical radiance fields, we propose RF-3DGS, a novel approach that enables precise site-specific reconstruction of radio radiance fields from sparse samples. RF-3DGS can render spatial spectra at arbitrary positions within 2 ms following a brief 3-minute training period, effectively identifying dominant propagation paths at these locations. Furthermore, RF-3DGS can provide fine-grained Channel State Information (CSI) of these paths, including the angle of departure and delay. Our experiments, calibrated through real-world measurements, demonstrate that RF-3DGS not only significantly improves rendering quality, training speed, and rendering speed compared to state-of-the-art methods but also holds great potential for supporting wireless communication and advanced applications such as Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC).</description>

      <title>Diffusion Models Meet Network Management: Improving Traffic Matrix Analysis with Diffusion-based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to network operation and maintenance relying heavily on network traffic monitoring, traffic matrix analysis has been one of the most crucial issues for network management related tasks. However, it is challenging to reliably obtain the precise measurement in computer networks because of the high measurement cost, and the unavoidable transmission loss. Although some methods proposed in recent years allowed estimating network traffic from partial flow-level or link-level measurements, they often perform poorly for traffic matrix estimation nowadays. Despite strong assumptions like low-rank structure and the prior distribution, existing techniques are usually task-specific and tend to be significantly worse as modern network communication is extremely complicated and dynamic. To address the dilemma, this paper proposed a diffusion-based traffic matrix analysis framework named Diffusion-TM, which leverages problem-agnostic diffusion to notably elevate the estimation performance in both traffic distribution and accuracy. The novel framework not only takes advantage of the powerful generative ability of diffusion models to produce realistic network traffic, but also leverages the denoising process to unbiasedly estimate all end-to-end traffic in a plug-and-play manner under theoretical guarantee. Moreover, taking into account that compiling an intact traffic dataset is usually infeasible, we also propose a two-stage training scheme to make our framework be insensitive to missing values in the dataset. With extensive experiments with real-world datasets, we illustrate the effectiveness of Diffusion-TM on several tasks. Moreover, the results also demonstrate that our method can obtain promising results even with $5\%$ known values left in the datasets.</description>

      <title>Through the Telco Lens: A Countrywide Empirical Study of Cellular Handovers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cellular networks rely on handovers (HOs) as a fundamental element to enable seamless connectivity for mobile users. A comprehensive analysis of HOs can be achieved through data from Mobile Network Operators (MNOs); however, the vast majority of studies employ data from measurement campaigns within confined areas and with limited end-user devices, thereby providing only a partial view of HOs. This paper presents the first countrywide analysis of HO performance, from the perspective of a top-tier MNO in a European country. We collect traffic from approximately 40M users for 4 weeks and study the impact of the radio access technologies (RATs), device types, and manufacturers on HOs across the country. We characterize the geo-temporal dynamics of horizontal (intra-RAT) and vertical (inter-RATs) HOs, at the district level and at millisecond granularity, and leverage open datasets from the country's official census office to associate our findings with the population. We further delve into the frequency, duration, and causes of HO failures, and model them using statistical tools. Our study offers unique insights into mobility management, highlighting the heterogeneity of the network and devices, and their effect on HOs.</description>

      <title>A Lightweight and Scalable Design of Segment Routing in Broadband LEO Constellations Using Landmark-Based Skeleton Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emerging Low Earth Orbit (LEO) broadband constellations hold significant potential to provide advanced Internet services due to inherent geometric features of the grid topology. However, high dynamics, unstable topology changes, and frequent route updates bring significant challenge to fast and adaptive routing policies. In addition, since computing, bandwidth, and storage resources in each LEO satellite is strictly limited, traffic demands are typically unbalanced, further enlarging the challenge to scalable routing policies with load balancing. Nevertheless, most existing research failed to address the above difficulties. Therefore, this paper proposes a lightweight and scalable protocol of segment routing through landmark-based skeleton graphs. To improve the overall performance, we design an efficient multipath segment routing algorithm. First, the algorithm partitions the network into multiple regions to construct skeleton paths, which can effectively guide packet forwarding and reduce the operating costs. In each region, multipath probabilistic routing is used to achieve uniform traffic distribution, avoiding hotspot congestion. Furthermore, the flexible hierarchical partitioning and localized segmented routing is employed for fine-grained traffic control and QoS guarantee combined with adaptive local single-path routing. Finally, experimental results validate our method's superior performance in terms of response time and network utility.</description>

      <title>A PDD-Inspired Channel Estimation Scheme in NOMA Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 5G networks, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) provides a number of benefits by providing uneven power distribution to multiple users at once. On the other hand, effective power allocation, successful successive interference cancellation (SIC), and user fairness all depend on precise channel state information (CSI). Because of dynamic channels, imperfect models, and feedback overhead, CSI prediction in NOMA is difficult. Our aim is to propose a CSI prediction technique based on an ML model that accounts for partially decoded data (PDD), a byproduct of the SIC process. Our proposed technique has been shown to be efficient in handover failure (HOF) prediction and reducing pilot overhead, which is particularly important in 5G. We have shown how machine learning (ML) models may be used to forecast CSI in NOMA handover.</description>

      <title>Challenges and Opportunities for Global Cellular Connectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional cellular service was designed for global connectivity, but business and logistical constraints led to its fragmentation, with deployments limited to individual countries and regions. Initiatives like Mobile Virtual Network Operators (MVNOs), Mobile Network Aggregators (MNAs), and regulations like ''roam-like-at-home'' have partially restored global service potential, though often at high costs in terms of user bills, application performance, and traffic efficiency. This paper makes two key contributions: first, it surveys the global cellular ecosystem, analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of major players using data from prior research, proprietary datasets, and public sources. Second, it argues that the technology for seamless global service exists in Local Breakout (LBO), a roaming architecture which allows user traffic to be routed directly to the Internet through the visited network, bypassing the home network and/or third-party infrastructures. However, LBO adoption is hindered by issues such as policy enforcement, billing, and Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees, rooted in a lack of trust between operators. The paper concludes by exploring technological advances that could enable LBO, and pave the way for truly global cellular connectivity.</description>

      <title>The Streetscape Application Services Stack (SASS): Towards a Distributed Sensing Architecture for Urban Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As urban populations grow, cities are becoming more complex, driving the deployment of interconnected sensing systems to realize the vision of smart cities. These systems aim to improve safety, mobility, and quality of life through applications that integrate diverse sensors with real-time decision-making. Streetscape applications-focusing on challenges like pedestrian safety and adaptive traffic management-depend on managing distributed, heterogeneous sensor data, aligning information across time and space, and enabling real-time processing. These tasks are inherently complex and often difficult to scale. The Streetscape Application Services Stack (SASS) addresses these challenges with three core services: multimodal data synchronization, spatiotemporal data fusion, and distributed edge computing. By structuring these capabilities as clear, composable abstractions with clear semantics, SASS allows developers to scale streetscape applications efficiently while minimizing the complexity of multimodal integration.
  We evaluated SASS in two real-world testbed environments: a controlled parking lot and an urban intersection in a major U.S. city. These testbeds allowed us to test SASS under diverse conditions, demonstrating its practical applicability. The Multimodal Data Synchronization service reduced temporal misalignment errors by 88%, achieving synchronization accuracy within 50 milliseconds. Spatiotemporal Data Fusion service improved detection accuracy for pedestrians and vehicles by over 10%, leveraging multicamera integration. The Distributed Edge Computing service increased system throughput by more than an order of magnitude. Together, these results show how SASS provides the abstractions and performance needed to support real-time, scalable urban applications, bridging the gap between sensing infrastructure and actionable streetscape intelligence.</description>

      <title>Examining quality of DGNSS derived positioning in data in urban city -- A case study of an urban city in India</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GNSS observations are carried out in static mode/ Differential global navigation satellite system (DGNSS) and dynamic mode / Real time Kinematics (RTK) mainly. RTK mode of observation is useful in case of navigation whereas in order to determine very precise positioning, static / DGNSS/ DGPS mode is recommended. In this study, we have examined the quality of DGNSS survey of an urban city in India over ~300 Ground Control Points. Survey is carried out in DGNSS mode with dual frequency mode. All the observations were recorded using GPS, GLONASS , Galileo and Beidu with GDOP values in the range of 1.4 to 2.5. Beidu was used in broadcast ephemeris mode whereas for other constellations, precise orbit ephemeris were obtained from International GNSS service (IGS) site as per the observation day and month. Further, all the data was post processed in the SW suite and positional and vertical accuracies of millimeter to few centimeter level were obtained. This paper describes the approach of Ground Control Point (GCP) identification, surveying, methodology, use of CORS network and data post-processing in order to achieve such a precise accuracies in the urban city.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning for Spectrum Sharing: A Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The 5th generation (5G) of wireless systems is being deployed with the aim to provide many sets of wireless communication services, such as low data rates for a massive amount of devices, broadband, low latency, and industrial wireless access. Such an aim is even more complex in the next generation wireless systems (6G) where wireless connectivity is expected to serve any connected intelligent unit, such as software robots and humans interacting in the metaverse, autonomous vehicles, drones, trains, or smart sensors monitoring cities, buildings, and the environment. Because of the wireless devices will be orders of magnitude denser than in 5G cellular systems, and because of their complex quality of service requirements, the access to the wireless spectrum will have to be appropriately shared to avoid congestion, poor quality of service, or unsatisfactory communication delays. Spectrum sharing methods have been the objective of intense study through model-based approaches, such as optimization or game theories. However, these methods may fail when facing the complexity of the communication environments in 5G, 6G, and beyond. Recently, there has been significant interest in the application and development of data-driven methods, namely machine learning methods, to handle the complex operation of spectrum sharing. In this survey, we provide a complete overview of the state-of-theart of machine learning for spectrum sharing. First, we map the most prominent methods that we encounter in spectrum sharing. Then, we show how these machine learning methods are applied to the numerous dimensions and sub-problems of spectrum sharing, such as spectrum sensing, spectrum allocation, spectrum access, and spectrum handoff. We also highlight several open questions and future trends.</description>

Abstract: Virtual Reality (VR) applications have a number of unique characteristics that set them apart from traditional video streaming. These characteristics have major implications on the design of VR rendering, adaptation, prefetching, caching, and transport mechanisms. This paper contrasts VR to video streaming, stored 2D video streaming in particular, and discusses how to rethink system and network support for VR.</description>

      <title>Fresh Caching of Dynamic Contents using Restless Multi-armed Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12468v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a dynamic content caching problem wherein the contents get updated at a central server, and local copies of a subset of contents are cached at a local cache associated with a Base station (BS). When a content request arrives, based on whether the content is in the local cache, the BS can decide whether to fetch the content from the central server or serve the cached version from the local cache. Fetching a content incurs a fixed fetching cost, and serving the cached version incurs an ageing cost proportional to the age-of-version (AoV) of the content. The BS has only partial information regarding AoVs of the contents. We formulate an optimal content fetching and caching problem to minimize the average cost subject to cache capacity constraints. The problem suffers from the curse of dimensionality and is provably hard to solve. We formulate this problem as a continuous time restless multi-armed bandit process (RMAB), where a single content problem of the corresponding RMAB is a partially observable Markov decision process. We reformulate the single content problem as a semi-Markov decision process, prove indexability, and provide a Whittle index based solution to this problem. Finally, we compare the performance with recent work and show that our proposed policy is optimal via simulations.</description>

      <title>Exploring QUIC Dynamics: A Large-Scale Dataset for Encrypted Traffic Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03728v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: QUIC, an increasingly adopted transport protocol, addresses limitations of TCP by offering improved security, performance, and features such as stream multiplexing and connection migration. However, these enhancements also introduce challenges for network operators in monitoring and analyzing web traffic, especially due to QUIC's encryption. Existing datasets are inadequate they are often outdated, lack diversity, anonymize critical information, or exclude essential features like SSL keys-limiting comprehensive research and development in this area. We introduce VisQUIC, a publicly available dataset of over 100,000 labeled QUIC traces with corresponding SSL keys, collected from more than 40,000 websites over four months. By generating visual representations of the traces, we facilitate advanced machine learning (ML) applications and in-depth analysis of encrypted QUIC traffic. To demonstrate the dataset's potential, we estimate the number of HTTP3 request-response pairs in a QUIC connection using only encrypted traffic, achieving up to 92% accuracy. This estimation provides insights into server behavior, client-server interactions, and connection load-crucial for tasks like load balancing and intrusion detection. Our dataset enables comprehensive studies on QUIC and HTTP/3 protocols and supports the development of tools for encrypted traffic analysis.</description>

      <title>DID Link: Authentication in TLS with Decentralized Identifiers and Verifiable Credentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07533v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Authentication in TLS is predominately carried out with X.509 digital certificates issued by certificate authorities (CA). The centralized nature of current public key infrastructures, however, comes along with severe risks, such as single points of failure and susceptibility to cyber-attacks, potentially undermining the security and trustworthiness of the entire system. With Decentralized Identifiers (DID) alongside distributed ledger technology, it becomes technically feasible to prove ownership of a unique identifier without requiring an attestation of the proof's public key by a centralized and therefore vulnerable CA. This article presents DID Link, a novel authentication scheme for TLS 1.3 that empowers entities to authenticate in a TLS-compliant way with self-issued X.509 certificates that are equipped with ledger-anchored DIDs instead of CA-issued identifiers. It facilitates the exchange of tamper-proof and 3rd-party attested claims in the form of DID-bound Verifiable Credentials after the TLS handshake to complete the authentication with a full identification of the communication partner. A prototypical implementation shows comparable TLS handshake durations of DID Link if verification material is cached and reasonable prolongations if it is obtained from a ledger. The significant speed improvement of the resulting TLS channel over a widely used, DID-based alternative transport protocol on the application layer demonstrates the potential of DID Link to become a viable solution for the establishment of secure and trustful end-to-end communication links with decentrally managed digital identities.</description>

      <title>An open source Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning Routing Simulator for satellite networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11047v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces an open source simulator for packet routing in Low Earth Orbit Satellite Constellations (LSatCs) considering the dynamic system uncertainties. The simulator, implemented in Python, supports traditional Dijkstra's based routing as well as more advanced learning solutions, specifically Q-Routing and Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MA-DRL) from our previous work. It uses an event-based approach with the SimPy module to accurately simulate packet creation, routing and queuing, providing real-time tracking of queues and latency. The simulator is highly configurable, allowing adjustments in routing policies, traffic, ground and space layer topologies, communication parameters, and learning hyperparameters. Key features include the ability to visualize system motion and track packet paths. Results highlight significant improvements in end-to-end (E2E) latency using Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based routing policies compared to traditional methods. The source code, the documentation and a Jupyter notebook with post-processing results and analysis are available on GitHub.</description>
