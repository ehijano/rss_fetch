      <title>Semantical Analysis of Intuitionistic Modal Logics between CK and IK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intuitionistic modal logics considered between Constructive K (CK) and Intuitionistic K (IK) differ in their treatment of the possibility (diamond) connective. It was recently rediscovered that some logics between CK and IK also disagree on their diamond-free fragments, with only some remaining conservative over the standard axiomatisation of intuitionistic modal logic with necessity (box) alone. We show that relational Kripke semantics for CK can be extended with frame conditions for all axioms in the standard axiomatisation of IK, as well as other axioms previously studied. This allows us to answer open questions about the (non-)conservativity of such logics over intuitionistic modal logic without diamond. Our results are formalised using the Coq Proof Assistant.</description>

      <title>Formal Ethical Obligations in Reinforcement Learning Agents: Verification and Policy Updates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When designing agents for operation in uncertain environments, designers need tools to automatically reason about what agents ought to do, how that conflicts with what is actually happening, and how a policy might be modified to remove the conflict. These obligations include ethical and social obligations, permissions and prohibitions, which constrain how the agent achieves its mission and executes its policy. We propose a new deontic logic, Expected Act Utilitarian deontic logic, for enabling this reasoning at design time: for specifying and verifying the agent's strategic obligations, then modifying its policy from a reference policy to meet those obligations. Unlike approaches that work at the reward level, working at the logical level increases the transparency of the trade-offs. We introduce two algorithms: one for model-checking whether an RL agent has the right strategic obligations, and one for modifying a reference decision policy to make it meet obligations expressed in our logic. We illustrate our algorithms on DAC-MDPs which accurately abstract neural decision policies, and on toy gridworld environments.</description>

      <title>Computer-assisted proofs for Lyapunov stability via Sums of Squares certificates and Constructive Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.09884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2006.09884v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a computer-assisted approach to ensure that a given continuous or discrete-time polynomial system is (asymptotically) stable. Our framework relies on constructive analysis together with formally certified sums of squares Lyapunov functions. The crucial steps are formalized within of the proof assistant Minlog. We illustrate our approach with various examples issued from the control system literature.</description>

      <title>$\Pi_{2}$-Rule Systems and Inductive Classes of G\"{o}del Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07189v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we present a general theory of $\Pi_{2}$-rules for systems of intuitionistic and modal logic. We introduce the notions of $\Pi_{2}$-rule system and of an Inductive Class, and provide model-theoretic and algebraic completeness theorems, which serve as our basic tools. As an illustration of the general theory, we analyse the structure of inductive classes of G\"{o}del algebras, from a structure theoretic and logical point of view. We show that unlike other well-studied settings (such as logics, or single-conclusion rule systems), there are continuum many $\Pi_{2}$-rule systems extending $\mathsf{LC}=\mathsf{IPC}+(p\rightarrow q)\vee (q\rightarrow p)$, and show how our methods allow easy proofs of the admissibility of the well-known Takeuti-Titani rule. Our final results concern general questions admissibility in $\mathsf{LC}$: (1) we present a full classification of those inductive classes which are inductively complete, i.e., where all $\Pi_{2}$-rules which are admissible are derivable, and (2) show that the problem of admissibility of $\Pi_{2}$-rules over $\mathsf{LC}$ is decidable.</description>

      <title>On the expressive power of inquisitive epistemic logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14573v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inquisitive modal logic, InqML, in its epistemic incarnation, extends standard epistemic logic to capture not just the information that agents have, but also the questions that they are interested in. We use the natural notion of bisimulation equivalence in the setting of InqML, as introduced in [Ciardelli/Otto: JSL 2021], to characterise the expressiveness of InqML as the bisimulation invariant fragment of first-order logic over natural classes of two-sorted first-order structures that arise as relational encodings of inquisitive epistemic (S5-like) models. The non-elementary nature of these classes crucially requires non-classical model-theoretic methods for the analysis of first-order expressiveness, irrespective of whether we aim for characterisations in the sense of classical or of finite model theory.</description>
