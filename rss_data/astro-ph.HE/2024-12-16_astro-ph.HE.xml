      <title>Neutrinos from explosive transients at the dawn of multi-messenger astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the advent of time-domain astronomy and the game-changing next generation of telescopes, we have unprecedented opportunities to explore the most energetic events in our Universe through electromagnetic radiation, gravitational waves, and neutrinos. These are elementary particles, which exist in three different flavors and change the latter as they propagate in the dense core of astrophysical sources as well as en route to Earth. To capitalize on existing and upcoming multi-messenger opportunities, it is crucial to understand: 1. the role of neutrinos in explosive transient sources as well as in the synthesis of the elements heavier than iron; 2. the impact of neutrino physics on the multi-messenger observables; 3. the information on the source physics carried by the detectable neutrino signal. In this review, the status of this exciting and fast-moving field is outlined, focusing on astrophysical sources linked to collapsing massive stars and neutron-star mergers. In light of the upcoming plethora of multi-messenger data, outstanding open issues concerning the optimization of multi-messenger detection strategies are discussed.</description>

      <title>Bounding the photon mass with gravitationally lensed fast radio bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gravitational time delays of macro-lenses can be used to constrain the rest mass of the photon with high accuracy. Assuming a point-mass $+$ external shear lens model, we prove that an upper limit of the photon mass can be derived directly from two observables--the time delay $\Delta t$ and the leading-to-trailing flux ratio $R$ of strongly lensed fast radio bursts (FRBs). Using the observed values of $\Delta t$ and $R$ of a lensed FRB candidate, i.e., FRB 20190308C, as a reference, we obtain a strict upper limit of the photon mass between $m_\gamma &lt; 5.3 \times {10}^{-42}\,\rm kg$, for a given external shear strength of $\gamma' = 0.01$, and $m_{\gamma} &lt; 2.1 \times 10^{-41}-2.4 \times 10^{-42}\,\text{kg}$, within the external shear range of $0&lt;\gamma'&lt;1$. This provides the most stringent limit to date on the photon mass through gravitational lensing time delays, improving by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude the previous results obtained from lensed active galactic nuclei.</description>

      <title>gwsnr: A Python Package for Efficient SNR Calculation of GWs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) detection and analysis rely heavily on efficient Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) computation, a critical parameter for identifying and characterizing astrophysical signals from detectors like LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA. The gwsnr Python package addresses the computational challenges in GW research by providing a flexible, user-friendly framework for SNR calculations. It supports diverse detector noise models, waveform approximants, detector configurations, and signal parameters, making it highly adaptable to various research needs. The package introduces innovative methods, including a partial-scaling interpolation technique for spin-less binary systems, a noise-weighted inner product approach with multiprocessing capabilities, and an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model for rapid detection probability estimation of precessing binary black hole systems. Performance is further optimized using numba's Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler, enabling significant reductions in execution time. Seamlessly integrating with other tools, such as the ler package, gwsnr is instrumental in simulating detectable compact binary mergers, estimating GW event rates, and analyzing selection effects in hierarchical Bayesian frameworks. This comprehensive toolkit empowers researchers to conduct efficient, precise, and scalable analyses of GW signals.</description>

      <title>Exploring the anisotropic gravitational wave background from all-sky mock gravitational wave event catalogues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anisotropic stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) serves as a potential probe of the large-scale structure (LSS) of the universe. In this work, we explore the anisotropic SGWB from local ($z &lt; \sim 0.085$) merging stellar mass compact binaries, specifically focusing on merging stellar binary black holes, merging neutron-star-black-hole binaries, and merging binary neutron stars. The analysis employs seven all-sky mock lightcone gravitational wave event catalogues, which are derived from the Millennium simulation combined with a semi-analytic model of galaxy formation and a binary population synthesis model. We calculate the angular power spectra $\mathrm{C}_\ell$ at multipole moments $\ell$, expressed as $\text{log}_{10} [\ell(\ell+1)\mathrm{C}_\ell/(2\pi)]$, based on the skymaps of the overdensity $\delta_\mathrm{GW}$ in the anisotropic SGWB. The spectra for all three source types exhibit an approximately linear increase with $\text{log}_{10} \ell$ at higher $\ell$ (e.g., $\ell &gt; \sim 30 - 300$) in seven catalogues, with a characteristic slope of $\sim 2$. The spectra of seven catalogues exhibit considerable variations, arising from fluctuations in spatial distribution, primarily in the radial distribution, of nearby sources (e.g., $&lt; 50$ Mpc/h). After subtracting these nearby sources, the variations become much smaller and the spectra for the three source types become closely aligned (within discrepancies of a factor of $\sim 2$ across $\ell = 1 - 1000$ for all catalogues).</description>

      <title>Passage of a Gamma-Ray Burst Through a Molecular Cloud: The Absorption of its Afterglow in the X-ray Wavelength Range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the absorption of a gamma-ray burst afterglow in a dense molecular cloud in the X-ray wavelength range. We report the results of numerical simulations of the propagation of the gamma-ray burst radiation in the cloud for various gas densities, metallicities, and distances from the gamma-ray burst progenitor star and the cloud. We consider a sample of 45 gamma-ray bursts with known redshifts in which the isotropic-equivalent gamma-ray energy is approximately equal to the value adopted in our numerical simulations. For these gamma-ray bursts, we have analyzed the Swift/XRT energy spectra of their afterglows at late times, $t \geq 4 \times 10^3$ s. It is shown that the hydrogen column densities estimated using the absorption model in which the ionization of metal ions is not taken into account and the solar metallicity is used are a factor of 1-3 smaller than the actual values - if the molecular cloud is located close to the gamma-ray burst progenitor star. If the gas-dust cloud is located at a distance of $R \geq 10$ pc from the source of the gamma-ray burst or the gas metallicity is $[M/H] \leq -1$, then the effect of the cloud ionization structure on the absorption of the afterglow is minor.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing research by enabling the efficient analysis of large datasets and the discovery of hidden patterns. In astrophysics, AI has become essential, transforming the classification of celestial sources, data modeling, and the interpretation of observations. In this review, I highlight examples of AI applications in astrophysics, including source classification, spectral energy distribution modeling, and discuss the advancements achievable through generative AI. However, the use of AI introduces challenges, including biases, errors, and the "black box" nature of AI models, which must be resolved before their application. These issues can be addressed through the concept of Human-Guided AI (HG-AI), which integrates human expertise and domain-specific knowledge into AI applications. This approach aims to ensure that AI is applied in a robust, interpretable, and ethical manner, leading to deeper insights and fostering scientific excellence.</description>

      <title>RTFAST-Spectra: Emulation of X-ray reverberation mapping for active galactic nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bayesian analysis has begun to be more widely adopted in X-ray spectroscopy, but it has largely been constrained to relatively simple physical models due to limitations in X-ray modelling software and computation time. As a result, Bayesian analysis of numerical models with high physics complexity have remained out of reach. This is a challenge, for example when modelling the X-ray emission of accreting black hole X-ray binaries, where the slow model computations severely limit explorations of parameter space and may bias the inference of astrophysical parameters. Here, we present RTFAST-Spectra: a neural network emulator that acts as a drop in replacement for the spectral portion of the black hole X-ray reverberation model RTDIST. This is the first emulator for the reltrans model suite and the first emulator for a state-of-the-art x-ray reflection model incorporating relativistic effects with 17 physically meaningful model parameters. We use Principal Component Analysis to create a light-weight neural network that is able to preserve correlations between complex atomic lines and simple continuum, enabling consistent modelling of key parameters of scientific interest. We achieve a $\mathcal{O}(10^2)$ times speed up over the original model in the most conservative conditions with $\mathcal{O}(1\%)$ precision over all 17 free parameters in the original numerical model, taking full posterior fits from months to hours. We employ Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling to show how we can better explore the posteriors of model parameters in simulated data and discuss the complexities in interpreting the model when fitting real data.</description>

      <title>Recovering Pulsar Braking Index from a Population of Millisecond Pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The braking index, $n$, of a pulsar is a measure of its angular momentum loss and the value it takes corresponds to different spin-down mechanisms. For a pulsar spinning down due to gravitational wave emission from the principal mass quadrupole mode alone, the braking index would equal exactly 5. Unfortunately, for millisecond pulsars, it can be hard to measure observationally due to the extremely small second time derivative of the rotation frequency, $\ddot{f}$. This paper aims to examine whether it could be possible to extract the distribution of $n$ for a whole population of pulsars rather than measuring the values individually. We use simulated data with an injected $n=5$ signal for 47 millisecond pulsars and extract the distribution using hierarchical Bayesian inference methods. We find that while possible, observation times of over 20 years and RMS noise of the order of $10^{-5}$ ms are needed, which can be compared to the mean noise value of $3\times10^{-4}$ ms for the recent wideband 12.5-year NANOGrav sample, which provided the pulsar timing data used in this paper.</description>

      <title>Equation of State Independent Determination on the Radius of a 1.4 $M_{\odot}$ Neutron Star Using Mass-Radius Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional methods for determining the radius of a 1.4 $M_{\odot}$ neutron star ($R_{1.4}$) rely on specific equations of state (EOS) models that describe various types of dense nuclear matter. This dependence on EOS models can introduce substantial systematic uncertainties, which may exceed the measurement uncertainties when constraining $R_{1.4}$. In this study, we explore a novel approach to constraining $R_{1.4}$ using data from NICER observations of PSR J0030+0451 (J0030) and PSR J0437-4715 (J0437). However, this work presents a more data-driven analysis framework, substantially decreasing the need for EOS assumptions. By analyzing the Mass-Radius measurements of these two neutron stars, we infer $R_{1.4}$ using statistical methods based mostly on observational data. We examine various hotspot configurations for J0030, along with new J0437 observations, and their effects on the inferred radius. Our results are consistent with X-ray timing, gravitational wave, and nuclear physics constraints, while avoiding EOS-related biases. The same method has also been applied to a simulated mass-radius dataset, based on our knowledge of future X-ray telescopes, demonstrating the model's ability to recover the injected $R_{1.4}$ value in certain cases. This method provides a data-driven pathway for extracting neutron star properties and offers a new approach for future observational efforts in neutron star astrophysics.</description>

      <title>Accretion Disc-Jet Decomposition from the Optical-Near Infrared Monitoring of Fermi Blazars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the variability of the thermal (accretion disc) and non-thermal (jet) emission of thirteen flat spectrum radio quasars in the optical and near infrared (OIR) regime using light curves spanning years with an average sampling of three observations per week. We fit a combination of a blackbody and a power-law function to the OIR data, in the blazar rest frame, to extract the corresponding thermal (disc) and non-thermal (jet) components from the total flux. We carry out this analysis for the entire duration of the light curves to obtain the variation of the disc and jet components over years. Reliability of our fits have been affirmed by successfully retrieving accurate parameters by employing our method to simulated data and by comparing our results with published disc luminosity obtained by other methods for a few well-observed blazars. In blazars, the thermal (disc) emission is difficult to extract because the relativistically beamed radiation of the jet dominates at all wavelengths. By employing this method, the disc emission in blazars may be estimated directly from photometric data at OIR bands instead of indirect methods, such as, inferring it from the emission line luminosities. We find that the variability of the disc and jet emission obtained by the above method are strongly correlated in most cases.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Mechanisms of Electron Energy Spectrum Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The electron spectrum exhibits a complex structure and has controversially proposed origins.This work reproduce the evolution of the electron spectrum based on a spatially dependent propagation (SDP) model. The key point is that our SPD model features two diffusion regions leading to two diffusion timescales, competing with the cooling timescale. This results in a three-segment power-law electron spectrum: (1) The spectrum below tens of GeV is primarily influenced by cooling effects from distant sources. (2)the spectrum dominated by diffusion effects from nearby sources from tens of GeV to TeV; (3) the spectrum above TeV, which is predominantly governed by cooling effects from nearby sources. This evolution is unique to the SDP model, and we offer a comprehensive and clear depiction of electron evolution under a single propagation scenario for the first time.</description>

      <title>Mass-transferring binary stars as progenitors of interacting hydrogen-free supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stripped-envelope supernovae (SNe) are H-poor transients produced at the end of the life of massive stars that previously lost their H-rich envelope. Their progenitors are thought to be donor stars in mass-transferring binary systems, which were stripped of their H-rich envelopes some $10^6$yr before core collapse. A subset of the stripped-envelope SNe exhibit spectral and photometric features indicative of interaction between their ejecta and nearby circumstellar material (CSM). We examine whether mass transfer during, or shortly before, core collapse in massive binary systems can produce the CSM inferred from the observations of interacting H-poor SNe. We select 44 models from a comprehensive grid of detailed binary evolution models in which the mass donors are H-free and explode while transferring mass to a main-sequence companion. We find that in these models, mass transfer starts less than $\sim20$kyr before, and often continues until the core collapse of the donor star. Up to $0.8M_\odot$ of H-free material are removed from the donor star during this phase, which may produce a He-rich circumbinary material. We explore plausible assumptions for its spatial distribution at the time of explosion. When assuming that the CSM accumulates in a circumbinary disk, we find qualitative agreement with the supernova and CSM properties inferred from observed Type Ibn SNe, and to a lesser extent with constraints from Type Icn SNe. We find that our mass transferring stripped envelope SN progenitor models may produce up to $\sim$10% of all stripped envelope supernovae. The binary channel proposed in this work can qualitatively account for the observed key properties and rate of interacting H-poor SNe. Models for the evolution of the circumbinary material and the spectral evolution of exploding progenitors from this channel are needed to further test its significance.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional tearing instability of flux-tube-like magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic reconnection, a fundamental plasma process, is pivotal in understanding energy conversion and particle acceleration in astrophysical systems. While extensively studied in two-dimensional (2D) configurations, the dynamics of reconnection in three-dimensional (3D) systems remain under-explored. In this work, we extend the classical tearing mode instability to 3D by introducing a modulation along the otherwise uniform direction in a 2D equilibrium, given by $g(y)$, mimicking a flux tube-like configuration. We perform linear stability analysis (both analytically and numerically) and direct numerical simulations to investigate the effects of three-dimensionality. Our findings reveal that the 3D tearing instability exhibits reduced growth rates compared to 2D by a factor of $\int g(y)^{1/2} dy~/\int dy$, with the dispersion relation maintaining similar scaling characteristics. We show that the modulation introduces spatially varying resistive layer properties, which influence the reconnection dynamics. Remarkably, we find that Sweet-Parker scaling for the reconnection rate persists even in the absence of a guide field.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a systematic exploration of exact solutions for electrically charged wormholes, black holes, and black bounces within the hybrid metric-Palatini gravity (HMPG) framework. HMPG combines features of the metric and Palatini formulations of modified gravity, offering a powerful approach to address challenges in General Relativity, particularly those related to cosmic acceleration and dark matter. We examine configurations characterized by a zero scalar potential under spherical symmetry, and present solutions in both the Jordan and Einstein conformal frames. A diverse set of solutions emerges, including traversable wormholes, black holes with extremal horizons, and "black universe" models in which spacetime beyond the horizon leads to an expanding cosmological solution rather than a singularity. Each configuration is categorized according to the properties of the scalar field, with an in-depth analysis of the horizon and throat structures, asymptotic behaviour, and singularities. These findings underscore the versatility of HMPG in capturing complex gravitational phenomena and broadens the scope of the theory, offering a robust framework for modelling gravitational phenomena across a range of astrophysical contexts. Future work will benefit from extending these solutions to include scalar potentials, addressing both early-universe inflation and late-time acceleration, and applying observational data, such as gravitational lensing and gravitational wave measurements.</description>

      <title>Neutral Fraction of Hydrogen in the Intergalactic Medium Surrounding High-Redshift Gamma-Ray Burst 210905A</title>

Abstract: The Epoch of Reionization (EoR) is a key period of cosmological history in which the intergalactic medium (IGM) underwent a major phase change from being neutral to almost completely ionized. Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are luminous and unique probes of their environments that can be used to study the timeline for the progression of the EoR. Here we present a detailed analysis of the ESO Very Large Telescope X-shooter spectrum of GRB 210905A, which resides at a redshift of z ~ 6.3. We focus on estimating the fraction of neutral hydrogen, x_HI, on the line of sight to the host galaxy of GRB 210905A by fitting the shape of the Lyman-alpha damping wing of the afterglow spectrum. The X-shooter spectrum has a high signal to noise ratio, but the complex velocity structure of the host galaxy limits the precision of our conclusions. The statistically preferred model suggests a low neutral fraction with a 3-sigma upper limit of x_HI &lt; 0.15 or x_HI &lt; 0.23, depending on the absence or presence of an ionized bubble around the GRB host galaxy, indicating that the IGM around the GRB host galaxy is mostly ionized. We discuss complications in current analyses and potential avenues for future studies of the progression of the EoR and its evolution with redshift.</description>

      <title>Are long gamma-ray bursts progenitors to merging binary black holes?</title>

Abstract: The distribution of delay times between the formation of binary black hole (BBH) progenitors and their gravitational-wave (GW) merger provides important clues about their unknown formation histories. When inferring the delay time distribution, it is typically assumed that BBH progenitor formation traces the star formation rate (SFR). In this work, we consider the rate of long gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs) instead of the SFR. LGRBs are thought to correspond to the formation of (possibly spinning) black holes, and may therefore be related to the BBH progenitor population. By comparing the redshift evolution of the LGRB rate as inferred by Ghirlanda &amp; Salvaterra (2022) and the BBH merger rate inferred by LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) observations, we find that the delay time distribution between LGRBs and BBH mergers is well-described by a power law with minimum delay time $10$ Myr and slope $\alpha ={-0.96}^{+0.64}_{-0.76}$ (90% credibility). This matches theoretical expectations for the BBH delay time distribution, which in turn lends support to the hypothesis that LGRBs trace BBH progenitor formation. However, comparing the absolute rates of these two populations, we find that at most $f = {4}^{+10}_{-2}\%$ of LGRBs may evolve into merging BBH. We also consider the possibility that LGRBs only produce BBH systems with large aligned spins (with effective inspiral spin $\chi_\mathrm{eff} &gt; 0.2$). In this case, we find $f = 0.3^{+1.0}_{-0.2}\%$ and the delay time distribution favors the steepest power-law slopes we consider ($\alpha = -2$). We argue that asynchronous observations of LGRBs and GWs provide a powerful multimessenger probe of black hole lifecycles across cosmic history.</description>

      <title>Cosmic-ray deuteron excess from a primary component</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07139v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent AMS-02 measurements of cosmic-ray (CR) deuteron fluxes suggest the presence of primary deuterons in quantities far exceeding predictions from Big Bang nucleosynthesis. This poses a significant challenge to modern astrophysics, as no known processes can account for such large amounts of deuterons without violating existing constraints~\cite{Epstein:1976hq}. In contrast, it is recently proposed that the AMS-02 measurements can be explained by a purely secondary origin when contributions from heavier nuclei are considered. In this study, we recalculate the secondary deuteron flux using production cross sections updated with the latest collider data. We find that some of the deuteron production cross sections are overestimated in the widely-used calculation tools for CR propagation, and a primary deuteron component is still necessary. We then propose a novel process for generating primary deuterons at CR sources through a fusion mechanism, which is naturally unique to deuterons. This model could explain the observed deuteron excess while maintaining consistency with other CR measurements.</description>

      <title>PKS~2332$-$017 and PMN J1916$-$1519: Candidate Blazar Counterparts to Two High-energy Neutrino Events</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01448v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report our counterpart identification study for two high-energy neutrino events IC-130127A and IC-131204A listed in the IceCube Event Catalog of Alert Tracks. These two events belong to Gold alerts, which have a significant probability of being of astrophysical origin.Within the events' 90\% positional uncertainty regions, we respectively find PKS~2332$-$017 and PMN J1916$-$1519. The first source is a flat-spectrum radio quasar at redshift $z= 1.18$ and the second a blazar of an uncertain type with photometric $z= 0.968$. As they correspondingly had a $\gamma$-ray flare temporally coincident with the arrival times of IC-130127A and IC-131204A, we identify them as the respective neutrino emitters. Detailed analysis of the $\gamma$-ray data for the two blazars, obtained with the Large Area Telescope (LAT) onboard {\it the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope (Fermi)}, is conducted. The two flares respectively from PKS~2332$-$017 and PMN~J1916$-$1519 lasted $\sim$4\,yr and $\sim$4\,month, and showed possible emission hardening by containing high-energy $\sim$2--10\,GeV photons in the emissions. Accompanying the flare of PKS~2332$-$017, optical and MIR brightening variations were also observed. We discuss the properties of the two sources and compare the properties with those of the previously reported (candidate) neutrino-emitting blazars.</description>

      <title>Evidence of non-Solar elemental composition in the clocked X-ray burster SRGA J144459.2$-$604207</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10993v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In February and March 2024, a series of many Type I X-ray bursts from the accreting neutron star SRGA J144459.2$-$604207, which has been identified by multiple X-ray satellites, with the first reports coming from INTEGRAL and NinjaSat. These observations reveal that after exhibiting very regular behavior as a ``clocked'' burster, the peak luminosity of the SRGA J144459.2$-$604207 X-ray bursts shows a gradual decline. The observed light curves exhibit a short plateau feature, potentially with a double peak, followed by a rapid decay in the tail-features unlike those seen in previously observed clocked bursters. In this study, we calculate a series of multizone X-ray burst models with various compositions of accreted matter, specifically varying the mass fractions of hydrogen ($X$), helium ($Y$), and heavier CNO elements or metallicity ($Z_{\rm CNO}$). We demonstrate that a model with higher $Z_{\rm CNO}$ and/or lower $X/Y$ compared to the solar values can reproduce the observed behavior of SRGA J144459.2$-$604207. Therefore, we propose that this new X-ray burster is likely the first clocked burster with non-solar elemental compositions. Moreover, based on the X-ray burst light curve morphology in the decline phase observed by NinjaSat, a He-enhanced model with $X/Y \approx 1.5$ seems preferred over high-metallicity cases. We also give a brief discussion on the implications for the neutron star mass, binary star evolution, inclination angle, and the potential for a high-metallicity scenario, the last of which is closely related to the properties of the hot CNO cycle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04068v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The BL Lac object 3C 371 is one of the targets that are regularly monitored by the Whole Earth Blazar Telescope (WEBT) Collaboration to study blazar variability on both short and long timescales. We aim to evaluate the long-term multiwavelength (MWL) behaviour of 3C 371, comparing it with the results derived for its optical emission in our previous study. For this, we make use of the multi-band campaigns organized by the WEBT Collaboration in optical and radio between January 2018 and December 2020, and of public data from Swift and Fermi satellites and the MOJAVE Very Large Interferometry programme. We evaluate the variability shown by the source in each band with the amplitude variability quantification, as well as possible interband correlation using the z-Discrete Correlation Function. We also present a deep analysis of the optical-UV, X-ray and $\gamma$-ray spectral variability. With the MOJAVE data we perform a kinematics analysis, looking for components propagating along the jet, calculating its kinematics parameters. This set of parameters is later used for the interpretation of the source MWL behaviour, modelling the broadband spectral energy distribution (SED) of the source with theoretical blazar emission scenarios.</description>

Abstract: Quadratic quasi-normal modes, generated at second order in black hole perturbation theory, are a promising target for testing gravity in the nonlinear regime with next-generation gravitational wave detectors. While their frequencies have long been known, their amplitudes remain poorly studied. We introduce regular variables and compute amplitudes for Schwarzschild black holes with the Leaver algorithm. We find a nonlinear ratio $\mathcal{R}\simeq0.154e^{-0.068i}$ for the most excited $\ell=4$ mode, matching results from Numerical Relativity. We also predict new low-frequency $\ell=2$ quadratic modes.</description>

      <title>Eccentricity effects on the supermassive black hole gravitational wave background</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05125v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We studied how eccentricity affects the gravitational wave (GW) spectrum from supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries. We developed a fast and accurate semi-analytic method for computing the GW spectra, the distribution for the spectral fluctuations and the correlations between different frequencies. As GW emission circularizes binaries, the suppression of the signal strength due to eccentricity is relevant for signals from wider binaries emitting at lower frequencies. Such a feature is present in the signal observed at pulsar timing arrays. We found that when orbital decay of the SMBH binaries is driven by GWs only, the shape of the observed signal preferred highly eccentric binaries $\langle e \rangle_{2\,{\rm nHz}} = 0.83^{+0.04}_{-0.05}$. However, when environmental effects were included, the initial eccentricity could be significantly lowered, yet the scenario with purely circular binaries was still mildly disfavored.</description>

      <title>Amplitudes and Polarizations of Quadratic Quasi-Normal Modes for a Schwarzschild Black Hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14611v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: General Relativity predicts the existence of quadratic quasi-normal modes at second order in perturbation theory. Building on our recent work, we compute the amplitudes and polarizations of these modes for non-rotating black holes, showing that they are completely determined by the amplitudes and polarizations of linear modes. We obtain the ratio of quadratic to linear amplitudes, which still depends on the initial conditions of the merger through the polarization of linear modes. However, we demonstrate that this dependence is captured by four fundamental numbers, independent of initial conditions, representing four different combinations of linear modes parities. Additionally, we prove two selection rules regarding the vanishing of classes of quadratic modes. Our results are available online as a package which provides the ratio of amplitudes across a broad spectrum of angular momenta.</description>

      <title>No-hair and almost-no-hair results for static axisymmetric black holes and ultracompact objects in astrophysical environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08128v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: No-hair theorems are uniqueness results constraining the form of the metric of black holes in general relativity. These theorems are typically formulated under idealized assumptions, involving a mixture of local (regularity of the horizon) and global aspects (vacuum spacetime and asymptotic flatness). This limits their applicability to astrophysical scenarios of interest such as binary black holes and accreting systems, as well as their extension to horizonless objects. A previous result due to G\"urlebeck constrains the asymptotic multipolar structure of static spacetimes containing black holes surrounded by matter although not revealing the possible structure of the metric itself. In this work, we disentangle some of these assumptions in the static and axisymmetric case. Specifically: i) we show that only a one-parameter family of black-hole geometries is compatible with a given external gravitational field, ii) we also analyze the case in which the central object is close to forming an event horizon but is still horizonless and show that the deviations from the natural black-hole shape have to die off as one approaches the black hole limit under the physical principle that curvatures are bounded.</description>

      <title>Bayesian evidence for two peaks in the sound speed in cold dense QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08760v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I show that in addition to the well-known peak inside massive neutron stars, the sound speed in cold dense QCD matter likely exhibits another peak above neutron star densities before it asymptotes to $c_s=\sqrt{C_s}=\sqrt{1/3}$. Based on the framework reported in arxiv:2408.16738, this approach does not rely on any assumption about the ultra-dense matter not realized in nature. Current multimessenger observation of neutron stars favors the two-peak scenario with a Bayes factor $5.1_{-0.7}^{+0.9}$, where the uncertainties are systematics due to models of neutron star inner cores. This evidence grows to $27_{-8}^{+11}$ if the $2.6M_\odot$ component of GW190814 is a neutron star. The trough in $C_s$ separating the two peaks is inferred to be below $0.05^{+0.04}_{-0.02}$ (at the $50\%$ level) if $2.6M_\odot$ neutron stars exist. The second peak above $1/3$ beyond baryon chemical potential $\mu_B=1.6-1.9$ GeV most likely signals non-perturbative effects in cold quark matter, for instance color superconductivity.</description>
