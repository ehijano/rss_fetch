      <title>Heston vol-of-vol and the VVIX</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Heston stochastic volatility model is arguably, the most popular stochastic volatility model used to price and risk manage exotic derivatives. In spite of this, it is not necessarily easy to calibrate to the market and obtain stable exotic option prices with this model. This paper focuses on the vol-of-vol parameter and its relation with the volatility of volatility index (VVIX) level. Four different approaches to estimate the VVIX in the Heston model are presented: two based on the known transition density of the variance, one analytical approximation, and one based on the Heston PDE which computes the value directly out of the underlying SPX500. Finally we explore their use to improve calibration stability.</description>

      <title>Mean-Field Price Formation on Trees with Multi-Population and Non-Rational Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11261v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work solves the equilibrium price formation problem for the risky stock by combining mean-field game theory with the binomial tree framework, adapting the classic approach of Cox, Ross \&amp; Rubinstein. For agents with exponential and recursive utilities of exponential-type, we prove the existence of a unique mean-field market-clearing equilibrium and derive an explicit analytic formula for equilibrium transition probabilities of the stock price on the binomial lattice. The agents face stochastic terminal liabilities and incremental endowments that depend on unhedgeable common and idiosyncratic factors, in addition to the stock price path. We also incorporate an external order flow. Furthermore, the analytic tractability of the proposed approach allows us to extend the framework in two important directions: First, we incorporate multi-population heterogeneity, allowing agents to differ in functional forms for their liabilities, endowments, and risk coefficients. Second, we relax the rational expectations hypothesis by modeling agents operating under subjective probability measures which induce stochastically biased views on the stock transition probabilities. Our numerical examples illustrate the qualitative effects of these components on the equilibrium price distribution.</description>

      <title>The critical disordered pinning measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17642v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a disordered pinning model induced by a random walk whose increments have a finite $(2+\kappa)$-th moment for some $\kappa&gt;0$. It is known that this model is marginally relevant, and moreover, it undergoes a phase transition in an intermediate disorder regime. We show that, in the critical window, the point-to-point partition functions converge to a unique limiting random measure, which we call the critical disordered pinning measure. We also obtain an analogous result for a continuous counterpart to the pinning model, which is closely related to two other models: one is a critical stochastic Volterra equation that gives rise to a rough volatility model, and the other is a critical stochastic heat equation with multiplicative noise that is white in time and delta in space.</description>
