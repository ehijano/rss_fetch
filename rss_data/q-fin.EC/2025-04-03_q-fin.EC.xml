      <title>Empirical Analysis of Digital Innovations Impact on Corporate ESG Performance: The Mediating Role of GAI Technology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the relationship between corporate digital innovation and Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) performance, with a specific focus on the mediating role of Generative artificial intelligence technology adoption. Using a comprehensive panel dataset of 8,000 observations from the CMARS and WIND database spanning from 2015 to 2023, we employ multiple econometric techniques to examine this relationship. Our findings reveal that digital innovation significantly enhances corporate ESG performance, with GAI technology adoption serving as a crucial mediating mechanism. Specifically, digital innovation positively influences GAI technology adoption, which subsequently improves ESG performance. Furthermore, our heterogeneity analysis indicates that this relationship varies across firm size, industry type, and ownership structure. Finally, our results remain robust after addressing potential endogeneity concerns through instrumental variable estimation, propensity score matching, and differenc in differences approaches. This research contributes to the growing literature on technologydriven sustainability transformations and offers practical implications for corporate strategy and policy development in promoting sustainable business practices through technological advancement.</description>

      <title>Exploitation of Eurosystem Loopholes and Their Quantitative Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper identifies and analyzes six key strategies used to exploit the Eurosystem's financial mechanisms, and attempts a quantitative reconstruction: inflating TARGET balances, leveraging collateral swaps followed by defaults, diluting self-imposed regulatory rules, issuing money through Emergency Liquidity Assistance (ELA), acquisitions facilitated via the Agreement on Net Financial Assets (ANFA), and the perpetual (re)issuance of sovereign bonds as collateral. The paper argues that these practices stem from systemic vulnerabilities or deliberate opportunism within the Eurosystem. While it does not advocate for illicit activities, the paper highlights significant weaknesses in the current structure and concludes that comprehensive reforms are urgently needed.</description>

      <title>The role of ethical consumption in promoting democratic sustainability: revisiting neoclassical economics through Kantian ethics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores how ethical consumption can transform democratic governance toward sustainability by challenging traditional economic models centered on utility and efficiency. As societal values shift toward transparency equity and environmental responsibility ethical consumers increasingly influence markets. Drawing on Whites Kantian economic framework and Ingleharts theory of value change the paper proposes a model integrating moral imperatives into economic theory. Using a vector bundle approach it captures evolving ethical preferences advocating for an inclusive sustainability focused economic paradigm aligned with post materialist values.</description>

      <title>GPT Adoption and the Impact of Disclosure Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPTs), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, have proven effective in content generation and productivity enhancement. However, legal risks associated with these tools lead to adoption variance and concealment of AI use within organizations. This study examines the impact of disclosure on ChatGPT adoption in legal, audit and advisory roles in consulting firms through the lens of agency theory. We conducted a survey experiment to evaluate agency costs in the context of unregulated corporate use of ChatGPT, with a particular focus on how mandatory disclosure influences information asymmetry and misaligned interests. Our findings indicate that in the absence of corporate regulations, such as an AI policy, firms may incur agency costs, which can hinder the full benefits of GPT adoption. While disclosure policies reduce information asymmetry, they do not significantly lower overall agency costs due to managers undervaluing analysts' contributions with GPT use. Finally, we examine the scope of existing regulations in Europe and the United States regarding disclosure requirements, explore the sharing of risk and responsibility within firms, and analyze how incentive mechanisms promote responsible AI adoption.</description>

      <title>Renewable Diesel Boom: The Impact of Soybean Crush Plants on Local Soybean Basis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of the policy-driven expansion of the diesel and renewable diesel industry on local soybean prices. Because soybean oil is a key feedstock for biodiesel and renewable diesel, significant investments have been made in new soybean crush facilities and the expansion of existing ones. We quantify the effect of both new and existing soybean plants on soybean basis using panel data and a differences-in-difference approach. The data available on new plants does not allow us to identify any statistically significant impacts. However, existing plants increase the basis by 23.36 to 9.20 cents per bushel, with the effect diminishing with distance. These results suggest the relevance of biofuel policies in supporting rural economies and have relevant policy implications.</description>

      <title>Slowing Climate Change and Ocean Acidification by Converting Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide to Graphite (CD2G)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere may slow climate change and ocean acidification. My approach converts atmospheric carbon dioxide into graphite (CD2G). The net profit for this conversion is ~$381/ton CO2 removed from the atmosphere. At the gigaton scale, CD2G factories will increase the affordability and availability of graphite. Since graphite can be used to make thermal batteries and electrodes for fuel cells and batteries, CD2G factories will help lower the cost of storing renewable energy, which will accelerate the transition to renewable energy. Replacing fossil fuel energy with renewable energy will slow the release of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, also slowing climate change. Converting atmospheric carbon dioxide into graphite will both generate a profit and slow climate change.</description>

      <title>Dual first-order methods for efficient computation of convex hull prices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Convex Hull (CH) pricing, used in US electricity markets and raising interest in Europe, is a pricing rule designed to handle markets with non-convexities such as startup costs and minimum up and down times. In such markets, the market operator makes side payments to generators to cover lost opportunity costs, and CH prices minimize the total "lost opportunity costs", which include both actual losses and missed profit opportunities. These prices can also be obtained by solving a (partial) Lagrangian dual of the original mixed-integer program, where power balance constraints are dualized. Computing CH prices then amounts to minimizing a sum of nonsmooth convex objective functions, where each term depends only on a single generator. The subgradient of each of those terms can be obtained independently by solving smaller mixed-integer programs. In this work, we benchmark a large panel of first-order methods to solve the above dual CH pricing problem. We test several dual methods, most of which not previously considered for CH pricing, namely a proximal variant of the bundle level method, subgradient methods with three different stepsize strategies, two recent parameter-free methods and an accelerated gradient method combined with smoothing. We compare those methods on two representative sets of real-world large-scale instances and complement the comparison with a (Dantzig-Wolfe) primal column generation method shown to be efficient at computing CH prices, for reference. Our numerical experiments show that the bundle proximal level method and two variants of the subgradient method perform the best among all dual methods and compare favorably with the Dantzig-Wolfe primal method.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Role of Perceived Range Anxiety in Adoption Behavior of Plug-in Electric Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.10313v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A sustainable solution to negative externalities imposed by road transportation is replacing internal combustion vehicles with electric vehicles (EVs), especially plug-in EV (PEV) encompassing plug-in hybrid EV (PHEV) and battery EV (BEV). However, EV market share is still low and is forecast to remain low and uncertain. This shows a research need for an in-depth understanding of EV adoption behavior with a focus on one of the main barriers to the mass EV adoption, which is the limited electric driving range. The present study extends the existing literature in two directions; First, the influence of the psychological aspect of driving range, which is referred to as range anxiety, is explored on EV adoption behavior by presenting a nested logit (NL) model with a latent construct. Second, the two-level NL model captures individuals' decision on EV adoption behavior distinguished by vehicle transaction type and EV type, where the upper level yields the vehicle transaction type selected from the set of alternatives including no-transaction, sell, trade, and add. The fuel type of the vehicles decided to be acquired, either as traded-for or added vehicles, is simultaneously determined at the lower level from a set including conventional vehicle, hybrid EV, PHEV, and BEV. The model is empirically estimated using a stated preferences dataset collected in the State of California. A notable finding is that anxiety about driving range influences the preference for BEV, especially as an added than traded-for vehicle, but not the decision on PHEV adoption.</description>

      <title>Effect of State and Local Sexual Orientation Anti-Discrimination Laws on Labor Market Differentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03794v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents the first quasi-experimental research examining the effect of both local and state anti-discrimination laws on sexual orientation on the labor supply and wages of lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) workers. To do so, we use the American Community Survey data on household composition to infer sexual orientation and combine this with a unique panel dataset on state and local anti-discrimination laws. Leveraging variation in law implementation across localities over time and between same-sex and different-sex couples, we find that anti-discrimination laws not only significantly narrow gaps in labor force participation and employment for male same-sex couples relative to men in different-sex couples, but also boost their percentile rank in the wage distribution. Our analysis reveals mostly null effects for female same-sex couples; however, in metropolitan areas these laws significantly reduce their employment compared to women in different-sex couples. One explanation for the reduced labor supply is that female same-sex couples begin to have more children in response to the laws. Finally, we present evidence that state anti-discrimination laws significantly and persistently increased support for same-sex marriage. This research shows that anti-discrimination laws can be an effective policy tool for reducing labor market inequalities across sexual orientation and improving sentiment toward LGB Americans.</description>

      <title>An Instrumental Variables Approach to Testing Firm Conduct</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05022v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding firm conduct is crucial for industrial organization and antitrust policy. In this article, we develop a testing procedure based on the Rivers and Vuong non-nested model selection framework. Unlike existing methods that require estimating the demand and supply system, our approach compares the model fit of two first-stage price regressions. Through an extensive Monte Carlo study, we demonstrate that our test performs comparably to, or outperforms, existing methods in detecting collusion across various collusive scenarios. The results are robust to model misspecification, alternative functional forms for instruments, and data limitations. By simplifying the diagnosis of firm behavior, our method provides an efficient tool for researchers and regulators to assess industry conduct. Additionally, our approach offers a practical guideline for enhancing the strength of BLP-style instruments in demand estimation: once collusion is detected, researchers are advised to incorporate the product characteristics of colluding partners into own-firm instruments while excluding them from other-firm instruments.</description>

      <title>Endogenous Persistence at the Effective Lower Bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06473v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a perfect foresight method to solve models with an interest rate lower bound constraint that nests OccBin/DynareOBC and \cite{Eggertsson2010}'s as well as \cite{Mertens2014}'s pen and paper solutions as special cases. Our method generalizes the pen-and-paper solutions by allowing for endogenous persistence while maintaining tractability and interpretability. We prove that our method necessarily gives stable multipliers. We use it to solve a New Keynesian model with habit formation and government spending, which we match to expectations data from the Great Recession. We find an output multiplier of government spending close to 1 for the US and Japan.</description>

      <title>Optimal Diversification and Leverage in a Utility-Based Portfolio Allocation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07498v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine the problem of optimal portfolio allocation within the framework of utility theory. We apply exponential utility to derive the optimal diversification strategy and logarithmic utility to determine the optimal leverage. We enhance existing methodologies by incorporating compound probability distributions to model the effects of both statistical and non-stationary uncertainties. Additionally, we extend the maximum expected utility objective by including the variance of utility in the objective function, which we term generalized mean-variance. In the case of logarithmic utility, it provides a natural explanation for the half-Kelly criterion, a concept widely used by practitioners.</description>
