      <title>$C^*$- Colored graph algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following our previous works on $C^*$-graph algebras and the associated Cuntz-Krieger graph families, in this paper we will try to have a look at the colored version of these structures and to see what a $C^*$-colored graph algebra might mean by employing some constructive examples very close to the toy example used in our previous works, and we also will try to study their graph theoretical properties as possible.</description>

      <title>Density of irreducible operators in the trace-class norm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1968, Paul Halmos initiated the research on density of the set of irreducible operators on a separable Hilbert space. Through the research, a long-standing unsolved problem inquires: is the set of irreducible operators dense in $B(H)$ with respect to the trace-class norm topology? Precisely, for each operator $T $ in $B(H)$ and every $\varepsilon &gt;0$, is there a trace-class operator $K$ such that $T+K$ is irreducible and $\Vert K \Vert_1 &lt; \varepsilon$?
  For $p&gt;1$, to prove the $\Vert \cdot \Vert_p$-norm density of irreducible operators in $B(H)$, a type of Weyl-von Neumann theorem effects as a key technique. But the traditional method fails for the case $p=1$, where by $\Vert \cdot \Vert_p$-norm we denote the Schatten $p$-norm.
  In the current paper, for a large family of operators in $B(H)$, we give the above long-term problem an affirmative answer. The result is derived from a combination of techniques in both operator theory and operator algebras. Moreover, we discover that there is a strong connection between the problem and another related operator-theoretical problem related to type $\mathrm{II}_1$ von Neumann algebras.</description>

      <title>The inverse-closed subalgebra of $C^{*}(G,A)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the inverse-closed subalgebras of the Roe algebra with coefficients of the type \(l^2(G, A)\). The coefficient \(A\) is chosen to be a non-commutative \(C^*\)-algebra, and the object of study is \(C^*(G, A)\) generated by the countable discrete group \(G\). By referring to the Sobolev-type algebra, the intersection of a family of Banach algebras is taken. It is proved that the intersection \(W_a^{\infty}(G, A)\) of Banach spaces is a spectrally invariant dense subalgebra of \(C^*(G, A)\), and a sufficient condition for this is that the group action of \(G\) has polynomial growth.</description>

      <title>Band-dominated and Fourier-band-dominated operators on locally compact abelian groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By relating notions from quantum harmonic analysis and band-dominated operator theory, we prove that over any locally compact abelian group $G$, the operator algebra $\mathcal C_1$ from quantum harmonic analysis agrees with the intersection of band-dominated operators and Fourier band-dominated operators. As an application, we characterize the compactness of operators acting on $L^2(G)$ and compare it with previous results in the discrete case. In particular, our results can be seen as a generalization of the limit operator concept to the non-discrete world. Moreover, we briefly discuss property $A'$ for arbitrary locally compact abelian groups.</description>

      <title>On coproducts of operator $\mathcal{A}$-systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.02687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.02687v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a unital $\boldsymbol{C}^{*}$-algebra $\mathcal{A}$, we prove the existence of the coproduct of two faithful operator $\mathcal{A}$-systems. We show that we can either consider it as a subsystem of an amalgamated free product of $\boldsymbol{C}^{*}$-algebras, or as a quotient by an operator system kernel. We introduce a universal $\boldsymbol{C}^{*}$-algebra for operator $\mathcal{A}$-systems and prove that in the case of the coproduct of two operator $\mathcal{A}$-systems, it is isomorphic to the amalgamated over $\mathcal{A}$, free product of their respective universal $\boldsymbol{C}^{*}$-algebras. Also, under the assumptions of hyperrigidity for operator systems, we can identify the $\boldsymbol{C}^{*}$-envelope of the coproduct with the amalgamated free product of the $\boldsymbol{C}^{*}$-envelopes. We consider graph operator systems as examples of operator $\mathcal{A}$-systems and prove that there exist graph operator systems whose coproduct is not a graph operator system, it is however a dual operator $\mathcal{A}$-system. More generally, the coproduct of dual operator $\mathcal{A}$-systems is always a dual operator $\mathcal{A}$-system. We show that the coproducts behave well with respect to inductive limits of operator systems.</description>

      <title>Semigroups of self-similar actions and higher rank Baumslag-Solitar semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07062v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we initiate the study of higher rank Baumslag-Solitar semigroups and their related C*-algebras. We focus on two extreme, but interesting, classes - one is related to products of odometers and the other is related to Furstenberg's $\times p,, \times q$ conjecture. For the former class, whose C*-algebras are studied by H. Li and the second author, we here characterize the factoriality of the associated von Neumann algebras and further determine their types; for the latter, we obtain their canonical Cartan subalgebras. In the rank 1 case, we study a more general setting which encompasses (single-vertex) generalized Baumslag-Solitar semigroups. One of our main tools is from self-similar higher rank graphs and their C*-algebras.</description>

      <title>Cartan semigroups and twisted groupoid C*-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05024v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that twisted groupoid C*-algebras are characterised, up to isomorphism, by having Cartan semigroups, a natural generalisation of normaliser semigroups of Cartan subalgebras. This extends the classic Kumjian-Renault theory to general twisted \'etale groupoid C*-algebras, even non-reduced C*-algebras of non-effective groupoids.</description>

      <title>Absolutely dilatable bimodule maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08086v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We characterise absolutely dilatable completely positive maps on the space of all bounded operators on a Hilbert space that are also bimodular over a given von Neumann algebra as rotations by a suitable unitary on a larger Hilbert space followed by slicing along the trace of an additional ancilla. We define the local, quantum and approximately quantum types of absolutely dilatable maps, according to the type of the admissible ancilla. We show that the local absolutely dilatable maps admit an exact factorisation through an abelian ancilla and show that they are limits in the point weak* topology of conjugations by unitaries in the commutant of the given von Neumann algebra. We show that the Connes Embedding Problem is equivalent to deciding if all absolutely dilatable maps are approximately quantum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14057v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a subproduct system of finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces using the Motzkin planar algebra and its Jones-Wenzl idempotents, which generalizes the Temperley-Lieb subproduct system of Habbestad and Neshveyev. We provide a description of the corresponding Toeplitz and Cuntz-Pimsner C$^*$-algebras as universal C$^*$-algebras, defined in terms of generators and relations, and we highlight properties of their representation theory.</description>

      <title>A note on Arveson's hyperrigidity and non-degenerate C*-correspondences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16618v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the results of Kim, and of Katsoulis and Ramsey concerning hyperrigidity for non-degenerate C*-correspondences. We show that the tensor algebra is hyperrigid, if and only if Katsura's ideal acts non-degenerately, if and only if Katsura's ideal acts non-degenerately under any representation. This gives a positive answer to the question of Katsoulis and Ramsey, showing that their necessary condition and their sufficient condition for hyperrigidity of the tensor algebra are equivalent. Non-degeneracy of the left action of Katsura's ideal was also shown by Kim to be equivalent to hyperrigidity for the selfadjoint operator space associated with the C*-correspondence, and our approach provides a simplified proof of this result as well. In the process we revisit Arveson's criterion connecting maximality with the unique extension property and hyperrigidity, in conjunction with the work of Salomon on generating sets.</description>

      <title>Measure equivalence rigidity of $\mathrm{Out}(F_N)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.03696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2103.03696v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that for every $N\ge 3$, the group $\mathrm{Out}(F_N)$ of outer automorphisms of a free group of rank $N$ is superrigid from the point of view of measure equivalence: any countable group that is measure equivalent to $\mathrm{Out}(F_N)$, is in fact virtually isomorphic to $\mathrm{Out}(F_N)$.
  We introduce three new constructions of canonical splittings associated to a subgroup of $\mathrm{Out}(F_N)$ of independent interest. They encode respectively the collection of invariant free splittings, invariant cyclic splittings, and maximal invariant free factor systems. Our proof also relies on the following improvement of an amenability result by Bestvina and the authors: given a free factor system $\mathcal{F}$ of $F_N$, the action of $\mathrm{Out}(F_N,\mathcal{F})$ (the subgroup of $\mathrm{Out}(F_N)$ that preserves $\mathcal{F}$) on the space of relatively arational trees with amenable stabilizer is a Borel amenable action.</description>
