      <title>Wigner function under changes of reference frames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the transformation laws of the Wigner function under changes of reference frames. By employing the coordinate transformation of the wave functions, we derive an integral representation for the transformed Wigner function in both position and momentum representations. To illustrate our results, we include some basic examples.</description>

      <title>On fluctuations of Coulomb systems and universality of the Heine distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a class of external potentials on the complex plane $\mathbb{C}$ for which the coincidence set to the obstacle problem contains a Jordan curve in the exterior of the droplet. We refer to this curve as a spectral outpost. We study the corresponding Coulomb gas at $\beta=2$. Generalizing recent work in the radially symmetric case, we prove that the number of particles which fall near the spectral outpost has an asymptotic Heine distribution, as the number of particles $n\to\infty$.We also consider a class of potentials with disconnected droplets whose connected components are separated by a ring-shaped spectral gap. We prove that the fluctuations of the number of particles that fall near a given component has an asymptotic discrete normal distribution, which depends on $n$. For the case of disconnected droplets we also consider fluctuations of general smooth linear statistics and show that they tend to distribute as the sum of a Gaussian field and an independent, oscillatory, discrete Gaussian field. Our techniques involve a new asymptotic formula on the norm of monic orthogonal polynomials in the bifurcation regime and a variant of the method of limit Ward identities of Ameur, Hedenmalm, and Makarov.</description>

      <title>Transmission eigenvalue distribution in disordered media from anisotropic field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10355v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A field theory for the distribution of transmission eigenvalues through a disordered medium is developed in details. The central equation of this theory is a self-consistent transport equation for a $2\times 2$ matrix radiance. This equation determines the transmission eigenvalue distribution not only in the diffusive regime but also in the quasiballistic regime, where the radiance is expected to be significantly anisotropic in the material bulk. We show that the matrix transport equation can be solved analytically in this regime. We also show that, in addition to the finite-width waveguide, our equation is able to predict the transmission eigenvalue distribution through an infinite slab.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Field Theory of Wave Transmission Statistics in Disordered Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10360v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a field theory to characterize the mean distribution of transmission eigenvalues for coherent wave propagation through a disordered medium. Unlike the Dorokhov-Mello-Pereyra-Kumar (DMPK) theory, our approach does not rely on the isotropy hypothesis, which assumes uniform field intensity across scattering channels. As a result, it accurately predicts the transmission eigenvalue distribution both in the diffusive and quasiballistic regime. In addition, it proves to be more versatile than the DMPK theory, allowing for the incorporation of physical effects such as absorption or partial channel control with minimal adjustments to the formalism. Although these effects are commonly encountered in experiments on complex media, until now there has been no ab initio theory addressing them. Our predictions are numerically validated against transmission eigenvalue distributions computed from the microscopic wave equation.</description>

      <title>Traveling Wave Solutions to Brenner-Navier-Stokes-Fourier system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As a continuum model for compressible fluid flows, Howard Brenner proposed the so-called Brenner-Navier-Stokes-Fourier(BNSF) system that improves some flaws of the Navier-Stokes-Fourier(NSF) system. For BNSF system, the volume velocity concept is introduced and is far different from the mass velocity of NSF, since the density of a compressible fluid is inhomogeneous. Although BNSF was introduced more than ten years ago, the mathematical study on BNSF is still in its infancy. We consider the BNSF system in the Lagrangian mass coordinates. We prove the existence and uniqueness of monotone traveling wave solutions to the BNSF system. We also present some quantitative estimates for them.</description>

      <title>Parametric Autoresonance with Time-Delayed Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate how a constant time delay influences a parametric autoresonant system. This is a nonlinear system driven by a parametrically chirped force with a negative delay-feedback that maintains adiabatic phase locking with the driving frequency. This phase locking results in a continuous amplitude growth, regardless of parameter changes. Our study reveals a critical threshold for delay strength; above this threshold, autoresonance is sustained, while below it, autoresonance diminishes. We examine the interplay between time delay and autoresonance stability, using multi-scale perturbation methods to derive analytical results, which are corroborated by numerical simulations. Ultimately, the goal is to understand and control autoresonance stability through the time-delay parameters. \end{abstract}</description>

      <title>On the solutions of a factorized wave equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long-distance transmission of energy by waves is a key mechanism for many natural processes. It becomes possible when the inhomogeneous medium is arranged in such a manner that it enables a specific type of waves to propagate with virtually no reflection or scattering. If the corresponding wave equation admits factorization, at least one of the waves it describes propagates without reflection. The paper is devoted to searching for conditions under which both solutions of a one-dimensional factorized wave equation of the second order describe traveling waves, that is, waves propagating without reflection. Possible variants of wave structure are found and the results are compared with those obtained in previous studies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we analytically evaluate certain classes of infinite sums involving special functions such as generalized hypergeometric functions, associated Laguerre polynomials, Bessel and Struve functions. The calculations are founded on the basic quantum mechanical principles applied to simple quantum mechanical models, namely half harmonic oscillator and model of a particle trapped inside an infinite potential well. We also show that some classes of functions which are not regular wave functions allow evaluation of additional infinite sums.</description>

      <title>Super-$\mathrm{Lie}_\infty$ T-Duality and M-Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Super $L_\infty$-algebras unify extended super-symmetry with rational classifying spaces for higher flux densities: The super-invariant super-fluxes which control super $p$-branes and their supergravity target super-spaces are, together with their (non-linear) Bianchi identities, neatly encoded in (non-abelian) super-$L_\infty$ cocycles. These are the rational shadows of flux-quantization laws (in ordinary cohomology, K-theory, Cohomotopy, iterated K-theory, etc).
  We first review, in streamlined form while filling some previous gaps, double-dimensional reduction/oxidation and 10D superspace T-duality along higher-dimensional super-tori. We do so tangent super-space wise, by viewing it as an instance of adjunctions (dualities) between super-$L_\infty$-extensions and -cyclifications, applied to the avatar super-flux densities of 10D supergravity. In particular, this yields a derivation, at the rational level, of the traditional laws of "topological T-duality" from the super-$L_\infty$ structure of type II superspace. At this level, we also discuss a higher categorical analog of T-duality involving M-branes.
  Then, by considering super-space T-duality along all 1+9 spacetime dimensions while retaining the 11th dimension as in F-theory, we find the M-algebra appearing as the complete brane-charge extension of the fully T-doubled/correspondence super-spacetime. On this backdrop, we recognize the "decomposed" M-theory 3-form on the "hidden M-algebra" as an M-theoretic lift of the Poincar\'e super 2-form that controls superspace T-duality as the integral kernel of the super Fourier-Mukai transform. This provides the super-space structure of an M-theory lift of the doubled/correspondence space geometry, which controls T-duality.</description>

      <title>Planar Novikov-Shubin invariant for adjacency matrices of structured directed dense random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Novikov-Shubin invariant associated to a graph provides information about the accumulation of eigenvalues of the corresponding adjacency matrix close to the origin. For a directed graph these eigenvalues lie in the complex plane and having a finite value for the planar Novikov-Shubin invariant indicates a polynomial behaviour of the eigenvalue density as a function of the distance to zero. We provide a complete description of these invariants for dense random digraphs with constant batch sizes, i.e. for the directed stochastic block model. The invariants depend only on which batches in the graph are connected by non-zero edge densities. We present an explicit finite step algorithm for their computation. For the proof we identify the asymptotic spectral density with the distribution of a $\mathbb{C}^K$-valued circular element in operator-valued free probability theory. We determine the spectral density in the bulk regime by solving the associated Dyson equation and infer the singular behaviour of this density close to the origin by determining the exponents associated to the power law with which the resolvent entries of the adjacency matrix that corresponds to the individual batches diverge to infinity or converge to zero.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a one-dimensional system of four inelastic hard spheres, colliding with a fixed restitution coefficient $r$, and we study the inelastic collapse phenomenon for such a particle system. We study a periodic, asymmetric collision pattern, proving that it can be realized, despite its instability. We prove that we can associate to the four-particle dynamical system another dynamical system of smaller dimension, acting on $\{1,2,3\} \times \mathbb{S}^2$, and that encodes the collision orders of each trajectory. We provide different representations of this new dynamical system, and study numerically its $\omega$-limit sets. In particular, the numerical simulations suggest that the orbits of such a system might be quasi-periodic.</description>

      <title>Pointwise Weyl Laws for Quantum Completely Integrable Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of the asymptotics of the spectral function for self-adjoint, elliptic differential, or more generally pseudodifferential, operators on a compact manifold has a long history. The seminal 1968 paper of H\"ormander, following important prior contributions by G\"arding, Levitan, Avakumovi\'c, and Agmon-Kannai (to name only some), obtained pointwise asymptotics (or a "pointwise Weyl law") for a single elliptic, self-adjoint operator.
  Here, we establish a microlocalized pointwise Weyl law for the joint spectral functions of quantum completely integrable (QCI) systems, $\overline{P}=(P_1,P_2,\dots, P_n)$, where $P_i$ are first-order, classical, self-adjoint, pseudodifferential operators on a compact manifold $M^n$, with $\sum P_i^2$ elliptic and $[P_i,P_j]=0$ for $1\leq i,j\leq n$. A particularly important case is when $(M,g)$ is Riemannian and $P_1=(-\Delta)^\frac12$. We illustrate our result with several examples, including surfaces of revolution.</description>

      <title>Global Minimality in Constrained Inverse Source Problems for Complex Electromagnetic Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00582</link>
      <description>arXiv:1810.00582v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Global minimality, boundedness, and uniqueness are established for a general, physically motivated class of inverse source problems in non-homogeneous electromagnetic media with generalized constitutive parameters. The existence of a solution was addressed earlier. The radiating source, represented by the current density, was reconstructed earlier by minimizing its $L^{2}$-norm constrained to produce a prescribed radiated field while ensuring vanishing reactive power. Using the $L^{2}$-norm allows for an analytically tractable measure of the physical resources of the source, while the reactive power constraint maximizes transmitted power. Numerical study suggests that sources within active metamaterial substrates can have remarkable tuning behaviors. Tuning stability can be achieved along specific permittivity and permeability curves on zero-reactive power plots. Each permittivity or permeability value can correspond to a discrete set of dual parameter values that enable effective tuning. The tuning characteristics observed suggest that double-positive (DPS) and double-negative (DNG) substrates are more favorable for tuning than single-negative (SNG) materials, possibly due to interactions dominant in DPS and DNG media.</description>

      <title>Lagrangian Multiform for Cyclotomic Gaudin Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12837v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a Lagrangian multiform for the class of cyclotomic (rational) Gaudin models by formulating its hierarchy within the Lie dialgebra framework of Semenov-Tian-Shansky and by using the framework of Lagrangian multiforms on coadjoint orbits. This provides the first example of a Lagrangian multiform for an integrable hierarchy whose classical $r$-matrix is non-skew-symmetric and spectral parameter-dependent. As an important by-product of the construction, we obtain a Lagrangian multiform for the periodic Toda chain by choosing an appropriate realisation of the cyclotomic Gaudin Lax matrix. This fills a gap in the landscape of Toda models as only the open and infinite chains had been previously cast into the Lagrangian multiform framework. A slightly different choice of realisation produces the so-called discrete self-trapping (DST) model. We demonstrate the versatility of the framework by coupling the periodic Toda chain with the DST model and by obtaining a Lagrangian multiform for the corresponding integrable hierarchy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15048v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the classical planar two-center problem of a particle $m$ subjected to harmonic-like interactions with two fixed centers. For convenient values of the dimensionless parameter of this problem we use the averaging theory for showing analytically the existence of periodic orbits bifurcating from two of the three equilibrium points of the Hamiltonian system modeling this problem. Moreover, it is shown that the system is generically non-integrable in the sense of Liouville-Arnold. The analytical results are complemented by numerical computations of the Poincar\'e sections and Lyapunov exponents. Explicit periodic orbits bifurcating from the equilibrium points are presented as well.</description>

      <title>Proposal of a quantum version of active particles via a nonunitary quantum walk</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.15319v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The main aim of the present paper is to define an active particle in a quantum framework as a minimal model of quantum active matter and investigate the differences and similarities of quantum and classical active matter. Although the field of active matter has been expanding, most research has been conducted on classical systems. Here, we propose a truly deterministic quantum active-particle model with a nonunitary quantum walk as the minimal model of quantum active matter. We aim to reproduce results obtained previously with classical active Brownian particles; that is, a Brownian particle, with finite energy take-up, becomes active and climbs up a potential wall. We realize such a system with nonunitary quantum walks. We introduce new internal states, the ground state and the excited state, and a new nonunitary operator $N(g)$ for an asymmetric transition between the two states. The non-Hermiticity parameter $g$ promotes the transition to the excited state; hence, the particle takes up energy from the environment. For our quantum active particle, we successfully observe that the movement of the quantum walker becomes more active in a nontrivial manner as we increase the non-Hermiticity parameter $g$, which is similar to the classical active Brownian particle. We also observe three unique features of quantum walks, namely, ballistic propagation of peaks in one dimension, the walker staying on the constant energy plane in two dimensions, and oscillations originating from the resonant transition between the ground state and the excited state both in one and two dimensions.</description>

      <title>The free energy of the large-$N$ fermionic Chern$\small-$Simons theory in the 'temporal' gauge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.11020v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most of the computational evidence for the Bose$\small-$Fermi duality of fundamental fields coupled to $U(N)$ Chern$\small-$Simons theories originates in large-$N$ calculations performed in the light-cone gauge. This gauge is ill-suited to computations in curved spacetimes, like the evaluation of the partition function on $\Sigma_g\times S^1$ for arbitrary genus $g$. In this paper, we use another gauge, the 'temporal' gauge, to set up the computation of this partition function. In the large-$N$ limit, and the special case $\Sigma_g=\mathbb{R}^2$, we take the computation through to the end by setting up and solving the gap equations, generalizing tricks explored in arXiv:1410.0558 to finite temperature. Our final results are in perfect agreement with earlier light-cone gauge results, providing a consistency check of both the formalism developed in this paper as well as previously performed light-cone gauge computations. In a follow-up paper, we will report on using our formalism to explicitly compute the partition function on $S^2 \times S^1$ for a finite-sized sphere.</description>

      <title>Quantized geodesic lengths for Teichm\"uller spaces: algebraic aspects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14727v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1980's H Verlinde suggested to construct and use a quantization of Teichm\"uller spaces to construct spaces of conformal blocks for the Liouville conformal field theory. This suggestion led to a mathematical formulation by Fock in 1990's and later by Fock, Goncharov and Shen, called the modular functor conjecture, based on the Chekhov-Fock quantum Teichm\"uller theory. In 2000's Teschner combined the Chekhov-Fock version and the Kashaev version of quantum Teichm\"uller theory to construct a solution to a modified form of the conjecture. We embark on a direct approach to the conjecture based on the Chekhov-Fock(-Goncharov) theory. We construct quantized trace-of-monodromy along simple loops via Bonahon and Wong's quantum trace maps developed in 2010's, and investigate algebraic structures of them, which will eventually lead to construction and properties of quantized geodesic length operators. We show that a special recursion relation used by Teschner is satisfied by the quantized trace-of-monodromy, and that the quantized trace-of-monodromy for disjoint loops commute in a certain strong sense.</description>

      <title>Lie symmetries, closed-form solutions, and conservation laws of a constitutive equation modeling stress in elastic materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15593v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Lie-point symmetry method is used to find some closed-form solutions for a constitutive equation modeling stress in elastic materials. The partial differential equation (PDE), which involves a power law with arbitrary exponent n, was investigated by Mason and his collaborators (Magan et al., Wave Motion, 77, 156-185, 2018). The Lie algebra for the model is five-dimensional for the shearing exponent n &gt; 0, and it includes translations in time, space, and displacement, as well as time-dependent changes in displacement and a scaling symmetry. Applying Lie's symmetry method, we compute the optimal system of one-dimensional subalgebras. Using the subalgebras, several reductions and closed-form solutions for the model are obtained both for general exponent n and special case n = 1. Furthermore, it is shown that for general n &gt; 0 the model has interesting conservation laws which are computed with symbolic software using the scaling symmetry of the given PDE.</description>

      <title>Non-invertible duality and symmetry topological order of one-dimensional lattice models with spatially modulated symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04182v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the interplay between self-duality and spatially modulated symmetry of generalized $N$-state clock models, which include the transverse-field Ising model and ordinary $N$-state clock models as special cases. The spatially modulated symmetry of the model becomes trivial when the model's parameters satisfy a specific number-theoretic relation. We find that the duality is non-invertible when the spatially modulated symmetry remains nontrivial, and show that this non-invertibility is resolved by introducing a generalized $\mathbb{Z}_N$ toric code, which manifests ultraviolet/infrared mixing, as the bulk topological order. In this framework, the boundary duality transformation corresponds to the boundary action of a bulk symmetry transformation, with the endpoint of the bulk symmetry defect realizing the boundary duality defect. Our results illuminate not only a holographic perspective on dualities but also a relationship between spatially modulated symmetry and ultraviolet/infrared mixing in one higher dimension.</description>

      <title>A relativistic Hardy-type inequality with minimisers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07789v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove a sharp, weighted Hardy-type inequality for the Dirac operator. A key feature of our result is that the inequality is not only sharp but also attained, and we construct explicit minimizers that satisfy the equality case. This extends previous work on the spectral properties of Dirac operators, especially in the context of relativistic quantum mechanics and Coulomb-like potentials.</description>
