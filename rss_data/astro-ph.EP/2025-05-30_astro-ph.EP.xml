      <title>Connecting Planetary Composition with Formation: a New Paradigm Emerges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extensive ground and space based surveys have now characterized the properties of thousands of exoplanets; their radii, masses, orbits around their host stars, and the beginnings of accurate measurements of the chemical compositions of their atmospheres and cores. How are these properties linked to their formation in physically and chemically evolving protoplanetary disks wherein they accrete pebbles, planetesimals, and gas as they undergo migration? To address this challenge, our review assembles a large and varied body of exoplanet observations as well as recent Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) and James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations of disk structure, chemistry, kinematics, and winds. The latest advances in theory and MHD simulations that bear on these issues are also reviewed and compared with the observations. Taken together, this review argues that a new dynamic paradigm for planet formation is emerging wherein MHD disk winds and not disk turbulence play a central role in disk evolution and planet formation including: angular momentum transport, gap and ring formation. disk astrochemistry, and planet formation and migration. These processes leave their mark on the resulting atmospheric composition, radii, and orbital characteristics of exoplanet populations, offering the possibility of future observational tests.</description>

      <title>The fraction of polar aligned circumbinary disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Circumbinary gas disks that are misaligned to the binary orbital plane evolve toward either a coplanar or a polar-aligned configuration with respect to the binary host. The preferred alignment depends on the dynamics of the disk: whether it undergoes librating or circulating nodal precession, with librating disks evolving to polar inclinations and circulating disks evolving to coplanar. We quantify the fraction of binary star systems whose disks are expected to have polar orbits $f_\text{polar}$, extending previous work to include disks with non-zero mass. Our results suggest that, for low mass disks, the polar fraction is highly sensitive to the distribution of binary eccentricity with a higher fraction expected for higher binary eccentricities, $f_{\rm polar}\sim e_{\rm b}$. However, for massive discs, the fraction is independent of the binary eccentricity and $f_{\rm polar}\approx 0.37$. The value of $f_\text{polar}$ is always reduced in a population with a greater preference for low initial mutual inclination. We also explore the consequences of the finite lifetime and non-zero radial extent of a real disk, both of which affect a disk's ability to complete its evolution to a stationary configuration. Our findings can be used to make predictions given populations with well-understood distributions of binary eccentricity, initial mutual inclination, and disk angular momentum.</description>

      <title>Origin of compact exoplanetary systems during disk infall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exoplanetary systems that contain multiple planets on short-period orbits appear to be prevalent in the current observed exoplanetary population, yet the processes that give rise to such configurations remain poorly understood. A common prior assumption is that planetary accretion commences after the infall of gas and solids to the circumstellar disk ended. However, observational evidence indicates that accretion may begin earlier. We propose that compact systems are surviving remnants of planet accretion that occurred during the final phases of infall. In regions of the disk experiencing ongoing infall, the planetary mass is set by the balance between accretion of infalling solids and the increasingly rapid inward migration driven by the surrounding gas as the planet grows. This balance selects for similarly-sized planets whose mass is a function of infall and disk conditions. We show that infall-produced planets can survive until the gas disk disperses and migration ends, and that across a broad range of conditions, the mass of surviving systems is regulated to a few 10^{-5} to 10^{-4} times the host star's mass. This provides an explanation for the similar mass ratios of known compact systems.</description>

      <title>A Terminology and Quantitative Framework for Assessing the Habitability of Solar System and Extraterrestrial Worlds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The search for extraterrestrial life in the Solar System and beyond is a key science driver in astrobiology, planetary science, and astrophysics. A critical step is the identification and characterization of potential habitats, both to guide the search and to interpret its results. However, a well-accepted, self-consistent, flexible, and quantitative terminology and method of assessment of habitability are lacking. Our paper fills this gap based on a three year-long study by the NExSS Quantitative Habitability Science Working Group. We reviewed past studies of habitability, but find that the lack of a universally valid definition of life prohibits a universally applicable definition of habitability. A more nuanced approach is needed. We introduce a quantitative habitability assessment framework (QHF) that enables self-consistent, probabilistic assessment of the compatibility of two models: First, a habitat model, which describes the probability distributions of key conditions in the habitat. Second, a viability model, which describes the probability that a metabolism is viable given a set of environmental conditions. We provide an open-source implementation of this framework and four examples as a proof of concept: (a) Comparison of two exoplanets for observational target prioritization; (b) Interpretation of atmospheric O2 detection in two exoplanets; (c) Subsurface habitability of Mars; and (d) Ocean habitability in Europa. These examples demonstrate that our framework can self-consistently inform astrobiology research over a broad range of questions. The proposed framework is modular so that future work can expand the range and complexity of models available, both for habitats and for metabolisms.</description>

      <title>MOA-2022-BLG-091Lb and KMT-2024-BLG-1209Lb: Microlensing planets detected through weak caustic-crossing signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The light curves of the microlensing events MOA-2022-BLG-091 and KMT-2024-BLG-1209 exhibit anomalies with very similar features. These anomalies appear near the peaks of the light curves, where the magnifications are moderately high, and are distinguished by weak caustic-crossing features with minimal distortion while the source remains inside the caustic. To achieve a deeper understanding of these anomalies, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the lensing events. We carried out binary-lens modeling with a thorough exploration of the parameter space. This analysis revealed that the anomalies in both events are of planetary origin, although their exact interpretation is complicated by different types of degeneracy. In the case of MOA-2022-BLG-091, the main difficulty in the interpretation of the anomaly arises from a newly identified degeneracy related to the uncertain angle at which the source trajectory intersects the planet-host axis. For KMT-2024-BLG-1209, the interpretation is affected by the previously known inner-outer degeneracy, which leads to ambiguity between solutions in which the source passes through either the inner or outer caustic region relative to the planet host. Bayesian analysis indicates that the planets in both lens systems are giant planets with masses about 2 to 4 times that of Jupiter, orbiting early K-type main-sequence stars. Both systems are likely located in the Galactic disk at a distance of around 4 kiloparsecs. The degeneracy in KMT-2024-BLG-1209 is challenging to resolve because it stems from intrinsic similarities in the caustic structures of the degenerate solutions. In contrast, the degeneracy in MOA-2022-BLG-091, which occurs by chance rather than from inherent characteristics, is expected to be resolved by the future space based Roman RGES microlensing survey.</description>

      <title>The Narrow Formation Pathway of Hot Saturns: Constraints on Initial Planetary Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The observed exoplanet population exhibits a scarcity of short-period Saturn-mass planets, a phenomenon referred to as the ``hot Saturn desert". This observational scarcity can be utilized to validate the theories regarding the formation and evolution of gas planets. In this study, we conduct large-scale numerical simulations to explore how the initial conditions of gas planets orbiting solar-type and M-dwarf stars influence their evolutionary trajectories in the semi-major axis versus planetary radius ($a$-$R$) parameter space. We generate a synthetic population of 10,000 short-period gaseous planets by systematically varying their initial planetary masses ($M_{\rm p}$), initial planetary luminosities ($L_{\rm p}$), initial core mass fractions ($f_{\rm core}$), and semi-major axis ($a$). Furthermore, we assume these gaseous planets have ceased orbital migration and model their long-term thermal evolution, taking into account the impacts of atmospheric evaporation. Our results show that the initial mass, $L_{\rm p}$, and $f_{\rm core}$ are the dominant factors controlling radius evolution for short-period gas planets. The key to survival as a hot Saturn analogue appears to be having just the right combination of properties after gas disk dissipation: an $M_{\rm p}$ below 0.5 Jupiter Mass ($M_{\rm Jup}$), a substantial $f_{\rm core}$ of $\geq$ 30%, and relatively low $L_{\rm p}$ on the order of $10^{-6}$ solar luminosity ($L_{\odot}$) or less. The survival criteria for hot Saturn analogs align with theoretically unfavorable initial conditions of gas planets formed via core accretion scenario, naturally explaining the observed boundaries of the hot Saturn desert.</description>

      <title>Detecting Atmospheric CO2 Trends as Population-Level Signatures for Long-Term Stable Water Oceans and Biotic Activity on Temperate Terrestrial Exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying key observables is essential for enhancing our knowledge of exoplanet habitability and biospheres, as well as improving future mission capabilities. While currently challenging, future observatories such as the Large Interferometer for Exoplanets (LIFE) will enable atmospheric observations of a diverse sample of temperate terrestrial worlds. Using thermal emission spectra that represent conventional predictions of atmospheric CO2 variability across the Habitable Zone (HZ), we assess the ability of the LIFE mission - as a specific concept for a future space-based interferometer - to detect CO2 trends indicative of the carbonate-silicate (Cb-Si) weathering feedback, a well-known habitability marker and potential biological tracer. Therefore, we explore the feasibility of differentiating between CO2 trends in biotic and abiotic planet populations. We create synthetic exoplanet populations based on geochemistry-climate predictions and perform retrievals on simulated thermal emission observations. The results demonstrate the robust detection of population-level CO2 trends in both biotic and abiotic scenarios for population sizes as small as 30 Exo-Earth Candidates (EECs) and the lowest assessed spectrum quality in terms of signal-to-noise ratio, S/N = 10, and spectral resolution, R = 50. However, biased CO2 partial pressure constraints hinder accurate differentiation between biotic and abiotic trends. If these biases were corrected, accurate differentiation could be achieved for populations with $\geq$ 100 EECs. We conclude that LIFE can effectively enable population-level characterization of temperate terrestrial atmospheres and detect Cb-Si cycle driven CO2 trends as habitability indicators. Nevertheless, the identified biases underscore the importance of testing atmospheric characterization performance against the broad diversity expected for planetary populations.</description>

      <title>Is Ozone a Reliable Proxy for Molecular Oxygen? II. The impact of N$_2$O on the O$_2$-O$_3$ relationship for Earth-like atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular oxygen (O2) will be an important molecule in the search for biosignatures in terrestrial planetary atmospheres in the coming decades. In particular, O2 combined with a reducing gas is thought to be strong evidence for disequilibrium caused by surface life. However, there are circumstances where it would be very difficult or impossible to detect O2, in which cases it has been suggested that ozone (O3), the photochemical product of O2, could be used instead. Unfortunately, the O2-O3 relationship is highly nonlinear and dependent on the host star, as shown in detail in the first paper in this series. We explore the O2-O3 relationship around G0V-M5V host stars, using climate/photochemistry modeling to simulate atmospheres while varying abundances of O2 and nitrous oxide (N2O). N2O is of particular importance to the O2-O3 relationship not just because it is produced biologically, but because it is the primary source of nitrogen oxides (NOx), which fuel the NOx catalytic cycle which destroys O3, and the smog mechanism that produces O3. We vary the O2 mixing ratio from 0.01-150% present atmospheric level (PAL), and N2O abundances of 10% and 1000% PAL. We find that varying N2O impacts the O2-O3 relationship differently depending strongly on both the host star and the amount of atmospheric O2. Planets orbiting hotter hosts with strong UV fluxes efficiently convert N2O into NOx, often depleting a significant amount of O3 via faster NOx catalytic cycles. However, for cooler hosts and low O2 levels we find that increasing N2O can lead to an increase of overall O3 due to the smog mechanism producing O3 in the lower atmosphere. Variations in O3 result in significant changes in the amount of harmful UV reaching the surfaces of the model planets as well as the strength of the 9.6 $\mu$m O3 emission spectral feature, demonstrating potential impacts on habitability and future observations.</description>

      <title>Apache Point rapid response characterization of primitive pre-impact detection asteroid 2024 RW$_1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pre-impact detection asteroids (PIDAs) may be detected only a few hours before their impact with Earth, providing a brief opportunity to characterize them before impact. We describe the characterization of PIDA 2024 RW$_1$, which was discovered by the Catalina Sky Survey on 2024 September 4 at 05:43 UTC, before it entered the atmosphere near the northern Philippines at 16:39 UTC. We observed 2024 RW$_1$ with the Astrophysical Research Consortium Telescope Imaging Camera on the Apache Point Astrophysical Research Consortium's 3.5-m telescope on 2024 September 4 10:16 UTC. We obtained g, r, i, and z photometry of 2024 RW$_1$, yielding color indices of g-r = 0.47$\pm$0.04, r-i = 0.13$\pm$0.04, i-z = -0.11$\pm$0.07, and g-i = 0.60$\pm$0.04, corresponding to a spectral slope of 0.67$\pm$0.40~$\%$/100 nm. The closest match to an asteroid spectral type is with B-type asteroids from the C-complex. We detect variations in the time series photometry of the asteroid with an amplitude of $\sim$0.75, and a double-peaked rotation period of $\sim$1900 s. Assuming a visible albedo of 0.07 and a density of $\sim$1500 kg/m$^3$, and using the derived absolute magnitude of 32.2$\pm$0.5, we calculate that the asteroid has a diameter of 1.8$\pm$0.4 m and a total mass of $\sim$5000 kg. The most likely source of 2024 RW$_1$ is the 3:1 mean motion resonance followed by the $\nu_6$ resonance, according to NEOMOD3.</description>

      <title>A differentiable N-body code for transit timing and dynamical modelling -- II. Photodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03874v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exoplanet transits contain substantial information about the architecture of a system. By fitting transit light curves we can extract dynamical parameters and place constraints on the properties of the planets and their host star. Having a well-defined probabilistic model plays a crucial role in making robust measurements of these parameters, and the ability to differentiate the model provides access to more robust inference tools. Gradient-based inference methods can allow for more rapid and accurate sampling of high-dimensional parameter spaces. We present a fully differentiable photodynamical model for multiplanet transit light curves that display transit timing variations. We model time-integrated exposures, compute the dynamics of a system over the full length of observations, and provide analytic expressions for derivatives of the flux with respect to the dynamical and photometric model parameters. The model has been implemented in the Julia language and is available open-source on GitHub. We demonstrate with a simulated data set that Bayesian inference with the NUTS HMC algorithm, which uses the model gradient, can outperform the affine invariant (e.g. emcee) MCMC algorithm in CPU time per effective sample, and we find that the relative sampling efficiency improves with the number of model parameters.</description>

      <title>The Spin-Orbit Alignment of 8 Warm Gas Giant Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08692v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Essential information about the formation and evolution of planetary systems can be found in their architectures -- in particular, in stellar obliquity ($\psi$) -- as they serve as a signature of their dynamical evolution. Here, we present ESPRESSO observations of the Rossiter-Mclaughlin (RM) effect of 8 warm gas giants, revealing that independent of the eccentricities, all of them have relatively aligned orbits. Our 5 warm Jupiters -- WASP-106 b, WASP-130 b, TOI-558 b, TOI-4515 b, and TOI-5027 b -- have sky-projected obliquities $|\lambda|\simeq0-10$ deg while the 2 less massive warm Saturns -- K2-139 b and K2-329 A b -- are slightly misaligned having $|\lambda|\simeq15-25$ deg. Furthermore, for K2-139 b, K2-329 A b, and TOI-4515 b, we also measure true 3D obliquities $\psi\simeq15-30$ deg. We also report a non-detection of the RM effect produced by TOI-2179 b. Through hierarchical Bayesian modeling of the true 3D obliquities of hot and warm Jupiters, we find that around single stars, warm Jupiters are statistically more aligned than hot Jupiters. Independent of eccentricities, 95\% of the warm Jupiters have $\psi\lesssim30$ deg with no misaligned planets, while hot Jupiters show an almost isotropic distribution of misaligned systems. This implies that around single stars, warm Jupiters form in primordially aligned protoplanetary disks and subsequently evolve in a more quiescent way than hot Jupiters. Finally, we find that Saturns may have slightly more misaligned orbits than warm Jupiters, but more obliquity measurements are necessary to be conclusive.</description>

      <title>A cometary Fluorescence Model for the $\nu_3$ Vibrational Band of Cyanogen</title>

Abstract: Cyanogen (\ce{C_2N_2}) is suspected for a long time to be present in comets and to contribute to the creation of CN radical. So far no observations with ground-based facilities managed to detect this species but the Rosetta mission, thanks to in situ observations with the ROSINA mass spectrometer detected this species in the coma of 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. To investigate its presence from infrared spectra in other comets, we developed a fluorescence model for the $\nu_3$ fundamental band. From new laboratory high-resolution infrared spectra of cyanogen, we analyzed the region of the $\nu_3$ band of \ce{C_2N_2}, centered around \SI{4.63}{\micro\meter} (\SI{2158}{\per\centi\meter}). In addition to line positions and intensities, molecular parameters for the ground and excited vibrational state were obtained. These parameters allowed us to develop a fluorescence model for cyanogen. Line-by-line excitation rates of the $\nu_3$ band of cyanogen in cometary comae are presented. An upper limit of the abundance of cyanogen in a spectrum of comet C/2022 E3 (ZTF) is discussed.</description>

      <title>SHARAD Illuminates Deeper Martian Subsurface Structures with a Boost from Very Large Rolls of the MRO Spacecraft</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21810</link>

Abstract: Throughout its mission, the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) has often rolled about its along-track axis by up to 28{\deg} to partially compensate for the suboptimal location of the Shallow Radar (SHARAD) antenna along an edge of the spacecraft that is opposite the imaging payload deck, thereby enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of echoes returned from the surface. After recent modeling work predicted that a much larger roll would improve the S/N by ~10 dB relative to nadir-pointed observing, MRO began a limited series of 120{\deg} roll maneuvers to test the effects on radar sounding. Three such SHARAD very-large-roll (VLR) observations have been acquired since May 2023, and they show dramatic improvements in signal clarity and depth of penetration, with S/N increasing by 9, 11, and 14 dB over that of nearly coincident observations at 0{\deg} roll angle. In low dielectric terrains, the first and second VLR observations enabled basal detections at depths previously unachievable, reaching depths of 800 m in Medusae Fossae materials and 1500 m through the ice of Ultimi Scopuli, respectively. The second VLR observation also obtained enhanced reflections throughout the ice stack. In the higher dielectric terrain of Amazonis Planitia, the third VLR observation improved continuity of a dipping subsurface interface, but it revealed neither an extension of the interface to greater depths nor any deeper interfaces. The MRO mission intends to obtain more SHARAD VLR observations of polar terrains and of midlatitude glacial and ground ices, sediments, and volcanics.</description>

      <title>Experimental demonstration of electric power generation from Earth's rotation through its own magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15790v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Earth rotates through the axisymmetric part of its own magnetic field, but a simple proof shows that it is impossible to use this to generate electricity in a conductor rotating with Earth.However, we previously identified implicit assumptions underlying this proof and showed theoretically that these could be violated and the proof circumvented. This requires using a soft magnetic material with a topology satisfying a particular mathematical condition and a composition and scale favoring magnetic diffusion, i.e. having a low magnetic Reynolds number Rm (C.F. Chyba, K.P. Hand, Electric power generation from Earth's rotation through its own magnetic field. Phys. Rev. Applied 6, 014017-1-18 (2016)). Here we realize these requirements with a cylindrical shell of manganese-zinc ferrite. Controlling for thermoelectric and other potentially confounding effects (including 60 Hz and RF background), we show that this small demonstration system generates a continuous DC voltage and current of the (low) predicted magnitude. We test and verify other predictions of the theory: voltage and current peak when the cylindrical shell's long axis is orthogonal to both Earth's rotational velocity v and magnetic field; voltage and current go to zero when the entire apparatus (cylindrical shell together with current leads and multimeters) is rotated 90 degrees to orient the shell parallel to v; voltage and current again reach a maximum but of opposite sign when the apparatus is rotated a further 90 degrees; an otherwise-identical solid MnZn cylinder generates zero voltage at all orientations; and a highRm cylindrical shell produces zero voltage. We also reproduce the effect at a second experimental location. The purpose of these experiments was to test the existence of the predicted effect. Ways in which this effect might be scaled to generate higher voltage and current may now be investigated.</description>
