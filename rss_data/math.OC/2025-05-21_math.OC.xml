      <title>Controllability and Inverse Problems for Hyperbolic and Dispersive Equations with Dynamic Boundary Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This review examines classical and recent results on controllability and inverse problems for hyperbolic and dispersive equations with dynamic boundary conditions. We aim to illustrate the applicability of Carleman estimates to establish exact controllability of such equations and derive Lipschitz stability estimates for inverse problems of source terms and coefficients with general dynamic boundary conditions. We highlight the challenges associated with dynamic boundary conditions compared to classical static ones. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of open problems and future research directions.</description>

      <title>Learning POMDPs with Linear Function Approximation and Finite Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study reinforcement learning with linear function approximation and finite-memory approximations for partially observed Markov decision processes (POMDPs). We first present an algorithm for the value evaluation of finite-memory feedback policies. We provide error bounds derived from filter stability and projection errors. We then study the learning of finite-memory based near-optimal Q values. Convergence in this case requires further assumptions on the exploration policy when using general basis functions. We then show that these assumptions can be relaxed for specific models such as those with perfectly linear cost and dynamics, or when using discretization based basis functions.</description>

      <title>Strong Formulations and Algorithms for Regularized A-optimal Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Regularized A-optimal Design (RAOD) problem, which selects a subset of $k$ experiments to minimize the inverse of the Fisher information matrix, regularized with a scaled identity matrix. RAOD has broad applications in Bayesian experimental design, sensor placement, and cold-start recommendation. We prove its NP-hardness via a reduction from the independent set problem. By leveraging convex envelope techniques, we propose a new convex integer programming formulation for RAOD, whose continuous relaxation dominates those of existing formulations. More importantly, we demonstrate that our continuous relaxation achieves bounded optimality gaps for all $k$, whereas previous relaxations may suffer from unbounded gaps. This new formulation enables the development of an exact cutting-plane algorithm with superior efficiency, especially in high-dimensional and small-$k$ scenarios. We also investigate scalable forward and backward greedy algorithms for solving RAOD, each with provable performance guarantees for different $k$ ranges. Finally, our numerical results on synthetic and real data demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed exact and approximation algorithms. We further showcase the practical effectiveness of RAOD by applying it to a real-world user cold-start recommendation problem.</description>

      <title>Customized Interior-Point Methods Solver for Embedded Real-Time Convex Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a customized convex optimization solver tailored for embedded real-time optimization, which frequently arise in modern guidance and control (G&amp;C) applications. The solver employs a practically efficient predictor-corrector type primal-dual interior-point method (PDIPM) combined with a homogeneous embedding framework for infeasibility detection. Unlike conventional homogeneous self-dual embedding formulations, the adopted approach can directly handle quadratic cost functions without requiring problem reformulation. To support a systematic workflow, we also develop a code generation tool that analyzes the sparsity pattern of the provided problem family and generates customized solver code using a predefined code template. The generated solver code is written in C with no external dependencies other than the standard library math.h, and it supports complete static allocation of all data. Additionally, it provides parsing information to facilitate the use of the solver API by end users. Benchmark results and numerical experiments on an embedded platform demonstrate that the developed solver outperforms existing solvers in both efficiency and reliability.</description>

      <title>Singular Perturbation in Multiscale Stochastic Control Problems with Domain Restriction in the Slow Variable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates multiscale stochastic optimal control problems that arise from the integration of intermittent renewable energy sources into the Brazilian power system. We conduct a rigorous analysis of state-constrained control problems and establish foundational results using the theory of viscosity solutions for degenerate Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations with Neumann-type boundary conditions. A singular perturbation framework is developed to analyze the convergence of multiscale value functions in infinite-horizon settings. Two examples are presented to illustrate the theoretical contributions of the proposed framework.</description>

      <title>On the equivalence between functionally affine LPV state-space representations and LFT models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a transformation algorithm for a class of Linear Parameter-Varying (LPV) systems with functional affine dependence on parameters, where the system matrices depend affinely on nonlinear functions of the scheduling varable, into Linear Fractional Transformation (LFT) systems. The transformation preserves input-output behavior and minimality, and the uncertainity block of the resulting LFT system is linear in the scheduling variables of the LPV system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we propose an efficient way to compute equilibria of a general class of set-valued Lur'e dynamical systems, which plays an important role in the asymptotical analysis of the systems. Besides the equilibria computation, our study can be also used to solve a class of quasi-variational inequalities. Some examples of finding Nash quasi-equilibria in game theory are given.</description>

      <title>Inverse Optimization via Learning Feasible Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study inverse optimization (IO), where the goal is to use a parametric optimization program as the hypothesis class to infer relationships between input-decision pairs. Most of the literature focuses on learning only the objective function, as learning the constraint function (i.e., feasible regions) leads to nonconvex training programs. Motivated by this, we focus on learning feasible regions for known linear objectives and introduce two training losses along with a hypothesis class to parameterize the constraint function. Our hypothesis class surpasses the previous objective-only method by naturally capturing discontinuous behaviors in input-decision pairs. We introduce a customized block coordinate descent algorithm with a smoothing technique to solve the training problems, while for further restricted hypothesis classes, we reformulate the training optimization as a tractable convex program or mixed integer linear program. Synthetic experiments and two power system applications, including comparisons with state-of-the-art approaches, showcase and validate the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>An ideal-sparse generalized moment problem reformulation for completely positive tensor decomposition exploiting maximal cliques of multi-hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the completely positive tensor decomposition problem with ideal-sparsity. First, we propose an algorithm to generate the maximal cliques of multi-hypergraphs associated with completely positive tensors. This also leads to a necessary condition for tensors to be completely positive. Then, the completely positive tensor decomposition problem is reformulated into an ideal-sparse generalized moment problem. It optimizes over several lower dimensional measure variables supported on the maximal cliques of a multi-hypergraph. The moment-based relaxations are applied to solve the reformulation. The convergence of this ideal-sparse moment hierarchies is studied. Numerical results show that the ideal-sparse problem is faster to compute than the original dense formulation of completely positive tensor decomposition problems. It also illustrates that the new reformulation utilizes sparsity structures that differs from the correlative and term sparsity for completely positive tensor decomposition problems.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Inertial Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the Adaptive Inertial Method (AIM), a novel framework for accelerated first-order methods through a customizable inertial term. We provide a rigorous convergence analysis establishing a global convergence rate of O(1/k) under mild conditions, requiring only convexity and local Lipschitz differentiability of the objective function. Our method enables adaptive parameter selection for the inertial term without manual tuning. Furthermore, we derive the particular form of the inertial term that transforms AIM into a new Quasi-Newton method. Notably, under specific circumstances, AIM coincides with the regularized Newton method, achieving an accelerated rate of O(1/k^2) without Hessian inversions. Through extensive numerical experiments, we demonstrate that AIM exhibits superior performance across diverse optimization problems, highlighting its practical effectiveness.</description>

      <title>On Discounted Infinite-Time Mean Field Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the infinite-time mean field games with discounting, establishing an equilibrium where individual optimal strategies collectively regenerate the mean-field distribution. To solve this problem, we partition all agents into a representative player and the social equilibrium. When the optimal strategy of the representative player shares the same feedback form with the strategy of the social equilibrium, we say the system achieves a Nash equilibrium.
  We construct a Nash equilibrium using the stochastic maximum principle and infinite-time forward-backward stochastic differential equations. By employing the elliptic master equation, we provide a representation for the Nash equilibrium.</description>

      <title>A Stochastic Programming Model for Anticipative Planning of Integrated Electricity and Gas Systems with Bidirectional Energy Flows under Fuel and CO2 Price Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A two-stage multi-period mixed-integer linear stochastic programming model is proposed to assist qualified operators in long-term generation and transmission expansion planning of electricity and gas systems to meet policy objectives. The first-stage decisions concern investments in new plants, new connections in the electricity and gas sectors, and the decommissioning of existing thermal power plants; the second-stage variables represent operational decisions, with uncertainty about future fuel and CO2 prices represented by scenarios. The main features of the model are: (i) the bidirectional conversion between electricity and gas enabled by Power-to-Gas and thermal power plants, (ii) a detailed representation of short-term operation, crucial for addressing challenges associated with integrating large shares of renewables in the energy mix, and (iii) an integrated planning framework to evaluate the operation of flexibility resources, their ability to manage non-programmable generation, and their economic viability. Given the computational complexity of the proposed model, in this paper we also implement a solution algorithm based on Benders decomposition to compute near-optimal solutions. A case study on the decarbonisation of the Italian integrated energy system demonstrates the effectiveness of the model. The numerical results show: (i) the importance of including a detailed system representation for obtaining reliable results, and (ii) the need to consider price uncertainty to design adequate systems and reduce overall costs.</description>

      <title>Multi-horizon optimization for domestic renewable energy system design under uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we address the challenge of designing optimal domestic renewable energy systems under multiple sources of uncertainty appearing at different time scales. Long-term uncertainties, such as investment and maintenance costs of different technologies, are combined with short-term uncertainties, including solar radiation, electricity prices, and uncontrolled load variations. We formulate the problem as a multistage multi-horizon stochastic Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model, minimizing the total cost of a domestic building complex's energy system. The model integrates long-term investment decisions, such as the capacity of photovoltaic panels and battery energy storage systems, with short-term operational decisions, including energy dispatch, grid exchanges, and load supply. To ensure robust operation under extreme scenarios, first- and second-order stochastic dominance risk-averse measures are considered preserving the time consistency of the solution. Given the computational complexity of solving the stochastic MILP for large instances, a rolling horizon-based matheuristic algorithm is developed. Additionally, various lower-bound strategies are explored, including wait-and-see schemes, expected value approximations, multistage grouping and clustering schemes. Extensive computational experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods on a case study based on a building complex in South Germany, tackling models with over 20 million constraints, 5 million binary variables, and 6 million continuous variables.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium models to analyse the impact of different coordination schemes between TSO and DSOs on market power in sequentially-cleared energy and ancillary services markets under load and renewable generation uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The current massive installation of distributed resources in electricity distribution systems is transforming these systems into active dispatching subjects. At the same time, the need to compensate for the intermittent generation of an increasing amount of renewable sources creates the need to acquire more ancillary services. Flexible resources in the distribution system could provide these services not only within the perimeter of the distribution network to which they are connected but also for the benefit of the transmission system. However, this requires Transmission System Operators (TSOs) and Distribution System Operators (DSOs) to coordinate their dispatching actions effectively. One critical aspect of this coordination is establishing a market architecture that limits market power. This paper presents an innovative game-theoretic approach to compare different TSO-DSO coordination models for acquiring ancillary services from distribution resources. Several schemes are considered: some with coordinated market management by TSOs and DSOs, others with sequential or independent local markets. For each scheme, the dispatching problem is formulated as a two-stage stochastic sequential game, where the first stage is the day-ahead market and the second stage is the balancing market. Nash equilibrium solutions are obtained by iteratively solving the profit maximization problem of each market player. Numerical tests on a CIGRE benchmark network show that coordination schemes enabling distribution resources to provide ancillary services to the transmission system can significantly increase system costs when congestion occurs in the transmission network.</description>

      <title>An adaptive proximal safeguarded augmented Lagrangian method for nonsmooth DC problems with convex constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A proximal safeguarded augmented Lagrangian method for minimizing the difference of convex (DC) functions over a nonempty, closed and convex set with additional linear equality as well as convex inequality constraints is presented. Thereby, all functions involved may be nonsmooth. Iterates (of the primal variable) are obtained by solving convex optimization problems as the concave part of the objective function gets approximated by an affine linearization. Under the assumption of a modified Slater constraint qualification, both convergence of the primal and dual variables to a generalized Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) point is proven, at least on a subsequence. Numerical experiments and comparison with existing solution methods are presented using some classes of constrained and nonsmooth DC problems.</description>

      <title>Riemannian EXTRA: Communication-efficient decentralized optimization over compact submanifolds with data heterogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider decentralized optimization over a compact Riemannian submanifold in a network of $n$ agents, where each agent holds a smooth, nonconvex local objective defined by its private data. The goal is to collaboratively minimize the sum of these local objective functions. In the presence of data heterogeneity across nodes, existing algorithms typically require communicating both local gradients and iterates to ensure exact convergence with constant step sizes. In this work, we propose REXTRA, a Riemannian extension of the EXTRA algorithm [Shi et al., SIOPT, 2015], to address this limitation. On the theoretical side, we leverage proximal smoothness to overcome the challenges of manifold nonconvexity and establish a global sublinear convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(1/k)$, matching the best-known results. To our knowledge, REXTRA is the first algorithm to achieve a global sublinear convergence rate under a constant step size while requiring only a single round of local iterate communication per iteration. Numerical experiments show that REXTRA achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, while supporting larger step sizes and reducing total communication by over 50\%.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates two optimization criteria for damping optimization in a multi-body oscillator system with arbitrary degrees of freedom ($n$), resembling string/rod free vibrations. The total average energy over all possible initial data and the total average displacement over all possible initial data. Our first result shows that both criteria are equivalent to the trace minimization of the solution of the Lyapunov equation with different right-hand sides. As the second result, we prove that in the case of damping with one damper, for the discrete system, the minimal trace for each criterion can be expressed as a linear or cubic function of the dimension $n$. Consequently, the optimal damping position is determined solely by the number of dominant eigenfrequencies and the optimal viscosity, independent of the dimension $n$, offering efficient damping optimization in discrete systems. The paper concludes with numerical examples illustrating the presented theoretical framework and results.</description>

      <title>Safe Control for Pursuit-Evasion with Density Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter presents a density function based safe control synthesis framework for the pursuit-evasion problem. We extend safety analysis to dynamic unsafe sets by formulating a reach-avoid type pursuit-evasion differential game as a robust safe control problem. Using density functions and semi-algebraic set definitions, we derive sufficient conditions for weak eventuality and evasion, reformulating the problem into a convex sum-of-squares program solvable via standard semidefinite programming solvers. This approach avoids the computational complexity of solving the Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs partial differential equation, offering a scalable and efficient framework. Numerical simulations demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Distributionally Robust Planning of Hydrogen-Electrical Microgrids for Sea Islands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a distributionally robust planning method for hydrogen-electrical microgrids over islands, where the cross-island energy exchange is supported by a maritime hydrogen transport network. This planning problem is complicated due to heterogeneous off-shore wind-driven uncertainties (i.e., renewable power, transport availability, demand fluctuations, and grid faulting), a subset of which exhibit endogenous uncertainty, as they can be affected by proactive measures (e.g., grid hardening) or infrastructure investment. To capture these features, a two-stage distributionally robust optimization (DRO) model is developed considering decision-dependent uncertainty (DDU), which encompasses variation of the underlying distributional ambiguity due to the change of the first stage decisions. Notably, the complete recourse property is missing, which is often neglected in existing DRO studies. Nevertheless, different from the case for land-based microgrids, this issue is critical and fundamental for sea island systems due to their particular physical and logistical requirements. To address these issues, we develop a C&amp;CG algorithm that is customized with strong cutting planes to handle DRO with a varying DDU ambiguity set and feasibility requirements. Numerical results demonstrate the cost-effectiveness and resilience of the proposed planning framework, along with the nontrivial improvements of the algorithm in both solution accuracy and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>New Understandings and Computation on Augmented Lagrangian Methods for Low-Rank Semidefinite Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Augmented Lagrangian Method (ALM) combined with Burer-Monteiro (BM) factorization, dubbed ALM-BM, offers a powerful approach for solving large-scale low-rank semidefinite programs (SDPs). Despite its empirical success, the theoretical understandings of the resulting non-convex ALM-BM subproblems, particularly concerning their structural properties and efficient subproblem solvability by first-order methods, still remain limited. This work addresses these notable gaps by providing a rigorous theoretical analysis. We demonstrate that, under appropriate regularity of the original SDP, termed as primal simplicity, ALM subproblems inherit crucial properties such as low-rankness and strict complementarity when the dual variable is localized. Furthermore, ALM subproblems are shown to enjoy a quadratic growth condition, building on which we prove that the non-convex ALM-BM subproblems can be solved to global optimality by gradient descent, achieving linear convergence under conditions of local initialization and dual variable proximity. Through illustrative examples, we further establish the necessity of these local assumptions, revealing them as inherent characteristics of the problem structure. Motivated by these theoretical insights, we propose ALORA, a rank-adaptive augmented Lagrangian method that builds upon the ALM-BM framework, which dynamically adjusts the rank using spectral information and explores negative curvature directions to navigate the nonconvex landscape. Exploiting modern GPU computing architectures, ALORA exhibits strong numerical performance, solving SDPs with tens of millions of dimensions in hundreds of seconds.</description>

      <title>Optimization and the Topology of Spaces of Parseval Frames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Parseval frame is a spanning set for a Hilbert space which satisfies the Parseval identity: a vector can be expressed as a linear combination of the frame whose coefficients are inner products with the frame vectors. There is considerable interest within the signal processing community in the structural properties of the space of finite-dimensional Parseval frames whose vectors all have the same norm, or which satisfy more general prescribed norm constraints. In this paper, we introduce a function on the space of arbitrary spanning sets that jointly measures the failure of a spanning set to satisfy both the Parseval identity and given norm constraints. We show that, despite its nonconvexity, this function has no spurious local minimizers, thereby extending the Benedetto--Fickus theorem to this non-compact setting. In particular, this shows that gradient descent converges to an equal norm Parseval frame when initialized within a dense open set in the associated matrix space. We then apply this result to study the topology of frame spaces. Using our Benedetto--Fickus-type result, we realize spaces of Parseval frames with prescribed norms as deformation retracts of simpler spaces, leading to explicit conditions which guarantee the vanishing of their homotopy groups. These conditions yield new path-connectedness results for spaces of real Parseval frames, generalizing the Frame Homotopy Theorem, which has seen significant interest in recent years.</description>

      <title>Group Distributionally Robust Optimization with Flexible Sample Queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Group distributionally robust optimization (GDRO) aims to develop models that perform well across $m$ distributions simultaneously. Existing GDRO algorithms can only process a fixed number of samples per iteration, either 1 or $m$, and therefore can not support scenarios where the sample size varies dynamically. To address this limitation, we investigate GDRO with flexible sample queries and cast it as a two-player game: one player solves an online convex optimization problem, while the other tackles a prediction with limited advice (PLA) problem. Within such a game, we propose a novel PLA algorithm, constructing appropriate loss estimators for cases where the sample size is either 1 or not, and updating the decision using follow-the-regularized-leader. Then, we establish the first high-probability regret bound for non-oblivious PLA. Building upon the above approach, we develop a GDRO algorithm that allows an arbitrary and varying sample size per round, achieving a high-probability optimization error bound of $O\left(\frac{1}{t}\sqrt{\sum_{j=1}^t \frac{m}{r_j}\log m}\right)$, where $r_t$ denotes the sample size at round $t$. This result demonstrates that the optimization error decreases as the number of samples increases and implies a consistent sample complexity of $O(m\log (m)/\epsilon^2)$ for any fixed sample size $r\in[m]$, aligning with existing bounds for cases of $r=1$ or $m$. We validate our approach on synthetic binary and real-world multi-class datasets.</description>

      <title>Linear Convergence of Plug-and-Play Algorithms with Kernel Denoisers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The use of denoisers for image reconstruction has shown significant potential, especially for the Plug-and-Play (PnP) framework. In PnP, a powerful denoiser is used as an implicit regularizer in proximal algorithms such as ISTA and ADMM. The focus of this work is on the convergence of PnP iterates for linear inverse problems using kernel denoisers. It was shown in prior work that the update operator in standard PnP is contractive for symmetric kernel denoisers under appropriate conditions on the denoiser and the linear forward operator. Consequently, we could establish global linear convergence of the iterates using the contraction mapping theorem. In this work, we develop a unified framework to establish global linear convergence for symmetric and nonsymmetric kernel denoisers. Additionally, we derive quantitative bounds on the contraction factor (convergence rate) for inpainting, deblurring, and superresolution. We present numerical results to validate our theoretical findings.</description>

Abstract: Phase retrieval is an inverse problem that, on one hand, is crucial in many applications across imaging and physics, and, on the other hand, leads to deep research questions in theoretical signal processing and applied harmonic analysis. This survey paper is an outcome of the recent workshop Phase Retrieval in Mathematics and Applications (PRiMA) (held on August 5--9 2024 at the Lorentz Center in Leiden, The Netherlands) that brought together experts working on theoretical and practical aspects of the phase retrieval problem with the purpose to formulate and explore essential open problems in the field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a continuous-time equivalent to the well-known iterative linear-quadratic algorithm including an implementation of a backtracking line-search policy and a novel regularization approach based on the necessary conditions in the Riccati pass of the linear-quadratic regulator. This allows the algorithm to effectively solve trajectory optimization problems with non-convex cost functions, which is demonstrated on the cart-pole swing-up problem. The algorithm compatibility with state-of-the-art suites of numerical integration solvers allows for the use of high-order adaptive-step methods. Their use results in a variable number of time steps both between passes of the algorithm and across iterations, maintaining a balance between the number of function evaluations and the discretization error.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper examines a broadly applicable triangular normal form for two-input x-flat control-affine systems. First, we show that this triangular form encompasses a wide range of established normal forms. Next, we prove that any x-flat system can be transformed into this triangular structure after a finite number of prolongations of each input. Finally, we introduce a refined algorithm for identifying candidates for x-flat outputs. Through illustrative examples, we demonstrate the usefulness of our results. In particular, we show that the refined algorithm exceeds the capabilities of existing methods for computing flat outputs based on triangular forms.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a model-based deep-learning approach to solve finite-horizon continuous-time stochastic control problems with jumps. We iteratively train two neural networks: one to represent the optimal policy and the other to approximate the value function. Leveraging a continuous-time version of the dynamic programming principle, we derive two different training objectives based on the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, ensuring that the networks capture the underlying stochastic dynamics. Empirical evaluations on different problems illustrate the accuracy and scalability of our approach, demonstrating its effectiveness in solving complex, high-dimensional stochastic control tasks.</description>

      <title>Fair Supervised Learning Through Constraints on Smooth Nonconvex Unfairness-Measure Surrogates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new strategy for fair supervised machine learning is proposed. The main advantages of the proposed strategy as compared to others in the literature are as follows. (a) We introduce a new smooth nonconvex surrogate to approximate the Heaviside functions involved in discontinuous unfairness measures. The surrogate is based on smoothing methods from the optimization literature, and is new for the fair supervised learning literature. The surrogate is a tight approximation which ensures the trained prediction models are fair, as opposed to other (e.g., convex) surrogates that can fail to lead to a fair prediction model in practice. (b) Rather than rely on regularizers (that lead to optimization problems that are difficult to solve) and corresponding regularization parameters (that can be expensive to tune), we propose a strategy that employs hard constraints so that specific tolerances for unfairness can be enforced without the complications associated with the use of regularization. (c)~Our proposed strategy readily allows for constraints on multiple (potentially conflicting) unfairness measures at the same time. Multiple measures can be considered with a regularization approach, but at the cost of having even more difficult optimization problems to solve and further expense for tuning. By contrast, through hard constraints, our strategy leads to optimization models that can be solved tractably with minimal tuning.</description>

      <title>A Distributed Optimization Framework to Regulate the Electricity Consumption of a Residential Neighborhood with Renewables</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.09954v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Demand response services at the distribution level are emerging as enabling strategies for improving grid reliability in the presence of intermittent renewable generation and grid congestion. For residential loads, space heating and cooling, water heating, electric vehicle charging, and routine appliances make up the bulk of the electricity consumption. Controlling these loads is essential to effectively partake into grid operations and provide services such as peak shaving and demand response. However, maintaining user comfort is important for ensuring user participation to such a program. This paper formulates a novel mixed integer linear programming problem to control the overall electricity consumption of a residential neighborhood by considering the users' comfort and preferences. To efficiently solve the problem for communities involving a large number of homes, a distributed optimization framework based on the Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition technique is developed. We demonstrate the load shaping capacity and the computational performance of the proposed optimization framework in a simulated environment.</description>

Abstract: We investigate time-dependent optimization problems in fractional Sobolev spaces with the sparsity promoting $L^p$-pseudo norm for $0&lt;p&lt;1$ in the objective functional. In order to avoid computing the fractional Laplacian on the time-space cylinder $I\times \Omega$, we introduce an auxiliary function $w$ on $\Omega$ that is an upper bound for the function $u\in L^2(I\times\Omega)$. We prove existence and regularity results and derive a necessary optimality condition. This is done by smoothing the $L^p$-pseudo norm and by penalizing the inequality constraint regarding $u$ and $w$. The problem is solved numerically with an iterative scheme whose weak limit points satisfy a weaker form of the necessary optimality condition.</description>

Abstract: This paper proposes and develops new Newton-type methods to solve structured nonconvex and nonsmooth optimization problems with justifying their fast local and global convergence by means of advanced tools of variational analysis and generalized differentiation. The objective functions belong to a broad class of prox-regular functions with specification to constrained optimization of nonconvex structured sums. We also develop a novel line search method, which is an extension of the proximal gradient algorithm while allowing us to globalize the proposed coderivative-based Newton methods by incorporating the machinery of forward-backward envelopes. Applications and numerical experiments, which are provided for nonconvex least squares regression models, Student's t-regression, and image restoration problems, demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithms</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a particle-based optimization method designed for addressing minimization problems with equality constraints, particularly in cases where the loss function exhibits non-differentiability or non-convexity. The proposed method combines components from consensus-based optimization algorithm with a newly introduced forcing term directed at the constraint set. A rigorous mean-field limit of the particle system is derived, and the convergence of the mean-field limit to the constrained minimizer is established. Additionally, we introduce a stable discretized algorithm and conduct various numerical experiments to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method.</description>

Abstract: We consider separable nonconvex optimization problems under affine constraints. For these problems, the Shapley-Folkman theorem provides an upper bound on the duality gap as a function of the nonconvexity of the objective functions, but does not provide a systematic way to construct primal solutions satisfying that bound. In this work, we develop a two-stage approach to do so. The first stage approximates the optimal dual value with a large set of primal feasible solutions. In the second stage, this set is trimmed down to a primal solution by computing (approximate) Caratheodory representations. The main computational requirement of our method is tractability of the Fenchel conjugates of the component functions and their (sub)gradients. When the function domains are convex, the method recovers the classical duality gap bounds obtained via Shapley-Folkman. When the function domains are nonconvex, the method also recovers classical duality gap bounds from the literature, based on a more general notion of nonconvexity.</description>

      <title>Underapproximating Safe Domains of Attraction for Discrete-Time Systems Using Implicit Representations of Backward Reachable Sets</title>

Abstract: Analyzing and certifying stability and attractivity of nonlinear systems is a topic of research interest that has been extensively investigated by control theorists and engineers for many years. Despite that, accurately estimating domains of attraction for nonlinear systems remains a challenging task, where available estimation approaches are either conservative or limited to low-dimensional systems. In this work, we propose an iterative approach to accurately underapproximate safe (i.e., state-constrained) domains of attraction for general discrete-time autonomous nonlinear systems. Our approach relies on implicit representations of safe backward reachable sets of safe regions of attraction, where such regions can be be easily constructed using, e.g., quadratic Lyapunov functions. The iterations of our approach are monotonic (in the sense of set inclusion), where each iteration results in a safe region of attraction, given as a sublevel set, that underapproximates the safe domain of attraction. The sublevel set representations of the resulting regions of attraction can be efficiently utilized in verifying the inclusion of given points of interest in the safe domain of attraction. We illustrate our approach through two numerical examples, involving two- and four-dimensional nonlinear systems.</description>

      <title>Robust Energy System Design via Semi-infinite Programming</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14320v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time-series information needs to be incorporated into energy system optimization to account for the uncertainty of renewable energy sources. Typically, time-series aggregation methods are used to reduce historical data to a few representative scenarios but they may neglect extreme scenarios, which disproportionally drive the costs in energy system design. We propose the robust energy system design (RESD) approach based on semi-infinite programming and use an adaptive discretization-based algorithm to identify worst-case scenarios during optimization. The RESD approach can guarantee robust designs for problems with nonconvex operational behavior, which current methods cannot achieve. The RESD approach is demonstrated by designing an energy supply system for the island of La Palma. To improve computational performance, principal component analysis is used to reduce the dimensionality of the uncertainty space. The robustness and costs of the approximated problem with significantly reduced dimensionality approximate the full-dimensional solution closely. Even with strong dimensionality reduction, the RESD approach is computationally intense and thus limited to small problems.</description>

      <title>Fast filtering of non-Gaussian models using Amortized Optimal Transport Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12633v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present the amortized optimal transport filter (A-OTF) designed to mitigate the computational burden associated with the real-time training of optimal transport filters (OTFs). OTFs can perform accurate non-Gaussian Bayesian updates in the filtering procedure, but they require training at every time step, which makes them expensive. The proposed A-OTF framework exploits the similarity between OTF maps during an initial/offline training stage in order to reduce the cost of inference during online calculations. More precisely, we use clustering algorithms to select relevant subsets of pre-trained maps whose weighted average is used to compute the A-OTF model akin to a mixture of experts. A series of numerical experiments validate that A-OTF achieves substantial computational savings during online inference while preserving the inherent flexibility and accuracy of OTF.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15125v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a spectral optimal control framework for Fokker-Planck equations based on the standard ground state transformation that maps the Fokker-Planck operator to a Schrodinger operator. Our primary objective is to accelerate convergence toward the (unique) steady state. To fulfill this objective, a gradient-based iterative algorithm with Pontryagin's maximum principle and the Barzilai-Borwein update is developed to compute time-dependent controls. Numerical experiments on two-dimensional ill-conditioned normal distributions and double-well potentials demonstrate that our approach effectively targets slow-decaying modes, thus increasing the spectral gap.</description>

      <title>Tractable downfall of basis pursuit in structured sparse optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19126v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The problem of finding the sparsest solution to a linear underdetermined system of equations, often appearing, e.g., in data analysis, optimal control, and system identification problems, is considered. This non-convex problem is commonly solved by convexification via $\ell_1$-norm minimization, known as basis pursuit (BP). In this work, a class of structured matrices, representing the system of equations, is introduced for which (BP) tractably fails to recover the sparsest solution. In particular, this enables efficient identification of matrix columns corresponding to unrecoverable non-zero entries of the sparsest solution, determination of the uniqueness of such a solution, and certification of (BP) failing to compute a sparsest solution without prior knowledge on its non-zero entry locations. These deterministic guarantees contrast with popular probabilistic ones and provide valuable insights into the a priori design of sparse optimization problems. As our matrix structures appear naturally in optimal control problems, we exemplify our findings based on a fuel-optimal control problem for a class of discrete-time linear time-invariant systems.</description>

      <title>Riemannian Optimization on the Oblique Manifold for Sparse Simplex Constraints via Multiplicative Updates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24075v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low-rank optimization problems with sparse simplex constraints involve variables that must satisfy nonnegativity, sparsity, and sum-to-one conditions, making their optimization particularly challenging due to the interplay between low-rank structures and constraints. These problems arise in various applications, including machine learning, signal processing, environmental fields, and computational biology. In this paper, we propose a novel manifold optimization approach to tackle these problems efficiently. Our method leverages the geometry of oblique rotation manifolds to reformulate the problem and introduces a new Riemannian optimization method based on Riemannian gradient descent that strictly maintains the simplex constraints. By exploiting the underlying manifold structure, our approach improves optimization efficiency. Experiments on synthetic datasets compared to standard Euclidean and Riemannian methods show the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04112v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional solvable optimal control theory predominantly focuses on quadratic costs due to their analytical tractability, yet they often fail to capture critical non-linearities inherent in real-world systems including water, energy, agriculture, and financial networks. Here, we present a unified framework for solving discrete-time optimal control with higher-order state and control costs of power-law form. By building convex-completion techniques, we derive semi-explicit expressions for control laws, cost-to-go functions, and recursive coefficient dynamics across deterministic and stochastic system settings. Key contributions include variance-aware solutions under additive and multiplicative noise, extensions to mean-field-type-dependent dynamics, and conditions that ensure the positivity of recursive coefficients. In particular, we establish that higher-order costs induce less aggressive control policies compared to quadratic formulations, a finding that is validated through numerical analyses.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic quantization on Riemannian manifolds via covering growth estimates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13164v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantization problem looks for best approximations of a probability measure on a given metric space by finitely many points, where the approximation error is measured with respect to the Wasserstein distance. On particular smooth domains, such as $\mathbb{R}^d$ or complete Riemannian manifolds, the quantization error is known to decay polynomially as the number of points is taken to infinity, provided the measure satisfies an integral condition which controls the amount of mass outside compact sets. On Riemannian manifolds, the existing integral condition involves a quantity measuring the growth of the exponential map, for which the only available estimates are in terms of lower bounds on sectional curvature.
  In this paper, we provide a more general integral condition for the asymptotics of the quantization error on Riemannian manifolds, given in terms of the growth of the covering numbers of spheres, which is purely metric in nature and concerns only the large-scale growth of the manifold. We further estimate the covering growth of manifolds in two particular cases, namely lower bounds on the Ricci curvature and geometric group actions by a discrete group of isometries. These estimates can themselves generalize beyond manifolds, and hint at a future treatment of asymptotic quantization also on non-smooth metric measure spaces.</description>

      <title>DPO: A Differential and Pointwise Control Approach to Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15617v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) in continuous state-action spaces remains challenging in scientific computing due to poor sample efficiency and lack of pathwise physical consistency. We introduce Differential Reinforcement Learning (Differential RL), a novel framework that reformulates RL from a continuous-time control perspective via a differential dual formulation. This induces a Hamiltonian structure that embeds physics priors and ensures consistent trajectories without requiring explicit constraints. To implement Differential RL, we develop Differential Policy Optimization (DPO), a pointwise, stage-wise algorithm that refines local movement operators along the trajectory for improved sample efficiency and dynamic alignment. We establish pointwise convergence guarantees, a property not available in standard RL, and derive a competitive theoretical regret bound of $O(K^{5/6})$. Empirically, DPO outperforms standard RL baselines on representative scientific computing tasks, including surface modeling, grid control, and molecular dynamics, under low-data and physics-constrained conditions.</description>

      <title>Two-person Positive Shortest Path Games Have Nash Equilibria in Pure Stationary Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09257v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that every finite two-person shortest path game, where the local cost of every move is positive for each player, has a Nash equilibrium (NE) in pure stationary strategies, which can be computed in polynomial time. We also extend the existence result to infinite graphs with finite out-degrees. Moreover, our proof gives that a terminal NE (in which the play is a path from the initial position to a terminal) exists provided at least one of the two players can guarantee reaching a terminal. If none of the players can do it, in other words, if each of the two players has a strategy that separates all terminals from the initial position $s$, then, obviously, a cyclic NE exists, although its cost is infinite for both players, since we restrict ourselves to positive games. We conjecture that a terminal NE exists too, provided there exists a directed path from $s$ to a terminal. However, this is open.
  We extend our result to short paths interdiction games, where at each vertex, we allow one player to block some of the arcs and the other player to choose one of the non-blocked arcs. Assuming that blocking sets are chosen from an independence system given by an oracle, we give an algorithm for computing a NE in time $O(|E|(\log|V|+\tau))$, where $V$ is the set of vertices, $E$ is the set of arcs, and $\tau$ is the maximum time taken by the oracle on any input.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00661v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Designing efficient algorithms for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is fundamentally challenging because the size of the joint state and action spaces grows exponentially in the number of agents. These difficulties are exacerbated when balancing sequential global decision-making with local agent interactions. In this work, we propose a new algorithm $\texttt{SUBSAMPLE-MFQ}$ ($\textbf{Subsample}$-$\textbf{M}$ean-$\textbf{F}$ield-$\textbf{Q}$-learning) and a decentralized randomized policy for a system with $n$ agents. For any $k\leq n$, our algorithm learns a policy for the system in time polynomial in $k$. We prove that this learned policy converges to the optimal policy on the order of $\tilde{O}(1/\sqrt{k})$ as the number of subsampled agents $k$ increases. In particular, this bound is independent of the number of agents $n$.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Asynchronous Federated Learning: A~Delicate Trade-Off Between Model-Parameter Staleness and Update Frequency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08206v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Synchronous federated learning (FL) scales poorly with the number of clients due to the straggler effect. Algorithms like FedAsync and GeneralizedFedAsync address this limitation by enabling asynchronous communication between clients and the central server. In this work, we rely on stochastic modeling and analysis to better understand the impact of design choices in asynchronous FL algorithms, such as the concurrency level and routing probabilities, and we leverage this knowledge to optimize loss. Compared to most existing studies, we account for the joint impact of heterogeneous and variable service speeds and heterogeneous datasets at the clients. We characterize in particular a fundamental trade-off for optimizing asynchronous FL: minimizing gradient estimation errors by avoiding model parameter staleness, while also speeding up the system by increasing the throughput of model updates. Our two main contributions can be summarized as follows. First, we prove a discrete variant of Little's law to derive a closed-form expression for relative delay, a metric that quantifies staleness. This allows us to efficiently minimize the average loss per model update, which has been the gold standard in literature to date. Second, we observe that naively optimizing this metric leads us to slow down the system drastically by overemphazing staleness at the detriment of throughput. This motivates us to introduce an alternative metric that also takes system speed into account, for which we derive a tractable upper-bound that can be minimized numerically. Extensive numerical results show that these optimizations enhance accuracy by 10% to 30%.</description>

      <title>Differential topology of the spaces of asymptotically stable vector fields and Lyapunov functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10828v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the topology of the space of all smooth asymptotically stable vector fields on $\mathbb{R}^n$, as well as the space of all proper smooth Lyapunov functions for such vector fields. We prove that both spaces are path-connected and simply connected when $n\neq 4,5$ and weakly contractible when $n\leq 3$. Moreover, both spaces have the weak homotopy type of the nonlinear Grassmannian of submanifolds of $\mathbb{R}^n$ diffeomorphic to the $n$-disc.
  The proofs rely on Lyapunov theory and differential topology, such as the work of Smale and Perelman on the generalized Poincar\'{e} conjecture and results of Smale, Cerf, and Hatcher on the topology of diffeomorphism groups of discs. Applications include a partial answer to a question of Conley, a parametric Hartman-Grobman theorem for nonyperbolic but asymptotically stable equilibria, and a parametric Morse lemma for degenerate minima. We also study the related topics of hyperbolic equilibria, Morse minima, and relative homotopy groups of the space of asymptotically stable vector fields inside the space of those vanishing at a single point.</description>

      <title>Multiobjective optimization for scattering mitigation and scattering screen reconstruction in VLBI observations of the Galactic Center</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16257v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Imaging reconstruction of interferometric data is a hard ill-posed inverse problem. Its difficulty is increased when observing the Galactic Center, which is obscured by a scattering screen. This is because the scattering breaks the one-to-one correspondence between images and visibilities. Solving the scattering problem is one of the biggest challenges in radio imaging of the Galactic Center. In this work we present a novel strategy to mitigate its effect and constrain the screen itself using multiobjective optimization. We exploit the potential of evolutionary algorithms to describe the optimization landscape to recover the intrinsic source structure and the scattering screen affecting the data. We successfully recover both the screen and the source in a wide range of simulated cases, including the speed of a moving screen at 230 GHz. Particularly, we can recover a ring structure in scattered data at 86 GHz. Our analysis demonstrates the huge potential that recent advancements in imaging and optimization algorithms offer to recover image structures, even in weakly constrained and degenerated, possibly multi-modal settings. The successful reconstruction of the scattering screen opens the window to event horizon scale works on the Galactic Center at 86G Hz up to 116 GHz, and the study of the scattering screen itself.</description>
