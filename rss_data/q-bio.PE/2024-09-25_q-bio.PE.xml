      <title>A random planting model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The adoption of agroecological practices will be crucial to address the challenges of climate change and biodiversity loss. Such practices favor the cultivation of plants in complex mixtures with layouts differing from the monoculture approach of conventional agriculture. Inspired by random sequential adsorption processes, we propose a one-dimensional model in which the plants are represented as line segments that start as points and grow at a constant rate until they reach length $\sigma$ after a time interval $\tau$. The planting positions and times are randomly chosen with the constraint that plant overlap is forbidden. We apply an exact, event-driven simulation to investigate the resulting spatiotemporal patterns and yields in both mono- and duocultures. After a transient period, with oscillations in the density and coverage, the field reaches a steady state in which the mean age of plants is one half of the time to maturity. The structure of the active plants is characterized by correlation functions between the fluctuation of the age of a plant and its $k$th neighbour. Nearest neighbours are negatively correlated, while next nearest neighbours tend to have similar ages. The steady state yield increases with the planting rate and approaches a maximum value of 4/3 plants per unit length per unit time. For two species with the same size at maturity but different growth rates, the more slowly growing species is enriched in the harvest compared to the seed mix composition. If two species have the same time to maturity but different sizes, the smaller one is enriched in the harvest and, at a sufficiently high planting rate, the larger species may be completely absent. For two species with the same ratio of $\sigma/\tau$ the selectivity is insensitive to the planting rate. The model may be extended to higher dimensions, more species and other planting strategies.</description>

      <title>Robust estimation of end-of-outbreak probabilities in the presence of delayed and incomplete case reporting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Towards the end of an infectious disease outbreak, when a period has elapsed without new case notifications, a key question for public health policy makers is whether the outbreak can be declared over. This requires the benefits of a declaration (e.g., relaxation of outbreak control measures) to be balanced against the risk of a resurgence in cases. To support this decision making, mathematical methods have been developed to quantify the end-of-outbreak probability. Here, we propose a new approach to this problem that accounts for a range of features of real-world outbreaks, specifically: (i) incomplete case ascertainment; (ii) reporting delays; (iii) individual heterogeneity in transmissibility; and (iv) whether cases were imported or infected locally. We showcase our approach using two case studies: Covid-19 in New Zealand in 2020, and Ebola virus disease in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 2018. In these examples, we found that the date when the estimated probability of no future infections reached 95% was relatively consistent across a range of modelling assumptions. This suggests that our modelling framework can generate robust quantitative estimates that can be used by policy advisors, alongside other sources of evidence, to inform end-of-outbreak declarations.</description>

      <title>Impact of spatial structure on early and long-term adaptation in rugged fitness landscapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the exploration of rugged fitness landscapes by spatially structured populations with demes on the nodes of a graph, connected by migrations. In the rare migration regime, we find that finite structures can adapt more efficiently than very large ones, especially in high-dimensional fitness landscapes. Furthermore, we show that, in most landscapes, migration asymmetries associated with some suppression of natural selection allow the population to reach higher fitness peaks first. In this sense, suppression of selection can make early adaptation more efficient. However, the time it takes to reach the first fitness peak is then increased. We also find that suppression of selection tends to enhance finite-size effects. We extend our study to frequent migrations, suggesting that our conclusions hold in this regime. We then investigate the impact of spatial structure with rare migrations on long-term evolution by studying the steady state of the population. For this, we define an effective population size for the steady-state distribution. We find that suppression of selection is associated to reduced steady-state effective population sizes, and reduced average steady-state fitnesses.</description>

      <title>Opponent Shaping for Antibody Development</title>

Abstract: Anti-viral therapies are typically designed to target the current strains of a virus. Game theoretically, this corresponds to a short-sighted, or myopic, response. However, therapy-induced selective pressures act on viral antigens to drive the emergence of mutated strains, against which initial therapies have reduced efficacy. Building on a computational model of binding between antibodies and viral antigens (the Absolut! framework), we design and implement a genetic simulation of such viral evolutionary escape. Crucially, this allows our antibody optimisation algorithm to consider and influence the entire escape curve of the virus, i.e. to guide (or ''shape'') the viral evolution. This is inspired by opponent shaping which, in general-sum learning, accounts for the adaptation of the co-player rather than playing a myopic best response. Hence we call the optimised antibodies shapers. Within our simulations, we demonstrate that our shapers target both current and simulated future viral variants, outperforming the antibodies chosen in a myopic way. Furthermore, we show that shapers exert specific evolutionary pressure on the virus compared to myopic antibodies. Altogether, shapers modify the evolutionary trajectories of viral strains and minimise the viral escape compared to their myopic counterparts. While this is a simplified model, we hope that our proposed paradigm will enable the discovery of better long-lived vaccines and antibody therapies in the future, enabled by rapid advancements in the capabilities of simulation tools.
