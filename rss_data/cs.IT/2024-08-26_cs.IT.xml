      <title>RIS-Aided Unsourced Multiple Access (RISUMA): Coding Strategy and Performance Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers an unsourced random access (URA) set-up equipped with a passive reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), where a massive number of unidentified users (only a small fraction of them being active at any given time) are connected to the base station (BS). We introduce a slotted coding scheme for which each active user chooses a slot at random for transmitting its signal, consisting of a pilot part and a randomly spread polar codeword. The proposed decoder operates in two phases. In the first phase, called the RIS configuration phase, the BS detects the transmitted pilots. The detected pilots are then utilized to estimate the corresponding users' channel state information, using which the BS suitably selects RIS phase shift employing the proposed RIS design algorithms. The proposed channel estimator offers the capability to obtain the channel coefficients of the users whose pilots interfere with each other without prior access to the list of transmitted pilots or the number of active users. In the second phase, called the data phase, transmitted messages of active users are decoded. Moreover, we establish an approximate achievability bound for the RIS-based URA scheme, providing a valuable benchmark. Computer simulations show that the proposed scheme outperforms the state-of-the-art for RIS-aided URA.</description>

      <title>Mobile Edge Computing Networks: Online Low-Latency and Fresh Service Provisioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Edge service caching can significantly mitigate latency and reduce communication and computing overhead by fetching and initializing services (applications) from clouds. The freshness of cached service data is critical when providing satisfactory services to users, but has been overlooked in existing research efforts. In this paper, we study the online low-latency and fresh service provisioning in mobile edge computing (MEC) networks. Specifically, we jointly optimize the service caching, task offloading, and resource allocation without knowledge of future system information, which is formulated as a joint online long-term optimization problem. This problem is NP-hard. To solve the problem, we design a Lyapunov-based online framework that decouples the problem at temporal level into a series of per-time-slot subproblems. For each subproblem, we propose an online integrated optimization-deep reinforcement learning (OIODRL) method, which contains an optimization stage including a quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP) transformation and a semidefinite relaxation (SDR) method, and a learning stage including a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm. Extensive simulations show that the proposed OIODRL method achieves a near-optimal solution and outperforms other benchmark methods.</description>

      <title>Transmitter Actions for Secure Integrated Sensing and Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work models a secure integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system as a wiretap channel with action-dependent channel states and channel output feedback, e.g., obtained through reflections. The transmitted message is split into a common and a secure message, both of which must be reliably recovered at the legitimate receiver, while the secure message needs to be kept secret from the eavesdropper. The transmitter actions, such as beamforming vector design, affect the corresponding state at each channel use. The action sequence is modeled to depend on both the transmitted message and channel output feedback. For perfect channel output feedback, the secrecy-distortion regions are provided for physically-degraded and reversely-physically-degraded secure ISAC channels with transmitter actions. The corresponding rate regions when the entire message should be kept secret are also provided. The results are illustrated through characterizing the secrecy-distortion region of a binary example.</description>

      <title>Modeling and Statistical Characterization of Large-Scale Automotive Radar Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The impact of discrete clutter and co-channel interference on the performance of automotive radar networks has been studied using stochastic geometry, in particular, by leveraging two-dimensional Poisson point processes (PPPs). However, such characterization does not take into account the impact of street geometry and the fact that the location of the automotive radars are restricted to the streets as their domain rather than the entire Euclidean plane. In addition, the structure of the streets may change drastically as a vehicle moves out of a city center towards the outskirts. Consequently, not only the radar performance change but also the radar parameters and protocols must be adapted for optimum performance. In this paper, we propose and characterize line and Cox process-based street and point models to analyze large-scale automotive radar networks. We consider the classical Poisson line process (PLP) and the newly introduced Binomial line process (BLP) model to emulate the streets and the corresponding PPP-based Cox process to emulate the vehicular nodes. In particular, the BLP model effectively considers the spatial variation of street geometry across different parts of the city. We derive the effective interference set experienced by an automotive radar, the statistics of distance to interferers, and characterize the detection probability of the ego radar as a function of street and vehicle density. Finally, leveraging the real-world data on urban streets and vehicle density across different cities of the world, we present how the radar performance varies in different parts of the city as well as across different times of the day. Thus, our study equips network operators and automotive manufacturers with essential system design insights to plan and optimize automotive radar networks.</description>

      <title>A higher-order Otto calculus approach to the Gaussian completely monotone conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Gaussian completely monotone (GCM) conjecture states that the $m$-th time-derivative of the entropy along the heat flow on $\mathbb{R}^d$ is positive for $m$ even and negative for $m$ odd. We prove the GCM conjecture for orders up to $m=5$, assuming that the initial measure is log-concave, in any dimension. Our proof differs significantly from previous approaches to the GCM conjecture: it is based on Otto calculus and on the interpretation of the heat flow as the Wasserstein gradient flow of the entropy. Crucial to our methodology is the observation that the convective derivative behaves as a flat connection over probability measures on $\mathbb{R}^d$. In particular we prove a form of the univariate Faa di Bruno's formula on the Wasserstein space (despite it being curved), and we compute the higher-order Wasserstein differentials of internal energy functionals (including the entropy), both of which are of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Hybrid SIC Aided Hybrid NOMA: A New Approach For Improving Energy Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), which organically combines pure NOMA and conventional OMA, has recently received significant attention to be a promising multiple access framework for future wireless communication networks. However, most of the literatures on hybrid NOMA only consider fixed order of successive interference cancellation (SIC), namely FSIC, for the NOMA transmission phase of hybrid NOMA, resulting in limited performance. Differently, this paper aims to reveal the potential of applying hybrid SIC (HSIC) to improve the energy efficiency of hybrid NOMA. Specifically, a HSIC aided hybrid NOMA scheme is proposed, which can be treated as a simple add-on to the legacy orthogonal multiple access (OMA) based network. The proposed scheme offers some users (termed ``opportunistic users'') to have more chances to transmit by transparently sharing legacy users' time slots. For a fair comparison, a power reducing coefficient $\beta$ is introduced to ensure that the energy consumption of the proposed scheme is less than conventional OMA. Given $\beta$, the probability for the event that the achievable rate of the proposed HSIC aided hybrid NOMA scheme cannot outperform its OMA counterpart is obtained in closed-form, by considering impact of user pairing. Furthermore, asymptotic analysis shows that the aforementioned probability can approach zero under some given conditions in the SNR regime, indicating that the energy efficiency of the proposed scheme is almost surely higher than that of OMA for these given conditions. Numerical results are presented to verify the analysis and also demonstrate the benefit of applying HSIC compared to FSIC.</description>

      <title>Mini-Slot-Assisted Short Packet URLLC:Differential or Coherent Detection?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the primary challenges in short packet ultra-reliable and low-latency communications (URLLC) is to achieve reliable channel estimation and data detection while minimizing the impact on latency performance. Given the small packet size in mini-slot-assisted URLLC, relying solely on pilot-based coherent detection is almost impossible to meet the seemingly contradictory requirements of high channel estimation accuracy, high reliability, low training overhead, and low latency. In this paper, we explore differential modulation both in the frequency domain and in the time domain, and propose adopting an adaptive approach that integrates both differential and coherent detection to achieve mini-slot-assisted short packet URLLC, striking a balance among training overhead, system performance, and computational complexity. Specifically, differential (especially in the frequency domain) and coherent detection schemes can be dynamically activated based on application scenarios, channel statistics, information payloads, mini-slot deployment options, and service requirements. Furthermore, we derive the block error rate (BLER) for pilot-based, frequency domain, and time domain differential OFDM using non-asymptotic information-theoretic bounds. Simulation results validate the feasibility and effectiveness of adaptive differential and coherent detection.</description>

      <title>IQ-aware precoding for atomic MIMO receivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Leveraging the strong atom-light interaction, Rydberg atomic receivers significantly enhance the sensitivity of electromagnetic signal measurements, outperforming traditional antennas. Existing research primarily focuses on improving the architecture and signal detection algorithms of atomic receivers, while established signal processing schemes at the transmitter end have remained constant. However, these schemes fail to maximize the throughput of atomic receivers due to the nonlinearity of transmission model. To address this issue, we propose to design transmitter precoding in multiple-input multiple-output systems to achieve the capacity of atomic receivers. Initially, we harness a strong reference approximation to convert the nonlinear magnitude-detection model of atomic receivers into a linear real-part detector. Based on this approximation, we prove that the degree of freedom is min{Nr/2,Nt} for a MIMO system comprising an Nr-antenna atomic receiver and an Nt-antenna classic transmitter. To achieve the system capacity, we propose an IQ-aware fully digital precoding method. Unlike traditional complex-valued digital precoders that jointly manipulate the inphase and quadrature (IQ) symbols, our method employs four real matrices to independently precode the IQ baseband symbols, which is shown to be optimal for atomic receivers. Then, to eliminate the reliance on fully digital precoding architecture, we further explore IQ-aware hybrid precoding techniques. Our design incorporates a low-dimensional IQ-aware digital precoder and a high-dimensional complex analog precoder. Alternating minimization algorithms are proposed to produce IQ-aware hybrid precoders, with the objective of approaching the optimal IQ-aware fully digital precoder. Simulation results validate the superiority of proposed IQ-aware precoding methods over existing techniques in atomic MIMO communications.</description>

      <title>User-Access Point Association for High Density MIMO Wireless LANs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wireless local area network (WLAN) access points (APs) are being deployed in high density to improve coverage and throughput. The emerging multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) implementation for uplink (UL) transmissions promises high per-user throughput and improved aggregate network throughput. However, the high throughput potential of dense UL-MIMO WLAN is impaired by multiple access channel interference and high contention among densely distributed user stations (STAs). We investigate the problem of actualizing the throughput potential of UL-MIMO in high density WLANs via user-AP association. Since user-AP association influences interference and STA contention, a method to optimally distribute STAs among APs is proposed to maximize aggregate users' throughput utility. This problem is transformed into a graph matching problem with the throughput utility function as the graph edge weights. The graph matching problem is solved as a combinatorial problem using a modified classical Kuhn-Munkres algorithm. A dynamic implementation of the proposed algorithm is used to periodically update user-AP associations when there are changes in the network due to new entrants and/or user mobility. Simulated dense UL-MIMO WLAN scenarios reveal that the proposed scheme achieves an average of $36.9 \%$, $33.5 \%$, $20.4 \%$ and $11.3 \%$ gains over the default strongest signal first (SSF) association scheme used in conventional WLAN, Greedy [14], SmartAssoc [13] and best performance first (BPF) [5] algorithms, respectively.</description>

      <title>STAR-RIS-Aided Cell-Free Massive MIMO with Imperfect Hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers a simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS)-aided cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) system, accounting for imperfect hardware in spatially correlated fading channels. Specifically, we consider the hardware impairments and phase noise at transceivers, as well as the phase shift errors generated within the STAR-RIS. We commence by introducing the STAR-RIS signal model, channel model, and imperfect hardware components. Then, the linear minimum mean-square error (MMSE) channel estimate is derived with pilot contamination, which provides sufficient information for sequential data processing. Moreover, a channel capacity lower bound is derived in the case of a finite number of RIS elements and access points (APs), while a closed-form expression for the downlink ergodic spectral efficiency (SE) for maximum ratio (MR) precoding is also deduced, where only the channel statistics are used. Our numerical results demonstrate that the STAR-RIS-aided CF-mMIMO system achieves higher SE compared to the conventional CF-mMIMO system, even with imperfect hardware.</description>

      <title>Non-convex matrix sensing: Breaking the quadratic rank barrier in the sample complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the problem of reconstructing a low-rank matrix from a few linear measurements, two classes of algorithms have been widely studied in the literature: convex approaches based on nuclear norm minimization, and non-convex approaches that use factorized gradient descent. Under certain statistical model assumptions, it is known that nuclear norm minimization recovers the ground truth as soon as the number of samples scales linearly with the number of degrees of freedom of the ground-truth. In contrast, while non-convex approaches are computationally less expensive, existing recovery guarantees assume that the number of samples scales at least quadratically with the rank $r$ of the ground-truth matrix. In this paper, we close this gap by showing that the non-convex approaches can be as efficient as nuclear norm minimization in terms of sample complexity. Namely, we consider the problem of reconstructing a positive semidefinite matrix from a few Gaussian measurements. We show that factorized gradient descent with spectral initialization converges to the ground truth with a linear rate as soon as the number of samples scales with $ \Omega (rd\kappa^2)$, where $d$ is the dimension, and $\kappa$ is the condition number of the ground truth matrix. This improves the previous rank-dependence from quadratic to linear. Our proof relies on a probabilistic decoupling argument, where we show that the gradient descent iterates are only weakly dependent on the individual entries of the measurement matrices. We expect that our proof technique is of independent interest for other non-convex problems.</description>

      <title>Transmissive RIS Enabled Transceiver Systems:Architecture, Design Issues and Opportunities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is anticipated to augment the performance of beyond fifth-generation (B5G) and sixth-generation (6G) networks by intelligently manipulating the state of its components. Rather than employing reflective RIS for aided communications, this paper proposes an innovative transmissive RIS-enabled transceiver (TRTC) architecture that can accomplish the functions of traditional multi-antenna systems in a cost-effective and energy-efficient manner. First, the proposed network architecture and its corresponding transmission scheme are elaborated from the perspectives of downlink (DL) and uplink (UL) transmissions. Then, we illustrate several significant advantages and differences of TRTC compared to other multiantenna systems. Furthermore, the downlink modulation and extraction principle based on time-modulation array (TMA) is introduced in detail to tackle the multi-stream communications. Moreover, a near-far field channel model appropriate for this architecture is proposed. Based on the channel model, we summarize some state-of-the-art channel estimation schemes, and the channel estimation scheme of TRTC is also provided. Considering the optimization for DL and UL communications, we present numerical simulations that confirm the superiority of the proposed optimization algorithm. Lastly, numerous prospective research avenues for TRTC systems are delineated to inspire further exploration.</description>

      <title>Quantum Illumination Advantage for Classification Among an Arbitrary Library of Targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum illumination (QI) is the task of querying a scene using a transmitter probe whose quantum state is entangled with a reference beam retained in ideal storage, followed by optimally detecting the target-returned light together with the stored reference, to make decisions on characteristics of targets at stand-off range, at precision that exceeds what is achievable with a classical transmitter of the same brightness and otherwise identical conditions. Using tools from perturbation theory, we show that in the limit of low transmitter brightness, high loss, and high thermal background, there is a factor of four improvement in the Chernoff exponent of the error probability in discriminating any number of apriori-known reflective targets when using a Gaussian-state entangled QI probe, over using classical coherent-state illumination (CI). While this advantage was known for detecting the presence or absence of a target, it had not been proven for the generalized task of discriminating between arbitrary target libraries. In proving our result, we derive simple general analytic expressions for the lowest-order asymptotic expansions of the quantum Chernoff exponents for QI and CI in terms of the signal brightness, loss, thermal noise, and the modal expansion coefficients of the target-reflected light's radiant exitance profiles when separated by a spatial mode sorter after entering the entrance pupil of the receiver's aperture.</description>

      <title>HRGraph: Leveraging LLMs for HR Data Knowledge Graphs with Information Propagation-based Job Recommendation</title>

Abstract: Knowledge Graphs (KGs) serving as semantic networks, prove highly effective in managing complex interconnected data in different domains, by offering a unified, contextualized, and structured representation with flexibility that allows for easy adaptation to evolving knowledge. Processing complex Human Resources (HR) data, KGs can help in different HR functions like recruitment, job matching, identifying learning gaps, and enhancing employee retention. Despite their potential, limited efforts have been made to implement practical HR knowledge graphs. This study addresses this gap by presenting a framework for effectively developing HR knowledge graphs from documents using Large Language Models. The resulting KG can be used for a variety of downstream tasks, including job matching, identifying employee skill gaps, and many more. In this work, we showcase instances where HR KGs prove instrumental in precise job matching, yielding advantages for both employers and employees. Empirical evidence from experiments with information propagation in KGs and Graph Neural Nets, along with case studies underscores the effectiveness of KGs in tasks such as job and employee recommendations and job area classification.

      <title>Generalized one-way function and its application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One-way functions are fundamental to classical cryptography and their existence remains a longstanding problem in computational complexity theory. Recently, a provable quantum one-way function has been identified, which maintains its one-wayness even with unlimited computational resources. Here, we extend the mathematical definition of functions to construct a generalized one-way function by virtually measuring the qubit of provable quantum one-way function and randomly assigning the corresponding measurement outcomes with identical probability. Remarkably, using this generalized one-way function, we have developed an unconditionally secure key distribution protocol based solely on classical data processing, which can then utilized for secure encryption and signature. Our work highlights the importance of information in characterizing quantum systems and the physical significance of the density matrix. We demonstrate that probability theory and randomness are effective tools for countering adversaries with unlimited computational capabilities.</description>

      <title>Beyond the I-MMSE relation: derivatives of mutual information in Gaussian channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.02500v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The I-MMSE formula connects two important quantities in information theory and estimation theory: the mutual information and the minimum mean-squared error (MMSE). It states that in a scalar Gaussian channel, the derivative of the mutual information with respect to the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is one-half of the MMSE. Although any derivative at a fixed order can be computed in principle, a general formula for all the derivatives is still unknown. In this paper, we derive this general formula for vector Gaussian channels. The obtained result is remarkably similar to the classic cumulant-moment relation in statistical theory.</description>

      <title>A manifold learning-based CSI feedback framework for FDD massive MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.14598v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) in Frequency Division Duplex (FDD) mode suffers from heavy feedback overhead for Channel State Information (CSI). In this paper, a novel manifold learning-based CSI feedback framework (MLCF) is proposed to reduce the feedback and improve the spectral efficiency for FDD massive MIMO. Manifold learning (ML) is an effective method for dimensionality reduction. However, most ML algorithms focus only on data compression, and lack the corresponding recovery methods. Moreover, the computational complexity is high when dealing with incremental data. Considering to utilize the intrinsic manifold structure where the CSI samples reside, we propose a landmark selection algorithm to describe the topological skeleton of this manifold. Based on the learned skeleton, the local patch of the incremental CSI on the manifold can be easily determined by its nearest landmarks. This motivates us to propose an incremental CSI compression and reconstruction scheme by keeping the local geometric relationships with landmarks invariant. We theoretically prove the convergence of the proposed landmark selection algorithm. Meanwhile, the upper bound on the error of approximating CSI with landmarks is derived. Simulation results under an industrial channel model of 3GPP demonstrate that the proposed MLCF outperforms existing deep learning based algorithms.</description>

      <title>An Information-Theoretic Approach for Detecting Edits in AI-Generated Text</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.12747v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a method to determine whether a given article was written entirely by a generative language model or perhaps contains edits by a different author, possibly a human. Our process involves multiple tests for the origin of individual sentences or other pieces of text and combining these tests using a method that is sensitive to rare alternatives, i.e., non-null effects are few and scattered across the text in unknown locations. Interestingly, this method also identifies pieces of text suspected to contain edits. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method in detecting edits through extensive evaluations using real data and provide an information-theoretic analysis of the factors affecting its success. In particular, we discuss optimality properties under a theoretical framework for text editing saying that sentences are generated mainly by the language model, except perhaps for a few sentences that might have originated via a different mechanism. Our analysis raises several interesting research questions at the intersection of information theory and data science.</description>

      <title>Mutual Information Optimization for SIM-Based Holographic MIMO Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18307v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the context of emerging stacked intelligent metasurface (SIM)-based holographic MIMO (HMIMO) systems, a fundamental problem is to study the mutual information (MI) between transmitted and received signals to establish their capacity. However, direct optimization or analytical evaluation of the MI, particularly for discrete signaling, is often intractable. To address this challenge, we adopt the channel cutoff rate (CR) as an alternative optimization metric for the MI maximization. In this regard, we propose an alternating projected gradient method (APGM), which optimizes the CR of a SIM-based HMIMO system by adjusting signal precoding and the phase shifts across the transmit and receive SIMs on a layer-by-layer basis. Simulation results indicate that the proposed algorithm significantly enhances the CR, achieving substantial gains, compared to the case with random SIM phase shifts, that are proportional to those observed for the corresponding MI. This justifies the effectiveness of using the channel CR for the MI optimization. Moreover, we demonstrate that the integration of digital precoding, even on a modest scale, has a significant impact on the ultimate performance of SIM-aided systems.</description>

      <title>Robust Continuous-Time Beam Tracking with Liquid Neural Network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00365v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Millimeter-wave (mmWave) technology is increasingly recognized as a pivotal technology of the sixth-generation communication networks due to the large amounts of available spectrum at high frequencies. However, the huge overhead associated with beam training imposes a significant challenge in mmWave communications, particularly in urban environments with high background noise. To reduce this high overhead, we propose a novel solution for robust continuous-time beam tracking with liquid neural network, which dynamically adjust the narrow mmWave beams to ensure real-time beam alignment with mobile users. Through extensive simulations, we validate the effectiveness of our proposed method and demonstrate its superiority over existing state-of-the-art deep-learning-based approaches. Specifically, our scheme achieves at most 46.9% higher normalized spectral efficiency than the baselines when the user is moving at 5 m/s, demonstrating the potential of liquid neural networks to enhance mmWave mobile communication performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12961v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a generalization of Bregman divergences in symplectic vector spaces that we term symplectic Bregman divergences. Symplectic Bregman divergences are derived from a symplectic generalization of the Fenchel-Young inequality which relies on the notion of symplectic subdifferentials. The symplectic Fenchel-Young inequality is obtained using the symplectic Fenchel transform which is defined with respect to a linear symplectic form. When the symplectic form is built from an inner product, we show that the corresponding symplectic Bregman divergences amount to ordinary Bregman divergences with respect to composite inner products. Some potential applications of symplectic divergences in geometric mechanics, information geometry, and learning dynamics in machine learning are touched upon.</description>

      <title>Random Vector Functional Link Networks for Function Approximation on Manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2007.15776v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The learning speed of feed-forward neural networks is notoriously slow and has presented a bottleneck in deep learning applications for several decades. For instance, gradient-based learning algorithms, which are used extensively to train neural networks, tend to work slowly when all of the network parameters must be iteratively tuned. To counter this, both researchers and practitioners have tried introducing randomness to reduce the learning requirement. Based on the original construction of Igelnik and Pao, single layer neural-networks with random input-to-hidden layer weights and biases have seen success in practice, but the necessary theoretical justification is lacking. In this paper, we begin to fill this theoretical gap. We provide a (corrected) rigorous proof that the Igelnik and Pao construction is a universal approximator for continuous functions on compact domains, with approximation error decaying asymptotically like $O(1/\sqrt{n})$ for the number $n$ of network nodes. We then extend this result to the non-asymptotic setting, proving that one can achieve any desired approximation error with high probability provided $n$ is sufficiently large. We further adapt this randomized neural network architecture to approximate functions on smooth, compact submanifolds of Euclidean space, providing theoretical guarantees in both the asymptotic and non-asymptotic forms. Finally, we illustrate our results on manifolds with numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Quantum R\'enyi and $f$-divergences from integral representations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.12343v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Smooth Csisz\'ar $f$-divergences can be expressed as integrals over so-called hockey stick divergences. This motivates a natural quantum generalization in terms of quantum Hockey stick divergences, which we explore here. Using this recipe, the Kullback-Leibler divergence generalises to the Umegaki relative entropy, in the integral form recently found by Frenkel. We find that the R\'enyi divergences defined via our new quantum $f$-divergences are not additive in general, but that their regularisations surprisingly yield the Petz R\'enyi divergence for $\alpha &lt; 1$ and the sandwiched R\'enyi divergence for $\alpha &gt; 1$, unifying these two important families of quantum R\'enyi divergences. Moreover, we find that the contraction coefficients for the new quantum $f$ divergences collapse for all $f$ that are operator convex, mimicking the classical behaviour and resolving some long-standing conjectures by Lesniewski and Ruskai. We derive various inequalities, including new reverse Pinsker inequalities with applications in differential privacy and explore various other applications of the new divergences.</description>

      <title>Progressive-Proximity Bit-Flipping for Decoding Surface Codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15924v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological quantum codes, such as toric and surface codes, are excellent candidates for hardware implementation due to their robustness against errors and their local interactions between qubits. However, decoding these codes efficiently remains a challenge: existing decoders often fall short of meeting requirements such as having low computational complexity (ideally linear in the code's blocklength), low decoding latency, and low power consumption. In this paper we propose a novel bit-flipping (BF) decoder tailored for toric and surface codes. We introduce the proximity vector as a heuristic metric for flipping bits, and we develop a new subroutine for correcting degenerate multiple errors on adjacent qubits. Our algorithm has quadratic complexity growth and it can be efficiently implemented as it does not require operations on dynamic memories, as do state-of-art decoding algorithms such as minimum weight perfect matching or union find. The proposed decoder shows a decoding threshold of 7.5% for the 2D toric code and 7% for the rotated planar code over the binary symmetric channel.</description>

      <title>Analytic Models for the Capacity Distribution in MDG-impaired Optical SDM Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12487v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In coupled space-division multiplexing (SDM) transmission systems, imperfections in optical amplifiers and passive devices introduce mode-dependent loss (MDL) and gain (MDG). These effects render the channel capacity stochastic and result in a decrease in average capacity. Several previous studies employ multi-section simulations to model the capacity of these systems. Additionally, relevant works derive analytically the capacity distribution for a single-mode system with polarization-dependent gain and loss (mode count D = 2). However, to the best of our knowledge, analytic expressions of the capacity distribution for systems with D &gt; 2 have not been presented. In this paper, we provide analytic expressions for the capacity of optical systems with arbitrary mode counts. The expressions rely on Gaussian approximations for the per-mode capacity distributions and for the overall capacity distribution, as well as on fitting parameters for the capacity cross-correlation among different modes. Compared to simulations, the derived analytical expressions exhibit a suitable level of accuracy across a wide range of practical scenarios.</description>
