      <title>CodonMoE: DNA Language Models for mRNA Analyses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Genomic language models (gLMs) face a fundamental efficiency challenge: either maintain separate specialized models for each biological modality (DNA and RNA) or develop large multi-modal architectures. Both approaches impose significant computational burdens - modality-specific models require redundant infrastructure despite inherent biological connections, while multi-modal architectures demand massive parameter counts and extensive cross-modality pretraining. To address this limitation, we introduce CodonMoE (Adaptive Mixture of Codon Reformative Experts), a lightweight adapter that transforms DNA language models into effective RNA analyzers without RNA-specific pretraining. Our theoretical analysis establishes CodonMoE as a universal approximator at the codon level, capable of mapping arbitrary functions from codon sequences to RNA properties given sufficient expert capacity. Across four RNA prediction tasks spanning stability, expression, and regulation, DNA models augmented with CodonMoE significantly outperform their unmodified counterparts, with HyenaDNA+CodonMoE series achieving state-of-the-art results using 80% fewer parameters than specialized RNA models. By maintaining sub-quadratic complexity while achieving superior performance, our approach provides a principled path toward unifying genomic language modeling, leveraging more abundant DNA data and reducing computational overhead while preserving modality-specific performance advantages.</description>

      <title>Discovery of Disease Relationships via Transcriptomic Signature Analysis Powered by Agentic AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern disease classification often overlooks molecular commonalities hidden beneath divergent clinical presentations. This study introduces a transcriptomics-driven framework for discovering disease relationships by analyzing over 1300 disease-condition pairs using GenoMAS, a fully automated agentic AI system. Beyond identifying robust gene-level overlaps, we develop a novel pathway-based similarity framework that integrates multi-database enrichment analysis to quantify functional convergence across diseases. The resulting disease similarity network reveals both known comorbidities and previously undocumented cross-category links. By examining shared biological pathways, we explore potential molecular mechanisms underlying these connections-offering functional hypotheses that go beyond symptom-based taxonomies. We further show how background conditions such as obesity and hypertension modulate transcriptomic similarity, and identify therapeutic repurposing opportunities for rare diseases like autism spectrum disorder based on their molecular proximity to better-characterized conditions. In addition, this work demonstrates how biologically grounded agentic AI can scale transcriptomic analysis while enabling mechanistic interpretation across complex disease landscapes. All results are publicly accessible at github.com/KeeeeChen/Pathway_Similarity_Network.</description>

      <title>GRIT: Graph-Regularized Logit Refinement for Zero-shot Cell Type Annotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cell type annotation is a fundamental step in the analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. In practice, human experts often rely on the structure revealed by principal component analysis (PCA) followed by $k$-nearest neighbor ($k$-NN) graph construction to guide annotation. While effective, this process is labor-intensive and does not scale to large datasets. Recent advances in CLIP-style models offer a promising path toward automating cell type annotation. By aligning scRNA-seq profiles with natural language descriptions, models like LangCell enable zero-shot annotation. While LangCell demonstrates decent zero-shot performance, its predictions remain suboptimal, particularly in achieving consistent accuracy across all cell types. In this paper, we propose to refine the zero-shot logits produced by LangCell through a graph-regularized optimization framework. By enforcing local consistency over the task-specific PCA-based k-NN graph, our method combines the scalability of the pre-trained models with the structural robustness relied upon in expert annotation. We evaluate our approach on 14 annotated human scRNA-seq datasets from 4 distinct studies, spanning 11 organs and over 200,000 single cells. Our method consistently improves zero-shot annotation accuracy, achieving accuracy gains of up to 10%. Further analysis showcase the mechanism by which GRIT effectively propagates correct signals through the graph, pulling back mislabeled cells toward more accurate predictions. The method is training-free, model-agnostic, and serves as a simple yet effective plug-in for enhancing automated cell type annotation in practice.</description>

      <title>Embedding Is (Almost) All You Need: Retrieval-Augmented Inference for Generalizable Genomic Prediction Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large pre-trained DNA language models such as DNABERT-2, Nucleotide Transformer, and HyenaDNA have demonstrated strong performance on various genomic benchmarks. However, most applications rely on expensive fine-tuning, which works best when the training and test data share a similar distribution. In this work, we investigate whether task-specific fine-tuning is always necessary. We show that simple embedding-based pipelines that extract fixed representations from these models and feed them into lightweight classifiers can achieve competitive performance. In evaluation settings with different data distributions, embedding-based methods often outperform fine-tuning while reducing inference time by 10x to 20x. Our results suggest that embedding extraction is not only a strong baseline but also a more generalizable and efficient alternative to fine-tuning, especially for deployment in diverse or unseen genomic contexts. For example, in enhancer classification, HyenaDNA embeddings combined with zCurve achieve 0.68 accuracy (vs. 0.58 for fine-tuning), with an 88% reduction in inference time and over 8x lower carbon emissions (0.02 kg vs. 0.17 kg CO2). In non-TATA promoter classification, DNABERT-2 embeddings with zCurve or GC content reach 0.85 accuracy (vs. 0.89 with fine-tuning) with a 22x lower carbon footprint (0.02 kg vs. 0.44 kg CO2). These results show that embedding-based pipelines offer over 10x better carbon efficiency while maintaining strong predictive performance.

      <title>Alz-QNet: A Quantum Regression Network for Studying Alzheimer's Gene Interactions</title>

Abstract: Understanding the molecular-level mechanisms underpinning Alzheimer's disease (AD) by studying crucial genes associated with the disease remains a challenge. Alzheimer's, being a multifactorial disease, requires understanding the gene-gene interactions underlying it for theranostics and progress. In this article, a novel attempt has been made using a quantum regression to decode how some crucial genes in the AD Amyloid Beta Precursor Protein ($APP$), Sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 14 ($FGF14$), Yin Yang 1 ($YY1$), and Phospholipase D Family Member 3 ($PLD3$) etc. become influenced by other prominent switching genes during disease progression, which may help in gene expression-based therapy for AD. Our proposed Quantum Regression Network (Alz-QNet) introduces a pioneering approach with insights from the state-of-the-art Quantum Gene Regulatory Networks (QGRN) to unravel the gene interactions involved in AD pathology, particularly within the Entorhinal Cortex (EC), where early pathological changes occur. Using the proposed Alz-QNet framework, we explore the interactions between key genes ($APP$, $FGF14$, $YY1$, $EGR1$, $GAS7$, $AKT3$, $SREBF2$, and $PLD3$) within the CE microenvironment of AD patients, studying genetic samples from the database $GSE138852$, all of which are believed to play a crucial role in the progression of AD. Our investigation uncovers intricate gene-gene interactions, shedding light on the potential regulatory mechanisms that underlie the pathogenesis of AD, which help us to find potential gene inhibitors or regulators for theranostics.</description>

      <title>A Probabilistic Framework for Imputing Genetic Distances in Spatiotemporal Pathogen Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09076v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pathogen genome data offers valuable structure for spatial models, but its utility is limited by incomplete sequencing coverage. We propose a probabilistic framework for inferring genetic distances between unsequenced cases and known sequences within defined transmission chains, using time-aware evolutionary distance modeling. The method estimates pairwise divergence from collection dates and observed genetic distances, enabling biologically plausible imputation grounded in observed divergence patterns, without requiring sequence alignment or known transmission chains. Applied to highly pathogenic avian influenza A/H5 cases in wild birds in the United States, this approach supports scalable, uncertainty-aware augmentation of genomic datasets and enhances the integration of evolutionary information into spatiotemporal modeling workflows.</description>

      <title>Quantum-inspired algorithm for simulating viral response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15671v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the properties of biological systems is an exciting avenue for applying advanced approaches to solving corresponding computational tasks. A specific class of problems that arises in the resolution of biological challenges is optimization. In this work, we present the results of a proof-of-concept study that applies a quantum-inspired optimization algorithm to simulate a viral response. We formulate an Ising-type model to describe the patterns of gene activity in host responses. Reducing the problem to the Ising form allows the use of available quantum and quantum-inspired optimization tools. We demonstrate the application of a quantum-inspired optimization algorithm to this problem. Our study paves the way for exploring the full potential of quantum and quantum-inspired optimization tools in biological applications.</description>
