      <title>SOC-Boundary and Battery Aging Aware Hierarchical Coordination of Multiple EV Aggregates Among Multi-stakeholders with Multi-Agent Constrained Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As electric vehicles (EV) become more prevalent and advances in electric vehicle electronics continue, vehicle-to-grid (V2G) techniques and large-scale scheduling strategies are increasingly important to promote renewable energy utilization and enhance the stability of the power grid. This study proposes a hierarchical multistakeholder V2G coordination strategy based on safe multi-agent constrained deep reinforcement learning (MCDRL) and the Proof-of-Stake algorithm to optimize benefits for all stakeholders, including the distribution system operator (DSO), electric vehicle aggregators (EVAs) and EV users. For DSO, the strategy addresses load fluctuations and the integration of renewable energy. For EVAs, energy constraints and charging costs are considered. The three critical parameters of battery conditioning, state of charge (SOC), state of power (SOP), and state of health (SOH), are crucial to the participation of EVs in V2G. Hierarchical multi-stakeholder V2G coordination significantly enhances the integration of renewable energy, mitigates load fluctuations, meets the energy demands of the EVAs, and reduces charging costs and battery degradation simultaneously.</description>

      <title>Real-time Estimation of Bound Water Concentration during Lyophilization with Temperature-based State Observers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lyophilization (aka freeze drying) has been shown to provide long-term stability for many crucial biotherapeutics, e.g., mRNA vaccines for COVID-19, allowing for higher storage temperature. The final stage of lyophilization, namely secondary drying, entails bound water removal via desorption, in which accurate prediction of bound water concentration is vital to ensuring the quality of the lyophilized product. This article proposes a novel technique for real-time estimation of the residual moisture during secondary drying in lyophilization. A state observer is employed, which combines temperature measurement and mechanistic understanding of heat transfer and desorption kinetics, without requiring any online concentration measurement. Results from both simulations and experimental data show that the observer can accurately estimate the concentration of bound water in real time for all possible concentration levels, operating conditions, and measurement noise. This framework can also be applied for monitoring and control of the residual moisture in other desorption-related processes.</description>

      <title>Online learning of Koopman operator using streaming data from different dynamical regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper presents a framework for online learning of the Koopman operator using streaming data. Many complex systems for which data-driven modeling and control are sought provide streaming sensor data, the abundance of which can present computational challenges but cannot be ignored. Streaming data can intermittently sample dynamically different regimes or rare events which could be critical to model and control. Using ideas from subspace identification, we present a method where the Grassmannian distance between the subspace of an extended observability matrix and the streaming segment of data is used to assess the `novelty' of the data. If this distance is above a threshold, it is added to an archive and the Koopman operator is updated if not it is discarded. Therefore, our method identifies data from segments of trajectories of a dynamical system that are from different dynamical regimes, prioritizes minimizing the amount of data needed in updating the Koopman model and furthermore reduces the number of basis functions by learning them adaptively. Therefore, by dynamically adjusting the amount of data used and learning basis functions, our method optimizes the model's accuracy and the system order.</description>

      <title>A trustworthy blockchain-based energy trading scheme for V2G operations in distributed power grids via integrated scheduling and trading framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid growth of electric vehicles (EVs) and the deployment of vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology pose significant challenges for distributed power grids, particularly in fostering trust and ensuring effective coordination among stakeholders. In this paper, we developed an integrated scheduling and trading framework to conduct transparent and efficacious coordination in V2G operations. In blockchain implementation, we propose a cyber-physical blockchain architecture that enhances transaction efficiency and scalability by leveraging smart charging points (SCPs) for rapid transaction validation through a fast-path practical byzantine fault tolerance (fast-path PBFT) consensus mechanism. From the energy dispatching perspective, a game-theoretical pricing strategy is employed and smart contracts are utilized for autonomous decision-making between EVs and operators, aiming to optimize the trading process and maximize economic benefits. Numerical evaluation of blockchain consensus shows the effect of the fast-path PBFT consensus in improving systems scalability with a balanced trade-off in robustness. A case study, utilizing real-world data from the Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech), demonstrates significant reductions in EV charging costs and the framework potential to support auxiliary grid services.</description>

      <title>TTT: A Temporal Refinement Heuristic for Tenuously Tractable Discrete Time Reachability Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reachable set computation is an important tool for analyzing control systems. Simulating a control system can show that the system is generally functioning as desired, but a formal tool like reachability analysis can provide a guarantee of correctness. For linear systems, reachability analysis is straightforward and fast, but as more complex components are added to the control system such as nonlinear dynamics or a neural network controller, reachability analysis may slow down or become overly conservative. To address these challenges, much literature has focused on spatial refinement, e.g., tuning the discretization of the input sets and intermediate reachable sets. However, this paper addresses a different dimension: temporal refinement. The basic idea of temporal refinement is to automatically choose when along the horizon of the reachability problem to execute slow symbolic queries which incur less approximation error versus fast concrete queries which incur more approximation error. Temporal refinement can be combined with other refinement approaches and offers an additional ``tuning knob'' with which to trade off tractability and tightness in approximate reachable set computation. Here, we introduce an automatic framework for performing temporal refinement and we demonstrate the effectiveness of this technique on computing approximate reachable sets for nonlinear systems with neural network control policies. We demonstrate the calculation of reachable sets of varying approximation error under varying computational budget and show that our algorithm is able to generate approximate reachable sets with a similar amount of error to the baseline approach in 20-70% less time.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Uncertainty Quantification for Scenario-based Control Using Meta-learning of Bayesian Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scenario-based optimization and control has proven to be an efficient approach to account for system uncertainty. In particular, the performance of scenario-based model predictive control (MPC) schemes depends on the accuracy of uncertainty quantification. However, current learning- and scenario-based MPC (sMPC) approaches employ a single timeinvariant probabilistic model (learned offline), which may not accurately describe time-varying uncertainties. Instead, this paper presents a model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) of Bayesian neural networks (BNN) for adaptive uncertainty quantification that would be subsequently used for adaptive-scenario-tree model predictive control design of nonlinear systems with unknown dynamics to enhance control performance. In particular, the proposed approach learns both a global BNN model and an updating law to refine the BNN model. At each time step, the updating law transforms the global BNN model into more precise local BNN models in real time. The adapted local model is then used to generate scenarios for sMPC design at each time step. A probabilistic safety certificate is incorporated in the scenario generation to ensure that the trajectories of the generated scenarios contain the real trajectory of the system and that all the scenarios adhere to the constraints with a high probability. Experiments using closed-loop simulations of a numerical example demonstrate that the proposed approach can improve the performance of scenario-based MPC compared to using only one BNN model learned offline for all time steps.</description>

      <title>Privacy-preserving gradient-based fair federated learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) schemes allow multiple participants to collaboratively train neural networks without the need to directly share the underlying data.However, in early schemes, all participants eventually obtain the same model. Moreover, the aggregation is typically carried out by a third party, who obtains combined gradients or weights, which may reveal the model. These downsides underscore the demand for fair and privacy-preserving FL schemes. Here, collaborative fairness asks for individual model quality depending on the individual data contribution. Privacy is demanded with respect to any kind of data outsourced to the third party. Now, there already exist some approaches aiming for either fair or privacy-preserving FL and a few works even address both features. In our paper, we build upon these seminal works and present a novel, fair and privacy-preserving FL scheme. Our approach, which mainly relies on homomorphic encryption, stands out for exclusively using local gradients. This increases the usability in comparison to state-of-the-art approaches and thereby opens the door to applications in control.</description>

      <title>Optimization-Based Outlier Accommodation for Tightly Coupled RTK-Aided Inertial Navigation Systems in Urban Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) aided Inertial Navigation System (INS) is a fundamental approach for attaining continuously available absolute vehicle position and full state estimates at high bandwidth. For transportation applications, stated accuracy specifications must be achieved, unless the navigation system can detect when it is violated. In urban environments, GNSS measurements are susceptible to outliers, which motivates the important problem of accommodating outliers while either achieving a performance specification or communicating that it is not feasible. Risk-Averse Performance-Specified (RAPS) is designed to optimally select measurements to address this problem. Existing RAPS approaches lack a method applicable to carrier phase measurements, which have the benefit of measurement errors at the centimeter level along with the challenge of being biased by integer ambiguities. This paper proposes a RAPS framework that combines Real-time Kinematic (RTK) GNSS in a tightly coupled INS for urban navigation applications. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this RAPS-INS-RTK framework, achieving 84.05% and 89.84% of horizontal and vertical errors less than 1.5 meters and 3 meters, respectively, using a deep-urban dataset. This performance not only surpasses the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) requirements, but also shows a 10% improvement compared to traditional methods.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Model Predictive Control with Optimal Linear Feedback for Mobile Robots in Dynamic Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robot navigation around humans can be a challenging problem since human movements are hard to predict. Stochastic model predictive control (MPC) can account for such uncertainties and approximately bound the probability of a collision to take place. In this paper, to counteract the rapidly growing human motion uncertainty over time, we incorporate state feedback in the stochastic MPC. This allows the robot to more closely track reference trajectories. To this end the feedback policy is left as a degree of freedom in the optimal control problem. The stochastic MPC with feedback is validated in simulation experiments and is compared against nominal MPC and stochastic MPC without feedback. The added computation time can be limited by reducing the number of additional variables for the feedback law with a small compromise in control performance.</description>

      <title>An Optimal Control Framework for Airborne Wind Energy Systems with a Flexible Tether</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we establish an optimal control framework for airborne wind energy systems (AWESs) with flexible tethers. The AWES configuration, consisting of a six-degree-of-freedom aircraft, a flexible tether, and a winch, is formulated as an index-1 differential-algebraic system of equations (DAE). We achieve this by adopting a minimal coordinate representation that uses Euler angles to characterize the aircraft's attitude and employing a quasi-static approach for the tether. The presented method contrasts with other recent optimization studies that use an index-3 DAE approach. By doing so, our approach avoids related inconsistency condition problems. We use a homotopy strategy to solve the optimal control problem that ultimately generates optimal trajectories of the AWES with a flexible tether. We furthermore compare with a rigid tether model by investigating the resulting mechanical powers and tether forces. Simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of the presented methodology and the necessity to incorporate the flexibility of the tether when solving the optimal control problem.</description>

      <title>Equivariant Symmetries for Aided Inertial Navigation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Respecting the geometry of the underlying system and exploiting its symmetry have been driving concepts in deriving modern geometric filters for inertial navigation systems (INSs). Despite their success, the explicit treatment of inertial measurement unit (IMU) biases remains challenging, unveiling a gap in the current theory of filter design. In response to this gap, this dissertation builds upon the recent theory of equivariant systems to address and overcome the limitations in existing methodologies. The goal is to identify new symmetries of inertial navigation systems that include a geometric treatment of IMU biases and exploit them to design filtering algorithms that outperform state-of-the-art solutions in terms of accuracy, convergence rate, robustness, and consistency. This dissertation leverages the semi-direct product rule and introduces the tangent group for inertial navigation systems as the first equivariant symmetry that properly accounts for IMU biases. Based on that, we show that it is possible to derive an equivariant filter (EqF) algorithm with autonomous navigation error dynamics. The resulting filter demonstrates superior to state-of-the-art solutions. Through a comprehensive analysis of various symmetries of inertial navigation systems, we formalized the concept that every filter can be derived as an EqF with a specific choice of symmetry. This underlines the fundamental role of symmetry in determining filter performance. This dissertation advances the understanding of equivariant symmetries in the context of inertial navigation systems and serves as a basis for the next generation of equivariant estimators, marking a significant leap toward more reliable navigation solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.08779v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semi-autonomous (SA) systems face the challenge of determining which source to prioritize for control, whether it's from the human operator or the autonomous controller, especially when they conflict with each other. While one may design an SA system to default to accepting control from one or the other, such design choices can have catastrophic consequences in safety-critical settings. For instance, the sensors an autonomous controller relies upon may provide incorrect information about the environment due to tampering or natural fault. On the other hand, the human operator may also provide erroneous input.
  To better understand the consequences and resolution of this safety-critical design choice, we investigate a specific application of an SA system that failed due to a static assignment of control authority: the well-publicized Boeing 737-MAX Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS) that caused the crashes of Lion Air Flight 610 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302. First, using a representative simulation, we analyze and demonstrate the ease by which the original MCAS design could fail. Our analysis reveals the most robust public analysis of aircraft recoverability under MCAS faults, offering bounds for those scenarios beyond the original crashes. We also analyze Boeing's updated MCAS and show how it falls short of its intended goals and continues to rely upon on a fault-prone static assignment of control priority. Using these insights, we present Semi-Autonomous MCAS (SA-MCAS), a new MCAS that both meets the intended goals of MCAS and avoids the failure cases that plague both MCAS designs. We demonstrate SA-MCAS's ability to make safer and timely control decisions of the aircraft, even when the human and autonomous operators provide conflicting control inputs.</description>

      <title>On Updating Static Output Feedback Controllers Under State-Space Perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.16178v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel update of a nominal stabilizing static output feedback (SOF) controller for a perturbed linear system. In almost every classical feedback controller design problem, a stabilizing feedback controller is designed given a stabilizable unstable system. In realistic scenarios, the system model is usually imperfect and subject to perturbations. A typical approach to attenuate the impacts of such perturbations on the system stability is repeating the whole controller design procedure to find an updated stabilizing SOF controller. Such an approach can be inefficient and occasionally infeasible. Using the notion of minimum destabilizing real perturbation (MDRP), we construct a simple norm minimization problem (a least-squares problem) to propose an efficient update of a nominal stabilizing SOF controller that can be applied to various control engineering applications in the case of perturbed scenarios like abrupt changes or inaccurate system models. In particular, considering norm-bounded known or unknown perturbations, this paper presents updated stabilizing SOF controllers and derives sufficient stability conditions. Geometric metrics to quantitatively measure the approach's robustness are defined. Moreover, we characterize the corresponding guaranteed stability regions, and specifically, for the case of norm-bounded unknown perturbations, we propose non-fragility-based robust updated stabilizing SOF controllers. Through extensive numerical simulations, we assess the effectiveness of the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Properties of Immersions for Systems with Multiple Limit Sets with Implications to Learning Koopman Embeddings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17045v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Linear immersions (such as Koopman eigenfunctions) of a nonlinear system have wide applications in prediction and control. In this work, we study the properties of linear immersions for nonlinear systems with multiple omega-limit sets. While previous research has indicated the possibility of discontinuous one-to-one linear immersions for such systems, it has been unclear whether continuous one-to-one linear immersions are attainable. Under mild conditions, we prove that any continuous immersion to a class of systems including finite-dimensional linear systems collapses all the omega-limit sets, and thus cannot be one-to-one. Furthermore, we show that this property is also shared by approximate linear immersions learned from data as sample size increases and sampling interval decreases. Multiple examples are studied to illustrate our results.</description>

      <title>Cross-Forming Control and Fault Current Limiting for Grid-Forming Inverters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13376v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article proposes a "cross-forming" control concept for grid-forming inverters operating against grid faults. Cross-forming refers to voltage angle forming and current magnitude forming. It differs from classical grid-forming and grid-following paradigms that feature voltage magnitude-and-angle forming and voltage magnitude-and-angle following (or current magnitude-and-angle forming), respectively. The cross-forming concept addresses the need for inverters to remain grid-forming (particularly voltage angle forming, as required by grid codes) while managing fault current limitation. Simple and feasible cross-forming control implementations are proposed, enabling inverters to quickly limit fault currents to a prescribed level while preserving voltage angle forming for grid-forming synchronization and providing dynamic ancillary services, during symmetrical or asymmetrical fault ride-through. Moreover, the cross-forming control yields an equivalent system featuring a constant virtual impedance and a "normal form" representation, allowing for the extension of previously established transient stability results to include scenarios involving current saturation. Simulations and experiments validate the efficacy of the proposed cross-forming control implementations.</description>

      <title>Active Islanding Detection Using Pulse Compression Probing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05301v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An islanding detection scheme is developed using pulse compression probing (PCP). A state space system realization is taken from the probing output. The nu-gap metric is applied to compare the measured system to fully intact system and classify it as islanded, or grid-connected. The designed detector displays fast operation, accurate islanding detection results under varying grid condition, and is physically implementable at the terminals of an inverter. The method is verified via electro-magnetic transient (EMT) simulation on a modified IEEE 34 bus test system with randomized loads and simultaneous probing at three independent solar plants, with the probing signal directly implemented into the logic of a switching inverter model.</description>

      <title>Introduction to Online Nonstochastic Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.09619v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This text presents an introduction to an emerging paradigm in control of dynamical systems and differentiable reinforcement learning called online nonstochastic control. The new approach applies techniques from online convex optimization and convex relaxations to obtain new methods with provable guarantees for classical settings in optimal and robust control.
  The primary distinction between online nonstochastic control and other frameworks is the objective. In optimal control, robust control, and other control methodologies that assume stochastic noise, the goal is to perform comparably to an offline optimal strategy. In online nonstochastic control, both the cost functions as well as the perturbations from the assumed dynamical model are chosen by an adversary. Thus the optimal policy is not defined a priori. Rather, the target is to attain low regret against the best policy in hindsight from a benchmark class of policies.
  This objective suggests the use of the decision making framework of online convex optimization as an algorithmic methodology. The resulting methods are based on iterative mathematical optimization algorithms, and are accompanied by finite-time regret and computational complexity guarantees.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models for Power Scheduling: A User-Centric Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00476v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While traditional optimization and scheduling schemes are designed to meet fixed, predefined system requirements, future systems are moving toward user-driven approaches and personalized services, aiming to achieve high quality-of-experience (QoE) and flexibility. This challenge is particularly pronounced in wireless and digitalized energy networks, where users' requirements have largely not been taken into consideration due to the lack of a common language between users and machines. The emergence of powerful large language models (LLMs) marks a radical departure from traditional system-centric methods into more advanced user-centric approaches by providing a natural communication interface between users and devices. In this paper, for the first time, we introduce a novel architecture for resource scheduling problems by constructing three LLM agents to convert an arbitrary user's voice request (VRQ) into a resource allocation vector. Specifically, we design an LLM intent recognition agent to translate the request into an optimization problem (OP), an LLM OP parameter identification agent, and an LLM OP solving agent. To evaluate system performance, we construct a database of typical VRQs in the context of electric vehicle (EV) charging. As a proof of concept, we primarily use Llama 3 8B. Through testing with different prompt engineering scenarios, the obtained results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed architecture. The conducted performance analysis allows key insights to be extracted. For instance, having a larger set of candidate OPs to model the real-world problem might degrade the final performance because of a higher recognition/OP classification noise level. All results and codes are open source.</description>
