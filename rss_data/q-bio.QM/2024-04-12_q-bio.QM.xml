      <title>Advancements in Radiomics and Artificial Intelligence for Thyroid Cancer Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thyroid cancer is an increasing global health concern that requires advanced diagnostic methods. The application of AI and radiomics to thyroid cancer diagnosis is examined in this review. A review of multiple databases was conducted in compliance with PRISMA guidelines until October 2023. A combination of keywords led to the discovery of an English academic publication on thyroid cancer and related subjects. 267 papers were returned from the original search after 109 duplicates were removed. Relevant studies were selected according to predetermined criteria after 124 articles were eliminated based on an examination of their abstract and title. After the comprehensive analysis, an additional six studies were excluded. Among the 28 included studies, radiomics analysis, which incorporates ultrasound (US) images, demonstrated its effectiveness in diagnosing thyroid cancer. Various results were noted, some of the studies presenting new strategies that outperformed the status quo. The literature has emphasized various challenges faced by AI models, including interpretability issues, dataset constraints, and operator dependence. The synthesized findings of the 28 included studies mentioned the need for standardization efforts and prospective multicenter studies to address these concerns. Furthermore, approaches to overcome these obstacles were identified, such as advances in explainable AI technology and personalized medicine techniques. The review focuses on how AI and radiomics could transform the diagnosis and treatment of thyroid cancer. Despite challenges, future research on multidisciplinary cooperation, clinical applicability validation, and algorithm improvement holds the potential to improve patient outcomes and diagnostic precision in the treatment of thyroid cancer.</description>

      <title>Assessing Engraftment Following Fecal Microbiota Transplant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fecal Microbiota Transplant (FMT) is an FDA approved treatment for recurrent Clostridium difficile infections, and is being explored for other clinical applications, from alleviating digestive and neurological disorders, to priming the microbiome for cancer treatment, and restoring microbiomes impacted by cancer treatment.
  Quantifying the extent of engraftment following an FMT is important in determining if a recipient didn't respond because the engrafted microbiome didn't produce the desired outcomes (a successful FMT, but negative treatment outcome), or the microbiome didn't engraft (an unsuccessful FMT and negative treatment outcome). The lack of a consistent methodology for quantifying FMT engraftment extent hinders the assessment of FMT success and its relation to clinical outcomes, and presents challenges for comparing FMT results and protocols across studies.
  Here we review 46 studies of FMT in humans and model organisms and group their approaches for assessing the extent to which an FMT engrafts into three criteria: 1) Chimeric Asymmetric Community Coalescence investigates microbiome shifts following FMT engraftment. 2) Donated Microbiome Indicator Features tracks donated microbiome features as a signal of engraftment with methods such as differential abundance testing based on the current sample collection, or tracking changes in feature abundances that have been previously identified. 3) Temporal Stability examines how resistant post-FMT recipient's microbiomes are to reverting back to their baseline microbiome. Investigated together, these criteria provide a clear assessment of microbiome engraftment.
  We discuss the pros and cons of each of these criteria, providing illustrative examples of their application. We also introduce key terminology and recommendations on how FMT studies can be analyzed for rigorous engraftment extent assessment.</description>

      <title>Predicting Side Effect of Drug Molecules using Recurrent Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.10473v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Identification and verification of molecular properties such as side effects is one of the most important and time-consuming steps in the process of molecule synthesis. For example, failure to identify side effects before submission to regulatory groups can cost millions of dollars and months of additional research to the companies. Failure to identify side effects during the regulatory review can also cost lives. The complexity and expense of this task have made it a candidate for a machine learning-based solution. Prior approaches rely on complex model designs and excessive parameter counts for side effect predictions. We believe reliance on complex models only shifts the difficulty away from chemists rather than alleviating the issue. Implementing large models is also expensive without prior access to high-performance computers. We propose a heuristic approach that allows for the utilization of simple neural networks, specifically the recurrent neural network, with a 98+% reduction in the number of required parameters compared to available large language models while still obtaining near identical results as top-performing models.</description>

      <title>A benchmark for computational analysis of animal behavior, using animal-borne tags</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.10740v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Animal-borne sensors ('bio-loggers') can record a suite of kinematic and environmental data, which can elucidate animal ecophysiology and improve conservation efforts. Machine learning techniques are used for interpreting the large amounts of data recorded by bio-loggers, but there exists no common framework for comparing the different machine learning techniques in this domain. To address this, we present the Bio-logger Ethogram Benchmark (BEBE), a collection of datasets with behavioral annotations, as well as a modeling task and evaluation metrics. BEBE is to date the largest, most taxonomically diverse, publicly available benchmark of this type, and includes 1654 hours of data collected from 149 individuals across nine taxa. In addition, using BEBE, we test a novel self-supervised learning approach to identifying animal behaviors based on bio-logger data, using a deep neural network pre-trained with self-supervision on data collected from human wrist-worn accelerometers. We show that this approach out-performs common alternatives, especially in a setting with a low amount of training data. Datasets, models, and evaluation code are made publicly available at https://github.com/earthspecies/BEBE, to enable community use of BEBE as a point of comparison in methods development.</description>

      <title>BOLD v4: A Centralized Bioinformatics Platform for DNA-based Biodiversity Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05696v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: BOLD, the Barcode of Life Data System, supports the acquisition, storage, validation, analysis, and publication of DNA barcodes, activities requiring the integration of molecular, morphological, and distributional data. Its pivotal role in curating the reference library of DNA barcodes, coupled with its data management and analysis capabilities, make it a central resource for biodiversity science. It enables rapid, accurate identification of specimens and also reveals patterns of genetic diversity and evolutionary relationships among taxa. Launched in 2005, BOLD has become an increasingly powerful tool for advancing understanding of planetary biodiversity. It currently hosts 17 million specimen records and 14 million barcodes that provide coverage for more than a million species from every continent and ocean. The platform has the long-term goal of providing a consistent, accurate system for identifying all species of eukaryotes. BOLD's integrated analytical tools, full data lifecycle support, and secure collaboration framework distinguish it from other biodiversity platforms. BOLD v4 brought enhanced data management and analysis capabilities as well as novel functionality for data dissemination and publication. Its next version will include features to strengthen its utility to the research community, governments, industry, and society-at-large.</description>
