      <title>Multiplicity results for fully nonlinear elliptic equations with natural gradient growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove a theorem concerning the existence of three solutions for the following boundary value problem: \begin{equation*} -\mathcal{M}_{\lambda,\Lambda}^+(D^2u)-\Gamma|Du|^2=f(u)~~~\text{in}\ \Omega, u=0~~~\text{on}\ \partial\Omega, \end{equation*} where $f:[0,\infty]\to[0,\infty]$ is a $C^{\alpha}$ function and $\Omega$ denotes a bounded, smooth domain in $\mathbb{R}^N$. By constructing two ordered pairs of sub and supersolutions for a specific class of $f$ exhibiting sublinear growth, we further establish the existence of three positive solutions to the aforementioned boundary value problem.</description>

      <title>H\"older regularity for degenerate parabolic double-phase equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that bounded weak solutions to degenerate parabolic double-phase equations of $p$-Laplace type are locally H\"older continuous. The proof is based on phase analysis and methods for the $p$-Laplace equation. In particular, the phase analysis determines whether the double-phase equation is locally similar to the $p$-Laplace or the $q$-Laplace equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is shown that the $p$-Poincar\'e inequality holds on an open set $\Omega$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ if and only if the strict $p$-capacitary inradius of $\Omega$ is finite. To that end, new upper and lower bounds for the infimum for the associated nonlinear Rayleigh quotients are derived.</description>

      <title>Regularity and long-time behavior of global weak solutions to a coupled Cahn-Hilliard system: the off-critical case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a diffuse interface model that describes the macro- and micro-phase separation processes of a polymer mixture. The resulting system consists of a Cahn-Hilliard equation and a Cahn-Hilliard-Oono type equation endowed with the singular Flory-Huggins potential. For the initial boundary value problem in a bounded smooth domain of $\mathbb{R}^d$ ($d\in\{2,3\}$) with homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions for the phase functions as well as chemical potentials, we study the regularity and long-time behavior of global weak solutions in the off-critical case, i.e., the mass is not conserved during the micro-phase separation of diblock copolymers. By investigating an auxiliary system with viscous regularizations, we show that every global weak solution regularizes instantaneously for $t&gt;0$. In two dimensions, we obtain the instantaneous strict separation property under a mild growth condition on the first derivative of potential functions near pure phases $\pm 1$, while in three dimensions, we establish the eventual strict separation property for sufficiently large time. Finally, we prove that every global weak solution converges to a single equilibrium as $t\to +\infty$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding human eye behavior involves intricate interactions between physical phenomena such as heat transfer and fluid dynamics. Accurate computational models are vital for comprehending ocular diseases and therapeutic interventions.This work focuses on modeling and simulating aqueous humor flow in the anterior and posterior chambers of the eye, coupled with overall heat transfer.Aqueous humor dynamics regulates intraocular pressure, crucial for understanding conditions like glaucoma.Convective effects from temperature disparities also influence this flow.Extending prior research, this work develops a comprehensive three-dimensional computational model to simulate coupled fluid-dynamic-heat transfer model, thus contributing to the understanding of ocular physiology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the global existence of solutions to a system of stochastic Schr\"odinger equations with multiplicative noise. Our setting of the quadratic nonlinear terms in dimension 4 is $L^2$-critical. We treat the solutions under the ground state. We estimate the time derivative of the quantity of energy by using the cancellation of the cubic terms in the spatial derivative of the solution.</description>

      <title>Sharp embedding results and geometric inequalities for H\"{o}rmander vector fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $U$ be a connected open subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$, and let $X=(X_1,X_{2},\ldots,X_m)$ be a system of H\"{o}rmander vector fields defined on $U$. This paper addresses sharp embedding results and geometric inequalities in the generalized Sobolev space $\mathcal{W}_{X,0}^{k,p}(\Omega)$, where $\Omega\subset\subset U$ is a general open bounded subset of $U$. By employing Rothschild-Stein's lifting technique and saturation method, we prove the representation formula for smooth functions with compact support in $\Omega$. Combining this representation formula with weighted weak-$L^p$ estimates, we derive sharp Sobolev inequalities on $\mathcal{W}_{X,0}^{k,p}(\Omega)$, where the critical Sobolev exponent depends on the generalized M\'{e}tivier index. As applications of these sharp Sobolev inequalities, we establish the isoperimetric inequality, logarithmic Sobolev inequalities, Rellich-Kondrachov compact embedding theorem, Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequality, Nash inequality, and Moser-Trudinger inequality in the context of general H\"{o}rmander vector fields.</description>

      <title>On wave systems with antisymmetric potential in dimension d &gt;= 4 and well-posedness for (half-)wave maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a priori estimates for wave systems of the type \[ \partial_{tt} u - \Delta u = \Omega \cdot du + F(u) \quad \text{in $\mathbb{R}^d \times \mathbb{R}$} \]
  where $d \geq 4$ and $\Omega$ is a suitable antisymmetric potential. We show that the assumptions on $\Omega$ are applicable to wave- and half-wave maps, the latter by means of the Krieger-Sire reduction. We thus obtain well-posedness of those equations for small initial data in $\dot{H}^{\frac{d}{2}}(\mathbb{R}^d)$.</description>

      <title>Starshaped compact hypersurfaces in warped product manifolds I: prescribed curvature equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive global curvature estimates for closed strictly star-shaped (n-2)-convex hypersurfaces in warped product spaces, satisfying the prescribed (n-2)-curvature equation with a general right-hand side. The proof is inspired by the recent breakthrough of [Guan-Ren-Wang CPAM 2015] and it can be readily adapted to establish curvature estimates for semi-convex and (k+1)-convex solutions to the general k-curvature equation. Furthermore, it can also be used to prove the same estimates for prescribed curvature measure type equations.</description>

      <title>On the lack of selection for the transport equation over a dense set of vector fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this work is to demonstrate that the lack of selection by smooth regularisation for the continuity equation with a bounded, divergence-free vector field as demonstrated in \cite{DeLellis_Giri22} by De Lellis and Giri takes place over a dense set of vector fields. More precisely, we construct a set of bounded vector fields $D$ dense in $L^p_{loc}([0,2]\times \R^2;\R^2)$ such that for each vector field $\bb\in D$, there are two smooth regularisations of $\bb$, for which the unique solution of the Cauchy problem for the continuity equation along each regularisation converges to two distinct solutions of the Cauchy problem along $\bb$.</description>

      <title>Continuum limit of $p$-biharmonic equations on graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the $p$-biharmonic equation on graphs, which arises in point cloud processing and can be interpreted as a natural extension of the graph $p$-Laplacian from the perspective of hypergraph. The asymptotic behavior of the solution is investigated when the random geometric graph is considered and the number of data points goes to infinity. We show that the continuum limit is an appropriately weighted $p$-biharmonic equation with homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions. The result relies on the uniform $L^p$ estimates for solutions and gradients of nonlocal and graph Poisson equations. The $L^\infty$ estimates of solutions are also obtained as a byproduct.</description>

      <title>Flow by Gauss Curvature to the Orlicz Minkowski Problem for q-torsional rigidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Minkowski problem for torsional rigidity ($2$-torsional rigidity) was firstly studied by Colesanti and Fimiani \cite{CA} using variational method. Moreover, Hu, Liu and Ma \cite{HJ00} also studied this problem by method of curvature flow and obtain the existence of smooth solution. In addition, the Minkowski problem for $2$-torsional rigidity was also extended to $L_p$ version and Orlicz version.
  Recently, Hu and Zhang \cite{HJ2} introduced the concept of Orlicz mixed $q$-torsional rigidity and obtained Orlicz $q$-torsional measure through the variational method for $q&gt;1$. Specially, they established the functional Orlicz Brunn-Minkowski inequality and the functional Orlicz Minkowski inequality.
  Motivated by the remarkable work by Hu and Zhang in \cite{HJ2}, we can propose the Orlicz Minkowksi problem for $q$-torsional rigidity, and then confirm the existence of smooth even solutions to the Orlicz Minkowski problem for $q$-torsional rigidity with $q&gt;1$ by method of a Gauss curvature flow.</description>

      <title>Effective Heat Transfer Between a Porous Medium and a Fluid Layer: Homogenization and Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.09291v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We are investigating the effective heat transfer in complex systems involving porous media and surrounding fluid layers in the context of mathematical homogenization. We differentiate between two fundamentally different cases: Case (a), where the solid part of the porous media is assumed to consist of disconnected inclusions and Case (b), where the solid matrix is assumed to be connected. For both scenarios, we consider a heat equation with convection where a small scale parameter epsilon characterizes the heterogeneity of the porous medium and conduct a limit process via two-scale convergence for the solutions of the epsilon-problems. In Case (a), we arrive at a one-temperature problem exhibiting a memory term and, in Case (b), at a two-phase mixture model. We compare and discuss these two limit models with several simulation studies both with and without convection.</description>

      <title>Wave map null form estimates via Peter-Weyl theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.13052v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study spacetime estimates for the wave map null form $Q_0$ on $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{S}^3$. By using the Lie group structure of $\mathbb{S}^3$ and Peter-Weyl theory, combined with the time-periodicity of the conformal wave equation on $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{S}^3$, we extend the classical ideas of Klainerman and Machedon to estimates on $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{S}^3$, allowing for a range of powers of natural (Laplacian and wave) Fourier multiplier operators. A key difference in these curved space estimates as compared to the flat case is a loss of an arbitrarily small amount of differentiability, attributable to a lack of dispersion of linear waves on $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{S}^3$. This arises in Fourier space from the product structure of irreducible representations of $\mathrm{SU}(2)$. We further show that our estimates imply weighted estimates for the null form on Minkowski space.</description>

Abstract: We consider the Hartree and Schr\"{o}dinger equations describing the time evolution of wave functions of infinitely many interacting fermions in three-dimensional space. These equations can be formulated using density operators, and they have infinitely many stationary solutions. In this paper, we prove the asymptotic stability of a wide class of stationary solutions. We emphasize that our result includes Fermi gas at zero temperature. This is one of the most important steady states from the physics point of view; however, its asymptotic stability has been left open after Lewin and Sabin first formulated this stability problem and gave significant results in their seminal work [arXiv:1310.0604].</description>

      <title>Curvature effects in pattern formation: well-posedness and optimal control of a sixth-order Cahn-Hilliard equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05189v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work investigates the well-posedness and optimal control of a sixth-order Cahn-Hilliard equation, a higher-order variant of the celebrated and well-established Cahn-Hilliard equation. The equation is endowed with a source term, where the control variable enters as a distributed mass regulator. The inclusion of additional spatial derivatives in the sixth-order formulation enables the model to capture curvature effects, leading to a more accurate depiction of isothermal phase separation dynamics in complex materials systems. We provide a well-posedness result for the aforementioned system when the corresponding nonlinearity of double-well shape is regular and then analyze a corresponding optimal control problem. For the latter, existence of optimal controls is established, and the first-order necessary optimality conditions are characterized via a suitable variational inequality. These results aim at contributing to improve the understanding of the mathematical properties and control aspects of the sixth-order Cahn-Hilliard equation, offering potential applications in the design and optimization of materials with tailored microstructures and properties.</description>

  \quad
  |A_i (x, \xi)|
  \le

      <title>BPHZ renormalisation and vanishing subcriticality asymptotics of the fractional $\Phi^3_d$ model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.13028</link>
      <description>arXiv:1907.13028v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider stochastic PDEs on the $d$-dimensional torus with fractional Laplacian of parameter $\rho\in(0,2]$, quadratic nonlinearity and driven by space-time white noise. These equations are known to be locally subcritical, and thus amenable to the theory of regularity structures, if and only if $\rho &gt; d/3$. Using a series of recent results by the second named author, A. Chandra, I. Chevyrev, M. Hairer and L. Zambotti, we obtain precise asymptotics on the renormalisation counterterms as the mollification parameter $\varepsilon$ becomes small and $\rho$ approaches its critical value. In particular, we show that the counterterms behave like a negative power of $\varepsilon$ if $\varepsilon$ is superexponentially small in $(\rho-d/3)$, and are otherwise of order $\log(\varepsilon^{-1})$. This work also serves as an illustration of the general theory of BPHZ renormalisation in a relatively simple situation.</description>

      <title>On the stability of the invariant probability measures of McKean-Vlasov equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.11612v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the long-time behavior of some McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equations used to model the evolution of large populations of interacting agents. We give conditions ensuring the local stability of an invariant probability measure. Lions derivatives are used in a novel way to obtain our stability criteria. We obtain results for non-local McKean-Vlasov equations on $\mathbb{R}^d$ and for McKean-Vlasov equations on the torus where the interaction kernel is given by a convolution. On $\mathbb{R}^d$, we prove that the location of the roots of an analytic function determines the stability. On the torus, our stability criterion involves the Fourier coefficients of the interaction kernel. In both cases, we prove the convergence in the Wasserstein metric $W_1$ with an exponential rate of convergence.</description>

      <title>A Nystr\"{o}m Method for Scattering by a Two-layered Medium with a Rough Boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.02339v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper considers the problems of scattering of time-harmonic acoustic waves by a two-layered medium with a non-locally perturbed boundary (called a rough boundary in this paper) in two dimensions, where a Dirichlet or impedance boundary condition is imposed on the boundary. The two-layered medium is composed of two unbounded media with different physical properties and the interface between the two media is considered to be a planar surface. We formulate the considered scattering problems as the boundary value problems and prove that each boundary value problem has a unique solution by utilizing the integral equation method associated with the two-layered Green function. Moreover, we develop the Nystr\"{o}m method for numerically solving the considered boundary value problems, based on the proposed integral equation formulations. We establish the convergence results of the Nystr\"{o}m method with the convergence rates depending on the smoothness of the rough boundary. It is worth noting that in establishing the well-posedness of the boundary value problems as well as the convergence results of the Nystr\"{o}m method, an essential role is played by the investigation of the asymptotic properties of the two-layered Green function for small and large arguments. Finally, numerical experiments are carried out to show the effectiveness of the Nystr\"{o}m method.</description>

      <title>Flow by Gauss Curvature to the orlicz Chord Minkowski Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05332v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $L_p$ chord Minkowski problem based on Chord measures and $L_p$ chord measures introduced firstly by Lutwak, Xi, Yang and Zhang [38] is a very important and meaningful geometric measure problem in the $L_p$ Brunn-Minkowski theory. Xi, Yang, Zhang and Zhao [45] using variational methods gave a measure solution when $p &gt; 1$ and $0&lt;p&lt;1$ in the symmetric case. Recently, Guo, Xi and Zhao [18] also obtained a measure solution for $0\leq p&lt;1$ by similar methods without the symmetric assumption.
  In the present paper, we investigate and confirm the orlicz chord Minkowski problem, which generalizes the $L_p$ chord Minkowski problem by replacing $p$ with a fixed continuous function $\varphi:(0,\infty)\rightarrow(0,\infty)$, and achieve the existence of smooth solutions to the orlicz chord Minkowski problem by using methods of Gauss curvature flows.</description>

      <title>A mathematical model of the visual MacKay effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07338v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the intricate connection between visual perception and the mathematical modelling of neural activity in the primary visual cortex (V1). The focus is on modelling the visual MacKay effect [Mackay, Nature 1957]. While bifurcation theory has been a prominent mathematical approach for addressing issues in neuroscience, especially in describing spontaneous pattern formations in V1 due to parameter changes, it faces challenges in scenarios with localized sensory inputs. This is evident, for instance, in Mackay's psychophysical experiments, where the redundancy of visual stimuli information results in irregular shapes, making bifurcation theory and multi-scale analysis less effective. To address this, we follow a mathematical viewpoint based on the input-output controllability of an Amari-type neural fields model. In this framework, we consider sensory input as a control function, a cortical representation via the retino-cortical map of the visual stimulus that captures its distinct features. This includes highly localized information in the center of MacKay's funnel pattern "MacKay rays". From a control theory point of view, the Amari-type equation's exact controllability property is discussed for linear and nonlinear response functions. For the visual MacKay effect modelling, we adjust the parameter representing intra-neuron connectivity to ensure that cortical activity exponentially stabilizes to the stationary state in the absence of sensory input. Then, we perform quantitative and qualitative studies to demonstrate that they capture all the essential features of the induced after-image reported by MacKay.</description>

      <title>On the Multiplicity One Conjecture for Mean Curvature Flows of surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02106v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the Multiplicity One Conjecture for mean curvature flows of surfaces in $\mathbb{R}^3$. Specifically, we show that any blow-up limit of such mean curvature flows has multiplicity one. This has several applications. First, combining our work with results of Brendle and Choi-Haslhofer-Hershkovits-White, we show that any level set flow starting from an embedded surface diffeomorphic to a 2-spheres does not fatten. In fact, we obtain that the problem of evolving embedded 2-spheres via the mean curvature flow equation is well-posed within a natural class of singular solutions. Second, we use our result to remove an additional condition in recent work of Chodosh-Choi-Mantoulidis-Schulze. This shows that mean curvature flows starting from any generic embedded surface only incur cylindrical or spherical singularities. Third, our approach offers a new regularity theory for solutions of mean curvature flows that flow through singularities. Among other things, this theory also applies to the innermost and outermost flow of any embedded surface and shows that all singularity models of such flows must have multiplicity one. It also establishes equality of the fattening time with the discrepancy time. Lastly, we obtain a number of further results characterizing a separation phenomenon of mean curvature flows of surfaces.</description>

      <title>The Case Against Smooth Null Infinity V: Early-Time Asymptotics of Linearised Gravity Around Schwarzschild for Fixed Spherical Harmonic Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04179v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Starting from Post-Newtonian predictions for a system of $N$ infalling masses from the infinite past, we formulate and solve a scattering problem for the system of linearised gravity around Schwarzschild as introduced in [DHR19]. The scattering data are posed on a null hypersurface $\mathcal C$ emanating from a section of past null infinity $\mathcal I^-$, and on the part of $\mathcal I^-$ that lies to the future of this section: Along $\mathcal C$, we implement the Post-Newtonian theory-inspired hypothesis that the gauge-invariant components of the Weyl tensor $\alpha$ and $\underline{\alpha}$ (a.k.a. $\Psi_0$ and $\Psi_4$) decay like $r^{-3}$, $r^{-4}$, respectively, and we exclude incoming radiation from $\mathcal I^-$ by demanding the News function to vanish along $\mathcal I^-$.
  We also show that compactly supported gravitational perturbations along $\mathcal I^-$ induce very similar data, with $\alpha$, $\underline{\alpha}$ decaying like $r^{-3}$, $r^{-5}$ along $\mathcal C$.
  After constructing the unique solution to this scattering problem, we provide a complete analysis of the asymptotic behaviour of projections onto fixed spherical harmonic number $\ell$ near spacelike $i^0$ and future null infinity $\mathcal I^+$. Using our results, we also give constructive corrections to popular historical notions of asymptotic flatness such as Bondi coordinates or asymptotic simplicity. In particular, confirming earlier heuristics due to Damour and Christodoulou, we find that the peeling property is violated both near $\mathcal I^-$ and near $\mathcal I^+$, with e.g. $\alpha$ near $\mathcal I^+$ only decaying like $r^{-4}$ instead of $r^{-5}$. We also find that the resulting solution decays slower towards $i^0$ than often assumed, with $\alpha$ decaying like $r^{-3}$ towards $i^0$.
  The issue of summing up the fixed angular mode estimates in $\ell$ is dealt with in forthcoming work.</description>
