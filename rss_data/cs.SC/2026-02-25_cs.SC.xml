      <title>GENSR: Symbolic Regression Based in Equation Generative Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symbolic Regression (SR) tries to reveal the hidden equations behind observed data. However, most methods search within a discrete equation space, where the structural modifications of equations rarely align with their numerical behavior, leaving fitting error feedback too noisy to guide exploration. To address this challenge, we propose GenSR, a generative latent space-based SR framework following the `map construction -&gt; coarse localization -&gt; fine search'' paradigm. Specifically, GenSR first pretrains a dual-branch Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) to reparameterize symbolic equations into a generative latent space with symbolic continuity and local numerical smoothness. This space can be regarded as a well-structured `map'' of the equation space, providing directional signals for search. At inference, the CVAE coarsely localizes the input data to promising regions in the latent space. Then, a modified CMA-ES refines the candidate region, leveraging smooth latent gradients. From a Bayesian perspective, GenSR reframes the SR task as maximizing the conditional distribution $p(\mathrm{Equ.} \mid \mathrm{Num.})$, with CVAE training achieving this objective through the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO). This new perspective provides a theoretical guarantee for the effectiveness of GenSR. Extensive experiments show that GenSR jointly optimizes predictive accuracy, expression simplicity, and computational efficiency, while remaining robust under noise.</description>

      <title>A Formal Framework for Predicting Distributed System Performance under Faults (Extended Version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19088v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Today's distributed systems operate in complex environments that inevitably involve faults and even adversarial behaviors. Predicting their performance under such environments directly from formal designs remains a longstanding challenge. We present the first formal framework that systematically enables performance prediction of distributed systems across diverse faulty scenarios. Our framework features a fault injector together with a wide range of faults, reusable as a library, and model compositions that integrate the system and the fault injector into a unified model suitable for statistical analysis of performance properties such as throughput and latency. We formalize the framework in Maude and implement it as an automated tool, PERF. Applied to representative distributed systems, PERF accurately predicts system performance under varying fault settings, with estimations from formal designs consistent with evaluations on real deployments.</description>
