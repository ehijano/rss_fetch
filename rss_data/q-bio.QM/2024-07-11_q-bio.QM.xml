      <title>A 3D Pancreatic Cancer Model with Integrated Optical Sensors for Noninvasive Metabolism Monitoring and Drug Screening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A distinct feature of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a prominent tumor microenvironment (TME) with remarkable cellular and spatial heterogeneity that meaningfully impacts disease biology and treatment resistance. The dynamic crosstalk between cancer cells and the dense stromal compartment leads to spatially and temporally heterogeneous metabolic alterations, such as acidic pH that contributes to drug resistance in PDAC. Thus, monitoring the extracellular pH metabolic fluctuations within the TME is crucial to predict and to quantify anticancer drug efficacy. Here, a simple and reliable alginate-based 3D PDAC model embedding ratiometric optical pH sensors and cocultures of tumor (AsPC-1) and stromal cells for simultaneously monitoring metabolic pH variations and quantify drug response is presented. By means of time-lapse confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) coupled with a fully automated computational analysis, the extracellular pH metabolic variations are monitored and quantified over time during drug testing with gemcitabine, folfirinox, and paclitaxel, commonly used in PDAC therapy. In particular, the extracellular acidification is more pronounced after drugs treatment, resulting in increased antitumor effect correlated with apoptotic cell death. These findings highlight the importance of studying the influence of cellular metabolic mechanisms on tumor response to therapy in 3D tumor models, this being crucial for the development of personalized medicine approaches.</description>

      <title>An epidemical model with nonlocal spatial infections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The SIR model is one of the most prototypical compartmental models in epidemiology. Generalizing this ordinary differential equation (ODE) framework into a spatially distributed partial differential equation (PDE) model is a considerable challenge. In the present work, we extend a recently proposed model based on nearest-neighbor spatial interactions by one of the authors in~\cite{vaziry2022modelling} towards a nonlocal, nonlinear PDE variant of the SIR prototype. We then seek to develop a set of tools that provide insights for this PDE framework. Stationary states and their stability analysis offer a perspective on the early spatial growth of the infection. Evolutionary computational dynamics enable visualization of the spatio-temporal progression of infection and recovery, allowing for an appreciation of the effect of varying parameters of the nonlocal kernel, such as, e.g., its width parameter. These features are explored in both one- and two-dimensional settings. At a model-reduction level, we develop a sequence of interpretable moment-based diagnostics to observe how these reflect the total number of infections, the epidemic's epicenter, and its spread. Finally, we propose a data-driven methodology based on the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) to identify approximate closed-form dynamical equations for such quantities. These approaches may pave the way for further spatio-temporal studies, enabling the quantification of epidemics.</description>

      <title>The mouth speaks as much as the eyes: Free-ranging dogs depend on inner facial features for human recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The human face is a multi-signal system continuously transmitting information of identity and emotion. In shared human-animal environments, the face becomes a reliable tool of heterospecific recognition. Because humans display mixed behaviour and pose differential risk to animals, adaptable decision-making based on recognition and classification of humans confer a fitness benefit. The human-dog dyad is an ideal model to study heterospecific recognition due to their shared history, niche overlap, and cognitive co-evolution. Multiple studies on pet dogs have examined their human facial information processing. However, no study has examined these perceptual abilities in free-living populations in their natural habitat where the human-dog relationship is more complex and impacts survival. Comprehensive behavioural analysis of 416 free-ranging dogs in an approach-based task with differential facial occlusion of a human, demonstrated that these dogs recognize and discriminate between familiar and unfamiliar people. Negative behaviours like aggression and avoidance were unlikely to be displayed. Inner facial components like eyes, nose and mouth were more important than outer components like hair in human recognition. Unlike in pet dogs, the occlusion of even a single inner component of the face prevented recognition by facial cue alone. Personality and habitat conditions influenced the behavioural strategy adopted by the dogs too. Considering the ambiguous nature of human interactions, recognition and response in free-ranging dogs relied on dual assessment of identity and intent of a human based, in part, on their ontogeny. Such a cue-processing system highlights the selection pressures inherent in the unpredictable environment of free-living populations.</description>

      <title>DeepGene Transformer: Transformer for the gene expression-based classification of cancer subtypes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.11833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.11833v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cancer and its subtypes constitute approximately 30% of all causes of death globally and display a wide range of heterogeneity in terms of clinical and molecular responses to therapy. Molecular subtyping has enabled the use of precision medicine to overcome these challenges and provide significant biological insights to predict prognosis and improve clinical decision-making. Over the past decade, conventional machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms have been widely espoused for the classification of cancer subtypes from gene expression datasets. However, these methods are potentially biased toward the identification of cancer biomarkers. Hence, an end-to-end deep learning approach, DeepGene Transformer, is proposed which addresses the complexity of high-dimensional gene expression with a multi-head self-attention module by identifying relevant biomarkers across multiple cancer subtypes without requiring feature selection as a pre-requisite for the current classification algorithms. Comparative analysis reveals that the proposed DeepGene Transformer outperformed the commonly used traditional and state-of-the-art classification algorithms and can be considered an efficient approach for classifying cancer and its subtypes, indicating that any improvement in deep learning models in computational biologists can be reflected well in this domain as well.</description>

      <title>Genome-on-Diet: Taming Large-Scale Genomic Analyses via Sparsified Genomics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.08157v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Searching for similar genomic sequences is an essential and fundamental step in biomedical research and an overwhelming majority of genomic analyses. State-of-the-art computational methods performing such comparisons fail to cope with the exponential growth of genomic sequencing data. We introduce the concept of sparsified genomics where we systematically exclude a large number of bases from genomic sequences and enable much faster and more memory-efficient processing of the sparsified, shorter genomic sequences, while providing similar or even higher accuracy compared to processing non-sparsified sequences. Sparsified genomics provides significant benefits to many genomic analyses and has broad applicability. We show that sparsifying genomic sequences greatly accelerates the state-of-the-art read mapper (minimap2) by 2.57-5.38x, 1.13-2.78x, and 3.52-6.28x using real Illumina, HiFi, and ONT reads, respectively, while providing up to 2.1x smaller memory footprint, 2x smaller index size, and more truly detected small and structural variations compared to minimap2. Sparsifying genomic sequences makes containment search through very large genomes and large databases 72.7-75.88x faster and 723.3x more storage-efficient than searching through non-sparsified genomic sequences (with CMash and KMC3). Sparsifying genomic sequences enables robust microbiome discovery by providing 54.15-61.88x faster and 720x more storage-efficient taxonomic profiling of metagenomic samples over the state-of-the-art tool (Metalign). We design and open-source a framework called Genome-on-Diet as an example tool for sparsified genomics, which can be freely downloaded from https://github.com/CMU-SAFARI/Genome-on-Diet.</description>

      <title>Parameter estimation from an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process with measurement noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.13498v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article aims to investigate the impact of noise on parameter fitting for an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, focusing on the effects of multiplicative and thermal noise on the accuracy of signal separation. To address these issues, we propose algorithms and methods that can effectively distinguish between thermal and multiplicative noise and improve the precision of parameter estimation for optimal data analysis. Specifically, we explore the impact of both multiplicative and thermal noise on the obfuscation of the actual signal and propose methods to resolve them. First, we present an algorithm that can effectively separate thermal noise with comparable performance to Hamilton Monte Carlo (HMC) but with significantly improved speed. We then analyze multiplicative noise and demonstrate that HMC is insufficient for isolating thermal and multiplicative noise. However, we show that, with additional knowledge of the ratio between thermal and multiplicative noise, we can accurately distinguish between the two types of noise when provided with a sufficiently large sampling rate or an amplitude of multiplicative noise smaller than thermal noise. Thus, we demonstrate the mechanism underlying an otherwise counterintuitive phenomenon: when multiplicative noise dominates the noise spectrum, one can successfully estimate the parameters for such systems after adding additional white noise to shift the noise balance.</description>

      <title>Inverse modeling of time-delayed interactions via the dynamic-entropy formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.01229v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although instantaneous interactions are unphysical, a large variety of maximum entropy statistical inference methods match the model-inferred and the empirically-measured equal-time correlation functions. Focusing on collective motion of active units, this constraint is reasonable when the interaction timescale is much faster than that of the interacting units, as in starling flocks, yet it fails in a number of counter examples, as in leukocyte coordination (where signalling proteins diffuse among two cells). Here, we relax this assumption and develop a path integral approach to maximum-entropy framework, which includes delay in signalling. Our method is able to infer the strength of couplings and fields, but also the time required by the couplings to completely transfer information among the units. We demonstrate the validity of our approach providing excellent results on synthetic datasets of non-Markovian trajectories generated by the Heisenberg-Kuramoto and Vicsek models equipped with delayed interactions. As a proof of concept, we also apply the method to experiments on dendritic migration, where matching equal-time correlations results in a significant information loss.</description>

      <title>PhenDiff: Revealing Subtle Phenotypes with Diffusion Models in Real Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08290v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For the past few years, deep generative models have increasingly been used in biological research for a variety of tasks. Recently, they have proven to be valuable for uncovering subtle cell phenotypic differences that are not directly discernible to the human eye. However, current methods employed to achieve this goal mainly rely on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). While effective, GANs encompass issues such as training instability and mode collapse, and they do not accurately map images back to the model's latent space, which is necessary to synthesize, manipulate, and thus interpret outputs based on real images. In this work, we introduce PhenDiff: a multi-class conditional method leveraging Diffusion Models (DMs) designed to identify shifts in cellular phenotypes by translating a real image from one condition to another. We qualitatively and quantitatively validate this method on cases where the phenotypic changes are visible or invisible, such as in low concentrations of drug treatments. Overall, PhenDiff represents a valuable tool for identifying cellular variations in real microscopy images. We anticipate that it could facilitate the understanding of diseases and advance drug discovery through the identification of novel biomarkers.</description>

      <title>Generative Plant Growth Simulation from Sequence-Informed Environmental Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14796v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A plant growth simulation can be characterized as a reconstructed visual representation of a plant or plant system. The phenotypic characteristics and plant structures are controlled by the scene environment and other contextual attributes. Considering the temporal dependencies and compounding effects of various factors on growth trajectories, we formulate a probabilistic approach to the simulation task by solving a frame synthesis and pattern recognition problem. We introduce a sequence-informed plant growth simulation framework (SI-PGS) that employs a conditional generative model to implicitly learn a distribution of possible plant representations within a dynamic scene from a fusion of low-dimensional temporal sensor and context data. Methods such as controlled latent sampling and recurrent output connections are used to improve coherence in the plant structures between frames of prediction. In this work, we demonstrate that SI-PGS is able to capture temporal dependencies and continuously generate realistic frames of plant growth.</description>
