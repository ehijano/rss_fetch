      <title>Myths of German Graphite in World War II, with Original Translations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We re-examine the common narrative that a 1941 experimental error by physicists Walther Bothe and Peter Jensen led Germany to abandon graphite as a reactor moderator during World War II. We first detail the history of both German and American graphite experiments, noting that the Americans faced similar setbacks but succeeded only at the end of a costly 18-month graphite purification program. We then use Monte Carlo N-Particle simulations to reconstruct Bothe's 1941 experiment. We find the thermal absorption cross section of Bothe's Siemens electrographite to be 12.2 mb, in contrast to his reported 7.9 mb. This discrepancy arises because the neutrons in Bothe's experiment did not reach thermal equilibrium, leading to an underestimation of neutron absorption. Additionally, despite misconceptions that the Germans were unaware of boron impurities, we share evidence that Wilhelm Hanle accurately measured boron and cadmium impurities in the electrographite. To support our findings, we provide 9 excerpted and 3 complete English translations of classified wartime reports by Heisenberg, Joos, Bothe, Jensen, H\"ocker, Hanle, and Kremer. Our work aims to illuminate the rational constraints behind Germany's decision to forgo graphite moderation.</description>
