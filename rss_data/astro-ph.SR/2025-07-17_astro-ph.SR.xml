      <title>Double White Dwarf Binaries in SDSS-V DR19 : The discovery of a rare DA+DQ white dwarf binary with 31 hour orbital period</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binaries of two white dwarfs (WDs) are an important class of astrophysical objects that are theorized to lead to Type Ia supernovae and are also used to gain insight into complex processes involved in stellar binary evolution. We report the discovery of SDSS~J090618.44+022311.6, a rare post-common envelope binary of a hydrogen atmospheric DA WD and a DQ WD which shows carbon absorption features, and is only the fourth such binary known. We combine the available spectroscopic, photometric, and radial velocity data to provide a self-consistent model for the binary and discuss its history as a binary DA+DQ. The system has a period of 31.17 hours with masses of 0.42 M$_{\odot}$ for DA WD and 0.49 M$_{\odot}$ for DQ WD. The corresponding cooling ages point to an Algol type of evolution with the lower mass star evolving into a DA WD first and later the massive DQ WD is formed. The system has a merger timescale of 450 Gyrs and will lead to the formation of a massive WD. With this, the number of known DA+DQ WD binaries has increased to four, and we find that their stellar properties all lie in the same range. Detailed study of more such systems is vital to understand common processes involved in the formation of this rare class of binaries and give insights towards the broader picture of WD spectral evolution.</description>

      <title>Abundances of P, S, and K in 58 bulge spheroid stars from APOGEE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have previously studied several elements in 58 selected bulge spheroid stars, based on spectral lines in the H-band. We now derive the abundances of the less-studied elements phosphorus (P; Z=15), sulphur (S; Z=16), and potassium (K; Z=19). The abundances of P, S, and K in 58 bulge spheroid stars are compared both with the results of a previous analysis of the data from the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE), and with a few available studies of these elements. We derive the individual abundances through spectral synthesis, using the stellar physical parameters available for our sample from the DR17 release of the APOGEE project. We provide recommendations for the best lines to be used for the studied elements among those in the H-band. We also compare the present results, together with literature data, with chemical-evolution models. Finally, the neutrino-process was taken into account for the suitable fit to the odd-Z elements P and K. We confirm that the H-band has useful lines for the derivation of the elements P, S, and K in moderately metal-poor stars. The abundances, plotted together with literature results from high-resolution spectroscopy, indicate that: moderately enhanced phosphorus stars are found, reminiscent results obtained for thick disk and halo stars of metallicity [Fe/H]~-1.0. Therefore, for the first time, we identify this effect to occur in the old stars from the bulge spheroid. Sulphur is an alpha-element and behaves as such. Potassium and sulphur both exhibit some star-to-star scatter, but fit within the expectations from chemical evolution models.</description>

      <title>Granulation signatures in 3D hydrodynamical simulations: evaluating background model performance using a Bayesian nested sampling framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the granulation background signal is of vital importance when interpreting the asteroseismic diagnostics of solar-like oscillators. Various descriptions exist in the literature for modelling the surface manifestation of convection, the choice of which affects our interpretations. We aim to evaluate the performance of and preference for various granulation background models for a suite of 3D hydrodynamical simulations of convection across the HR diagram, thereby expanding the number of simulations and coverage of parameter space for which such studies have been made. We take a statistical approach by considering the granulation in power density spectra of 3D simulations, where no biases or systematics of observational origin are present. To properly contrast the performance of the models, we develop a Bayesian nested sampling framework for model inference and comparison. This framework was extended to real stellar data using KIC 8006161 (Doris) and the Sun. We find that multi-component models are consistently preferred over a single-component model, with each tested multi-component model demonstrating merit in specific cases. This occurs for simulations with no magnetic activity, thus ruling out stellar faculae as the sole source of the second granulation component. Like a previous study, we find that a hybrid model with a single overall amplitude and two characteristic frequencies performs well for numerous simulations. Additionally, a tentative third granulation component beyond the value of $\nu_\mathrm{max}$ is seen for some simulations, but its potential presence in observations requires further efforts. Studying the granulation signatures in these simulations paves the way to studying stars with accurate granulation models. This deeper understanding of the granulation signal may lead to complementary methods to existing algorithms for determining stellar parameters.</description>

      <title>Current Helicity in Response to Coronal Mass Ejections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coronal mass ejections (CMEs), powerful solar eruptions with massive plasma ejected into the interplanetary space, are caused by the release of the magnetic free enengy stored in coronal electric currents. Photospheric current helicity, defined as the integral of the product of vertical electric current density and vertical magnetic field ($H_c=\int j_zB_z\ dS$), serves as a key parameter in understanding the eruptions. Using a 3D magnetohydrodynamic model, we identify a current helicity reversal pattern associated with the eruption: a pre-eruption decrease and a post-eruption increase. This helicity reversal is attributed to the redistribution of electric currents: before the eruption, currents concentrate toward the polarity inversion line (PIL); after the eruption they move away from the PIL, consistent with the flare ribbon separation, which is caused by the upward progression reconnection site. To validate this pattern, we conducted an observational analysis of 50 $\geq$M5.0 eruptive flares. The results reveal that 58\% of cases exhibited a pre-eruption decrease and 92\% showed the post-eruption increase in current helicity. Detailed analysis of two cases with this reversal suggests that they share the same current redistribution pattern, consistent with the mechanism identified in the simulations. Moreover, the pre-eruption decrease could be observed clearly even in the long-term evolution of the two cases. Current helicity can serve as an indicator of when electric currents are built up for the subsequent eruption, and it has the potential to predict CMEs to some extent.</description>

      <title>The origin of the most recently ejected OB runaway star from the R136 cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $\sim 60\,000$ solar-mass (\MSun) star-cluster R136 (NGC~2070) in the Tarantula Nebula in the Large Magellanic Cloud is the host of at least 55 massive stars ($M \apgt 10$\,\MSun) which move away from the cluster at projected velocities $\gteq 27.5$\,km/s \cite{2024Natur.634..809S}. The origin of the high velocities of such runaway stars have been debated since the 1960s, resulting either from dynamical ejections \citep{1961BAN....15..265B,1961BAN....15..291B} or from supernova explosions \citep{1983ApJ...267..322H}. Due to the Gaia satellite's outstanding precision, we can now retrace the most recently ejected binary star, Mel 34, back to the center of R136 and reconstruct the events that 52\,000 years ago let to its removal from R136, i.e., we establish its dynamical interaction and ejection history. We find that this ejection requires the participation of 5 stars in a strong interaction between a triple composed of the tight massive binary Mel~39 orbited by the star VFTS~590, and the binary star Mel~34. The participation of 5 stars is unexpected because runaway stars were not expected to result from triple interactions \cite{2011Sci...334.1380F}. The deterministic nature of the Newtonian dynamics in the scattering enables us to reconstruct the encounter that ejected Mel~34. We then predict that Mel~39 is a binary star with an 80\,\Msun\, companion star that orbits within $\sim 1^\circ$ in the same plane as Mel~34, and escapes the cluster with a velocity of $\sim 64$\,km/s. The five stars will undergo supernova explosions in the coming 5\,Myr at a distance of $\sim 180$\,pc to $\sim 332$\,pc from their birth location (R\,136). The resulting black hole binaries, however, are not expected to merge within a Hubble time.</description>

      <title>Subspace Approximation to the Focused Transport Equation. II. The Modified Form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transport of energetic particles in a spatially varying magnetic field is described by the focused transport equation. In the past two versions of this equation were investigated. The more commonly used standard form described a pitch-angle isotropization process but does not conserve the norm. In the current paper we consider the focused transport equation in conservative form also called modified focused transport equation. This equation conserves the norm but does not describe pitch-angle isotropization. We use the previously developed subspace method to solve the focused transport equation analytically and numerically. For a pure analytical treatment we employ the two-dimensional subspace approximation. Furthermore, we consider a higher dimensionality for which one needs to evaluate occurring matrix exponentials numerically. This type of semi-numerical approach is much faster than traditional solvers and, therefore, it is very useful.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Parameters for Totally Eclipsing Contact Binaries Observed by TESS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Totally eclipsing contact binaries provide a unique opportunity to accurately determine mass ratios through photometric methods alone, eliminating the need for spectroscopic data. Studying low mass ratio (LMR) contact binaries is crucial for advancing our understanding of binary star evolution and the formation of rare optical transients known as red novae. We identified 143 totally eclipsing contact binaries from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite. These high-precision light curves reveal a distinct O'Connell effect, which we interpret by introducing a cool spot on the primary star. Training a neural network model that includes cool spot parameters can generate a high-precision light curve 2 orders of magnitude faster than Phoebe. Utilizing the neural network (NNnol3) model combined with the Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm, we rapidly derived the fundamental parameters of these systems. By leveraging the relationship between orbital period and semimajor axis using the Random Sample Consensus algorithm, we estimated their absolute parameters. Our analysis identified 96 targets with mass ratios below 0.25, all of which were not listed in any previous catalog, thus signifying the discovery of new LMR system candidates. Assuming all 143 binary systems are affected by a third light during parameter estimation, we train a neural network (NNl3) model considering the third light. Then we calculate the residuals between the mass ratio ql3 (considering the third light) and qnol3 (neglecting it). For these residuals, the 25th percentile (Q1) is 0.012, the median (Q2) is 0.026, and the 75th percentile (Q3) is 0.05.</description>

      <title>Can plasmoid-mediated reconnection occur in collisionless systems?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic reconnection is a process that converts magnetic energy into plasma energy by changing the magnetic field line topology. The outstanding question is why the reconnection rate is $\mathcal{O}(0.01 - 0.1)$ in many astrophysical phenomena, for example solar flares and terrestrial substorms. Previous studies have shown two ideas of Hall reconnection and plasmoid instability. However, there is no consensus on which process is the reason for the fast reconnection. In this paper, we discuss the formation of secondary plasmoids in \rewrite{2D antiparallel collisionless reconnection} using 2.5-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations and discuss whether plasmoid-mediated reconnection occur in collisionless systems by comparing with plasmoid instability in resistive MHD simulations. We find that in collisionless systems secondary plasmoids can indeed form. However, the mass ratio has a strong effect on the formation of secondary plasmoids, and it indicates that secondary plasmoids do not emerge using realistic ion-electron mass ratio ($m_i/m_e = 1836$). Furthermore, we find that there is no enhancement of the reconnection rate due to the secondary plasmoid in the collisionless system, as discussed in the plasmoid-mediated reconnection. Although our simulation $\mathcal{O}(100\lambda_i)$ box is not large enough to discuss astrophysical phenomena such as solar flares, it can reflect a relatively small plasma system such as the Earth's magnetotail.</description>

      <title>Microwave Imaging Spectroscopy Diagnosis of the Slow-rise Precursor of a Major Solar Eruption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this Letter, taking advantage of microwave data from the Expanded Owens Valley Solar Array and extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) data from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly, we present the first microwave imaging spectroscopy diagnosis for the slow-rise precursor of a major coronal mass ejection (CME) on 2022 March 30. The EUV images reveal that the CME progenitor, appearing as a hot channel above the polarity inversion line, experiences a slow rise and heating before the eruption. The microwave emissions are found to mainly distribute along the hot channel, with high-frequency sources located at the ends of the hot channel and along precursor bright loops underneath the hot channel. The microwave spectroscopic analysis suggests that microwave emissions in the precursor phase are dominated by thermal emission, largely different from the main phase when a significant non-thermal component is present. These results support the scenario that the precursor reconnection, seeming to be moderate compared with the flare reconnection during the main phase, drives the build-up, heating, and slow rise of CME progenitors toward the explosive eruption.</description>

      <title>Spectral synthesis of 3D unified model atmospheres with winds for O stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectroscopic studies of massive and luminous O-type stellar atmospheres and winds have primarily been done by using 1D, spherically symmetric and stationary models. Both observations and modern theoretical models show that such stars have highly structured and variable atmospheres and winds. We present first spectral synthesis based on 3D time-dependent unified RHD model atmospheres with winds for O stars. We first carried out time-dependent, 3D simulations of unified atmospheres with winds. We then used 3D radiative transfer to compute surface brightness maps for the optical continuum as well as integrated flux profiles for select diagnostic lines. To derive occupation numbers and source functions, an aNLTE method was used, as well as scattering source functions. Our continuum intensity maps of a prototypical early O star reveal a highly variable and time-dependent surface, characterised by local emergent radiation temperature variations. Our averaged synthetic line profiles of optical absorption lines have large widths, without applying any macro- or microturbulence. From the simulations we find correspondingly large velocity dispersions in the photospheric layers. Additionally, the absorption line EWs are larger than for comparable 1D models. First results using scattering source functions further demonstrate that characteristic features like the softening of the blue edge of strong ultra-violet wind lines are qualitatively well-reproduced by our models. Our 3D simulations clearly predict a highly structured and strongly variable O star surface. First line profile results further suggest that several observed features are naturally reproduced by our models without the need to introduce ad-hoc spectral fitting parameters. We also discuss how using 3D rather than 1D simulations as a basis for future studies may affect the derivation of fundamental stellar parameters.</description>

      <title>The impact of the transport of chemicals and electronic screening on helioseismic and neutrino observations in solar models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transport of chemical elements in stellar interiors is one of the greatest sources of uncertainties of solar and stellar modelling. The Sun, with its exquisite spectroscopic, helioseismic and neutrino observations, offers a prime environment to test the prescriptions used for both microscopic and macroscopic transport processes. We study in detail the impact of various formalisms for atomic diffusion on helioseismic constraints in both CLES (Scuflaire et al., 2008a) and Cesam2k2 (Morel and Lebreton 2008; Marques et al. 2013; Deal et al. 2018) models and compare both codes in detail. Moreover, due to the inability of standard models using microscopic diffusion to reproduce light element depletion in the Sun (Li, Be), another efficient process must be included to reproduce these constraints (rotation-induced: Eggenberger et al. 2022, overshooting -- or penetrative convection -- below the convective envelope: Th\'evenin et al. 2017, or ad hoc turbulence: Lebreton and Maeder 1987; Richer, Michaud, and Turcotte 2000). However, introducing such an extra mixing leads to issues with the CNO neutrino fluxes (see Buldgen et al. 2023), which seem to be systematically lower than the Borexino observations (Appel et al., 2022. Another key aspect to consider when reconciling models with neutrino fluxes is the impact of electronic screening (Mussack and D\"appen, 2011).</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations at 1.3mm have recently revealed surprising complexity in the circumstellar environment of DFK 52, a red supergiant (RSG) located in the Stephenson 2 massive open cluster. We provide an initial characterisation of the star's mass-loss properties by studying its circumstellar emission in continuum, $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, and SiO rotational lines. We find that DFK 52 is surrounded by an extremely large outflow (up to 50,000 au in radius) that shows complex morphologies in both its molecular and dust emission. The size of the circumstellar medium is unprecedented, even when compared with other known extreme RSGs, and its lower luminosity indicates that its mass ejection mechanism may be unique among this population. The molecular emission can be partially reproduced by a two-component model consisting of a fast (27 km/s) detached equatorial component with $M{\sim}0.05$ $M_{\odot}$ and a slow (10 km/s) spherical envelope with $\dot{M}\sim3\times10^{-6}$ $M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. This suggests that DFK 52 underwent a dramatic mass-loss event $\sim$4000 years ago, but has since transitioned into having a slower more symmetric mass loss. We conservatively estimate a total mass of $0.1-1$ $M_{\odot}$ in the complex extended regions of the outflow. The uncertain nature of the dramatic mass loss warrants extensive follow-up of this likely supernova progenitor.</description>

      <title>A young gas giant and hidden substructures in a protoplanetary disk</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detection of planets in protoplanetary disks has proven to be extremely challenging. In contrast, rings and gaps, usually attributed to planet-disk interactions, have been found in virtually every large protoplanetary (Class II) disk observed at 0.9-1.3 mm with sufficient spatial resolution (5 au). The nearby disk around MP Mus (PDS 66) stands as an exception to this rule, and its advanced age (7-10 Myr) is particularly difficult to reconcile with its apparent lack of substructures. Despite the disk's smooth appearance, Gaia data of MP Mus show a significant proper motion anomaly, signalling the presence of a companion. Here we present ALMA 3 mm observations of the system with comparable high spatial resolution to previous 1.3 mm data. The new observations pierce deeper into the disk midplane and reveal an inner cavity (&lt;3 au) and a ring at 10 au. The disk structure inferred from ALMA observations narrows down the properties of the companion to a gas giant orbiting at 1-3 au, and hydrodynamic simulations further confirm that such a planet can produce the observed cavity. These independent pieces of evidence constitute an indirect but compelling detection of an exoplanet within a protoplanetary disk using Gaia astrometry. MP Mus is the first system in which undetected substructures are revealed thanks to the lower optical depths at longer wavelengths, suggesting that rings and gaps are even more abundant than what is currently believed.</description>

      <title>Towards sub-milliarcsecond astrometric precision using seeing-limited imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Earth's atmospheric turbulence degrades the precision of ground-based astrometry. Here we discuss these limitations and propose that, with proper treatment of systematics and by leveraging the many epochs available from the Korean Microlensing Telescope Network (KMTNet), seeing-limited observations can reach sub-milliarcsecond precision. Such observations may be instrumental for the detection of Galactic black holes via microlensing. We present our methodology and pipeline for precise astrometric measurements using seeing-limited observations. The method is a variant of Gaia's Astrometric Global Iterative Solution (AGIS) that include several detrending steps. Tests on 6,500 images of the same field, obtained by KMTNet with typical seeing condition of 1 arcsecond and pixel scale of 0.4 arcsecond, suggest that we can achieve, at the bright end (mag &lt;17), relative proper motion precision of 0.1-0.2 mas/yr, over a baseline of approximately five years, using data from the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory (CTIO) site. The precision is estimated using bootstrap simulations and further validated by comparing results from two independent KMTNet telescopes.</description>

      <title>exoALMA. XVIII. Interpreting large scale kinematic structures as moderate warping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The exoALMA program gave an unprecedented view of the complex kinematics of protoplanetary disks, revealing diverse structures that remain poorly understood. We show that moderate disk warps ($\sim 0.5-2^\circ$) can naturally explain many of the observed large-scale velocity features with azimuthal wavenumber $m = 1$. Using a simple model, we interpret line-of-sight velocity variations as changes in the projected Keplerian rotation caused by warping of the disk. While not a unique explanation, this interpretation aligns with growing observational evidence that warps are common. We demonstrate that such warps can also produce spiral structures in scattered light and CO brightness temperature, with $\sim 10$ K variations in MWC 758. Within the exoALMA sample, warp properties correlate with stellar accretion rates, suggesting a link between the inner disc and outer disc kinematics. If warps cause large-scale kinematic structure, this has far reaching implications for turbulence, angular momentum transport, and planet formation.</description>

      <title>The Galactic Bulge exploration VI.: Gaia Enceladus/Sausage RR Lyrae stars in the inner-central stellar halo of the Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a view of the stellar halo in the inner-central regions of the Milky Way (R &lt;~ 10 kpc) mapped by RR Lyrae stars. The combined BRAVA-RR/APOGEE RR Lyrae catalog is used to obtain a sample of 281 RR Lyrae stars located in the bulge region of the Galaxy, but with orbits indicating they belong to the inner-central halo. The RR Lyrae stars in the halo are more metal-poor than the bulge RR Lyrae stars and have pulsation properties more consistent with an accreted population. We use the Milky Way-like zoom-in cosmological simulation Auriga to compare the properties of the RR Lyrae stars to those expected from the "Gaia-Enceladus-Sausage" (GES) merger. The integrals of motions and eccentricities of the RR Lyrae stars are consistent with a small fraction of 6-9 +- 2 % of the inner-central halo RR Lyrae population having originated from GES. This fraction, lower than what is seen in the solar neighborhood, is consistent with trends seen in the Auriga simulation, where a GES-like merger would have a decreasing fraction of GES stars at small Galactocentric radii compared to other accreted populations. Very few of the Auriga inner Galaxy GES-18 particles have properties consistent with belonging to a bulge population with (z_max &lt; 1.1 kpc), indicating that no (or very few) RR Lyrae stars with bulge orbits should have originated from GES.</description>

      <title>Why Wide Jupiter-Mass Binary-Objects Cannot Form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of $N_{\rm pp} = 40$ Jupiter-mass binary objects (JuMBOs) alongside $N_{\rm p} = 500$ free-floating Jupiter-mass objects (JMOs) in the Trapezium cluster's central portion raises questions about their origin \cite{2023arXiv231001231P}. \citet{2024NatAs...8..756W} argue that the rate at which two planets orbiting the same star are stripped by a close encounter can explain about half the observed JuMBOs in the Trapezium cluster. Although, their cross-section calculations agree with our own \citep{2024ScPA....3....1P}, one cannot extrapolate their results into clustered environments because it ignores the dissociation of JuMBOs due to subsequent encounters in the clustered environment. The inability of forming JuMBOs via the proposed scenario either calls for another formation mechanism, or the observed JuMBOs require thorough confirmation.</description>

      <title>Multi-directional investigations on quiet time suprathermal ions measured by ASPEX-STEPS on-board Aditya L1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The origin, acceleration and anisotropy of suprathermal ions in the interplanetary medium during quiet periods have remained poorly understood issues in solar wind physics. To address these aspects, we derive the spectral indices for the quiet time suprathermal ions based on the measurements by the four directionally separated sensors that are part of the Supra-Thermal and Energetic Particle Spectrometer (STEPS) of Aditya Solar Wind Particle EXperiment (ASPEX) on-board Aditya L1 spacecraft. Three out of four STEPS sensors Parker Spiral (PS), Inter-Mediate (IM), Earth Pointing (EP) are in one plane (nearly aligned with the ecliptic plane) while the fourth sensor North Pointing (NP) is in a mutually orthogonal plane. The energy ranges covered by the PS, IM, EP and NP sensors are 0.36-1.32 MeV, 0.14-1.22 MeV, 0.39-1.33 MeV and 0.12-1.23 MeV respectively. The quiet intervals are identified during January November, 2024 and the derived spectral indices (differential directional flux versus energy) are found to be in the range of 2.0 for all directions in the time scale of a few days revealing isotropic nature of their distribution. Further analysis of elemental abundance ratios (3He/4He, Fe/O, and C/O) during the same quiet intervals obtained from the Ultra-Low Energy Isotope Spectrometer (ULEIS) on board the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) spacecraft suggests possible contributions from the leftover ions from the previous impulsive (Solar flares) and gradual events (CMEs) in the quiet time suprathermal ion pool.</description>

      <title>Panchromatic characterization of the Y0 brown dwarf WISEP J173835.52+273258.9 using JWST/MIRI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cold brown dwarf atmospheres are good training grounds for analyzing temperate giant planets. WISEP J173835.52+273258.9 (WISE 1738) is an isolated Y0 brown dwarf with a temperature between 350-400 K, at the T-Y transition. While its near-infrared spectrum has been studied, bulk properties and chemistry remain uncertain. We analyze new JWST MIRI medium-resolution spectra (5-18 micron), combined with near-infrared spectra (0.98-2.2 micron) from HST/WFC3 and Gemini/GNIRS, to better constrain WISE 1738's atmosphere and physical parameters. We use Neural Posterior Estimation (NPE) with a cloud-free petitRADTRANS model and evaluate results using posterior checks, coverage, and L-C2ST diagnostics. Our retrieval confirms previous constraints on H2O, CH4, and NH3, and for the first time constrains CO, CO2, and 15NH3. We find evidence of disequilibrium chemistry through CO and CO2 abundances not expected under equilibrium. Estimated properties are temperature 402 (+12,-9) K, log g 4.43 (+0.26,-0.34) cm/s2, mass 13 (+11,-7) M_Jup, radius 1.14 (+0.03,-0.03) R_Jup, and bolometric luminosity -6.52 (+0.05,-0.04) log L/L_sun. Evolutionary models suggest an age between 1 and 4 Gyr, consistent with a 6-hour rotation. We place an upper bound on 15NH3, implying a 3-sigma lower limit on the 14N/15N ratio of 275. We also derive a C/O ratio of 1.35 (+0.39,-0.31) and metallicity of 0.34 (+0.12,-0.11), without accounting for oxygen sequestration.</description>

      <title>Constraining shear modulus of polycrystalline neutron star crust: Hashin-Shtrikman variational approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The elastic properties of the neutron star crust are thought to play a crucial role in various phenomena of neutron stars (glitches, oscillations, gravitational wave emission) and should be described quantitatively to model these phenomena. The fundamental problem of this description is associated with the polycrystalline nature of the crust: similar to terrestrial materials, the elastic moduli, strictly speaking, depend on the shape and orientation of crystallites, but for the crust, they are unknown. As a result, some assumptions are generally required to predict the elastic properties or constrain their possible range. In this paper, we follow the commonly believed assumption that the crust is (locally) isotropic, which allows us to describe elastic properties by two (effective) parameters: bulk and shear moduli. The bulk modulus is well determined by the Voigt-Reuss bounds, and we constrain the shear modulus by applying, for the first time in astrophysics of compact stars, the variational Hashin-Shtrikman approach, based on the additional assumption that there are no correlations in the orientation of crystallites. We analyse the Hashin-Shtrikman bounds for the one-component crust taking into account the electron screening and the motion of the nuclei, and for two-component static crystals. In particular, we demonstrate that within applied assumptions the effective shear modulus should be lower than the Voigt estimate, typically applied in the astrophysical literature.</description>

      <title>Using deep learning to characterize single-exposure double-line spectroscopic binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Distinguishing the component spectra of double-line spectroscopic binaries (SB2s) and extracting their stellar parameters is a complex and computationally intensive task that usually requires observations spanning several epochs that represent various orbital phases. This poses an especially significant challenge for large surveys such as Gaia or LAMOST, where the number of available spectra per target is often not enough for a proper spectral disentangling. We present a new approach for characterizing SB2 components from single-exposure spectroscopic observations. The proposed tool uses deep neural networks to extract the stellar parameters of the individual component spectra that comprise the single exposure, without explicitly disentangling them or extracting their radial velocities. The neural networks were trained, tested, and validated using simulated data resembling Gaia RVS spectra, which will be made available to the community in the coming Gaia data releases. We expect our tool to be useful in their analysis.</description>

      <title>The $R$-Process Alliance: Enrichment of $r$-process Elements in a Simulated Milky Way-like Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11943v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the formation of stars with varying amounts of heavy elements synthesized by the rapid neutron-capture process ($r$-process) based on our detailed cosmological zoom-in simulation of a Milky Way-like galaxy with an $N$-body/smoothed particle hydrodynamics code, ASURA. Most stars with no overabundance in $r$-process elements, as well as the strongly $r$-process enhanced $r$-II stars ([Eu/Fe] $&gt;+0.7$), are formed in dwarf galaxies accreted by the Milky Way within the 6 Gyr after the Big Bang. In contrast, over half of the moderately enhanced $r$-I stars ($+0.3 &lt;$ [Eu/Fe] $\leq +0.7$) are formed in the main in-situ disk after 6 Gyr. Our results suggest that the fraction of $r$-I and $r$-II stars formed in disrupted dwarf galaxies is larger the higher their [Eu/Fe] is. Accordingly, the most strongly enhanced $r$-III stars ([Eu/Fe] $&gt; +2.0$) are formed in accreted components. These results suggest that non-$r$-process-enhanced stars and $r$-II stars are mainly formed in low-mass dwarf galaxies that hosted either none or a single neutron star merger, while the $r$-I stars tend to form in the well-mixed in-situ disk. We compare our findings with high-resolution spectroscopic observations of $r$-process-enhanced metal-poor stars in the halo and dwarf galaxies, including those collected by the R-Process Alliance. We conclude that observed [Eu/Fe] and [Eu/Mg] ratios can be employed in chemical tagging of the Milky Way's accretion history.</description>

      <title>BEBOP VII. SOPHIE discovery of BEBOP-3b, a circumbinary giant planet on an eccentric orbit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14615v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Planetary systems orbiting close binaries are valuable testing grounds for planet formation and migration models. More detections with good mass measurements are needed. We present a new planet discovered during the BEBOP survey for circumbinary exoplanets using radial velocities. We use data taken with the SOPHIE spectrograph at the Observatoire de Haute-Provence, and perform a spectroscopic analysis to obtain high precision radial velocities. This planet is the first radial velocity detection of a previously unknown circumbinary system. The planet has a mass of $0.56$ $M_{Jup}$ and orbits its host binary in 550 days with an eccentricity of 0.25. Compared to most of the previously known circumbinary planets, BEBOP-3b has a long period (relative to the binary) and a high eccentricity. There also is a candidate outer planet with a $\sim1400$ day orbital period. We test the stability of potential further candidate signals inside the orbit of BEBOP-3b, and demonstrate that there are stable orbital solutions for planets near the instability region which is where the Kepler circumbinary planets are located. We also use our data to obtain independent dynamical masses for the two stellar components of the eclipsing binary using High Resolution Cross-Correlation Spectroscopy (HRCCS), and compare those results to a more traditional approach, finding them compatible with one another.</description>
