      <title>Feasibility as a moving target: Fluctuating species interactions lead to universal power law in equilibrium abundances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Theoretical ecology has traditionally equated persistence with the stability of a fixed equilibrium point. Here we argue that the primary threat to ecosystem persistence need not be the loss of stability, but instead the escape of the stable equilibrium to a negative orthant. In a realistic setting, fluctuations in interactions do not merely disturb abundances about an equilibrium but can displace the equilibrium point itself. We theoretically and empirically analyze such displacements of the equilibrium point in a complex community. Theoretically, we find that light-tailed fluctuations in species interactions, no matter how small, lead to a heavy-tailed power law $P(y)=1/y^\alpha$ for the equilibrium abundance $y$ of a species. Remarkably, the exponent $\alpha=2$ is a universal value independent of interaction structure, community size, and species. Empirically, our analysis of 34 species reveals a power law signal for most, with a median exponent $\alpha \sim2.56$. Next, we derive a formula for the critical noise, $\sigma_c$, beyond which the community experiences feasibility loss ``with near certainty''. We find that $\sigma_c(N)\sim N^{-1}$, implying that larger communities are significantly more fragile to noise induced feasibility loss. Lastly, we define and calculate biologically measurable analytical metrics for both global and species-specific feasibility escape rates, and implement these metrics in dynamic simulations of 98 real world mutualistic and food web networks, to successfully predict their fragility.</description>

      <title>Experimental and numerical modeling of liposome congregation in meteorite craters of Early Earth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18510v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper provides experimental and numerical evidence supporting the occurrence of liposome congregation at the floors of meteor craters on Early Earth. This work builds on our earlier research, which demonstrated that liposomes submerged in a shallow Archean pond are protected from harmful UV radiation. This protection allows them to survive long enough for autocatalytic replication of amphiphiles and for mutation and selection of assemblies that maximize membrane stability. For liposomes to fuse, grow, exchange contents and membranes, and divide, they need to establish a population, which means forming a dense conglomerate that enables close physical contact. The study demonstrates that such a congregation is feasible in bowl-shaped meteor craters on Early Earth, especially under periodic seismic disturbances.</description>

      <title>Conditionally Site-Independent Neural Evolution of Antibody Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Common deep learning approaches for antibody engineering focus on modeling the marginal distribution of sequences. By treating sequences as independent samples, however, these methods overlook affinity maturation as a rich and largely untapped source of information about the evolutionary process by which antibodies explore the underlying fitness landscape. In contrast, classical phylogenetic models explicitly represent evolutionary dynamics but lack the expressivity to capture complex epistatic interactions. We bridge this gap with CoSiNE, a continuous-time Markov chain parameterized by a deep neural network. Mathematically, we prove that CoSiNE provides a first-order approximation to the intractable sequential point mutation process, capturing epistatic effects with an error bound that is quadratic in branch length. Empirically, CoSiNE outperforms state-of-the-art language models in zero-shot variant effect prediction by explicitly disentangling selection from context-dependent somatic hypermutation. Finally, we introduce Guided Gillespie, a classifier-guided sampling scheme that steers CoSiNE at inference time, enabling efficient optimization of antibody binding affinity toward specific antigens.</description>

      <title>Estimating wolf population size in France using non-invasive genetic sampling and spatial capture recapture models</title>

Abstract: Population size is a key metric for management and conservation. This is especially true for large carnivore populations for which management decisions are often based on population size estimates. In France, gray wolves (Canis lupus) have been monitored for more than two decades using non-invasive genetic sampling and capture-recapture models. Population size estimates directly inform the annual number of wolves that can be killed legally. It is therefore key to use appropriate methods to obtain robust population size estimates. To track the recent numerical and geographical expansion of the population, a substantial increase in sample collection was performed during the winter 2023/24 within the entire wolf distribution range in France. A total of 1964 samples were genotyped and assigned to 576 different individuals using microsatellites genetic markers. During the winter 2023/24, spatial capture-recapture models estimated the wolf population size in France to be likely between 920 and 1125 individuals (95% credible interval). Detection probability varied spatially and was positively influenced by snow cover and accessibility. Wolf density was strongly associated with the recent presence of the species, reflecting the ongoing recolonization process from the Alps. This work illustrates the usefulness of non-invasive genetic data and spatial capture-recapture for large-scale population assessment. It also lays the ground for future improvements in monitoring to fully exploit the potential of spatial capture-recapture models.</description>

      <title>Evolution under Stochastic Transmission: Mutation-Rate Modifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03073v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evolutionary analyses of large populations commonly incorporate stochasticity through temporal variation in selection while treating genetic transmission as fixed. Much less attention has been given to stochasticity in transmission itself. We study a selected locus with alleles $A$ and $a$ under constant selection, linked to a neutral modifier locus whose alleles $M_1$ and $M_2$ control the mutation rate from $A$ to $a$. Under constant transmission, the Reduction Principle applies: near a mutation--selection balance where $M_1$ is fixed with mutation rate $u_1$, a rare allele $M_2$ invades if its associated rate $u_2$ is smaller than $u_1$, but cannot invade if $u_2$ is larger than $u_1$. This result holds for both haploid and diploid populations and is independent of recombination, which affects only the rate, not the direction, of evolutionary change. We extend this framework by allowing the mutation rate associated with the invading modifier to fluctuate randomly across generations. In this stochastic setting, invasion is no longer determined by mean mutation rates alone. Instead, it depends on the temporal distribution of mutation rates, the strength of selection at the selected locus, and the recombination rate between modifier and target. Stochastic transmission and recombination therefore do not merely rescale deterministic predictions based on the Reduction Principle; they can alter the direction of selection on modifier alleles.</description>

      <title>Qualitative analysis and numerical investigations of time-fractional Zika virus model arising in population dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11636v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Epidemic models play a crucial role in population dynamics, offering valuable insights into disease transmission while aiding in epidemic prediction and control. In this paper, we analyze the mathematical model of the time-fractional Zika virus transmission for human and mosquito populations. The fractional derivative is considered in the Caputo sense of order $\alpha\in(0,1).$ We begin by conducting a qualitative analysis using the stability theory of differential equations. The existence and uniqueness of the solution are established, and the model's stability is examined through Hyers-Ulam stability analysis. Furthermore, an efficient difference scheme utilizing the standard L1 technique is developed to simulate the model and analyze the solution's behavior under key parameters. The resulting nonlinear algebraic system is solved using the Newton-Raphson method. Finally, illustrative examples are presented to validate the theoretical findings. Graphical results indicate that the fractional model provides deeper insights and a better understanding of disease dynamics. These findings aid in controlling the virus through contact precautions and recommended therapies while also helping to predict its future spread.</description>
