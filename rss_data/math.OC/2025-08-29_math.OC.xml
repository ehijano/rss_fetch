      <title>Characterization of Safety in Stochastic Difference Inclusions using Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study stochastic systems characterized by difference inclusions. Such stochastic differential inclusions are defined by set-valued maps involving the current state and stochastic input. For such systems, we investigate the problem of proving bounds on the worst-case probability of violating safety properties. Our approach uses the well-known concept of barrier functions from the study of stochastic control systems. However, barrier functions are hard to prove in the presence of stochastic inputs and adversarial choices due to the set-valued nature of the dynamics.
  In this paper, we show that under some assumptions on the set-valued map including upper semi-continuity and convexity combined with a concave barrier function vastly simplifies the proof of barrier conditions, allowing us to effectively substitute each random input in terms of its expectation. We prove key results based on the theory of set-valued maps and provide some interesting numerical examples. The ideas proposed here will contribute to the growing interest in problems of robust control and verification of stochastic systems in the presence of uncertain distributions and unmodeled dynamics.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Splitting for Gradient-Based Unconstrained and Adjoint Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High dimensional and/or nonconvex optimization remains a challenging and important problem across a wide range of fields, such as machine learning, data assimilation, and partial differential equation (PDE) constrained optimization. Here we consider gradient-based methods for solving unconstrained and constrained optimization problems, and introduce the concept of nonlinear splitting to improve accuracy and efficiency. For unconstrained optimization, we consider splittings of the gradient to depend on two arguments, leading to semi-implicit gradient optimization algorithms. In the context of adjoint-based constrained optimization, we propose a splitting of the constraint $F(\mathbf{x},\theta)$, effectively expanding the space on which we can evaluate the ``gradient''. In both cases, the formalism further allows natural coupling of nonlinearly split optimization methods with acceleration techniques, such as Nesterov or Anderson acceleration. The framework is demonstrated to outperform existing methods in terms of accuracy and/or runtime on a handful of diverse optimization problems. This includes low-dimensional analytic nonconvex functions, high-dimensional nonlinear least squares in quantum tomography, and PDE-constrained optimization of kinetic equations, where the total number of high-dimensional kinetic solves is reduced by a factor of three compared with standard adjoint optimization.</description>

      <title>Mean Field Game with Reflected Jump Diffusion Dynamics: A Linear Programming Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a linear programming approach for mean field games with reflected jump-diffusion state dynamices. The jump component is driven by a Poisson process with time-varying intensity, and the multi-dimensional reflections enforce the state process to stay in a bounded domain. We first prove the equivalence between the mean field equilibria in the linear programming formulation and those in the weak relaxed control formulation under some measurability conditions on model coefficients. Building upon the characterization of the occupation measure in the equivalence result, we further establish the existence of linear programming mean field equilibria under mild continuity conditions on model coefficients.</description>

Abstract: This paper studies the geometry of the optimizer for the optimal transport problem with capacity constraints. We introduce the concept of c-capacity monotonicity, which is a generalization of c-cyclical monotonicity in optimal transport. We show that the optimizer of the optimal transport problem with capacity constraints is c-capacity monotone.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Data-Driven Framework for Linear Quadratic Output Feedback Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linear quadratic regulator with unmeasurable states and unknown system matrix parameters better aligns with practical scenarios. However, for this problem, balancing the optimality of the resulting controller and the leniency of the algorithm's feasibility conditions remains a non-trivial challenge, as no well-established general method has yet been developed to address this trade-off. To address this gap, this study first develops a comprehensive theoretical framework for state parameterization that equivalently substitutes for unknown states. By analyzing the controllability of consistent systems satisfied by substitute states, this framework quantifies the capability of substitute state data matrices to parameterize unknown closed-loop systems and output feedback controllers, thereby constructing a modified state parameterization form that meets the complete data parameterization condition of Willems' Fundamental Lemma. Leveraging this framework, this study proposes efficient model-free off-policy policy iteration and value iteration algorithms with theoretical guarantees to solve for the optimal output feedback controller. Compared with existing studies, particularly for multi-output problems where existing model-free reinforcement learning algorithms may fail, the proposed method removes redundant information in substitute states and the additional full row rank condition on regression matrices, thereby ensuring the solution of optimal output feedback controllers equivalent to optimal state feedback controllers for multi-output systems. Furthermore, this study pioneers a comprehensive and highly scalable theoretical analysis of state parameterization from a data-driven viewpoint, and the proposed algorithms exhibit significant advantages in implementation conditions, data demand, unknown handling, and convergence speed.</description>

      <title>Revisit Stochastic Gradient Descent for Strongly Convex Objectives: Tight Uniform-in-Time Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic optimization for strongly convex objectives is a fundamental problem in statistics and optimization. This paper revisits the standard Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) algorithm for strongly convex objectives and establishes tight uniform-in-time convergence bounds. We prove that with probability larger than $1 - \beta$, a $\frac{\log \log k + \log (1/\beta)}{k}$ convergence bound simultaneously holds for all $k \in \mathbb{N}_+$, and show that this rate is tight up to constants. Our results also include an improved last-iterate convergence rate for SGD on strongly convex objectives.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider nested variational inequalities con- sisting in a (upper-level) variational inequality whose feasible set is given by the solution set of another (lower-level) variational inequality. This class of hierarchical equilibrium contains a wealth of important applications, including purely hierarchical convex bilevel optimization problems and certain multi-follower games. Working within a real Hilbert space setting, we develop a double loop prox-penalization algorithm with strong conver- gence guarantees towards a solution of the nested VI problem. We present various application that fit into our framework and present also some preliminary numerical results.</description>

      <title>Low-Rank Multi-Objective Linear Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When solving multi-objective programs, the number of objectives essentially determines the computing time. This can even lead to practically unsolvable problems. Consequently, it is worthwhile to reduce the number of objectives without losing information. In this article, we discuss multi-objective linear programs (MOLP) with objective matrices that do not have a full row rank. We introduce a method to transform an MOLP into an equivalent vector linear program (VLP) with merely as many objectives as the rank of the original objective matrix. To this end, only a factorization of this matrix is needed to be calculated. One of the factors then forms a new ordering cone while the other factor remains as the objective matrix. Through a series of numerical experiments, we will show that this approach indeed leads to a significant speedup of computing time, and therefore provides a powerful technique for solving MOLPs in practice. As there are fewer objectives to consider, the approach additionally helps decision makers to get a better visualization as well as understanding of the actual problem. Moreover, we will point out that the equivalence of the MOLP and the corresponding VLP can be used to derive statements about the concept of nonessential objectives.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Quadratic Programming Solvers via Quadratic Nonconvex Reformulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider solving nonconvex quadratic programming problems using modern solvers such as Gurobi and SCIP. It is well-known that the classical techniques of quadratic convex reformulation can improve the computational efficiency of global solvers for mixed-integer quadratic optimization problems. In contrast, the use of quadratic nonconvex reformulation (QNR) has not been previously explored. This paper introduces a QNR framework--an unconventional yet highly effective approach for improving the performance of state-of-the-art quadratic programming solvers such as Gurobi and SCIP. Our computational experiments on diverse nonconvex quadratic programming problem instances demonstrate that QNR can substantially accelerate both Gurobi and SCIP. Notably, with QNR, Gurobi achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark and randomly generated instances.</description>

      <title>Active-set Newton-MR methods for nonconvex optimization problems with bound constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents active-set methods for minimizing nonconvex twice-continuously differentiable functions subject to bound constraints. Within the faces of the feasible set, we employ descent methods with Armijo line search, utilizing approximated Newton directions obtained through the Minimum Residual (MINRES) method. To escape the faces, we investigate the use of the Spectral Projected Gradient (SPG) method and a tailored variant of the Cubic Regularization of Newton's method for bound-constrained problems. We provide theoretical guarantees, demonstrating that when the objective function has a Lipschitz continuous gradient, the SPG-based method requires no more than $\mathcal{O}(n\epsilon^{-2})$ oracle calls to find $\epsilon$-approximate stationary points, where $n$ is the problem dimension. Furthermore, if the objective function also has a Lipschitz continuous Hessian, we show that the method based on cubic regularization requires no more than $\mathcal{O}\left(n|\log_{2}(\epsilon)|\epsilon^{-3/2}\right)$ oracle calls to achieve the same goal. We emphasize that, under certain hypotheses, the method achieves $O(\epsilon^{3/2})$ descent within the faces without resorting to cubic regularization. Numerical experiments are conducted to compare the proposed methods with existing active-set methods, highlighting the potential benefits of using MINRES instead of the Conjugate Gradient (CG) method for approximating Newton directions.</description>

      <title>Bounds on Perfect Node Classification: A Convex Graph Clustering Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an analysis of the transductive node classification problem, where the underlying graph consists of communities that agree with the node labels and node features. For node classification, we propose a novel optimization problem that incorporates the node-specific information (labels and features) in a spectral graph clustering framework. Studying this problem, we demonstrate a synergy between the graph structure and node-specific information. In particular, we show that suitable node-specific information guarantees the solution of our optimization problem perfectly recovering the communities, under milder conditions than the bounds on graph clustering alone. We present algorithmic solutions to our optimization problem and numerical experiments that confirm such a synergy.</description>

      <title>Objective Value Change and Shape-Based Accelerated Optimization for the Neural Network Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduce a novel metric of an objective function f, we say VC (value change) to measure the difficulty and approximation affection when conducting an neural network approximation task, and it numerically supports characterizing the local performance and behavior of neural network approximation. Neural networks often suffer from unpredictable local performance, which can hinder their reliability in critical applications. VC addresses this issue by providing a quantifiable measure of local value changes in network behavior, offering insights into the stability and performance for achieving the neural-network approximation. We investigate some fundamental theoretical properties of VC and identified two intriguing phenomena in neural network approximation: the VC-tendency and the minority-tendency. These trends respectively characterize how pointwise errors evolve in relation to the distribution of VC during the approximation process.In addition, we propose a novel metric based on VC, which measures the distance between two functions from the perspective of variation. Building upon this metric, we further propose a new preprocessing framework for neural network approximation. Numerical results including the real-world experiment and the PDE-related scientific problem support our discovery and pre-processing acceleration method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic gradient optimization is the dominant learning paradigm for a variety of scenarios, from classical supervised learning to modern self-supervised learning. We consider stochastic gradient algorithms for learning problems whose objectives rely on unknown nuisance parameters, and establish non-asymptotic convergence guarantees. Our results show that, while the presence of a nuisance can alter the optimum and upset the optimization trajectory, the classical stochastic gradient algorithm may still converge under appropriate conditions, such as Neyman orthogonality. Moreover, even when Neyman orthogonality is not satisfied, we show that an algorithm variant with approximately orthogonalized updates (with an approximately orthogonalized gradient oracle) may achieve similar convergence rates. Examples from orthogonal statistical learning/double machine learning and causal inference are discussed.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Stochastic Gradient Tracking Method for Distributed Online Optimization Over Time-Varying Directed Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the increasing scale and dynamics of data, distributed online optimization has become essential for real-time decision-making in various applications. However, existing algorithms often rely on bounded gradient assumptions and overlook the impact of stochastic gradients, especially in time-varying directed networks. This study proposes a novel Time-Varying Hybrid Stochastic Gradient Tracking algorithm named TV-HSGT, based on hybrid stochastic gradient tracking and variance reduction mechanisms. Specifically, TV-HSGT integrates row-stochastic and column-stochastic communication schemes over time-varying digraphs, eliminating the need for Perron vector estimation or out-degree information. By combining current and recursive stochastic gradients, it effectively reduces gradient variance while accurately tracking global descent directions. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that TV-HSGT can achieve improved bounds on dynamic regret without assuming gradient boundedness. Experimental results on logistic regression tasks confirm the effectiveness of TV-HSGT in dynamic and resource-constrained environments.</description>

      <title>Formal equivalence between global optimization consistency and random search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formalize a proof that any stochastic and iterative global optimization algorithm is consistent over Lipschitz continuous functions if and only if it samples the whole search space. To achieve this, we use the L$\exists$$\forall$N theorem prover and the Mathlib library. The major challenge of this formalization, apart from the technical aspects of the proof itself, is to converge to a definition of a stochastic and iterative global optimization algorithm that is both general enough to encompass all algorithms of this type and specific enough to be used in a formal proof. We define such an algorithm as a pair of an initial probability measure and a sequence of Markov kernels that describe the distribution of the next point sampled by the algorithm given the previous points and their evaluations. We then construct a probability measure on finite and infinite sequences of iterations of the algorithm using the Ionescu-Tulcea theorem.</description>

      <title>Activated Backstepping with Control Barrier Functions for the Safe Navigation of Automated Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel safety-critical control method through the synthesis of control barrier functions (CBFs) for systems with high-relative-degree safety constraints. By extending the procedure of CBF backstepping, we propose activated backstepping - a constructive method to synthesize valid CBFs. The novelty of our method is the incorporation of an activation function into the CBF, which offers less conservative safe sets in the state space than standard CBF backstepping. We demonstrate the proposed method on an inverted pendulum example, where we explain the underlying geometric meaning in the state space and provide comparisons with existing CBF synthesis techniques. Finally, we implement our method to achieve collision-free navigation for automated vehicles using a kinematic bicycle model in simulation.</description>

      <title>Model-Free Hovering and Source Seeking via Extremum Seeking Control: Experimental Demonstration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a recent effort, we successfully proposed a categorically novel approach to mimic the phenomenoa of hovering and source seeking by flapping insects and hummingbirds using a new extremum seeking control (ESC) approach. Said ESC approach was shown capable of characterizing the physics of hovering and source seeking by flapping systems, providing at the same time uniquely novel opportunity for a model-free, real-time biomimicry control design. In this paper, we experimentally test and verify, for the first time in the literature, the potential of ESC in flapping robots to achieve model-free, real-time controlled hovering and source seeking. The results of this paper, while being restricted to 1D, confirm the premise of introducing ESC as a natural control method and biomimicry mechanism to the field of flapping flight and robotics.</description>

      <title>Fast Convergence Rates for Subsampled Natural Gradient Algorithms on Quadratic Model Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Subsampled natural gradient descent (SNGD) has shown impressive results for parametric optimization tasks in scientific machine learning, such as neural network wavefunctions and physics-informed neural networks, but it has lacked a theoretical explanation. We address this gap by analyzing the convergence of SNGD and its accelerated variant, SPRING, for idealized parametric optimization problems where the model is linear and the loss function is strongly convex and quadratic. In the special case of a least-squares loss, namely the standard linear least-squares problem, we prove that SNGD is equivalent to a regularized Kaczmarz method while SPRING is equivalent to an accelerated regularized Kaczmarz method. As a result, by leveraging existing analyses we obtain under mild conditions (i) the first fast convergence rate for SNGD, (ii) the first convergence guarantee for SPRING in any setting, and (iii) the first proof that SPRING can accelerate SNGD. In the case of a general strongly convex quadratic loss, we extend the analysis of the regularized Kaczmarz method to obtain a fast convergence rate for SNGD under stronger conditions, providing the first explanation for the effectiveness of SNGD outside of the least-squares setting. Overall, our results illustrate how tools from randomized linear algebra can shed new light on the interplay between subsampling and curvature-aware optimization strategies.</description>

      <title>Estimating the errors for solutions of the SAA method to solve compound and risk averse stochastic programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.08579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.08579v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is a study on solutions of the Sample Average Approximation Method to solve compound stochastic programs. We derive nonasymptotic upper estimates for probabilities of the approximation errors. The results depend on the sample size with explicit terms instead of unspecified universal constants. They allow to conclude immediately nonasymptotic rates for the optimal solutions, and they may be utilized to construct nonasymptotic confidence regions for unique solutions of the genuine compound stochastic programs. In the special case of classical risk neutral stochastic programs, we end up with upper estimates of deviation probabilities for M-estimators, and their nonasymptotic rates. Moreover, we may also demonstrate how to apply the results to sample average approximation of risk averse stochastic programs. In this respect we consider stochastic programs expressed in terms of absolute semideviation risk measures and Average Value at Risk. The investigations are based on concentration inequalities from the recent contribution Kr\"atschmer (2024a). The line of reasoning does not rely on pathwise analytical properties of the objectives. In particular, continuity or convexity in the parameter is not imposed in advance as usual in the literature on the Sample Average Approximation method. It is also shown that objectives with H\"older continuous paths meet the requirements of the main results. Moreover, the main results are applied to objectives whose paths are piecewise H\"older continuous, as e.g. in two stage mixed-integer programs.</description>

      <title>Hovering Flight in Flapping Insects and Hummingbirds: A Natural Real-Time and Stable Extremum Seeking Feedback System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04985v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we take an initial and novel step toward characterizing the hovering phenomenon in flapping insects and hummingbirds as a new class of extremum seeking (ES) feedback systems. By characterizing hovering flight in insects and hummingbirds as a natural hovering ES system, we achieve: (1) very simple, (2) stable, (3) model-free, and (4) real-time hovering. More importantly, our hovering ES characterization only needs the natural oscillations of the wing as the ES input. That is, unlike other control techniques in the literature, the natural hovering ES system only needs the natural flapping action built in the system, and feedback of local sensations (measurements) related to the altitude where the insect seeks to stabilize itself. Said ES characterization, can become an important initial step in starting a new line of research that may succeed in resolving the longstanding gap between model-based control theory and the biologically observed mechanisms that stabilize hovering flight. We provide simulation trials, including comparisons with some approaches from literature, to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our results. We used literature data for hawkmoth, cranefly, bumblebee, dragonfly, hoverfly, and a hummingbird.</description>

      <title>Finite-Agent Stochastic Differential Games on Large Graphs: I. The Linear-Quadratic Case</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09523v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study finite-agent linear-quadratic games on graphs. Specifically, we propose a comprehensive framework that extends the existing literature by incorporating heterogeneous and interpretable player interactions. Compared to previous works, our model offers a more realistic depiction of strategic decision-making processes. For general graphs, we establish the convergence of fictitious play, a widely-used iterative solution method for determining the Nash equilibrium of our proposed game model. Notably, under appropriate conditions, this convergence holds true irrespective of the number of players involved. For vertex-transitive graphs, we develop a semi-explicit characterization of the Nash equilibrium. Through rigorous analysis, we demonstrate the well-posedness of this characterization under certain conditions. We present numerical experiments that validate our theoretical results and provide insights into the intricate relationship between various game dynamics and the underlying graph structure.</description>

      <title>Variable smoothing algorithm for inner-loop-free DC composite optimizations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13990v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a variable smoothing algorithm for minimizing a nonsmooth and nonconvex cost function. The cost function is the sum of a smooth function and a composition of a difference-of-convex (DC) function with a smooth mapping. At each step of our algorithm, we generate a smooth surrogate function by using the Moreau envelope of each weakly convex function in the DC function, and then perform the gradient descent update of the surrogate function. The proposed algorithm does not require any inner loop unlike many existing algorithms for DC problem. We also present a convergence analysis in terms of a DC critical point for the proposed algorithm as well as its application to robust phase retrieval.</description>

      <title>Risk-Aware Adaptive Control Barrier Functions for Safe Control of Nonlinear Systems under Stochastic Uncertainty</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19205v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of ensuring safety in stochastic control systems with high-relative-degree constraints, while maintaining feasibility and mitigating conservatism in risk evaluation. Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) provide an effective framework for enforcing safety constraints in nonlinear systems. However, existing methods struggle with feasibility issues and multi-step uncertainties. To address these challenges, we introduce Risk-aware Adaptive CBFs (RACBFs), which integrate Discrete-time Auxiliary-Variable adaptive CBFs (DAVCBFs) with coherent risk measures. DAVCBFs introduce auxiliary variables to improve the feasibility of the optimal control problem, while RACBFs incorporate risk-aware formulations to balance safety and risk evaluation performance. By extending discrete-time high-order CBF constraints over multiple steps, RACBFs effectively handle multi-step uncertainties that propagate through the system dynamics. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a stochastic unicycle system, showing that RACBFs maintain safety and feasibility while reducing unnecessary conservatism compared to standard robust formulations of discrete-time CBF methods.</description>

      <title>On exactness of SDP relaxation for the maximum cut problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05200v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semidefinite programming provides a relaxation of the maximum cut problem on a graph. Given a graph G with rational weights, the decision problem of whether this relaxation is exact on G is known to be N P -complete since Delorme-Poljak (1993), but its complexity was unresolved for unweighted graphs. In this work, we extend the N P -completeness result for unweighted graphs. We then investigate and present a few classes of graphs for which the semidefinite relaxation of the maximum cut problem is exact. For each class, we determine the optimal objective value by explicitly constructing a maximum cut and prove the uniqueness of the exact solution for two of these classes. Finally, we address two open problems posed by Mirka and Williamson (2024) concerning the rank of the optimal solutions of an exact semidefinite relaxation, providing corresponding counterexamples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02644v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A replicator dynamic for non-exchangeable agents in a continuous action space is formulated and its well-posedness is proven in a space of probability measures. The non-exchangeability allows for the analysis of evolutionary games involving agents with distinct (and possibly infinitely many) types. We also explicitly connect this replicator dynamic to a stationary mean field game, which determines the pairwise actions of the heterogeneous agents. Moreover, as a byproduct of our theoretical results, we show that a class of nonlinear voter models, recently the subject of increasing interest, called q-voter models, can be viewed as a replicator dynamic driven by a utility that is a power of the probability density. This implies that non-exchangeable and/or mean-field game formulations of these models can also be constructed. We also present computational examples of evolutionary and mean field game models using a finite difference method, focusing on tragedy of the commons and the q-voter model with non-exchangeable agents, of which are interesting cases from theoretical and computational perspectives.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16779v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates a class of general linear-quadratic mean field games with common noise, where the diffusion terms of the system contain the state variables, control variables, and the average state terms. We solve the problem using both the direct method and the fixed-point method in the paper. First, by using the variational method to solve a finite $N$-players game problem, we obtain the necessary and sufficient conditions for the centralized open-loop Nash equilibrium strategy. Subsequently, by employing the decoupling technique, we derive the state feedback representation of the centralized open-loop Nash equilibrium strategy in terms of Riccati equations. Next, by studying the asymptotic solvability of the Riccati equations, we construct the decentralized open-loop asymptotic Nash equilibrium strategies. Finally, through some estimates, we prove the asymptotic optimality of the decentralized open-loop Nash equilibrium strategies. Moreover, we find that the decentralized open-loop asymptotic Nash equilibrium strategies obtained via the fixed-point method are identical to those derived using the direct method. Finally, we apply the main results of this paper to a concrete production planning example.</description>

      <title>Joint Planning and Operations of Wind Power under Decision-dependent Uncertainty</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10437v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a joint wind farm planning and operational scheduling problem under decision-dependent uncertainty. The objective is to determine the optimal number of wind turbines at each location to minimize total cost, including both investment and operational expenses. Due to the stochastic nature and geographical heterogeneity of wind power, fluctuations across dispersed wind farms can partially offset one another, thereby influencing the distribution of aggregated wind power generation-a phenomenon known as the smoothing effect. Effectively harnessing this effect requires strategic capacity allocation, which introduces decision-dependent uncertainty into the planning process. To address this challenge, we propose a two-stage distributionally robust optimization model with a decision-dependent Wasserstein ambiguity set, in which both the distribution and the radius are modeled as functions of the planning decisions, reflecting the statistical characteristics of wind power resources. Then, we reformulate the model as a mixed-integer second-order cone program, and the optimal objective value provides a probabilistic guarantee on the out-of-sample performance. To improve computational efficiency, we develop a constraint generation based solution framework that accelerates the solution procedure by hundreds of times. Numerical experiments using different datasets validate the effectiveness of the solution framework and demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed model.</description>

      <title>The Geometry of Constrained Optimization: Constrained Gradient Flows via Reparameterization: A-Stable Implicit Schemes, KKT from Stationarity, and Geometry-Respecting Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18764v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gradient-flow (GF) viewpoints unify and illuminate optimization algorithms, yet most GF analyses focus on unconstrained settings. We develop a geometry-respecting framework for constrained problems by (i) reparameterizing feasible sets with maps whose Jacobians vanish on the boundary (orthant/box) or have rank $n-1$ on the simplex (the Fisher--Shahshahani operator), (ii) deriving flows in parameter space that induce feasible primal dynamics, (iii) discretizing with A-stable implicit schemes (backward Euler on vector domains; feasible Cayley on Stiefel) solved by robust inner loops (modified Gauss--Newton or a KL-prox/negative-entropy Newton--KKT solver), and (iv) proving that stationarity of the dynamics implies KKT, with complementary slackness arising from a simple kinematic mechanism (zero normal speed induced by a vanishing Jacobian or by the Fisher--Shahshahani operator on the simplex). We also treat the Stiefel manifold, where Riemannian stationarity coincides with KKT. The theory yields efficient, geometry-respecting algorithms for each constraint class, with monotone descent and no step-size cap. We include a brief A-stability discussion and present numerical tests (NNLS, simplex- and box-constrained least squares, and Stiefel) demonstrating stability, accuracy, and runtime efficiency of the implicit schemes.</description>

      <title>An Effective Positivstellensatz over the Rational Numbers for Finite Semialgebraic Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04845v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of representing multivariate polynomials with rational coefficients, which are nonnegative and strictly positive on finite semialgebraic sets, using rational sums of squares.
  We focus on the case of finite semialgebraic sets S defined by equality constraints, generating a zero-dimensional ideal I, and by nonnegative sign constraints.
  First, we obtain existential results. We prove that a strictly positive polynomial f with coefficients in a subfield K of R has a representation in terms of weighted Sums-of-Squares with coefficients in this field, even if the ideal I is not radical. We generalize this result to the case where f is nonnegative on S and (f ) + (I : f ) = 1. We deduce that nonnegative polynomials with coefficients in K can be represented in terms of Sum-of-Squares of polynomials with coefficients in K, when the ideal is radical.
  Second, we obtain degree bounds for such Sums-of-Squares representations, which depend linearly on the regularity of the ideal and the degree of the defining equations, when they form a graded basis.
  Finally, we analyze the bit complexity of the Sums-of-Squares representations for polynomials with coefficients in Q, in the case the ideal is radical. The bitsize bounds are quadratic or cubic in the Bezout bound, and linear in the regularity, generalizing and improving previous results obtained for special zero dimensional ideals.
  As an application in the context of polynomial optimization, we retrieve and improve results on the finite convergence and exactness of the moment/Sums-of-Squares hierarchy.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Trust Region Sequential Convex Optimization for Multi-Drone Thermal Screening Trajectory Planning in Urban Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06012v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid detection of abnormal body temperatures in urban populations is essential for managing public health risks, especially during outbreaks of infectious diseases. Multi-drone thermal screening systems offer promising solutions for fast, large-scale, and non-intrusive human temperature monitoring. However, trajectory planning for multiple drones in complex urban environments poses significant challenges, including collision avoidance, coverage efficiency, and constrained flight environments. In this study, we propose an enhanced trust region sequential convex optimization (TR-SCO) algorithm for optimal trajectory planning of multiple drones performing thermal screening tasks. Our improved algorithm integrates a refined convex optimization formulation within a trust region framework, effectively balancing trajectory smoothness, obstacle avoidance, altitude constraints, and maximum screening coverage. Simulation results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves trajectory optimality and computational efficiency compared to conventional convex optimization methods. This research provides critical insights and practical contributions toward deploying efficient multi-drone systems for real-time thermal screening in urban areas. For reader who are interested in our research, we release our source code at https://github.com/Cherry0302/Enhanced-TR-SCO.</description>

      <title>Distributed optimization: designed for federated learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08606v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL), as a distributed collaborative Machine Learning (ML) framework under privacy-preserving constraints, has garnered increasing research attention in cross-organizational data collaboration scenarios. This paper proposes a class of distributed optimization algorithms based on the augmented Lagrangian technique, designed to accommodate diverse communication topologies in both centralized and decentralized FL settings. Furthermore, we develop multiple termination criteria and parameter update mechanisms to enhance computational efficiency, accompanied by rigorous theoretical guarantees of convergence. By generalizing the augmented Lagrangian relaxation through the incorporation of proximal relaxation and quadratic approximation, our framework systematically recovers a broad of classical unconstrained optimization methods, including proximal algorithm, classic gradient descent, and stochastic gradient descent, among others. Notably, the convergence properties of these methods can be naturally derived within the proposed theoretical framework. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm exhibits strong performance in large-scale settings with significant statistical heterogeneity across clients.</description>

      <title>Dimension-Decomposed Learning for Quadrotor Geometric Attitude Control with Almost Global Exponential Convergence on SO(3)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14422v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a lightweight and interpretable online learning approach called Dimension-Decomposed Learning (DiD-L) for disturbance identification in quadrotor geometric attitude control. As a module instance of DiD-L, we propose the Sliced Adaptive-Neuro Mapping (SANM). Specifically, to address underlying underfitting problems, the high-dimensional mapping for online identification is axially ``sliced" into multiple low-dimensional submappings (slices). In this way, the complex high-dimensional problem is decomposed into a set of simple low-dimensional subtasks addressed by shallow neural networks and adaptive laws. These neural networks and adaptive laws are updated online via Lyapunov-based adaptation without the persistent excitation (PE) condition. To enhance the interpretability of the proposed approach, we prove that the state solution of the rotational error dynamics exponentially converges into an arbitrarily small ball within an almost global attraction domain, despite time-varying disturbances and inertia uncertainties. This result is novel as it demonstrates exponential convergence without requiring pre-training for unseen disturbances and specific knowledge of the model. To our knowledge in the quadrotor control field, DiD-L is the first online learning approach that is lightweight enough to run in real-time at 400 Hz on microcontroller units (MCUs) such as STM32, and has been validated through real-world experiments.</description>

      <title>Distributed Implementation of Variational Quantum Eigensolver to Solve QUBO Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17471v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a distributed algorithm and implementation of the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE), termed distributed VQE (DVQE). DVQE, provided as an open-source Python package, enables the execution of parameterized quantum circuits across multiple logical quantum processing units (QPUs) in a distributed fashion. This approach addresses key hardware limitations of near-term quantum devices, including restricted qubit counts and limited circuit depth. Distributed ansatz circuits are constructed to preserve the quantum state fidelity of their monolithic counterparts, allowing consistent energy estimation while distributing the computational load. To improve the convergence and robustness of the optimization loop for identifying the variational parameters of the DVQE ansatz circuit, we use the ADAM optimizer in combination with metaheuristic initialization strategies, which outperform random initialization across various test cases. The complete DVQE pipeline is implemented in a modular Python package that accepts QUBO problems as input and supports monolithic and distributed execution modes. The framework leverages Qiskit to construct and simulate distributed circuits, and includes an internal greedy algorithm for automatic qubit allocation across multiple QPUs. Simulation results on QUBO benchmarks confirm the correctness of the approach, paving the way for real QPU deployment and further exploration of distributed quantum optimization. \textbf{The simulator is publicly available on \href{https://github.com/LSU-RAISE-LAB/DVQE.git}{GitHub} under a package named raiselab, with a collection of tutorial examples.}</description>
