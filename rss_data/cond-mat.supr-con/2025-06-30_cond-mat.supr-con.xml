      <title>Intertwined Orders and the Physics of High Temperature Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex phase diagrams are generic feature of quantum materials that display high temperature superconductivity. In addition to d-wave superconductivity (or other unconventional states), these phase diagrams typically include various forms of charge-ordered phases, including charge-density-waves and/or spin-density waves, and electronic nematic states. In most cases these phases have critical temperatures comparable in magnitude to that of the superconducting state, and appear in a "pseudo-gap" regime. In these systems the high temperature state is not a good metal with well-defined quasiparticles but a "strange metal". These states typically arise from doping a strongly correlated Mott insulator. With my collaborators we have identified these behaviors as a problem with "Intertwined Orders". A Pair-density wave is a type of superconducting state which embodies the physics of intertwined orders. Here I discus the phenomenology of intertwined orders and the quantum materials that are known to display these behaviors.</description>

      <title>A New Experimental Method for Determining the Pinning Energy of an Abrikosov Vortex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a novel method of experimentally addressing the pinning energy of an Abrikosov vortex in high-temperature superconducting thin films. The method is based on our previously published theoretical framework considering the optimization of heterostructural bilayer films. To demonstrate our method, we have estimated the pinning energy of a typical BaZrO$_3$-nanocolumn within YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+x}$ lattice using the experimental data from our previous study. Our calculations result in pinning energy of 0.04 eV/nm for a $c$-axis oriented vortex, which is in excellent agreement with a widely used theoretical formula for artificial columnar defects. However, the estimated energy is significantly higher than what has been previously reported for BaZrO$_3$-nanocolumns based on magnetic relaxation measurements. We argue that this discrepancy originates from the previously raised issues concerning the reliability of the magnetic relaxation measurements in determining the pinning energy. While the presented study only considers BaZrO$_3$-nanocolumns in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+x}$, the demonstrated method is equally applicable to any pinning site and superconducting material. The introduced method of measuring the pinning energy of Abrikosov vortices reduces the present ambiguity around the topic and enables more reliable modeling and design of YBCO based cryogenic memory cells and investigation for their use in quantum applications.</description>

      <title>Theory of Magnon Spintronics: Non-Abelian Gauge Theory of Electron Spintronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Treating the electron as a charged spinon we propose a theory of magnon spintronics, a non-Abelian gauge theory of SU(2)xU(1), which could be viewed as an effective theory of electron spintronics. Just like QED the theory has the U(1) electromagnetic interaction, but the new ingredient is the non-Abelian SU(2) gauge interaction of the magnon with the spinon. A remarkable feature of the theory is the photon-magnon mixing, the mixing between the electromagnetic U(1) gauge boson and the diagonal part of the SU(2) magnon gauge boson. After the mixing we have the massless Abelian magnon and a massive photon, and the doubly charged massive off-diagonal non-Abelian magnons which induce the spin-flip interaction to the spinon. The theory is characterized by three scales. In addition to the correlation length fixed by the mass of the Higgs field it has two different penetration lengths, the one fixed by the mass of the photon which generates the well known Meissner effect and the other fixed by the mass of the off-diagonal magnons which generates the non-Abelian Meissner effect. The non-Abelian structure of the theory naturally accommodates new topological objects, the non-Abrikosov quantized magnonic vortex and non-Abelian magnonic monopole of the Cho-Maison type, as well as the well known Abrikosov vortex. We discuss the physical implications of the non-Abelian gauge theory of the magnon spintronics.</description>

      <title>Vortex structure and intervortex interaction in superconducting structures with intrinsic diode effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the intrinsic superconducting-diode effect can strongly reshape Abrikosov vortices in non-centrosymmetric superconductor/ferromagnet hybrid structures. The Ginzburg-Landau (GL) theory accounting for the spin-orbit and exchange-field effects predicts a chiral distortion of the superfluid velocity, non-central interaction forces and resulting torque in a vortex-antivortex pair, and anisotropy of the Bean-Livingston barrier. These closed-form results are fully confirmed by time-dependent GL numerical simulations carried out with a fourth-order least-squares finite-difference solver, which captures equilibrium single vortex configuration in realistic mesoscopic geometries. The analysis shows that the cubic gradient term shifts vortex cores by an amount proportional to the in-plane exchange field and simultaneously generates a lateral torque that can rotate entire vortex ensembles, showing how spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and the exchange field enable breakdown of the vortex--antivortex symmetry in a finite-size sample. By combining transparent analytics with quantitative numerics, the work provides the hallmarks of vortex physics in superconducting structures with an intrinsic diode effect and supplies concrete guidelines for designing non-reciprocal superconducting circuits, fluxonic logic elements, and kinetic-inductance devices.</description>

      <title>Coherent coupling of YBCO superconducting resonators and 100-nm-thick YIG films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In cavity magnonics, magnon-photon hybridization has been widely investigated for both fundamental studies and applications. Planar superconducting resonators operating at microwave frequencies have demonstrated the possibility to achieve high couplings with magnons by exploiting the confinement of the microwave field in a reduced volume. Here we report a study of the coupling of high-Tc YBCO superconducting waveguides with 100-nm-thick YIG magnetic films. We study the evolution of mode frequencies at different temperatures and extract the coupling strength of hybrid magnon-photon modes. We show that the experimental results can be reproduced using a simple model in which the temperature dependence of the penetration depth accounts for the evolution of the polaritonic spectrum.</description>

      <title>Phase-modulated superconductivity via altermagnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stimulated by recent interest in altermagnets, a novel class of antiferromagnets with macroscopic time-reversal symmetry breaking, we investigate the coexistence of altermagnetism and superconductivity. By developing a Ginzburg--Landau theory based on microscopic models, we show that a phase-modulated Fulde--Ferrell superconducting state is stabilized via altermagnetic spin splitting, in contrast to the typical amplitude-modulated states that occur under a uniform Zeeman field. We apply our framework to different models: a two-sublattice model with altermagnetic order, a continuum model with an anisotropic Zeeman field mimicking altermagnetic spin splitting, and a conventional square-lattice model with two kinds of anisotropic Zeeman fields. Our results indicate that the multi-sublattice structure is crucial for realizing this exotic superconductivity, and highlight spin-split altermagnets as a promising platform for exploring phase-modulated superconductivity without external magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the multiband metallic nature of the normal state in nickelate La3Ni2O7</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09375v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The discovery of unconventional superconductivity around 80 K in perovskite nickelates under high pressure has furnished a new platform to explore high-temperature unconventional superconductivity in addition to cuprates. Understanding the normal state of nickelate superconductors is crucial to uncovering the origin of this unconventional superconductivity and gaining further insight into its underlying mechanism. In this study, we systemically studied the transport properties of La3Ni2O7 by tuning the pressure under high magnetic fields. Magnetoresistance (MR) consistently exhibits a quasi-quadratic dependence on the magnetic field across all measured pressures and temperatures. Increased pressure enhances the metallicity of the system and leads to a monotonic increase in MR, which follows the extended Kohler's rule. These results suggest that the normal state of La3Ni2O7 to be a multiband metallic nature.</description>

      <title>Strong-coupling high-$T_{\rm c}$ superconductivity in doped correlated band insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14601v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the superconducting properties of the bilayer Hubbard model, which exhibits a high transition temperature ($T_{\rm c}$) for an $s_{\pm}$ pairing, using a cluster extension of the dynamical mean-field theory. Unlike the single-layer Hubbard model, where the $d$-wave superconductivity emerges by doping the Mott insulator, the parent state of the bilayer system is a correlated band insulator. Above $T_{\rm c}$, slight hole (electron) doping introduces a striking dichotomy between electron and hole pockets: the electron (hole) pocket develops a pseudogap while the other becomes a nearly incipient band. We reveal that the superconductivity is driven by kinetic (potential) energy gain in the underdoped (overdoped) region. We also find a very short coherence length, for which we argue the relevance to multi-orbital physics. Our study offers crucial insights into the superconductivity in the bilayer Hubbard model potentially relevant to La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.</description>

      <title>Transparent Graphene-Superconductor Interfaces: Quantum Hall and Zero Field Regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13307v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study clean, edge-contacted graphene/superconductor interfaces in both the quantum Hall (QH) and zero field regimes. We find that Andreev reflection is substantially stronger than at an interface with a semiconductor two-dimensional electron gas: the large velocity at graphene's conical Dirac points makes the requirement of current continuity to a metal much less restrictive. In both our tight-binding and continuum models, we find a wide range of parameters for which Andreev reflection is strong. For a transparent interface, we demonstrate the following for graphene in the lowest Landau level QH state: (i) Excellent electron-hole hybridization occurs: the electron and hole components in graphene are simply related by an exchange of sublattice. The spatial profile for the electron component is predominantly gaussian on one sublattice and peaked at the interface, and so very different from the QH edge state of a terminated lattice. (ii) The degree of hybridization is independent of the graphene filling: no fine-tuning is needed. (iii) The spectrum is valley degenerate: the dispersion of each chiral Andreev edge mode (CAEM) self-aligns to be antisymmetric about the center of each valley, independent of filling. Achieving a transparent interface requires the absence of any barrier as well as a superconductor that is suitably matched to graphene; we argue that the latter condition is not very stringent. We further consider the effect of reduced transparency and Zeeman splitting on both the wavefunctions of the CAEM and their dispersion.</description>
