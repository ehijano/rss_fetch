      <title>Modeling the drying process in hard carbon electrodes based on the phase-field method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present work addresses the simulation of pore emptying during the drying of battery electrodes. For this purpose, a model based on the multiphase-field method (MPF) is used, since it is an established approach for modeling and simulating multiphysical problems. A model based on phase fields is introduced that takes into account fluid flow, capillary effects, and wetting behavior, all of which play an important role in drying. In addition, the MPF makes it possible to track the movement of the liquid-air interface without computationally expensive adaptive mesh generation. The presented model is used for the first time to investigate pore emptying in real hard carbon microstructures. For this purpose, the microstructures of real dried electrodes are used as input for the simulations. The simulations performed here demonstrate the importance of considering the resolved microstructural information compared to models that rely only on statistical geometry parameters such as pore size distributions. The influence of various parameters such as different microstructures, fluid viscosity, and the contact angle on pore emptying are investigated. In addition, this work establishes a correlation between the capillary number and the breakthrough time of the solvent as well as the height difference of the solvent front at the time of breakthrough. The results indicate that the drying process can be optimized by doping the particle surface, which changes the contact angle between the fluids and the particles.</description>

      <title>Computational Protein Science in the Era of Large Language Models (LLMs)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Considering the significance of proteins, computational protein science has always been a critical scientific field, dedicated to revealing knowledge and developing applications within the protein sequence-structure-function paradigm. In the last few decades, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has made significant impacts in computational protein science, leading to notable successes in specific protein modeling tasks. However, those previous AI models still meet limitations, such as the difficulty in comprehending the semantics of protein sequences, and the inability to generalize across a wide range of protein modeling tasks. Recently, LLMs have emerged as a milestone in AI due to their unprecedented language processing &amp; generalization capability. They can promote comprehensive progress in fields rather than solving individual tasks. As a result, researchers have actively introduced LLM techniques in computational protein science, developing protein Language Models (pLMs) that skillfully grasp the foundational knowledge of proteins and can be effectively generalized to solve a diversity of sequence-structure-function reasoning problems. While witnessing prosperous developments, it's necessary to present a systematic overview of computational protein science empowered by LLM techniques. First, we summarize existing pLMs into categories based on their mastered protein knowledge, i.e., underlying sequence patterns, explicit structural and functional information, and external scientific languages. Second, we introduce the utilization and adaptation of pLMs, highlighting their remarkable achievements in promoting protein structure prediction, protein function prediction, and protein design studies. Then, we describe the practical application of pLMs in antibody design, enzyme design, and drug discovery. Finally, we specifically discuss the promising future directions in this fast-growing field.</description>
