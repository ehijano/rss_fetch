      <title>Metallicities from High-Resolution TRES Spectra with The Payne and uberMS: Performance Benchmarks and Literature Comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the field of exoplanetary astronomy has matured, there has been growing demand for precise stellar abundances to probe subtle correlations between stellar compositions and planetary demographics. However, drawing population-level conclusions from the disparate measurements in the literature is challenging, with various groups measuring metallicities using bespoke codes with differing line lists, radiative transfer models, and other assumptions. Here we use the neural-net framework uberMS to measure iron abundances and alpha enchriments from high-resolution optical spectra observed by the Tillinghast Reflector Echelle Spectrograph (TRES), a key resource used for the follow-up of candidate exoplanet hosts. To contextualize these measurements and benchmark the performance of our method, we compare to external constraints on metallicity using the Hyades cluster, wide binaries, and asteroids, to external constraints on $T_{\rm eff}$ and $\log g$ using stars with interferometric radii, and to the results of other abundance measurement methods using overlap samples with the APOGEE and SPOCS catalogs, as well as by applying the SPC method directly to TRES spectra. We find that TRES-uberMS provides parameter estimates with errors of roughly 100K in $T_{\rm eff}$, 0.09dex in $\log g$, and 0.04dex in [Fe/H] for nearby dwarf stars. However, [Fe/H] performance is significantly poorer for mid-to-late K dwarfs, with the bias worsening with decreasing $T_{\rm eff}$. Performance is also worse for evolved stars. Our [$\alpha$/Fe] error may be as good as 0.03dex for dwarfs based on external benchmarks, although there are large systematic differences when comparing with specific alpha-element abundances from other catalogs.</description>

      <title>The Relationship of Stellar Radius Inflation to Rotation and Magnetic Starspots at 10--670 Myr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active, low-mass stars are widely observed to have radii that are larger than predicted by standard stellar models. Proposed mechanisms for this radius inflation generally involve stellar magnetism, either in the form of added pressure support in the outer layers and/or suppression of convection via starspots. We have assembled a large sample of 261 low-mass stars in the young clusters Upper Scorpius, $\alpha$ Persei, Pleiades, and Praesepe (spanning ages 10--670 Myr) for which the data exist to empirically measure the stellar radii, rotation periods, and starspot covering fractions. We find a clear, strong relationship between the degree of radius inflation and stellar rotation as represented by the Rossby number; this inflation-rotation relationship bears striking resemblance to canonical activity-rotation relationships, including both the so-called linear and saturated regimes. We also demonstrate here for the first time that the radius inflation depends directly on the starspot covering fraction. We furthermore find that the stars' effective temperatures decrease with decreasing Rossby number as well, and that this temperature suppression balances the radius inflation so as to preserve the stellar bolometric luminosity. These relationships are consistent across the age range sampled here, which spans from the pre--main-sequence to the zero-age main sequence. The favorable comparison of our findings to the predictions of modern starspot-based stellar evolution models suggests that, while rotation is clearly the underlying driver, magnetism may be the most likely direct cause of the radius inflation phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Parametric models of core-helium-burning stars: structural glitches near the core</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the internal structure of core helium burning (CHeB) stars is crucial for evaluating transport processes in nuclear-burning regions, constructing accurate stellar population models, and assessing nucleosynthesis processes that impact the chemical evolution of galaxies. While asteroseismic observations have recently enabled detailed probing of CHeB star interiors, seismic signatures related to structural variations at the boundary between the convective and radiative core, and chemical composition gradients within the radiative core remain underexplored. This paper investigates how such gradients affect the oscillation modes of low-mass CHeB stars, focusing on mixed dipole modes and uncoupled g-modes as diagnostic tools. Using semi-analytical models calibrated with the evolutionary codes $\texttt{BaSTI-IAC}$,$ \texttt{CLES}$, and $\texttt{MESA}$, we examine the impact of density discontinuities and associated structural glitches on mode period spacings. These codes span diverse physical prescriptions, allowing us to isolate robust features relevant for calibration. Our approach enables controlled glitch insertion while preserving a realistic representation of the star. Consistent with prior works, we find that structural glitches introduce periodic components in the period spacings, providing constraints on the location and amplitude of interior variations. We compare models with smooth and sharp transitions, demonstrating how glitch sharpness affects period spacing and mode trapping. Simulations based on four-year $\textit{Kepler}$ data show that our models yield oscillation frequencies closely matching observations. Ultimately, our results offer realistic predictions of how specific structural features affect the power spectral density, validating our theoretical framework and guiding future efforts to interpret glitch signatures in high-precision asteroseismic data.</description>

      <title>Time-resolved p-mode oscillations for subgiant HD 142091 with NEID at WIYN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detections of Earth-analog planets in radial velocity observations are limited by stellar astrophysical variability occurring on a variety of timescales. Current state-of-the-art methods to disentangle potential planet signals from intrinsic stellar signals assume that stellar signals introduce asymmetries to the line profiles that can therefore be separated from the pure translational Doppler shifts of planets. Here, we examine this assumption using a time series of resolved stellar p-mode oscillations in HD 142091 ($\kappa$ CrB), as observed on a single night with the NEID spectrograph at 2-minute cadence and with 25 cm/s precision. As an evolved subgiant star, this target has p-mode oscillations that are larger in amplitude (4-8 m/s) and occur on longer timescales (80 min.) than those of typical Sun-like stars of RV surveys, magnifying their corresponding effects on the stellar spectral profile. We show that for HD 142091, p-mode oscillations manifest primarily as pure Doppler shifts in the average line profile -- measured by the cross-correlation function (CCF) -- with "shape-driven" CCF variations as a higher-order effect. Specifically, we find that the amplitude of the shift varies across the CCF bisector, with 10% larger oscillation amplitudes closer to the core of the CCF, and 25% smaller oscillation amplitudes for bisector velocities derived near the wings; we attribute this trend to larger oscillation velocities higher in the stellar atmosphere. Using a line-by-line analysis, we verify that a similar trend is seen as a function of average line depth, with deeper lines showing larger oscillation amplitudes. Finally, we find no evidence that p-mode oscillations have a chromatic dependence across the NEID bandpass beyond that due to intrinsic line depth differences across the spectrum.</description>

      <title>28 Years of Sun-as-a-star Extreme Ultraviolet Light Curves from SOHO EIT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) Extreme-ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (EIT) has been taking images of the Solar disk and corona in four narrow EUV bandpasses (171\AA, 195\AA, 284\AA, and 304\AA) at a minimum cadence of once per day since early 1996. The time series of fully-calibrated EIT images now spans approximately 28 years, from early 1996 to early 2024, covering solar cycles 23, 24, and the beginning of cycle 25. We convert this extensive EIT image archive into a time series of `Sun-as-a-star' light curves in EIT's four bandpasses, providing a long-term record of solar EUV variability. These Sun-as-a-star light curves, available for download from https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15474179, trace the Sun as if it were a distant point source, viewed from a fixed perspective. We find that our EUV light curves trace the $\sim$ 11-year solar activity cycle and the $\sim$ 27-day rotation period much better than comparable optical observations. In particular, we can accurately recover the solar rotation period from our 284\AA light curve for 26 out of 28 calendar years of EIT observations (93% of the time), compared to only 3 out of 29 calendar years (10% of the time) of the VIRGO total solar irradiance time series, which is dominated by optical light. Our EIT light curves, in conjunction with Sun-as-a-star light curves at optical wavelengths, will be valuable to those interested in inferring the EUV/UV character of stars with long optical light curves but no intensive UV observations, as well as to those interested in long-term records of solar and space weather.</description>

      <title>The OVz stars in NGC 346: distribution, stellar parameters and insights into low-metallicity effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: OVz stars are identified by their optical spectra, in which the He II 4686 absorption line is stronger than any other He line. This spectral characteristic suggests that these stars may be less luminous, less evolved, and located closer to the zero-age main sequence (ZAMS). Although their evolutionary status is still debated, OVz stars are key candidates for understanding the earliest stages of massive star evolution. In this study, we analyze OVz stars in the star-forming regions NGC 346 in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) and 30 Doradus in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), aiming to determine their physical properties and investigate the role of low metallicity in the emergence of the Vz peculiarity. We identified a sample of OVz and OV stars in NGC 346 using spectra obtained with the Magellan Echellette (MagE) spectrograph at Las Campanas Observatory. Spectral classification was based on the equivalent width ratios of key He lines. Quantitative spectroscopic analyses were carried out using the IACOB-BROAD and IACOB-GBAT/FASTWIND tools. For consistency, previously identified OV and OVz stars in 30 Doradus were reclassified following the same criteria.</description>

      <title>The evolution of chromospheric quiet-sun bright points during their lifetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bright points (BPs) are ubiquitous, small-scale energetic events with multithermal signatures, typically observed in the chromosphere and linked to both photospheric structure and coronal composition. Their evolution is influenced by various physical processes, including plasma dynamics and magnetic interactions. This paper examines BP evolution using a large statistical sample, focusing on when they reach maximum values for key attributes, and explores differences between BPs in the "Active Quiet Sun" (AQS, above the network) and the "True Quiet Sun" (TQS, above the internetwork). Observed attributes include maximum brightness (total and intrinsic), plane-of-sky (POS) speed, travel distance, acceleration, and apparent size (POS area). BPs can reach maximum brightness and size at almost any time during their lifetime, likely due to complex chromospheric interactions. AQS and TQS BPs show similar behaviour overall and tend to reach maximum POS speed around the midpoint of their lifetimes. Positive acceleration usually occurs early, while negative acceleration is more common near the end. Preliminary results suggest two distinct BP regimes with differing relationships between intrinsic brightness and area. We interpret these trends as evidence that BPs, whether due to plasma motion or a heating event, follow arched paths -- likely along short magnetic loops. In this model, the midpoint of a BP's life corresponds to the crest of the arch, producing the greatest POS speeds. Reconnection may occur at a footpoint, with the BP moving along the loop before returning to the photosphere. Deviations from this expected evolution may result from complex chromospheric interactions or BPs with highly non-linear POS motions.</description>

      <title>The H$\alpha$ line as a probe of chromospheric magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the diagnostic potential of the H$\alpha$ line for probing the chromospheric magnetic field using a realistic 3D radiative magnetohydrodynamic (rMHD) model. The Stokes profiles of the H$\alpha$ line are synthesized through full 3D radiative transfer under the field-free approximation, alongside the Ca II 8542 {\AA} and Fe I 6173 {\AA} lines for comparison. The line-of-sight (LOS) magnetic fields are inferred using the weak field approximation (WFA) for theH$\alpha$ and Ca II 8542 {\AA} lines, while the Fe I 6173 {\AA} line is analyzed through Milne-Eddington inversion techniques. The comparison between the inferred LOS magnetic field maps and the magnetic fields in the rMHD model revealed that the H$\alpha$ line core primarily probes the chromospheric magnetic field at log tau_500 = -5.7, which corresponds to higher layers than the Ca II 8542 {\AA} line core, which is most sensitive to conditions at log tau_500 = -5.1. On average, the Stokes V profiles of the H$\alpha$ line core form 500 km higher than those of the Ca II 8542 {\AA} line core. The H$\alpha$ polarization signals persist after adding noise, and with noise at the level of 10^-3 Ic, most simulated magnetic structures remain visible. These findings suggest that spectropolarimetric observations of the H$\alpha$ line can provide complementary insights into the stratification of the magnetic field at higher altitudes, especially when recorded simultaneously with widely used chromospheric diagnostics such as the Ca II 8542 {\AA} line.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Drag Torque in Common Envelope Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Common envelope (CE) evolution is largely governed by the drag torque applied on the inspiralling stellar components by the envelope. Previous work has shown that idealized models of the torque based on a single body moving in rectilinear motion through an unperturbed atmosphere can be highly inaccurate. Progress requires new models for the torque that account for binarity. Toward this end we perform a new 3D global hydrodynamic CE simulation with the mass of the companion point particle set equal to the mass of the asymptotic giant branch star core particle to maximize symmetry and facilitate interpretation. First, we find that a region around the particles of a scale comparable to their separation contributes essentially all of the torque. Second, the density pattern of the torque-dominating gas and, to an extent, this gas itself, is roughly in corotation with the binary. Third, approximating the spatial distribution of the torquing gas as a uniform-density prolate spheroid whose major axis resides in the orbital plane and lags the line joining the binary components by a constant phase angle reproduces the torque evolution remarkably well, analogous to studies of binary supermassive black holes. Fourth, we compare the torque measured in the simulation with the predictions of a model that assumes two weak point-mass perturbers undergoing circular motion in a uniform background without gas self-gravity, and find remarkable agreement with our results if the background density is taken to be equal to a fixed fraction ($\approx0.44$) of the density at the spheroid surface. Overall, this work makes progress toward developing simple time-dependent models of the CE phase.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the Observational Properties of the Sun's High-latitude m=1 Inertial Mode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-m inertial modes have been recently discovered in the Sun's high-latitude regions. In this study, we characterize the observational properties of the m = 1 mode by analyzing time-distance subsurface flow maps. Synoptic flow maps, constructed from daily subsurface flow maps using a tracking rate corresponding to the rotation at latitude 65 degrees, are filtered in both the spherical harmonic and Fourier domains to retain only the m = 1 mode and its dominant frequencies. Our analysis reveals a power distribution that is significantly stronger in the northern polar region. The mode's power exhibits an anti-correlation with solar activity, remaining strong and persistent during the solar activity minimum and becoming weaker and more fragmented during the solar maximum. Magnetic flux transported from low to high latitudes influences both the mode's power and lifetime, enhancing its power and shortening its lifetime upon arrival. The phases of the m = 1 mode in the northern and southern polar regions are near-antisymmetric for most of the time with short deviations. We also compute zonal and meridional phase velocities of the mode and find that it exhibits significantly less differential rotation than its surrounding plasma. The meridional phase velocity, comprising both the local plasma's meridional flow and the mode's intrinsic phase motion, is directed poleward below latitude 70 degrees and equatorward above this latitude. These observational findings underscore the need for a deeper understanding of the internal dynamics of the low-m modes, which may offer valuable insights into the structure and dynamics of the solar interior.</description>

      <title>SIP-IFVM: An observation-based magnetohydrodynamic model of coronal mass ejection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Currently, achieving a balance between computational efficiency, accuracy, and numerical stability in CME simulations, particularly in the sub-Alfv{'e}nic coronal region, remains a significant challenge. This paper aims to address the challenge by integrating observational data and developing advanced numerical algorithms, focusing on reproducing large-scale CME evolutions that are consistent with observations in the coronal region. Based on the recently developed fully implicit thermodynamic MHD coronal model (Wang et al. 2025a), we further use an observation-based RBSL flux rope to trigger a CME event during CR 2111. Additionally, we improve the temporal accuracy using a 2nd-order accurate ESDIRK2 method, with the intermediate stage solutions computed by the 2nd-order accurate BDF2 pseudo-time marching method. To enhance the numerical stability of ESDIRK2, we apply approximate linearisation in the implicitly solved intermediate stages. Furthermore, we adjust the time-evolving magnetic field B1 to zero at the end of each physical time step to further validate the extended magnetic field decomposition approach proposed by (Wang et al. 2025a). It is noticed that the model successfully reproduces the CME evolution consistent with white-light coronagraph observations, enables faster-than-real-time CME propagation simulations from solar surface to 0.1 AU using only a few dozen CPU cores on approximately 1 million grid cells, and remains numerically stable in CME simulations involving low-\b{eta} regions. The simulation results show that this novel MHD coronal model, combined with an observation-based magnetic flux rope, is sufficiently numerically stable and computationally efficient to reproduce real CME events propagating through the sub-Alfv{\'e}nic coronal region. Thus, the observation-based CME model is well suited for practical applications in daily space weather forecasting.</description>

      <title>Multiband analysis of the O'Connell effect in 14 eclipsing binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The O'Connell effect is a phenomenon in eclipsing binary (EB) systems that consists of unequal maxima in a light curve when out of eclipse. Despite being known for decades and with several theories proposed over the years, this effect is still not fully understood. Our goal is to find different O'Connell effect properties using a multiband approach, compare them with each other, and find correlations between these properties and the physical parameters of the systems. We present the analysis of 14 new EBs that show the O'Connell effect using multiband data extracted from the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) and Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) all-sky surveys. We measured the difference in maximum amplitudes (delta m) alongside different light curve features in different passbands via a new modeling process that uses Gaussian fits. We created a brand-new phenomenological model for O'Connell effect systems whose analysis had previously been hampered by overfitting. Although the magnitude of the O'Connell effect seems to be more pronounced at shorter effective wavelengths, supporting the idea that cool starspots cause the effect, a conclusive correlation is not found. On the other hand, we do find strong correlations between the magnitude of the effect and both the temperature and the period, both of which are inconsistent with a previous study. We also find that in systems that show both positive and negative O'Connell effects, there are different correlations with the aforementioned parameters. We conclude that, even though starspots may be one cause of the O'Connell effect, it is likely a multipronged phenomenon; for instance, the physical interaction between the components of close binary stars may be another important factor.</description>

      <title>Role of non-thermal processes in the quiescent and active millimeter spectrum of a young M-dwarf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Millimeter (mm) emission from F - M dwarfs (cool stars) primarily traces chromospheric activity, with thermal emission thought to dominate in quiescence. Despite the high chromospheric activity, the quiescent mm spectral fluence (mm-S($\nu$)) of young (&lt; 1 Gyr) M dwarfs (dMs) remain largely unexplored. We present the quiescent mm-S($\nu$) of a young dM, ADLeo, observed around 94 GHz using the Northern Extended Millimetre Array (NOEMA). The observed quiescent mm-S($\nu$) exceeds the thermal flux density from a 1D chromospheric model, constrained by optical-UV spectroscopic data, by up to a factor of 7. This indicates a quasi-steady non-thermal emission powered by supra-thermal electrons unlike in old (&gt; 1 Gyr) cool stars, whose quiescent mm-S($\nu$) generally agree with 1D thermal models. The mm-brightness temperature spectral index ($\alpha_{mm}$; $T_B(\nu)\propto \nu^{- \alpha_{mm}}$) of AD Leo deviates by a factor of 3 from the $\alpha_{mm}$ - $T_{eff}$ scaling law for old sun-like stars (Mohan, A., et al., 2022), while UV Ceti, an older M6V star, follows the trend. Also, we report a double-hump flare with second-scale variability in flux density and spectral index, and a frequency-rising nature with brightness increasing with frequency. The flare resemble certain solar events, but is unlike the second-scale events reported in dMs. The non-thermal flare humps suggest multiple injections of accelerated electrons. The mean flare luminosity (2 - 5 $\times 10^{15} erg s^{-1} Hz^{-1}$) and duration ($18\pm 2$ s) are comparable to flares reported in AU Mic and Proxima Cen, but 100 - 1000 times weaker than the minutes-long dM flares observed by the South Pole Telescope.</description>

      <title>The OATMEAL Survey. II. The 3D spin-orbit obliquity of an eccentric transiting brown dwarf in the Ruprecht 147 open cluster</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present new analysis of the CWW 89 system as part of the Orbital Architectures of Transiting Massive Exoplanets And Low-mass stars (OATMEAL) survey. The CWW 89 system is a member of the 2.8 Gyr old Ruprecht 147 (NGC 6774) cluster and features two stars, CWW 89A (EPIC 219388192) and CWW 89B, with the primary hosting a transiting brown dwarf. We use in-transit, highly precise radial velocity measurements with the Keck Planet Finder (KPF) to characterize the Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) effect and measure the projected spin-orbit obliquity $|\lambda|=1.4\pm2.5^\circ$ and the full 3D spin-orbit obliquity of the brown dwarf to be $\psi=15.1^{+15.0^\circ}_{-10.9}$. This value of $\lambda$ implies that the brown dwarf's orbit is prograde and well-aligned with the equator of the host star, continuing the trend of transiting brown dwarfs showing a preference for alignment ($\lambda \approx 0^\circ$) regardless of the stellar effective temperature. We find that this contrast with the transiting giant planet population, whose spin-orbit alignments depend on host $T_{\rm eff}$, shows an increasingly clear distinction in the formation and orbital migration mechanisms between transiting giant planets and transiting brown dwarfs like CWW 89Ab. For this system in particular, we find it plausible that the brown dwarf may have undergone coplanar high-eccentricity migration influence by CWW 89B.</description>

      <title>The Evolution of Jupiter and Saturn as a function of the Semi-convective Parameter R$_{\rho}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computed using the APPLE planetary evolution code, we present updated evolutionary models for Jupiter and Saturn that incorporate helium rain, non-adiabatic thermal structures, and "fuzzy" extended heavy-element cores. Building on our previous Ledoux-stable models, we implement improved atmospheric boundary conditions that account for composition-dependent effective temperatures and systematically explore the impact of varying the density ratio parameter R$_{\rho}$, which governs in an approximate way the efficiency of semi-convection. For both Jupiter and Saturn, we construct models spanning R$_{\rho}$=1 (Ledoux) to R$_{\rho}$=0 (Schwarzschild), and identify best-fit solutions that match each planet's effective temperature, equatorial radius, lower-order gravitational moments, and atmospheric composition at 4.56 Gyr. We find that lower R$_{\rho}$ values lead to stronger convective mixing, resulting in higher surface metallicities and lower deep interior temperatures, while requiring reduced heavy-element masses and lower initial entropies to stabilize the dilute inner cores. Our Saturn models also agree with the observed Brunt-Vaisala frequency profile inferred from Cassini ring seismology, with stable layers arising from both the helium rain region and the dilute core. These findings support the presence of complex, compositionally stratified interiors in both gas giants.</description>

      <title>The Galactic Bulge exploration V.: The secular spherical and X-shaped Milky Way bulge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19074v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we derive systemic velocities and subsequently orbits for 8456 RR~Lyrae stars. We identify interlopers from other Milky Way (MW) structures, which amount to 22 percent of the total sample. Most interlopers are associated with the halo, with the remainder linked to the Galactic disk. We confirm the previously reported lag in the rotation curve of bulge RR~Lyrae stars regardless of the removal of interlopers. Metal-rich RR~Lyrae stars' rotation patterns are consistent with that of non-variable metal-rich giants, following the MW bar, while metal-poor stars exhibit slower rotation. The analysis of orbital parameter space is used to distinguish bulge stars that, in the bar reference frame, have prograde orbits from those in retrograde orbits. We classify the prograde stars into orbital families and estimate the chaoticity (in the form of frequency drift) of their orbits. RR~Lyrae stars with banana-like orbits have a bimodal distance distribution, similar to the distance distribution seen in the metal-rich red clump stars. The fraction of stars with banana-like orbits decreases linearly with metallicity, as does the fraction of stars on prograde orbits (in the bar reference frame). The retrograde moving stars (in the bar reference frame) form a centrally concentrated nearly spherical distribution. Analyzing an $N$-body+SPH simulation, we find that some stellar particles in the central parts oscillate between retrograde and prograde orbits and only a minority stays prograde over a long period of time. Based on the simulation, the ratio between prograde and retrograde stellar particles seems to stabilize within a couple of gigayears after bar formation. The non-chaoticity of retrograde orbits and their high numbers can explain some of the spatial and kinematical features of the MW bulge that have been often associated with a classical bulge.</description>

      <title>The DECam MAGIC Survey: Spectroscopic Follow-up of the Most Metal-Poor Stars in the Distant Milky Way Halo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present high-resolution spectroscopic observations for six metal-poor stars with [Fe/H]&lt;-3 (including one with [Fe/H]&lt;-4), selected using narrow-band Ca II HK photometry from the DECam MAGIC Survey. The spectroscopic data confirms the accuracy of the photometric metallicities and allows for the determination of chemical abundances for 16 elements, from carbon to barium. The program stars have chemical abundances consistent with this metallicity range. A kinematic/dynamical analysis suggests that all program stars belong to the distant Milky Way halo population (heliocentric distances 35 &lt; dhelio/kpc &lt; 55), including three with high-energy orbits that might have been associated with the Magellanic system and one, J0026-5445, having parameters consistent with being a member of the Sagittarius stream. The remaining two stars show kinematics consistent with the Gaia-Sausage/Enceladus dwarf galaxy merger. J0433-5548, with [Fe/H]=-4.12, is a carbon-enhanced ultra metal-poor star, with [C/Fe]=+1.73. This star is believed to be a bona fide second-generation star, and its chemical abundance pattern was compared with yields from metal-free supernova models. Results suggest that J0433-5548 could have been formed from a gas cloud enriched by a single supernova explosion from a ~11Mo star in the early universe. The successful identification of such objects demonstrates the reliability of photometric metallicity estimates, which can be used for target selection and statistical studies of faint targets in the Milky Way and its satellite population. These discoveries illustrate the power of measuring chemical abundances of metal-poor Milky Way halo stars to learn more about early galaxy formation and evolution.</description>

      <title>Quasi-periodic oscillations and reflection feature evolution in 4U 1630-47 observed with Insight-HXMT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Galactic black hole (BH) X-ray binary 4U 1630-47 went into a new outburst in 2021 after $\sim$ 600 days from its 2020 outburst. We perform a detailed analysis of quasi-periodic oscillations and spectral evolutions during its 2021 outburst based on \textit{Insight}-HXMT observations. The main science aims to study the reflection features evolution of this accreting black hole using the observations of detecting quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) and quasi-regular modulations (QRMs). The QPOs frequencies evolve from $\sim 1.6 - 3.6$ Hz, and QRMs have low frequencies around 0.05 - 0.07 Hz. The reflection fraction varies during the outburst and has a positive correlation with the hardness ratio when QPOs are detected. The centroid frequency of QPOs is anti-correlated to the reflection fraction. This is consistent with the prediction of precessing inner flow model and provides evidence for a geometrical origin of QPOs. The centroid frequency of QRMs also shows an anti-correlation to the reflection fraction, but the hardness ratio shows no relation to the reflection fraction during the period. We suggest that QRMs may have a different origin from QPOs and be caused by instabilities in the corona.</description>

      <title>Birthplaces of X-ray emission lines in Cygnus X-3</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the formation of X-ray emission lines in the wind of the Wolf-Rayet (WR) companion in Cyg X-3 by analyzing their orbital dynamics using Chandra High Energy Transmission Grating (HEG) observations during a hypersoft state. Our goal is to constrain the X-ray transparency of the recently discovered funnel-like structure surrounding the compact star, as revealed by X-ray polarimetry. All lines exhibit sinusoidal orbital modulation, with the velocity amplitude generally increasing and the orbital phase with the highest blueshift generally decreasing for ions with a higher ionisation potential. The {Fe}{xxvi}-line displays velocity extremes at phase 0.25 (blueshift) and 0.75 (redshift), indicating that the line-emitting region is close to the compact component (disc or corona) and thus reflects the orbital motion. The {Fe}{xxv}-line shows a complex behaviour that cannot be fully resolved with the Chandra/HEG resolution. Other lines display velocity extremes scattered around phase 0.5 (blueshift) and 0.0 (redshift), with velocity amplitudes of 100--300 km/s, suggesting their origin in the WR stellar wind between the two components along 3D \xi-surfaces. Parts of the emission lines of {Ar}{xviii} and {Ca}{xx} originated around the compact star (disc or corona). The recent polarisation funnel-modelling is consistent with the present results during the hypersoft state.</description>

      <title>HD 143006: Interferometric Confirmation of Misaligned Protoplanetary Disc with CHARA/MIRCX and VLTI/PIONIER</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The outer regions of the protoplanetary disc surrounding the T Tauri star HD 143006 show rings, dust asymmetries and shadows. Whilst rings and dust asymmetries can arise from companions and other mechanisms, shadows and misaligned discs in particular are typically attributed to the presence of misaligned planets or stellar-mass companions. To understand the mechanisms that drive these traits, the innermost regions of discs need to be studied. Using CHARA/MIRCX and VLTI/PIONIER, we observed the sub-au region of HD 143006. We constrain the orientation of the inner disc of HD 143006 and probe whether a misalignment between the inner and outer disc could be the cause of the shadows. Modelling the visibilities using a geometric model, the inclination and position angle are found to be $i=22^\circ\pm 3^\circ$ and $\mathrm{PA}=158^\circ\pm 8^\circ$ respectively, with an inner dust sublimation radius of $\sim0.04$ au. The inner disc is misaligned by $39^\circ\pm4^\circ$ with respect to the outer disc, with the far side of the inner disc to the east and the far side of the outer disc to the west. We constrain $h/R$ (scattering surface/radius of scattered light) of the outer disc at $18$ au to be about $13\%$ by calculating the offset between the shadow position and the central star. No companion was detected, with a magnitude contrast of $4.4$ in the H-band and placing an upper mass limit of $0.17 M_\odot$ at separations of $0-8$ au. Therefore, we cannot confirm or rule out that a low-mass star or giant planet is responsible for the misalignment and dust sub-structures.</description>

      <title>Line ratio identification of external photoevaporation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: External photoevaporation of protoplanetary discs, by massive O stars in stellar clusters, is thought to be a significant process in the evolution of a disc. It has been shown to result in significant mass loss and disc truncation, ultimately reducing the lifetime of the discs, and possibly affecting potential planet populations. It is a well-studied process in the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC) where the cometary morphology of proplyds is spatially resolvable due to its proximity to Earth. However, we need to study external photoevaporation in additional stellar clusters to better understand its prevalence and significance more globally. Unfortunately, more massive stellar clusters where the majority of stars form are much farther away than the ONC. In these more distant clusters the proplyds are spatially unresolvable with current facilities, hence the cometary morphology is not a useful identification of external photoevaporation. Therefore, in order to identify and interpret external photoevaporation, the only observations we have are of spatially unresolved emission lines. To resolve this issue we have used the CLOUDY code to develop an approximate general model of the emission lines emanating from the hot ionized wind of a proplyd. We have used the model to determine which line ratios are most sensitive to the distance from an OB star, and found that the most sensitive line ratios vary by multiple orders of magnitude over an FUV field of between 10$^3$ G$_0$ to 10$^6$ G$_0$. By identifying spatial gradients of line ratios in stellar clusters, we can identify regions of ongoing external photoevaporation.</description>

      <title>11 New Transiting Brown Dwarfs and Very Low Mass Stars from TESS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09795v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the discovery of 11 new transiting brown dwarfs and low-mass M-dwarfs from NASA's TESS mission: TOI-2844, TOI-3122, TOI-3577, TOI-3755, TOI-4462, TOI-4635, TOI-4737, TOI-4759, TOI-5240, TOI-5467, and TOI-5882. They consist of 5 brown dwarf companions and 6 very low mass stellar companions ranging in mass from $25 M_{\rm J}$ to $128 M_{\rm J}$. We used a combination of photometric time-series, spectroscopic, and high resolution imaging follow-up as a part of the TESS Follow-up Observing Program (TFOP) in order to characterize each system. With over 50 transiting brown dwarfs confirmed, we now have a large enough sample to directly test different formation and evolutionary scenarios. We provide a renewed perspective on the transiting brown dwarf desert and its role in differentiating between planetary and stellar formation mechanisms. Our analysis of the eccentricity distribution for the transiting brown dwarf sample does not support previous claims of a transition between planetary and stellar formation at $\sim42$ $M_{\rm J}$. We also contribute a first look into the metallicity distribution of transiting companions in the range $7 - 150$ $M_{\rm J}$, showing that this too does not support a $\sim42$ $M_{\rm J}$ transition. Finally, we also detect a significant lithium absorption feature in one of the brown dwarf hosts (TOI-5882) but determine that the host star is likely old based on rotation, kinematic, and photometric measurements. We therefore claim that TOI-5882 may be a candidate for planetary engulfment.</description>

      <title>Predicted Neutrino Signal Features of Core-Collapse Supernovae</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we examine the neutrino signals from 24 initially non-rotating, three-dimensional core-collapse supernova (CCSN) simulations carried to late times. We find that not only does the neutrino luminosity signal encode information about each stage of the CCSN process, but that the monotonic dependence of the luminosity peak height with compactness enables one to infer the progenitor core structure from the neutrino signal. We highlight a systematic relationship between the luminosity peak height with its timing. Additionally, we emphasize that the total energy radiated in neutrinos is monotonic with progenitor compactness, and that the mean neutrino energy contains a unique spiral SASI signature for nonexploding, BH-forming models. We also find that neutrino emissions are not isotropic and that the anisotropy increases roughly with progenitor compactness. To assess the detectability of these neutrino signal features, we provide examples of the event rates for our models for the JUNO, DUNE, SK, and IceCube detectors using the SNEWPY software, and find that many of the trends in the luminosity signal can be detectable across several detectors and oscillation models. Finally, we discuss correlations between the radiated neutrino energy and the evolution of the gravitational-wave f-mode.</description>

Abstract: Chemical clocks offer a powerful tool for estimating stellar ages from spectroscopic surveys. We present a new detailed spectroscopic analysis of 68 Kepler red giant stars to provide a suite of high-precision abundances along with asteroseismic ages with better than 10 percent precision from individual mode frequencies. We obtained several chemical clocks as ratios between s-process elements (Y, Zr, Ba, La, Ce) and alpha-elements (Mg, Ca, Si, Al, Ti). Our data show that [Ce/Mg] and [Zr/Ti] display a remarkably tight correlation with stellar ages, with abundance dispersions of 0.08 and 0.01 dex respectively and below 3 Gyr in ages, across the entire Galactic chronochemical history. While improving the precision floor of spectroscopic surveys is critical for broadening the scope and applicability of chemical clocks, the intrinsic accuracy of our relations -- enabled by high-resolution chemical abundances and stellar ages in our sample -- allows us to draw meaningful conclusions about age trends across stellar populations. By applying our relations to the APOGEE and Gaia-ESO surveys, we are able to differentiate the low- and high-alpha sequences in age, recover the age-metallicity relation, observe the disc flaring of the Milky Way, and identify a population of old metal-rich stars.</description>
