      <title>Characteristic subgroups and the R$_\infty$-property for virtual braid groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $n\geq 2$. Let $VB_n$ (resp. $VP_n$) denote the virtual braid group (resp. virtual pure braid group), let $WB_n$ (resp. $WP_n$) denote the welded braid group (resp. welded pure braid group) and let $UVB_n$ (resp. $UVP_n$) denote the unrestricted virtual braid group (resp. unrestricted virtual pure braid group). In the first part of this paper we prove that, for $n\geq 4$, the group $VP_n$ and for $n\geq 3$ the groups $WP_n$ and $UVP_n$ are characteristic subgroups of $VB_n$, $WB_n$ and $UVB_n$, respectively. In the second part of the paper we show that, for $n\geq 2$, the virtual braid group $VB_n$, the unrestricted virtual pure braid group $UVP_n$, and the unrestricted virtual braid group $UVB_n$ have the R$_\infty$-property. As a consequence of the technique used for few strings we also prove that, for $n=2,3,4$, the welded braid group $WB_n$ has the R$_\infty$-property and that for $n=2$ the corresponding pure braid groups have the R$_\infty$-property. On the other hand for $n\geq 3$ it is unknown if the R$_\infty$-property holds or not for the virtual pure braid group $VP_n$ and the welded pure braid group $WP_n$.</description>

      <title>Some properties of Higman-Thompson monoids and digital circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define various monoid versions of the R. Thompson group $V$, and prove connections with monoids of acyclic digital circuits. We show that the monoid $M_{2,1}$ (based on partial functions) is not embeddable into Thompson's monoid ${\sf tot}M_{2,1}$, but that ${\sf tot}M_{2,1}$ has a submonoid that maps homomorphically onto $M_{2,1}$. This leads to an efficient completion algorithm for partial functions and partial circuits. We show that the union of partial circuits with disjoint domains is an element of $M_{2,1}$, and conversely, every element of $M_{2,1}$ can be decomposed efficiently into a union of partial circuits with disjoint domains.</description>

      <title>Cutoff for random Cayley graphs of nilpotent groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the random Cayley graphs of a sequence of finite nilpotent groups of diverging sizes $G=G(n)$, whose ranks and nilpotency classes are uniformly bounded. For some $k=k(n)$ such that $1\ll\log k \ll \log |G|$, we pick a random set of generators $S=S(n)$ by sampling $k$ elements $Z_1,\ldots,Z_k$ from $G$ uniformly at random with replacement, and set $S:=\{Z_j^{\pm 1}:1 \le j\le k \}$. We show that the simple random walk on Cay$(G,S)$ exhibits cutoff with high probability.
  Some of our results apply to a general set of generators. Namely, we show that there is a constant $c&gt;0$, depending only on the rank and the nilpotency class of $G$, such that for all symmetric sets of generators $S$ of size at most $ \frac{c\log |G|}{\log \log |G|}$, the spectral gap and the $\varepsilon$-mixing time of the simple random walk $X=(X_t)_{t\geq 0}$ on Cay$(G,S)$ are asymptotically the same as those of the projection of $X$ to the abelianization of $G$, given by $[G,G]X_t$. In particular, $X$ exhibits cutoff if and only if its projection does.</description>

      <title>Controllability and diffeomorphism groups on manifolds with boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we consider diffeomorphism groups of manifolds with smooth boundary. We show that the diffeomorphism groups of the manifold and its boundary fit into a short exact sequence which admits local sections. In other words, they form an infinite-dimensional fibre bundle. Manifolds with boundary are of interest in numerical analysis and with a view towards applications in machine learning we establish controllability results for families of vector fields. This generalises older results due to Agrachev and Caponigro in the boundary-less case. Our results show in particular that the diffeomorphism group of a manifold with smooth boundary is generated by the image of the exponential map.</description>

      <title>Weakly maximal subgroups of branch groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.06399</link>
      <description>arXiv:1910.06399v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a branch group acting by automorphisms on a rooted tree $T$. Stabilizers of infinite rays in $T$ are examples of weakly maximal subgroups of $G$ (subgroups that are maximal among subgroups of infinite index), but in general they are not the only examples.
  In this note we describe two families of weakly maximal subgroups of branch groups. We show that, for the first Grigorchuk group as well as for the torsion GGS groups, every weakly maximal subgroup belongs to one of these families. The first family is a generalization of stabilizers of rays, while the second one consists of weakly maximal subgroups with a block structure. We obtain different equivalent characterizations of these families in terms of finite generation, the existence of a trivial rigid stabilizer, the number of orbit-closures for the action on the boundary of the tree or by the means of sections.</description>

      <title>Wreath products of groups acting with bounded orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.08001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2102.08001v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: If $\textbf{S}$ is a subcategory of metric spaces, we say that a group G has property $B\textbf{S}$ if any isometric action on an $\textbf{S}$-space has bounded orbits. Examples of such subcategories include metric spaces, affine real Hilbert spaces, CAT(0) cube complexes, connected median graphs, trees or ultra-metric spaces. The corresponding properties $B\textbf{S}$ are respectively Bergman's property, property FH (which, for countable groups, is equivalent to the celebrated Kazhdan's property (T)), property FW (both for CAT(0) cube complexes and for connected median graphs), property FA and uncountable cofinality. Historically many of these properties were defined using the existence of fixed points.
  Our main result is that for many subcategories $\textbf{S}$, the wreath product $G\wr_XH$ has property $B\textbf{S}$ if and only if both $G$ and $H$ have property $B\textbf{S}$ and $X$ is finite. On one hand, this encompasses in a general setting previously known results for properties FH and FW. On the other hand, this also applies to the Bergman's property. Finally, we also obtain that $G\wr_XH$ has uncountable cofinality if and only if both $G$ and $H$ have uncountable cofinality and $H$ acts on $X$ with finitely many orbits.</description>

Abstract: We show that the automorphism groups of right-angled Artin groups whose defining graphs have at least 3 vertices are not relatively hyperbolic. We then show that the outer automorphism groups are not relatively hyperbolic, if they are not virtually isomorphic to a right-angled Artin group whose defining graph is either a single vertex or disconnected.</description>

      <title>Character formula for conjugacy classes in a coset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.07247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.07247v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite group and $N&lt;G$ a normal subgroup with $G/N$ abelian. We show how the conjugacy classes of $G$ in a given coset $qN$ relate to the irreducible characters of $G$ that are not identically $0$ on $qN$. We describe several consequences. In particular, we deduce that when $G/N$ is cyclic generated by $q$, the number of irreducible characters of $N$ that extend to $G$ is the number of conjugacy classes of $G$ in $qN$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.02652v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explain how the germ of the structure group of a cycle set decomposes as a product of its Sylow-subgroups, and how this process can be reversed to construct cycle sets from ones with coprime classes. We study Dehornoy's class associated to a cycle set, and conjecture a bound that we prove in a specific case. We combine the use of braces and a monomial representation, in particular to answer a question by Dehornoy on retrieving the Garside structure without a theorem of Rump, while also retrieving said theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09423v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There are several graphs defined on groups. Among them we consider graphs whose vertex set consists conjugacy classes of a group $G$ and adjacency is defined by properties of the elements of conjugacy classes. In particular, we consider commuting/nilpotent/solvable conjugacy class graph of $G$ where two distinct conjugacy classes $a^G$ and $b^G$ are adjacent if there exist some elements $x\in a^G$ and $y\in b^G$ such that $\langle x, y \rangle$ is abelian/nilpotent/solvable. After a section of introductory results and examples, we discuss all the available results on connectedness, graph realization, genus, various spectra and energies of certain induced subgraphs of these graphs. Proofs of the results are not included. However, many open problems for further investigation are stated.</description>

      <title>RFD property for groupoid C*-algebras of amenable groupoids and for crossed products by amenable actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.12122v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By Bekka's theorem the group C*-algebra of an amenable group $G$ is residually finite dimensional (RFD) if and only if $G$ is maximally almost periodic (MAP). We generalize this result in two directions of dynamical flavour. Firstly, we provide a sufficient condition for the RFD property of the C*-algebra of an amenable \'etale groupoid. Secondly, we characterize RFD property for crossed products by amenable actions of discrete groups on C*-algebras. The characterisation can be formulated in various terms, such as primitive ideals, (pure) states and approximations of representations, and can be viewed as a dynamical version of Exel-Loring characterization of RFD C*-algebras. As byproduct of our methods we also characterize the property FD of Lubotzky and Shalom for semidirect products by amenable groups and obtain characterizations of the properties MAP and RF for general semidirect products of groups. The latter descriptions allow us to obtain the properties MAP, RF, RFD and FD for various examples.</description>
