      <title>Multi-Hypothesis Prediction for Portfolio Optimization: A Structured Ensemble Learning Approach to Risk Diversification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A framework for portfolio allocation based on multiple hypotheses prediction using structured ensemble models is presented. Portfolio optimization is formulated as an ensemble learning problem, where each predictor focuses on a specific asset or hypothesis. The portfolio weights are determined by optimizing the ensemble's parameters, using an equal-weighted portfolio as the target, serving as a canonical basis for the hypotheses. Diversity in learning among predictors is parametrically controlled, and their predictions form a structured input for the ensemble optimization model. The proposed methodology establishes a link between this source of learning diversity and portfolio risk diversification, enabling parametric control of portfolio diversification prior to the decision-making process. Moreover, the methodology demonstrates that the diversity in asset or hypothesis selection, based on predictions of future returns, before and independently of the ensemble learning stage, also contributes to the out-of-sample portfolio diversification. The sets of assets with more diverse but lower average return predictions are preferred over less diverse selections. The methodology enables parametric control of diversity in both the asset selection and learning stages, providing users with significant control over out-of-sample portfolio diversification prior to decision-making. Experiments validate the hypotheses across one-step and multi-step decisions for all parameter configurations and the structured model variants using equity portfolios.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Data for Portfolios: A Throw of the Dice Will Never Abolish Chance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulation methods have always been instrumental in finance, and data-driven methods with minimal model specification, commonly referred to as generative models, have attracted increasing attention, especially after the success of deep learning in a broad range of fields. However, the adoption of these models in financial applications has not kept pace with the growing interest, probably due to the unique complexities and challenges of financial markets. This paper aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of the limitations of generative models, particularly in portfolio and risk management. To this end, we begin by presenting theoretical results on the importance of initial sample size, and point out the potential pitfalls of generating far more data than originally available. We then highlight the inseparable nature of model development and the desired use case by touching on a paradox: generic generative models inherently care less about what is important for constructing portfolios (in particular the long-short ones). Based on these findings, we propose a pipeline for the generation of multivariate returns that meets conventional evaluation standards on a large universe of US equities while being compliant with stylized facts observed in asset returns and turning around the pitfalls we previously identified. Moreover, we insist on the need for more delicate evaluation methods, and suggest, through an example of mean-reversion strategies, a method designed to identify poor models for a given application based on regurgitative training, i.e. retraining the model using the data it has itself generated, which is commonly referred to in statistics as identifiability.</description>

      <title>In-Sample and Out-of-Sample Sharpe Ratios for Linear Predictive Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study how much the in-sample performance of trading strategies based on linear predictive models is reduced out-of-sample due to overfitting. More specifically, we compute the in- and out-of-sample means and variances of the corresponding PnLs and use these to derive a closed-form approximation for the corresponding Sharpe ratios. We find that the out-of-sample ``replication ratio'' diminishes for complex strategies with many assets and based on many weak rather than a few strong trading signals, and increases when more training data is used. The substantial quantitative importance of these effects is illustrated with an empirical case study for commodity futures following the methodology of Garleanu-Pedersen.</description>
