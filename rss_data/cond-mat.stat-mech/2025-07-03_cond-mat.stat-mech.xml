      <title>Dynamic Models for Two Nonreciprocally Coupled Fields: A Microscopic Derivation for Zero, One, and Two Conservation Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct the dynamic models governing two nonreciprocally coupled fields for cases with zero, one, and two conservation laws. Starting from two microscopic nonreciprocally coupled Ising models, and using the mean-field approximation, we obtain closed-form evolution equations for the spatially resolved magnetization in each lattice. For single spin-flip dynamics, the macroscopic equations in the thermodynamic limit are closely related to the nonreciprocal Allen-Cahn equations, i.e. conservation laws are absent. Likewise, for spin-exchange dynamics within each lattice, the thermodynamic limit yields equations similar to the nonreciprocal Cahn-Hilliard model, i.e. with two conservation laws. In the case of spin-exchange dynamics within and between the two lattices, we obtain two nonreciprocally coupled equations that add up to one conservation law. For each of these cases, we systematically map out the linear instabilities that can arise. Our results provide a microscopic foundation for a broad class of nonreciprocal field theories, establishing a direct link between non-equilibrium statistical mechanics and macroscopic continuum descriptions.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic bound on current fluctuations in coherent conductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a universal bound on the large-deviation functions of particle currents in coherent conductors. This bound depends only on the mean value of the relevant current and the total rate of entropy production required to maintain a non-equilibrium steady state, thus showing that both typical and rare current fluctuations are ultimately constrained by dissipation. Our analysis relies on the scattering approach to quantum transport and applies to any multi-terminal setup with arbitrary chemical potential and temperature gradients, provided the transmission coefficients between reservoirs are symmetric. This condition is satisfied for any two-terminal system and, more generally, when the dynamics of particles within the conductor are symmetric under time-reversal. For typical current fluctuations, we recover a recently derived thermodynamic uncertainty relation for coherent transport. To illustrate our theory, we analyze a specific model comprising two reservoirs connected by a chain of quantum dots, which shows that our bound can be saturated asymptotically.</description>

      <title>Spin Systems Coupled to Photons: A Case study of Phase Transition in a One-Dimensional Classical Ferromagnetic Ising Spin Chain at Finite Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although one-dimensional classical spin chains do not exhibit phase transitions, we found that a phase transition does occur when they are coupled to a cavity photon mode. This provides one of the simplest examples demonstrating that finite-temperature superradiant phase transitions can emerge from long-range fully connected interactions mediated by photons and interactions within the material.</description>

      <title>Levy-driven temporally quenched dynamic critical behavior in directed percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quenched disorder in absorbing phase transitions can disrupt the structure and symmetry of reaction-diffusion processes, affecting their phase transition characteristics and offering a more accurate mapping to real physical systems. In the directed percolation (DP) universality class, time quenching is implemented through the dynamic setting of transition probabilities. We developed a non-uniform distribution time quenching method in the (1+1)-dimensional DP model, where the random quenching follows a L\'evy distribution. We use Monte Carlo (MC) simulations to study its phase structure and universality class. The critical point measurements show that this model has a critical region controlling the transition between the absorbing and active states, which changes as the parameter $ \beta $, influencing the distribution properties varies. Guided by dynamic scaling laws, we measured the continuous variation of critical exponents: particle density decay exponent $\alpha$, total particle number change exponent $ \theta $, and dynamic exponent $z$. This evidence establishes that the universality class of L\'evy-quenched DP systems evolves with distribution properties. The L\'evy-distributed quenching mechanism we introduced has broad potential applications in the theory and experiments of various absorbing phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Looking Back: Field theory of transiently chiral active particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a Doi-Peliti Field Theory for transiently chiral active particles in two dimensions, that is, active Brownian particles that undergo tumbles via a diffusing reorientation angle. Using this framework, we compute the mean squared displacement for both uniformly distributed and fixed initial reorientations. We also calculate an array of orientation-based observables, to quantify the transiently chiral behaviour observed.</description>

      <title>Stabilization of long-range order in low-dimensional nonequilibrium $O(N)$ models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is now well established that the Mermin-Wagner theorem can be circumvented in nonequilibrium systems, allowing for the spontaneous breaking of a continuous symmetry and the emergence of long-range order in low dimensions. However, only a few models demonstrating this violation are known, and they often rely on specific mechanisms that may not be generally applicable. In this work, we identify a new mechanism for nonequilibrium-induced long-range order in a class of $O(N)$-symmetric models. Inspired by the role of long-range spatial interactions in equilibrium, consider the effect of non-Markovian dissipation, in stabilizing long range order in low-dimensional nonequilibrium systems. We find that this alone is insufficient, but the interplay of non-Markovian dissipation and slow modes due to conservation laws can effectively suppress fluctuations and stabilize long-range order.</description>

      <title>Extracting the singularity of the logarithmic partition function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In principle, the logarithm of the partition function and its derivatives can be used to rigorously determine the nature of phase transitions. However, in practice, this approach is often ineffective in numerical calculations, since resolving the singularities of the logarithmic partition function requires extremely high precision data especially when distinguishing between weakly first order phase transitions and deconfined quantum critical points. Based on the finite size scaling hypothesis, we propose that the singular contribution to the logarithmic partition function in quantum phase transitions can be extracted by eliminating the leading volume-law term. This is achieved by computing the Renyi thermal entropy (RTE) and its derivative (DRTE). We have derived the scaling relations for RTE and DRTE, which successfully determine the phase transition points and critical exponents through data collapse in various quantum many body systems. Notably, beyond their utility in locating quantum critical points, we find that DRTE is remarkably effective in detecting weakly first order phase transitions, such as in $ JQ $ models, which were initially thought to be continuous deconfined quantum phase transitions. The discontinuity of these transitions is challenging to detect using traditional local physical quantities. This work provides a new and powerful paradigm for studying quantum many body phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous symmetry breaking in an antiferromagnetic Heisenberg chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is generally believed that spontaneous breaking of continuous symmetry is restricted by Hohenberg-Mermin-Wagner theorem. A special case is that the 1D ferromagnetic Heisenberg chain holds long-range order because the order parameter commutes with the Hamiltonian. The other one is that the recently found frustration-free Hamiltonians can bypass this theorem, but the observed symmetry breaking is fragile under generic perturbations. In this work, we have discovered a new example that goes beyond the above two examples -- a 1D antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model -- that can achieve spontaneous breaking of continuous symmetry. Importantly, it is not a frustration-free model and its order parameter does not commute with the Hamiltonian. Moreover, the long-range order is robust under symmetry-preserving perturbations. Combining numerical simulation and theoretical analysis, we have further confirmed and understood this nontrivial phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Functional Renormalization for Signal Detection: Dimensional Analysis and Dimensional Phase Transition for Nearly Continuous Spectra Effective Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Signal detection is one of the main challenges of data science. According to the nature of the data, the presence of noise may corrupt measurements and hinder the discovery of significant patterns. A wide range of techniques aiming at extracting the relevant degrees of freedom from data has been thus developed over the years. However, signal detection in almost continuous spectra, for small signal-to-noise ratios, remains a known difficult issue. This paper develops over recent advancements proposing to tackle this issue by analysing the properties of the underlying effective field theory arising as a sort of maximal entropy distribution in the vicinity of universal random matrix distributions. Nearly continuous spectra provide an intrinsic and non-conventional scaling law for field and couplings, the scaling dimensions depending on the energy scale. The coarse-graining over small eigenvalues of the empirical spectrum defines a specific renormalization group, whose characteristics change when the collective behaviour of "informational" modes become significant, that is, stronger than the intrinsic fluctuations of noise. This paper pursues three different goals. First, we propose to quantify the real effects of fluctuations relative to what can be called "signal", while improving the robustness of the results obtained in our previous work. Second, we show that quantitative changes in the presence of a signal result in a counterintuitive modification of the distribution of eigenvectors. Finally, we propose a method for estimating the number of noise components and define a limit of detection in a general nearly continuous spectrum using the renormalization group. The main statements of this paper are essentially numeric, and their reproducibility can be checked using the associated code.</description>

      <title>Mixed five-point correlators in the 3d Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study five-point correlators of the $\sigma$, $\epsilon$, and $\epsilon'$ operators in the critical 3d Ising model. We consider the $\sigma \times \sigma$ and $\sigma \times \epsilon$ operator product expansions (OPEs) and truncate them by including a finite set of exchanged operators. We approximate the truncated operators by the corresponding contributions in appropriate disconnected five-point correlators. We compute a number of OPE coefficients that were previously unknown and show that these are consistent with predictions obtained using the fuzzy sphere regularization of the critical 3d Ising model.</description>

      <title>Fluid-dynamic limit of the Enskog equation with the guaranteed H-theorem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fluid-dynamic limit of the Enskog equation with a slight modification is discussed on the basis of the Chapman-Enskog method. This modified version of the Enskog equation has been shown recently by the present authors to ensure the H-theorem. In the present paper, it is shown that the modified version recovers the same fluid-dynamic description of the dense gas as the original Enskog equation, at least up to the level of the Navier-Stokes-Fourier set of equations inclusive. Since the original Enskog equation is known to recover the fluid-dynamical transport properties well, this result implies that the modified version of the Enskog equation provides consistent descriptions both thermodynamically and fluid-dynamically.</description>

      <title>Low-temperature anomalies in 1D hard rods with soft attractive nearest-neighbor interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Previous experiments and numerical simulations have revealed that a limited number of two- and three-dimensional particle systems contract in volume upon heating isobarically. This anomalous phenomenon is known as negative thermal expansion (NTE). Recently, in a study by [I. Trav\v{e}nec and L. \v{S}amaj: J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. {\bf 58}, 195005 (2025)], exactly solvable one-dimensional fluids of hard rods with various types of soft purely repulsive nearest-neighbor interactions were examined at low temperatures. The presence of the NTE anomaly in such systems heavily depends on the shape of the core-softened potential and, in some cases, is associated with jumps in chain spacing of the equidistant ground state at certain pressures. This paper focuses on one-dimensional fluids of hard rods with soft nearest-neighbor interactions that contain a basin of attraction with just one minimum. The ground-state analysis reveals that, for certain potentials, increasing the pressure can lead to a discontinuous jump in the mean spacing between particles. The low-temperature analysis of the exact equation of state indicates that the NTE anomaly is present if the curvature of the interaction potential increases with the distance between particles or if the potential exhibits a singularity within the basin of attraction. Isotherms of the compressibility factor, which measures the deviation of the thermodynamic behavior of a real gas from that of an ideal gas, demonstrate typical plateau or double-plateau shapes in large intervals of particle density.</description>

Abstract: The QSSEP, short for quantum symmetric simple exclusion process, is a paradigm model for stochastic quantum dynamics. Averaging over the noise, the quantum dynamics reduce to the well-studied SSEP (symmetric simple exclusion process).

      <description>arXiv:2507.01602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fluctuation theorems establish exact relations for nonequilibrium dynamics, profoundly advancing the field of stochastic thermodynamics. In this Letter, we extend quantum fluctuation theorems beyond the traditional thermodynamic framework to quantum information dynamics and many-body systems, where both the system and the environment are multipartite without assuming any thermodynamic constraints. Based on the two-point measurement scheme and the classical probability, we establish the fluctuation theorem for the dynamics of many-body classical mutual information. By extending to quasiprobability, we derive quantum fluctuation theorems for many-body coherence and quantum correlations, presenting them in both integral and detailed forms. Our theoretical results are illustrated and verified using three-qubit examples, and feasible experimental verification protocols are proposed. These findings uncover the statistical structure underlying the nonequilibrium quantum information dynamics, providing fundamental insights and new tools for advancing quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>String Breaking Dynamics and Glueball Formation in a $2+1$D Lattice Gauge Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the advent of advanced quantum processors capable of probing lattice gauge theories (LGTs) in higher spatial dimensions, it is crucial to understand string dynamics in such models to guide upcoming experiments and to make connections to high-energy physics (HEP). Using tensor network methods, we study the far-from-equilibrium quench dynamics of electric flux strings between two static charges in the $2+1$D $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGT with dynamical matter. We calculate the probabilities of finding the time-evolved wave function in string configurations of the same length as the initial string. At resonances determined by the the electric field strength and the mass, we identify various string breaking processes accompanied with matter creation. Away from resonance strings exhibit intriguing confined dynamics which, for strong electric fields, we fully characterize through effective perturbative models. Starting in maximal-length strings, we find that the wave function enters a dynamical regime where it splits into shorter strings and disconnected loops, with the latter bearing qualitative resemblance to glueballs in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Our findings can be probed on state-of-the-art superconducting-qubit and trapped-ion quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Optimal time estimation and the clock uncertainty relation for stochastic processes</title>

Abstract: Time estimation is a fundamental task that underpins precision measurement, global navigation systems, financial markets, and the organisation of everyday life. Many biological processes also depend on time estimation by nanoscale clocks, whose performance can be significantly impacted by random fluctuations. In this work, we formulate the problem of optimal time estimation for Markovian stochastic processes, and present its general solution in the asymptotic (long-time) limit. Specifically, we obtain a tight upper bound on the precision of any time estimate constructed from sustained observations of a classical, Markovian jump process. This bound is controlled by the mean residual time, i.e. the expected wait before the first jump is observed. As a consequence, we obtain a universal bound on the signal-to-noise ratio of arbitrary currents and counting observables in the steady state. This bound is similar in spirit to the kinetic uncertainty relation but provably tighter, and we explicitly construct the counting observables that saturate it. Our results establish ultimate precision limits for an important class of observables in non-equilibrium systems, and demonstrate that the mean residual time, not the dynamical activity, is the measure of freneticity that tightly constrains fluctuations far from equilibrium.</description>

      <title>A universal black-box quantum Monte Carlo approach to quantum phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03924v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive exact, universal, closed-form quantum Monte Carlo estimators for finite-temperature energy susceptibility and fidelity susceptibility, applicable to essentially arbitrary Hamiltonians. Combined with recent advancements in Monte Carlo, our approach enables a black-box framework for studying quantum phase transitions--without requiring prior knowledge of an order parameter or the manual design of model-specific ergodic quantum Monte Carlo update rules. We demonstrate the utility of our method by applying a single implementation to the transverse-field Ising model, the XXZ model, and an ensemble of models related by random unitaries.</description>

      <title>Out-of-time-order correlator computation based on discrete truncated Wigner approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14221v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a method based on the discrete truncated Wigner approximation (DTWA) for computing out-of-time-order correlators. This method is applied to long-range interacting quantum spin systems where the interactions decay as a power law with distance. As a demonstration, we use a squared commutator of local operators and its higher-order extensions that describe quantum information scrambling under Hamilton dynamics. Our results reveal that the DTWA method accurately reproduces the exact dynamics of the average spreading of quantum information (i.e., the squared commutator) across all time regimes in strongly long-range interacting systems. We also identify limitations in the DTWA method when capturing dynamics in weakly long-range interacting systems and the fastest spreading of quantum information. Then we apply the DTWA method to investigate the system-size dependence of the scrambling time in strongly long-range interacting systems. We reveal that the scaling behavior of the scrambling time for large system sizes qualitatively changes depending on the interaction range. This work provides and demonstrates a new technique to study scrambling dynamics in long-range interacting quantum spin systems.</description>

      <title>Single file dynamics of tethered random walkers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18402v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the single-file dynamics of $N$ identical random walkers moving with diffusivity $D$ in one dimension (walkers bounce off each other when attempting to overtake). Additionally, we require that the separation between neighboring walkers cannot exceed a threshold value $\Delta$ and therefore call them ``tethered walkers'' (they behave as if bounded by strings which tighten fully when reaching the maximum length $\Delta$). For finite $\Delta$, we study the diffusional relaxation to the equilibrium state and characterize the latter [the long-time relaxation is exponential with a characteristic time that scales as $(N\Delta)^2/D$]. In particular, our approximate approach for the $N$-particle probability distribution yields the one-particle distribution function of the central and edge particles [the first two positional moments are given as power expansions in $\Delta/\sqrt{4Dt}$]. For $N=2$, we find an exact solution (both in the continuum case and on-lattice) and use it to test our approximations for one-particle distributions, positional moments, and correlations. For finite $\Delta$ and arbitrary $N$, edge particles move with an effective long-time diffusivity $D/N$, in sharp contrast with the $1/\ln(N)$-behavior observed when $\Delta=\infty$. Finally, we compute the probability distribution of the equilibrium system length and the associated entropy. We find that the force required to change this length by a given amount is linear in this quantity, the (entropic) spring constant being $6k_BT/(N\Delta^2)$. In this respect, the system behaves like an ideal polymer. Our main analytical results are confirmed by Monte Carlo simulations.</description>

      <title>Classical Simulation of High Temperature Quantum Ising Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2002.02232v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider generalized quantum Ising models, including those which could describe disordered materials or quantum annealers, and we prove that for all temperatures above a system-size independent threshold the path integral Monte Carlo method based on worldline heat-bath updates always mixes to stationarity in time $\mathcal{O}(n \log n)$ for an $n$ qubit system, and therefore provides a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme for the partition function. This result holds whenever the temperature is greater than four plus twice the maximum interaction degree (valence) over all qubits, measured in units of the local coupling strength. For example, this implies that the classical simulation of the thermal state of a superconducting device modeling a frustrated quantum Ising model with maximum valence of 6 and coupling strengths of 1 GHz is always possible at temperatures above 800 mK. Despite the quantum system being at high temperature, the classical spin system resulting from the quantum-to-classical mapping contains strong couplings which cause the single-site Glauber dynamics to mix slowly, therefore this result depends on the use of worldline updates (which are a form of cluster updates that can be implemented efficiently). This result places definite constraints on the temperatures required for a quantum advantage in analog quantum simulation with various NISQ devices based on equilibrium states of quantum Ising models.</description>

      <title>Improving the five-point bootstrap</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13344v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new algorithm for the numerical evaluation of five-point conformal blocks in $d$-dimensions, greatly improving the efficiency of their computation. To do this we use an appropriate ansatz for the blocks as a series expansion in radial coordinates, derive a set of recursion relations for the unknown coefficients in the ansatz, and evaluate the series using a Pad\'e approximant to accelerate its convergence. We then study the $\langle\sigma\sigma\epsilon\sigma\sigma\rangle$ correlator in the 3d critical Ising model by truncating the operator product expansion (OPE) and only including operators with conformal dimension below a cutoff $\Delta\leqslant \Delta_{\rm cutoff}$. We approximate the contributions of the operators above the cutoff by the corresponding contributions in a suitable disconnected five-point correlator. Using this approach, we compute a number of OPE coefficients with greater accuracy than previous methods.</description>

      <title>Experimental signatures of Hilbert-space ergodicity: Universal bitstring distributions and applications in noise learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11971v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Systems reaching thermal equilibrium are ubiquitous. For classical systems, this phenomenon is typically understood statistically through ergodicity in phase space, but translating this to quantum systems is a long-standing problem of interest. Recently a strong notion of quantum ergodicity has been proposed, namely that isolated, global quantum states uniformly explore their available state space, dubbed Hilbert-space ergodicity. Here we observe signatures of this process with an experimental Rydberg quantum simulator and various numerical models, before generalizing to the case of a local quantum system interacting with its environment. For a closed system, where the environment is a complementary subsystem, we predict and observe a smooth quantum-to-classical transition in that observables progress from large, quantum fluctuations to small, Gaussian fluctuations as the bath size grows. This transition exhibits universal properties on a quantitative level amongst a wide range of systems, including those at finite temperature, those with itinerant particles, and random circuits. For an open system, where the environment is uncontrolled, we predict the statistics of observables under largely arbitrary noise channels including those with correlated errors, allowing us to discriminate between candidate error models both for continuous Hamiltonian time evolution and for digital random circuits. This allows for computationally efficient experimental noise learning, and more broadly is a new avenue for quantitatively classifying the behavior of noisy quantum systems. Ultimately our results clarify the role of ergodicity in quantum dynamics, with fundamental and practical consequences.</description>

      <title>Stability and Loop Models from Decohering Non-Abelian Topological Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12230v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Decohering topological order (TO) is central to the many-body physics of open quantum matter and decoding transitions. We identify relevant statistical mechanical models for decohering non-Abelian TO, which have been crucial for understanding the error threshold of Abelian stabilizer codes. The decohered density matrix can be described by loop models, whose topological loop weight $N$ is given by the quantum dimension of the decohering anyon -- reducing to the Ising model if $N=1$. In particular, the R\'enyi-$n$ moments of the decohered state correspond to $n$ coupled O$(N)$ loop models, and we exactly diagonalize the density matrix at maximal error rate. This allows us to relate the fidelity between two logically distinct ground states to properties of random O$(N)$ loop and spin models. Utilizing the literature on loop models, we find a remarkable stability to quantum channels which proliferate non-Abelian anyons with large quantum dimension, with the possibility of critical phases for smaller dimensions. We confirm our framework with exact results for Kitaev quantum double models, and with numerical simulations for the non-Abelian phase of the Kitaev honeycomb model. The latter is an example of a non-fixed-point wavefunction with non-bosonic and non-integral anyon dimensions. Our work opens up the possibility of non-Abelian TO being robust against maximally proliferating certain anyons, which can inform error-correction studies of these topological memories.</description>

      <title>Decoherence and wavefunction deformation of $D_4$ non-Abelian topological order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12948v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The effect of decoherence on topological order (TO) has been most deeply understood for the toric code, the paragon of Abelian TOs. We show that certain non-Abelian TOs can be analyzed and understood to a similar degree, despite being significantly richer. We consider both wavefunction deformations and quantum channels acting on $D_4$ TO, which has recently been realized on a quantum processor. By identifying the corresponding local statistical mechanical spin or rotor model with $D_4$ symmetry, we find a remarkable stability against proliferating non-Abelian anyons. This is shown by leveraging a reformulation in terms of the tractable O$(2)$ loop model in the pure state case, and $n$ coupled O$(2)$ loop models for R\'enyi-$n$ quantities in the decoherence case -- corresponding to worldlines of the proliferating anyon with quantum dimension $2$. In particular, we find that the purity ($n=2$) remains deep in the $D_4$ TO for any decoherence strength, while the $n \to \infty$ limit becomes critical upon maximally decohering a particular anyon type, similar to our wavefunction deformation result. The information-theoretic threshold ($n\to 1$) appears to be controlled by a disordered version of these stat-mech models, akin to the toric code case although significantly more robust. We furthermore use Monte Carlo simulations to explore the phase diagrams when multiple anyon types proliferate at the same time, leading to a continued stability of the $D_4$ TO in addition to critical phases with emergent $U(1)$ symmetry. Instead of loop models, these are now described by net models corresponding to different anyon types coupled together according to fusion rules.This opens up the exploration of statistical mechanical models for decohered non-Abelian TO, which can inform optimal decoders, and which in an ungauged formulation examples of non-Abelian strong-to-weak symmetry breaking.</description>

      <title>Re-entrant localization induced by short-range hopping in the fractal Rosenzweig-Porter Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16851v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Typically, metallic systems localized under strong disorder exhibit a transition to \imk{delocalization} %finite conduction as kinetic terms increase. In this work, we reveal the opposite effect~--~increasing kinetic terms leads to an unexpected \imk{reduction of mobility, }%suppression of conductivity, enhancing localization of the system, and even lead to re-entrant delocalization transitions. Specifically, we add a nearest-neighbor hopping with amplitude \(\kappa\) to the Rosenzweig-Porter (RP) model with fractal on-site disorder and surprisingly see that, as \(\kappa\) grows, the system initially tends to localization from the fractal phase, but then re-enters the ergodic phase. We build an analytical framework to explain this re-entrant behavior, supported by exact diagonalization results. The interplay between the spatially local $\kappa$ term, insensitive to fractal disorder, and the energy-local RP coupling, sensitive to fine-level spacing structure, drives the observed re-entrant behavior. This mechanism offers a novel pathway to re-entrant localization phenomena in many-body quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium friction and free energy estimates for kinetic coarse-graining -- Driven particles in responsive media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18484v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predicting the molecular friction and energy landscapes under nonequilibrium conditions is key to coarse-graining the dynamics of selective solute transport through complex, fluctuating and responsive media, e.g., polymeric materials such as hydrogels, cellular membranes or ion channels. The analysis of equilibrium ensembles already allows such a coarse-graining for very mild nonequilibrium conditions. Yet in the presence of stronger external driving and/or inhomogeneous setups, the transport process is governed apart from a potential of mean force also by a nontrivial position- and velocity-dependent friction. It is therefore important to find suitable and efficient methods to estimate the mean force and the friction landscape, which then can be used in a low-dimensional, coarse-grained Langevin framework to predict the system's transport properties and timescales. In this work, we evaluate different coarse-graining approaches based on constant-velocity constraint simulations for generating such estimates using two model systems, which are a 1D responsive barrier as a minimalistic model and a single tracer driven through a 3D bead-spring polymer membrane as a more sophisticated problem. Finally, we demonstrate that the estimates from 3D constant-velocity simulations yield the correct velocity-dependent friction, which can be directly utilized for coarse-grained (1D) Langevin simulations with constant external driving forces.</description>
