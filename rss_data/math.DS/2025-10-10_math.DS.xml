      <title>Hitting times of shrinking targets: Transversality and an ergodic theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate ergodic and fractal properties of the sets $$\Lambda_y:=\Big\{n\in\mathbb{N}:\ \{u_ny\}\in I_n\Big\},$$ where $\{\cdot\}$ denotes the fractional part function, $(u_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ is an increasing sequence of real numbers, $y\in [0,1]$ and each $I_n$ is a finite union of intervals with decreasing Lebesgue measure. Our main result shows that, under suitable conditions, the set $\Lambda_y$ is good for pointwise convergence of ergodic averages for Lebesgue almost every $y\in [0,1]$. Furthermore, we prove a transversality phenomenon: for any fixed set $A\subseteq \mathbb{N}$, the sets $\Lambda_y$ and $A$ are geometrically independent for almost every $y\in[0,1]$, as witnessed by the integer-fractal dimension of their intersection</description>

      <title>Structural stability for the bidirectional cyclic negative feedback systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present paper investigates the structural stability of bidirectional cyclic negative feedback systems. To address this, we develop a generalized Floquet theory and construct nested invariant cones for the systems. Subsequently, we demonstrate that the Poincar\'{e}-Bendixson property for the limit set persists under $C^1$-perturbations. By applying the generalized Floquet theory and the nested invariant cones, we establish that the stable and unstable manifolds of any two connecting hyperbolic critical elements intersect transversally, with the exception of two hyperbolic equilibria possessing the same odd Morse index. Next, we prove the generic hyperbolicity of critical elements using the Sard-Smale theorem. Furthermore, by formulating the transversality condition as a functional constraint, we generically preclude connecting orbits between hyperbolic equilibrium points with the same odd Morse index, thereby establishing the generic Kupka-Smale property. Finally, under dissipative assumptions, we show that the system generically exhibits the Morse-Smale property. Our findings characterize the stability of bidirectional cyclic negative feedback systems in two distinct manners: $C^1$- small perturbations of the system do not alter the asymptotic behavior of orbits; from a topological perspective, generic vector fields in bidirectional cyclic negative feedback systems are structurally stable.</description>

      <title>Limits of equilibrium states for coupled weakly interacting systems. Application to the measure of maximal entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study metastability for symbolic dynamic. We prove that for a global system given by two independent sub-systems linked by a hole, and for a Lipschitz continuous potential, the global equilibrium state converges, as the hole shrinks, to a convex combination of the two independent equilibria in each component. Two kinds of convergence occur, depending on the assumptions on how long an orbit has to stay in each well.  As a by-product, we show that this can be applied to a geometrical system inspired from [11] and for the measure of maximal entropy.</description>

      <title>Mean dimension and rate-distortion function revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Around the mean dimensions and rate-distortion functions, using some tools from local entropy theory this paper establishes the following main results:
  $(1)$ We prove that for non-ergodic measures associated with almost sure processes, the mean R\'enyi information dimension coincides with the information dimension rate. This answers a question posed by Gutman and \'Spiewak (in Around the variational principle for metric mean dimension, \emph{Studia Math.} \textbf{261}(2021) 345-360).
  $(2)$ We introduce four types of rate-distortion entropies and establish their relation with Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy.
  $(3)$ We show that for systems with the marker property, if the mean dimension is finite, then the supremum in Lindenstrauss-Tsukamoto's double variational principle can be taken over the set of ergodic measures. Additionally, the double variational principle holds for various other measure-theoretic $\epsilon$-entropies.</description>

      <title>Stability with respect to periodic switching laws does not imply global stability under arbitrary switching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: R. Shorten, F. Wirth, O. Mason, K. Wulff and C. King have asked whether a linear switched system is guaranteed to be globally uniformly stable under arbitrary switching if it is known that every trajectory induced by a periodic switching law converges exponentially to the origin. Positive answers to this question have previously been announced for linear switched systems of order two and three. We answer this question negatively in all higher orders by constructing a fourth-order linear switched system with four switching states which is not uniformly exponentially stable but which has the property that every trajectory defined by a periodic switching law converges exponentially to the origin. We argue informally that positive linear systems with this combination of properties are likely to exist in sufficiently high dimensions.</description>

      <title>Generic balanced synchrony patterns in network dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coupled cell networks are specific ordinary differential equations with symmetry constraints, which are described by a given directed graph, with cells and arrows divided into several types. The generated dynamics can model, for example, those of neural networks. This type of systems and their emerging symmetries has been the subject of intense study, particularly by Golubitsky, Stewart and their co-authors.
  In the present article, we show that, for a generic vector field $f$, the synchrony patterns of the solutions of $\dot x(t)=f(x(t))$ are always balanced. This roughly means that the symmetries observed in a solution, such as synchronisation in two different cells, must come from the symmetries imposed by the geometry of network.
  By doing so, we are completing the proof of several conjectures stated in previous works, including the rigid synchrony conjecture, the full oscillation conjecture and the observation of constant states</description>

      <title>On roundness of rotation sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the question whether a round disk can be realized as the rotation set of a torus diffeomorphism, we study the roundness of rotation sets of a parametric family of torus diffeomorphisms $F_\rho$, where the parameter $\rho$ ranges over irrational numbers in $(0,1)$. Each $F_\rho$ is a Kwapisz-like diffeomorphism with a 2-dimensional non-polygonal rotation set
  $$\Lambda'_\rho = \operatorname{conv}\left(\left\{(\pm\frac{\lceil m\rho \rceil}{m+n+1}, \pm\frac{\lceil n\rho \rceil}{m+n+1}): m, n \in \mathbb{N} _0, \lceil m\rho\rceil - m\rho&lt;\rho,\lceil n\rho\rceil - n\rho&lt;\rho\right\}\right)$$ whose extreme point set contains exactly four (two-sided) accumulation points. We define the roundness of $\Lambda'_\rho$ as the ratio $R_\rho=\frac{\operatorname{Area}(\Lambda'_\rho)}{\pi\rho^2}$, and give its upper and lower bounds in terms of $\rho$.
  $R_\rho$ is neither monotone nor continuous.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present some foundational results about the outer length billiard system, including its generating function and the invariant area form. We describe the limiting behavior of the orbits far away from the billiard table: the orbits of the map lie on the origin-centered circles, and the second iteration of the map is approximated by the flow of a Hamiltonian function whose level curves are these circles. Furthermore, the orbits "at infinity" of the centers of the auxiliary circles involved in the definition of the map lie on the curves that are polar dual to the symmetrization of the billiard table, the curves which are traced by the second iteration of the usual outer billiard map "at infinity".</description>

      <title>Understanding the invader-driven replicator dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a special case of the invasion fitness matrix in a replicator equation: the invader-driven case. In this replicator, each species is defined by its unique active invasiveness potential (initial growth rate when rare), upon invading any other species, independently of the partner. We derive explicit expressions and theorems to fully characterize the steady-states of this system, including its unique interior coexistence regime, reached for positive species traits, or alternative boundary exclusion states, reached for negative species traits. We study the internal stability of coexistence steady-states, and the system's stability to outsider invasion, relevant for system assembly. We provide detailed analytical results for critical diversity thresholds, and for the special case of random uniform species traits, we analytically compute the probability of stable $k-$species coexistence in a random pool of size $N$, and show that the mean number of co-existing species can be approximated as $\mathbb{E}[n] \sim \sqrt{2N}$. We also derive explicit mathematical conditions for invader traits and invasion outcomes (augmentation, rejection, and replacement), dependent on the history of system assembly. Finally, by outlining links of this replicator case with corresponding (rank-1) Lotka-Volterra ecological systems and specific epidemiological multi-strain SIS models with coinfection, we highlight the relevance of applying these mathematical principles to improve the theoretical and empirical understanding of multi-species coexistence.</description>

      <title>VeMo: A Lightweight Data-Driven Approach to Model Vehicle Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Developing a dynamic model for a high-performance vehicle is a complex problem that requires extensive structural information about the system under analysis. This information is often unavailable to those who did not design the vehicle and represents a typical issue in autonomous driving applications, which are frequently developed on top of existing vehicles; therefore, vehicle models are developed under conditions of information scarcity. This paper proposes a lightweight encoder-decoder model based on Gate Recurrent Unit layers to correlate the vehicle's future state with its past states, measured onboard, and control actions the driver performs. The results demonstrate that the model achieves a maximum mean relative error below 2.6% in extreme dynamic conditions. It also shows good robustness when subject to noisy input data across the interested frequency components. Furthermore, being entirely data-driven and free from physical constraints, the model exhibits physical consistency in the output signals, such as longitudinal and lateral accelerations, yaw rate, and the vehicle's longitudinal velocity.</description>

Abstract: These are notes to accompany my lectures at the $2024$ "Current Developments in Mathematics" conference hosted by Harvard/MIT. The lectures were about some recent progress in our understanding of two and three dimensional dynamical systems, using in part some tools from low-dimensional topology. In these notes, I try to give a sense for how this works by discussing a few examples from problems I have worked on and surveying some related developments. Some symplectic variants of Weyl's law play a key role. I also briefly comment on some other developments and on the relationship with what is known in higher dimensions. The lectures themselves are available online.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove central limit theorems, Berry-Esseen type theorems, almost sure invariance principles, large deviations and Livsic type regularity for partial sums of the form $S_n=\sum_{j=0}^{n-1}f_j(...,X_{j-1},X_j,X_{j+1},...)$, where $(X_j)$ is an inhomogeneous Markov chain satisfying some mixing assumptions and $f_j$ is a sequence of sufficiently regular functions. Even though the case of non-stationary chains and time dependent functions $f_j$ is more challenging, our results seem to be new already for stationary Markov chains. They also seem to be new for non-stationary Bernoulli shifts (that is when $(X_j)$ are independent but not identically distributed). This paper is the first one in a series of two papers. In \cite{Work} we will prove local limit theorems including developing the related reduction theory in the sense of \cite{DolgHaf LLT, DS}.</description>

      <title>Weak Form Learning for Mean-Field Partial Differential Equations: an Application to Insect Movement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Insect species subject to infection, predation, and anisotropic environmental conditions may exhibit preferential movement patterns. Given the innate stochasticity of exogenous factors driving these patterns over short timescales, individual insect trajectories typically obey overdamped stochastic dynamics. In practice, data-driven modeling approaches designed to learn the underlying Fokker-Planck equations from observed insect distributions serve as ideal tools for understanding and predicting such behavior. Understanding dispersal dynamics of crop and silvicultural pests can lead to a better forecasting of outbreak intensity and location, which can result in better pest management. In this work, we extend weak-form equation learning techniques, coupled with kernel density estimation, to learn effective models for lepidopteran larval population movement from highly sparse experimental data. Galerkin methods such as the Weak form Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (WSINDy) algorithm have recently proven useful for learning governing equations in several scientific contexts. We demonstrate the utility of the method on a sparse dataset of position measurements of fall armyworms (Spodoptera frugiperda) obtained in simulated agricultural conditions with varied plant resources and infection status.</description>

      <title>LDMD with Temporally Adaptive Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) is a widely used data-driven algorithm for predicting the future states of dynamical systems. However, its standard formulation often struggles with poor long-term predictive accuracy. To address this limitation, we propose a localized DMD (LDMD) framework that improves prediction performance by integrating DMD's strong linear forecasting capabilities with time-domain segmentation techniques. In this framework, the temporal domain is segmented into multiple subintervals, within which snapshot matrices are constructed and localized predictions are performed. We first present the localized DMD method with predefined segmentation, and then explore an adaptive segmentation strategy to further enhance computational efficiency and prediction robustness. Furthermore, we conduct an error analysis that provides the upper bound of the local and global truncation error for the proposed framework. The effectiveness of LDMD is demonstrated on four benchmark problems-Burgers', Allen-Cahn, nonlinear Schrodinger, and Maxwell's equations. Numerical results show that LDMD significantly enhances long-term predictive accuracy while preserving high computational efficiency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that if any four distinct solutions of a rational difference equation are algebraically independent, then any number of distinct solutions to the equation are independent. A nontrivial variant of this result is given for autonomous difference equations or algebraic dynamical systems, where we show the degree of nonminimality is at most one. The results have a natural interpretation in terms of invariant or periodic subvarieties of algebraic dynamical systems and $\sigma$-varieties. Surprisingly, the proofs of these results rely on the classification of finite simple groups.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium States for Random Zooming Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09437v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, based on Pinheiro for deterministic systems, we extend the notion of zooming systems to the random context and based on the technique of Arbieto-Matheus-Oliveira we prove the existence of equilibrium states for which we call random zooming potentials, that include the hyperbolic ones, possibly with the presence of a critical set. With a mild condition, we obtain uniqueness. As an example of existence, we have the so-called random Viana maps with critical points. We also prove that the classes of random zooming potentials and random hyperbolic potentials are equivalent and also contain the null potential, giving measures of maximal entropy.</description>

      <title>Carleman-Fourier linearization of nonlinear real dynamical systems with quasi-periodic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01498v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents Carleman-Fourier linearization for analyzing nonlinear real dynamical systems with periodic vector fields. Using Fourier basis functions, this novel framework transforms such dynamical systems into equivalent infinite-dimensional linear dynamical systems. In this paper, we establish the exponential convergence of the primary block in the finite-section approximation of this linearized system to the state vector of the original nonlinear system. To showcase the efficacy of our approach, we apply it to the Kuramoto model, a prominent model for coupled oscillators. The results demonstrate promising accuracy in approximating the original system's behavior.</description>

      <title>Ledrappier-Young entropy formula for $C^1$ diffeomorphisms with dominated splitting Part 1: Unstable entropy formula and invariance principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16981v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the unstable entropy of $C^1$ diffeomorphisms with dominated splittings. Our main result shows that when the zero Lyapunov exponent has multiplicity one, the center direction contributes no entropy, and the unstable entropy coincides with the metric entropy. This extends the celebrated work of Ledrappier-Young [18] for $C^2$ diffeomorphisms to the $C^1$ setting under these assumptions. In particular, our results apply to $C^1$ diffeomorphisms away from homoclinic tangencies due to [20].
  As consequences, we obtain several applications at $C^1$ regularity. The Avila-Viana invariance principle [7, 33] holds when the center is one-dimensional. Results on measures of maximal entropy due to Hertz-Hertz-Tahzibi-Ures [25], Tahzibi-Yang [33], and Ures-Viana-Yang-Yang [34, 35] also remain valid for $C^1$ diffeomorphisms.</description>

      <title>Rectangular Shrinking Targets on Self-Similar Carpets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04875v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since the introduction of the shrinking target problem by Hill and Velani in 1995 there has been a surge of interest in the area. In this paper we consider the case where the target is a rectangle, rather than a ball, and the underlying space is a self-similar carpet. We calculate the exact Hausdorff dimension of the resulting shrinking target set. Interestingly the Hausdorff dimension depends on the centre of the target, a condition uncommon in most other shrinking target type problems. This extends a theorem of Wang and Wu [Theorem 12.1, Math. Ann. 2021].</description>

      <title>Stoichiometric recipes for periodic oscillations in reaction networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15273v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Oscillatory chemical reactions are functional components in a variety of biological contexts. In chemistry, the construction and identification of even rudimentary oscillators remain elusive and lack a general framework. Using parameter-rich kinetics - a methodology enabling the disentanglement of parametric dependencies from structural analysis - we investigate the stoichiometry of chemical oscillators. We introduce the concept of oscillatory cores: minimal subnetworks that guarantee the potential for oscillations in any reaction network containing them. These cores fall into two classes, depending on whether they involve positive or negative feedback. In particular, the latter class unveils a family of oscillators - yet to be synthesized - that require a minimum number of reaction steps to exhibit oscillations, a phenomenon we refer to as the principle of length. We identify several mechanisms through which catalysis promotes oscillations: (I) furnishing instability (e.g. autocatalysis), (II) lifting dependencies, (III) lowering length thresholds. Notwithstanding this mechanistic ubiquity, we show that oscillators can also be realized without employing any catalysis. Our results highlight branches of chemistry where oscillators are likely to arise by chance, suggest new strategies for their design, and point to novel classes of oscillators yet to be realized experimentally.</description>

      <title>Twisted crossed products of Banach algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24106v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a locally compact group $G$, a nondegenerate Banach algebra $A$ with a contractive approximate identity, a twisted action $(\alpha, \sigma)$ of $G$ on $A$, and a family $\mathcal{R}$ of uniformly bounded representations of $A$ on Banach spaces, we define the twisted crossed product $F_\mathcal{R}(G,A,\alpha, \sigma)$. When $\mathcal{R}$ consists of contractive representations, we show that $F_\mathcal{R}(G,A,\alpha, \sigma)$ is a Banach algebra with a contractive approximate identity, which can also be characterized by an isometric universal property.
  As an application, we specialize to the $L^p$-operator algebra setting, defining both the $L^p$-twisted crossed product and the reduced version. Finally, we give a generalization of the so-called Packer-Raeburn trick to the $L^p$-setting, showing that any $L^p$-twisted crossed product is "stably" isometrically isomorphic to an untwisted one.</description>

      <title>Non-algebraicity of non-abundant foliations and abundance for adjoint foliated structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04419v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Assuming the abundance conjecture in dimension $d$, we establish a non-algebraicity criterion of foliations: any log canonical foliation of rank $\le d$ with $\nu\neq\kappa$ is not algebraically integrable, answering question of Ambro--Cascini--Shokurov--Spicer. Under the same hypothesis, we prove abundance for klt algebraically integrable adjoint foliated structures of dimension $\le d$ and show the existence of good minimal models or Mori fiber spaces. In particular, when $d=3$, all these results hold unconditionally.
  Using similar arguments, we solve a problem proposed by Lu and Wu on abundance of surface adjoint foliated structures that are not necessarily algebraically integrable.</description>
