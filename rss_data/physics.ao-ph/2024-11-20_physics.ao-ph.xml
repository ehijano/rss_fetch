      <title>The synchronization of convective lifecycles in an idealized microscopic model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How a cloud ensemble responds to external forcing is a puzzle in tropical convection research. Convectively coupled gravity waves (CCGWs) in a finite domain have controllable wavelengths, providing a convenient simulation setup for studying the cloud ensemble. A multiscale analysis shows that the growth of CCGWs in a finite-domain involves not only the amplitude growth of individual clouds but also the synchronization of convective lifecycles. To understand the synchronization mechanism, we build a microscopic model with many clouds. For each cloud, the microscopic model simulates the evolution of equivalent potential temperature $\theta_e$ in the boundary layer, which is reduced by convective transport and radiative cooling and increased by surface heating. At the shallow convection stage, the $\theta_e$ grows until reaching an upper threshold where the convective inhibition energy is eliminated, and the system transitions to the deep convection stage. At the deep convection stage, the $\theta_e$ drops until reaching a lower threshold where the convective available potential energy is exhausted, and the system transitions to the shallow convection stage. The wave influences $\theta_e$ with the boundary layer convergent flow and adjusts the phase of the convective lifecycle. Numerical simulations of the microscopic model show that when the period of convection and wave equals, the wave gradually synchronizes convection. Theoretical analysis shows that the microscopic synchronization appears as the macroscopic resonant growth of the cloud ensemble. In the resonant state, the averaged $\theta_e$ and vertical velocity in the boundary layer are in phase, agreeing with the cloud-permitting simulation.</description>

      <title>Leadsee-Precip: A Deep Learning Diagnostic Model for Precipitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, deep-learning weather forecasting models have surpassed traditional numerical models in terms of the accuracy of meteorological variables. However, there is considerable potential for improvements in precipitation forecasts, especially for heavy precipitation events. To address this deficiency, we propose Leadsee-Precip, a global deep learning model to generate precipitation from meteorological circulation fields. The model utilizes an information balance scheme to tackle the challenges of predicting heavy precipitation caused by the long-tail distribution of precipitation data. Additionally, more accurate satellite and radar-based precipitation retrievals are used as training targets. Compared to artificial intelligence global weather models, the heavy precipitation from Leadsee-Precip is more consistent with observations and shows competitive performance against global numerical weather prediction models. Leadsee-Precip can be integrated with any global circulation model to generate precipitation forecasts. But the deviations between the predicted and the ground-truth circulation fields may lead to a weakened precipitation forecast, which could potentially be mitigated by further fine-tuning based on the predicted circulation fields.</description>

      <title>Absorption cross-sections for the 5th and 6th vibrational overtones in a series of short chained alcohols using incoherent broadband cavity enhanced-absorption spectroscopy (IBBCEAS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Absorption cross-sections for the 5th (6 $\leftarrow$ 0) and 6th (7 $\leftarrow$ 0) OH overtones for gas-phase methanol, ethanol, and isopropanol were measured using a slow flow cell and Incoherent Broadband Cavity-Enhanced Absorption Spectroscopy (IBBCEAS). Measurements were performed in two wavelength regions, 447-457 nm, and 508-518 nm, using two different instruments. The experimental results are consistent with previous computational predictions of the excitation energies for these transitions. Treating the OH stretch as a local mode allowed for calculation of the fundamental vibrational frequency ($\omega_e$), anharmonicity constant ($\omega_e x_e$), and the vertical dissociation energy (VDE) for each alcohol studied. The fundamental vibrational frequency is $3848 \pm 18 \, \text{cm}^{-1}$, $3807 \pm 55 \,\text{cm}^{-1}$, and $3813 \pm 63 \, \text{cm}^{-1}$ for methanol, ethanol, and isopropanol, respectively. The anharmonicity constant was measured to be $84.8 \pm 2.1 \, \text{cm}^{-1}$, $80.2 \pm 5.9 \, \text{cm}^{-1}$, and $84.4 \pm 6.8 \, \text{cm}^{-1}$ for methanol, ethanol, and isopropanol, respectively. The OH vertical dissociation energy was measured to be $499.4 \pm 18.4$ kJ/mol, $518.0 \pm 56.7$ kJ/mol, and $492.7 \pm 59.9$ kJ/mol. The spectroscopically measured values are compared to thermodynamically measured OH bond dissociation energies. The observed differences in previous measurements of the bond dissociation energies compared to the values reported herein can be explained due to the difference between vertical dissociation energies and bond dissociation energies. If the OH overtone stretching mode is excited in methanol to either the 5th or 6th overtone, the bimolecular reaction between methanol and O$_2$ becomes thermodynamically feasible and could contribute to formation of methoxy and HO$_2$ radicals under the proper combination of pressure and temperature.</description>

      <title>NDUI+: A fused DMSP-VIIRS based global normalized difference urban index dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.02794v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Urbanization is advancing rapidly, covering less than 2% of Earth's surface yet profoundly influencing global environments and experiencing disproportionate impacts from extreme weather events. Effective urban management and planning require high-resolution, temporally consistent datasets that capture the complexity of urban growth and dynamics. This study presents NDUI+, a novel global urban dataset addressing critical gaps in urban data continuity and quality. NDUI+ integrates data from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program's Operational Linescan System (DMSP-OLS), VIIRS Nighttime Light, and Landsat 7 NDVI using advanced remote sensing and deep learning techniques. The dataset resolves sensor discontinuity challenges, offering a seamless 30-meter spatial and annual temporal resolution time series from 1999 to the present. NDUI+ demonstrates high precision and granularity, aligning closely with high-resolution satellite data and capturing urban dynamics effectively. The dataset provides valuable insights for urban climate studies, IPCC assessments, and urbanization research, complementing resources like UT-GLOBUS for urban modeling.</description>

      <title>Rapid near-inertial wave generation at topography in response to surface wind forcing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02275v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Internal waves propagate on the ocean stratification, carrying energy and redistributing momentum through the ocean interior. The two most significant sources of these waves in the ocean are surface winds and oscillatory tidal flow across topography. We propose a hybrid of these two mechanisms, in which wind-induced flows at the sea surface are rapidly communicated to the seafloor via the de-phasing of horizontally propagating vertical internal wave modes. In the presence of topography, the resulting oscillatory bottom velocity may then generate internal waves in a similar manner to the barotropic tide. We investigate this mechanism in an idealised numerical model of a storm passing over a mid ocean ridge, and perform several perturbation experiments in which ocean and wind properties are varied. Bottom-generated near-inertial internal waves are identified propagating away from the ridge in the wake of the storm. Perturbation experiments were performed when altering the shape of the topography and properties of the storm, with energy flux ranging from 0.01 to 0.2 mW m$^{-2}$ or up to 10% the magnitude of the energy flux from surface generated near-inertial waves in our domain. Our results suggest a need for further investigation in less idealised scenarios to more precisely quantify this novel mechanism of deep ocean wave generation, and how it may affect abyssal mixing. We argue that this mechanism could explain some of the unaccounted for bottom near-inertial wave signals found in ocean observations and numerical studies.</description>
