      <title>A Stopping Game on Zero-Sum Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and analyze a natural game formulated as follows. In this one-person game, the player is given a random permutation $A=(a_1,\dots, a_n)$ of a multiset $M$ of $n$ reals that sum up to $0$, where each of the $n!$ permutation sequences is equally likely. The player only knows the value of $n$ beforehand. The elements of the sequence are revealed one by one and the player can stop the game at any time. Once the process stops, say, after the $i$th element is revealed, the player collects the amount $\sum_{j=i+1}^{n} a_j$ as his/her payoff and the game is over (the payoff corresponds to the unrevealed part of the sequence).
  Three online algorithms are given for maximizing the expected payoff in the binary case when $M$ contains only $1$'s and $-1$'s. $\texttt{Algorithm 1}$ is slightly suboptimal, but is easier to analyze. Moreover, it can also be used when $n$ is only known with some approximation. $\texttt{Algorithm 2}$ is exactly optimal but not so easy to analyze on its own. $\texttt{Algorithm 3}$ is the simplest of all three. It turns out that the expected payoffs of the player are $\Theta(\sqrt{n})$ for all three algorithms.
  In the end, we address the general problem and deal with an arbitrary zero-sum multiset, for which we show that our $\texttt{Algorithm 3}$ returns a payoff proportional to $\sqrt{n}$, which is worst case-optimal.</description>

      <title>On corona of Konig-Egervary graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\alpha(G)$ denote the cardinality of a maximum independent set and $\mu(G)$ be the size of a maximum matching of a graph $G=\left( V,E\right) $. If $\alpha(G)+\mu(G)=\left\vert V\right\vert $, then $G$ is a K\"{o}nig-Egerv\'{a}ry graph, and $G$ is a $1$-K\"{o}nig-Egerv\'{a}ry graph whenever $\alpha(G)+\mu(G)=\left\vert V\right\vert -1$. The corona $H\circ\mathcal{X}$ of a graph $H$ and a family of graphs $\mathcal{X}=\left\{ X_{i}:1\leq i\leq\left\vert V(H)\right\vert \right\} $ is obtained by joining each vertex $v_{i}$ of $H$ to all the vertices of the corresponding graph $X_{i},i=1,2,...,\left\vert V(H)\right\vert $.
  In this paper we completely characterize graphs whose coronas are $k$-K\"{o}nig-Egerv\'{a}ry graphs, where $k\in\left\{ 0,1\right\} $.</description>

      <title>(Independent) Roman Domination Parameterized by Distance to Cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a graph $G=(V,E)$, a function $f:V\to \{0,1,2\}$ is said to be a \emph{Roman Dominating function} (RDF) if for every $v\in V$ with $f(v)=0$, there exists a vertex $u\in N(v)$ such that $f(u)=2$. A Roman Dominating function $f$ is said to be an \emph{Independent Roman Dominating function} (IRDF), if $V_1\cup V_2$ forms an independent set, where $V_i=\{v\in V~\vert~f(v)=i\}$, for $i\in \{0,1,2\}$. The total weight of $f$ is equal to $\sum_{v\in V} f(v)$, and is denoted as $w(f)$. The \emph{Roman Domination Number} (resp. \emph{Independent Roman Domination Number}) of $G$, denoted by $\gamma_R(G)$ (resp. $i_R(G)$), is defined as min$\{w(f)~\vert~f$ is an RDF (resp. IRDF) of $G\}$. For a given graph $G$, the problem of computing $\gamma_R(G)$ (resp. $i_R(G)$) is defined as the \emph{Roman Domination problem} (resp. \emph{Independent Roman Domination problem}).
  In this paper, we examine structural parameterizations of the (Independent) Roman Domination problem. We propose fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) algorithms for the (Independent) Roman Domination problem in graphs that are $k$ vertices away from a cluster graph. These graphs have a set of $k$ vertices whose removal results in a cluster graph. We refer to $k$ as the distance to the cluster graph. Specifically, we prove the following results when parameterized by the deletion distance $k$ to cluster graphs: we can find the Roman Domination Number (and Independent Roman Domination Number) in time $4^kn^{O(1)}$. In terms of lower bounds, we show that the Roman Domination number can not be computed in time $2^{\epsilon k}n^{O(1)}$, for any $0&lt;\epsilon &lt;1$ unless a well-known conjecture, SETH fails. In addition, we also show that the Roman Domination problem parameterized by distance to cluster, does not admit a polynomial kernel unless NP $\subseteq$ coNP$/$poly.</description>

      <title>Multipacking and broadcast domination on cactus graph and its impact on hyperbolic graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.04882v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a graph $G$, $ mp(G) $ is the multipacking number, and $\gamma_b(G)$ is the broadcast domination number. It is known that $mp(G)\leq \gamma_b(G)$ and $\gamma_b(G)\leq 2mp(G)+3$ for any graph $G$, and it was shown that $\gamma_b(G)-mp(G)$ can be arbitrarily large for connected graphs. It is conjectured that $\gamma_b(G)\leq 2mp(G)$ for any general graph $G$.
  We show that, for any cactus graph $G$, $\gamma_b(G)\leq \frac{3}{2}mp(G)+\frac{11}{2}$. We also show that $\gamma_b(G)-mp(G)$ can be arbitrarily large for cactus graphs and asteroidal triple-free graphs by constructing an infinite family of cactus graphs which are also asteroidal triple-free graphs such that the ratio $\gamma_b(G)/mp(G)=4/3$, with $mp(G)$ arbitrarily large. This result shows that, for cactus graphs, the bound $\gamma_b(G)\leq \frac{3}{2}mp(G)+\frac{11}{2}$ cannot be improved to a bound in the form $\gamma_b(G)\leq c_1\cdot mp(G)+c_2$, for any constant $c_1&lt;4/3$ and $c_2$. Moreover, we provide an $O(n)$-time algorithm to construct a multipacking of cactus graph $G$ of size at least $ \frac{2}{3}mp(G)-\frac{11}{3} $, where $n$ is the number of vertices of the graph $G$. The hyperbolicity of the cactus graph class is unbounded. For $0$-hyperbolic graphs, $mp(G)=\gamma_b(G)$. Moreover, $mp(G)=\gamma_b(G)$ holds for the strongly chordal graphs which is a subclass of $\frac{1}{2}$-hyperbolic graphs. Now it's a natural question: what is the minimum value of $\delta$, for which we can say that the difference $ \gamma_{b}(G) - mp(G) $ can be arbitrarily large for $\delta$-hyperbolic graphs? We show that the minimum value of $\delta$ is $\frac{1}{2}$ using a construction of an infinite family of cactus graphs with hyperbolicity $\frac{1}{2}$.</description>
