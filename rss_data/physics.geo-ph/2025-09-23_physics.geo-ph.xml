      <title>A Deep-Learning-Driven Optimization-Based Inverse Solver for Accelerating the Marchenko Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Marchenko method is a powerful tool for reconstructing full-wavefield Green's functions using surface-recorded seismic data. These Green's functions can then be utilized to produce subsurface images that are not affected by artifacts caused by internal multiples. Despite its advantages, the method is computationally demanding, primarily due to the iterative nature of estimating the focusing functions, which links the Green's functions to the surface reflection response. To address this limitation, an optimization-based solver is proposed to estimate focusing functions in an efficient way. This is achieved by training a network to approximate the forward modeling problem on a small subset of pre-computed focusing function pairs, mapping final up-going focusing functions obtained via the conventional iterative scheme to their initial estimates. Once trained, the network is fixed and used as the forward operator within the Marchenko framework. For a given target location, an input is initialized and iteratively updated through backpropagation to minimize the mismatch between the output of the fixed network and the known initial up-going focusing function. The resulting estimate is then used to compute the corresponding down-going focusing function and the full Green's functions based on the Marchenko equations. This strategy significantly reduces the computational cost compared to the traditional Marchenko method based on conventional iterative scheme. Tests on a synthetic model, using only 0.8% of the total imaging points for training, show that the proposed approach accelerates the imaging process while maintaining relatively good imaging results, which is better than reverse time migration. Application to the Volve field data further demonstrates the method's robustness and practicality, highlighting its potential for efficient, large scale seismic imaging.</description>

      <title>A Mutil-conditional Diffusion Transformer for Versatile Seismic Wave Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Seismic wave generation creates labeled waveform datasets for source parameter inversion, subsurface analysis, and, notably, training artificial intelligence seismology models. Traditionally, seismic wave generation has been time-consuming, and artificial intelligence methods using Generative Adversarial Networks often struggle with authenticity and stability. This study presents the Seismic Wave Generator, a multi-conditional diffusion model with transformers. Diffusion models generate high-quality, diverse, and stable outputs with robust denoising capabilities. They offer superior theoretical foundations and greater control over the generation process compared to other models. Transformers excel in seismic wave processing by capturing long-range dependencies and spatial-temporal patterns, improving feature extraction and prediction accuracy compared to traditional models. To evaluate the realism of the generated waveforms, we trained downstream models on generated data and compared their performance with models trained on real seismic waveforms. The seismic phase-picking model trained on generative data achieved 99% recall and precision on real seismic waveforms. Furthermore, the magnitude estimation model reduced prediction bias from uneven training data. These findings suggest that diffusion-based generation models can address the challenge of limited regional labeled data and hold promise for bridging gaps in observational data in the future.</description>

      <title>Advancing resistivity-chargeability modeling for complex subsurface characterization using machine learning and deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Subsurface lithological heterogeneity presents challenges for traditional geophysical methods, particularly in resolving nonlinear electrical resistivity and induced polarization (IP) relationships. This study introduces a data-driven machine learning and deep learning (ML/DL) framework for predicting 2D IP chargeability models from resistivity, depth, and station distance, reducing reliance on field IP surveys. The framework integrates ensemble regressors with a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D CNN) enhanced by global average pooling. Among the tested models, CatBoost achieved the highest prediction accuracy (R^2 = 0.942 training, 0.945 testing), closely followed by random forest, while the stacked ML/DL ensemble further improved performance, particularly for complex resistivity-IP behaviors. Overall accuracy ranged from R^2 = 0.882 to 0.947 with RMSE &lt; 0.04. Integration with k-means clustering enhanced lithological discrimination, effectively delineating sandy silt, silty sand, and weathered granite influenced by saturation, clay content, and fracturing. This scalable approach provides a rapid solution for subsurface modeling in exploration, geotechnical, and environmental applications.</description>

      <title>Measuring the locations and properties of VHF sources emitted from an aircraft flying through high clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that it is possible to locate the few places on the body of an airplane, while it is flying through high clouds, from which broad-band, pulsed, radiation is emitted at Very High Frequency (VHF) radio frequencies. This serendipitous discovery was made whilst imaging a lightning flash using the Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR). This observation provides insights into the way the airplane sheds the electrical charge it acquires when flying through clouds. Furthermore, this observation allowed us to test and improve the precision and accuracy for our lightning observation techniques.
  Our new results indicate that with the improved procedure the location precision for strong pulses is better than 50~cm, with the orientation of linear polarization being accurate to within 25$^\circ$. For the present case of a Boeing 777-300ER, VHF emissions were observed exclusively associated with the two engines, as well as a specific spot on the tail. Despite the aircraft flying through clouds at an altitude of 8~km, we did not detect any emissions from electrostatic wicks.</description>

      <title>Diverse patterns of pebbles on sand on Mars and Earth</title>

Abstract: On Mars, fields of sand dunes contrast with the general cratered, rocky terrain commonly seen from orbit. Near the equator, in Gale Crater, images from the rover, Curiosity, also reveal order on smaller scales: ripples on dunes, and ground patterns in scattered sites. The patterns include relatively inconspicuous forms: evenly spaced pebble-size rocks (termed clasts) on meter-scale domains of wind-blown sand. Here, we examine quantitatively several such domains on both Mars and Earth. The domains are significantly more orderly than expected by chance. Moreover, many are hyperuniform, a self-organized state recently recognized in diverse active materials and biological systems but that appears novel for planetary surfaces. We use numerical simulations to examine how diverse clast distributions, ranging from random and hyperuniform dispersions to distinct alignments, can emerge spontaneously from clast displacements induced by gravity, combined with the wind-driven evolution of the surface, sand transport, and ripple migration. This paper highlights easily overlooked self-organized patterns beyond distinct geometric patterns on at least two planets, and the simulations help understand the information coded in clast domains. Moreover, our methods and findings potentially have quantitatively implications for studies of issues of global significance on Earth, including dust emission from vast areas into the atmosphere.</description>

      <title>The Fe-Ni phase diagram and the Earth's inner core structure</title>

Abstract: The Fe-Ni alloy is believed to be the main component of Earth's core. Yet, a comprehensive understanding of phase equilibria near the melting point of this alloy under core conditions is still lacking, leaving the effect of nickel inconclusive. Using ab initio simulations, we computed Gibbs free energy and phase diagram for liquid and solid solutions of the Fe-Ni alloy under conditions close to the inner core, considering inner-shell electron contributions and non-ideal mixing effects. The Fe-Ni phase diagram provides crucial insights for understanding previous experimental observations and crystallization simulations of the Fe-Ni alloy under core conditions. It also presents new scenarios for inner core structures, suggesting bcc-liquid coexistence at the inner core boundary and the possibility of multi-layer structures consisting of bcc-hcp composites within the inner core. Our work clarifies nickel's substantial impact on the inner core structure, providing new constraints for the study of core's composition and formation.</description>

      <title>Observations of high-frequency spectral peaks from in-situ waves in ice data: evidence for nonlinear waves in ice triad interactions?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19034v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The propagation of waves through the marginal ice zone (MIZ) and deeper into pack ice is a key phenomenon that influences the breakup and drift of sea ice. When waves in ice propagate through a solid, non-cracked, thick enough sea ice cover, significant flexural elastic effects can be present in the dispersion relation. This results in a dispersion relation that opens up for 3-wave interactions, also known as wave triads.
  Here, we report the observation of high-frequency spectral peaks in the power spectral density of waves in ice spectra. We show, in two timeseries datasets, that the presence of these high-frequency peaks is accompanied by high values for the spectral bicoherence. This is a signature that the high-frequency peak is phase-locked with frequency components in the main spectral energy peak, and a necessary condition for nonlinear coupling to take place. Moreover, we show for a timeseries dataset that includes several closely located sensors that the dispersion relation recovered from a cross-spectrum analysis is compatible with the possible existence of wave triads at the same frequencies for which the bicoherence peak is observed. In addition to these observations in timeseries datasets, we show that similar high-frequency peaks are observed from additional, independent datasets of waves in ice power spectrum densities transmitted over iridium from autonomous buoys.
  These results suggest that nonlinear energy transfers between wave in ice spectral components are likely to occur in some waves and sea ice conditions. This may enable redistribution of energy from weakly damped low-frequency waves to more strongly attenuated higher-frequency spectral components, which can contribute to energy dissipation in the ice.</description>

      <title>Revealing Hidden Precursors to Earthquakes via a Stress-Sensitive Transformation of Seismic Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00268v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Earthquake prediction has long been one of the most elusive challenges in science. Laboratory experiments and simulations suggest that failure precursors should exist, yet reliable signals have remained unobserved in real-world seismic records, leaving open the question of whether they are absent in nature or simply hidden within noise. Here we introduce a stress-sensitive frequency-domain transformation that tracks energy differences between adjacent frequency bands, isolating subtle spectral changes linked to evolving shear and normal stress. Applied to both laboratory acoustic emission data and seismic records from eight major earthquakes (Mw 5.9-9.0), including the 2011 Tohoku and 2023 Turkey-Syria events, the transform consistently reveals precursory signatures, arc-like trajectories and accelerations toward extrema, emerging hours to days before rupture. These features are robust across diverse tectonic settings, from induced seismicity and volcanic collapse to continental strike-slip and subduction megathrust earthquakes. Our findings demonstrate that hidden precursors are indeed encoded in ambient seismic noise, offering a pathway toward real-time fault monitoring and actionable short-term earthquake forecasting.</description>
