      <title>Energy Management for Renewable-Colocated Artificial Intelligence Data Centers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop an energy management system (EMS) for artificial intelligence (AI) data centers with colocated renewable generation. Under a profit-maximizing framework, the EMS of renewable-colocated data center (RCDC) co-optimizes AI workload scheduling, on-site renewable utilization, and electricity market participation. Within both wholesale and retail market participation models, the economic benefit of the RCDC operation is maximized. Empirical evaluations using real-world traces of electricity prices, data center power consumption, and renewable generation demonstrate significant profit gains from renewable and AI data center colocations.</description>

      <title>Data-driven joint optimization of maintenance and spare parts provisioning: A distributionally robust approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the joint optimization of condition-based maintenance and spare provisioning, incorporating insights obtained from sensor data. Prognostic models estimate components' remaining lifetime distributions (RLDs), which are integrated into an optimization model to coordinate maintenance and spare provisioning. The existing literature addressing this problem assumes that prognostic models provide accurate estimates of RLDs, thereby allowing a direct adoption of Stochastic Programming or Markov Decision Process methodologies. Nevertheless, this assumption often does not hold in practice since the estimated distributions can be inaccurate due to noisy sensors or scarcity of training data. To tackle this issue, we develop a Distributionally Robust Chance Constrained (DRCC) formulation considering general discrepancy-based ambiguity sets that capture potential distribution perturbations of the estimated RLDs. The proposed formulation admits a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) reformulation, where explicit formulas are provided to simplify the general discrepancy-based ambiguity sets. Finally, for the numerical illustration, we test a type-$\infty$ Wasserstein ambiguity set and derive closed-form expressions for the parameters of the MILP reformulation. The efficacy of our methodology is showcased in a wind turbine case study, where the proposed DRCC formulation outperforms other benchmarks based on stochastic programming and robust optimization.</description>

      <title>A Dissipativity Framework for Constructing Scaled Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scaled relative graphs have been originally introduced in the context of convex optimization and have recently gained attention in the control systems community for the graphical analysis of nonlinear systems. Of particular interest in stability analysis of feedback systems is the scaled graph, a special case of the scaled relative graph. In many ways, scaled graphs can be seen as a generalization of the classical Nyquist plot for linear time-invariant systems, and facilitate a powerful graphical tool for analyzing nonlinear feedback systems. In their current formulation, however, scaled graphs require characterizing the input-output behaviour of a system for an uncountable number of inputs. This poses a practical bottleneck in obtaining the scaled graph of a nonlinear system, and currently limits its use. This paper presents a framework grounded in dissipativity for efficiently computing the scaled graph of several important classes of systems, including multivariable linear time-invariant systems, impulsive systems, and piecewise linear systems. The proposed approach leverages novel connections between linear matrix inequalities, integral quadratic constraints, and scaled graphs, and is shown to be exact for specific linear time-invariant systems. The results are accompanied by several examples illustrating the potential and effectiveness of the presented framework.</description>

      <title>Genericity of Polyak-Lojasiewicz Inequalities for Entropic Mean-Field Neural ODEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the behavior of idealized deep residual neural networks (ResNets), modeled via an optimal control problem set over continuity (or adjoint transport) equations. The continuity equations describe the statistical evolution of the features in the asymptotic regime where the layers of the network form a continuum. The velocity field is expressed through the network activation function, which is itself viewed as a function of the statistical distribution of the network parameters (weights and biases). From a mathematical standpoint, the control is interpreted in a relaxed sense, taking values in the space of probability measures over the set of parameters. We investigate the optimal behavior of the network when the cost functional arises from a regression problem and includes an additional entropic regularization term on the distribution of the parameters. In this framework, we focus in particular on the existence of stable optimizers --that is, optimizers at which the Hessian of the cost is non-degenerate. We show that, for an open and dense set of initial data, understood here as probability distributions over features and associated labels, there exists a unique stable global minimizer of the control problem. Moreover, we show that such minimizers satisfy a local Polyak--Lojasiewicz inequality, which can lead to exponential convergence of the corresponding gradient descent when the initialization lies sufficiently close to the optimal parameters. This result thus demonstrates the genericity (with respect to the distribution of features and labels) of the Polyak--Lojasiewicz condition in ResNets with a continuum of layers and under entropic penalization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are interested in studying the structure of the feasible sets of MIPs and its relation with the existence of a finite cardinality test set which can be applied in augmentation algorithms. This paper characterizes a computable, finite test set for MIP which can be embedded in an augmentation algorithm.

      <title>Warm-starting outer approximation for parametrized convex MINLP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the challenge of efficiently solving parametrized sequences of convex Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) problems through warm-starting techniques. We focus on an outer approximation (OA) approach, for which we develop the theoretical foundation and present two warm-starting techniques for solving sequences of convex MINLPs. These types of problem sequences arise in several important applications, such as, multiobjective MINLPs using scalarization techniques, sparse linear regression, hybrid model predictive control, or simply in analyzing the impact of certain problem parameters.
  The main contribution of this paper is the mathematical analysis of the proposed warm-starting framework for OA-based algorithms, which shows that a simple adaptation of the polyhedral outer approximation from one problem to the next can greatly improve the computational performance. We prove that, under some conditions, one of the proposed warm-starting techniques result in only one OA iteration to find an optimal solution and verify optimality. Numerical results also demonstrate noticeable performance improvements compared to two common initialization approaches, and show that the warm-starting can also in practice result in a single iteration to converge for several problems in the sequences. Our methods are especially effective for problems where consecutive problems in the sequence are similar, and where the integer part of the optimal solutions are constant for several problems in the sequence. The results show that it is possible, both in theory and practice, to perform warm-starting to enhance the computational efficiency of solving parametrized convex MINLPs.</description>

      <title>Causal Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman Equations for Anticipative Stochastic Optimal Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a stochastic optimal control problem where the controller can anticipate the evolution of the driving noise over some dynamically changing time window. The controlled state dynamics are understood as a rough differential equation. We combine the martingale optimality principle with a functional form of It\^o's formula to derive a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation for this problem. This HJB equation is formulated in terms of Dupire's functional derivatives and involves a transport equation arising from the anticipativity of the problem.</description>

      <title>Robust Contextual State Estimation with Limited Measurement Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing integration of distributed energy resources (DERs) is transforming power systems into complex, decentralized networks, particularly at the distribution level, where active distribution networks (ADNs) introduce new challenges for monitoring and control. Accurate state estimation in these systems is complicated by limited and heterogeneous measurement infrastructures, where real-time data from supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) and micro-phasor measurement units ($\mu$-PMUs) is sparse, and slower data from Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) is abundant but delayed. In this context, historical data becomes a key asset, yet its effective use requires robust methods that account for its relevance and variability. This paper proposes a novel data-driven methodology for state estimation under limited real-time observability. We first introduce a non-parametric estimator that leverages nearest neighbors to approximate the conditional expectation of delayed measurement residuals. Building on this, we develop a robustified extension that accounts for ambiguity in the estimated conditional distribution, mitigating the impact of sample sparsity and uncertainty. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach brings substantial benefits in accuracy and robustness, particularly in scenarios with scarce and noisy measurements.</description>

      <title>Variable annuities: A closer look at ratchet guarantees, hybrid contract designs, and taxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates optimal withdrawal strategies and behavior of policyholders in a variable annuity (VA) contract with a guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit (GMWB) rider incorporating taxation and a ratchet mechanism for enhancing the benefit base during the life of the contract. Mathematically, this is accomplished by solving a backward dynamic programming problem associated with optimizing the discounted risk-neutral expectation of cash flows from the contract. Furthermore, reflecting traded VA contracts in the market, we consider hybrid products providing policyholders access to a cash fund which functions as an intermediate repository of earnings from the VA and earns interest at a contractually specified cash rate. We contribute to the literature by revealing several significant interactions among taxation, the cash fund, and the benefit base update mechanism. When tax rates are high, the tax-shielding effect of the cash fund, which is taxed differently from ordinary withdrawals from the VA, plays a significant role in enhancing the attractiveness of the overall contract. Furthermore, the ratchet benefit base update scheme (in contrast to the ubiquitous return-of-premium specification in the literature) tends to discourage early surrender as it provides enhanced downside market risk protection. In addition, the cash fund discourages active withdrawals, with policyholders preferring to transfer the guaranteed withdrawal amount to the cash fund to leverage the cash fund rate.</description>

      <title>Data Generation without Function Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimating the score function (or other population-density-dependent functions) is a fundamental component of most generative models. However, such function estimation is computationally and statistically challenging. Can we avoid function estimation for data generation? We propose an estimation-free generative method: A set of points whose locations are deterministically updated with (inverse) gradient descent can transport a uniform distribution to arbitrary data distribution, in the mean field regime, without function estimation, training neural networks, and even noise injection. The proposed method is built upon recent advances in the physics of interacting particles. We show, both theoretically and experimentally, that these advances can be leveraged to develop novel generative methods.</description>

      <title>Towards solving large QUBO problems using quantum algorithms: improving the LogQ scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The LogQ algorithm encodes Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems with exponentially fewer qubits than the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). The advantages of conventional LogQ are accompanied by a challenge related to the optimization of its free parameters, which requires the usage of resource intensive evolutionary or even global optimization algorithms. We propose a new LogQ parameterization that can be optimized with a gradient-inspired method, which is less resource-intensive and thus strengthens the advantage of LogQ over QAOA for large/industrial problems. We illustrate the features of our method on an analytical model and present larger scale numerical results on MaxCut problems.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Stabilisation of Unstable Periodic Orbits of the Three-Body Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many different models of the physical world exhibit chaotic dynamics, from fluid flows and chemical reactions to celestial mechanics. The study of the three-body problem (3BP) and its many different families of unstable periodic orbits (UPOs) have provided fundamental insight into chaotic dynamics as far back as the 19th century. The 3BP, a conservative system, is inherently challenging to sample due to its volume-preservation property. In this paper we present an interpretable data-driven approach for the state-dependent control of UPOs in the 3BP, through leveraging the inherent sensitivity of chaos and the local manifold structure. We overcome the sampling challenge by utilising prior knowledge of UPOs and a novel augmentation strategy. This enables sample-efficient discovery of a verifiable and accurate local Poincar\'{e} map in as few as 55 data points. We suggest that the Poincar\'{e} map is best discovered at a surface of section where the norm of the monodromy matrix, i.e. the local sensitivity to small perturbations, is the smallest. To stabilise the UPOs, we apply small velocity impulses once each period, determined by solving a convex system of linear matrix inequalities based on the linearised map. We constrain the norm of the decision variables used to solve this system, resulting in locally optimal velocity impulses directed along the local stable manifold. Critically, this behaviour is achieved in a computationally efficient manner. We demonstrate this sample-efficient and low-energy method across several orbit families in the 3BP, with potential applications ranging from robotics and spacecraft control to fluid dynamics.</description>

Abstract: For developing innovative systems architectures, modeling and optimization techniques have been central to frame the architecting process and define the optimization and modeling problems. In this context, for system-of-systems the use of efficient dedicated approaches (often physics-based simulations) is highly recommended to reduce the computational complexity of the targeted applications. However, exploring novel architectures using such dedicated approaches might pose challenges for optimization algorithms, including increased evaluation costs and potential failures. To address these challenges, surrogate-based optimization algorithms, such as Bayesian optimization utilizing Gaussian process models have emerged.</description>

      <title>Greedy Low-Rank Gradient Compression for Distributed Learning with Convergence Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Distributed optimization is pivotal for large-scale signal processing and machine learning, yet communication overhead remains a major bottleneck. Low-rank gradient compression, in which the transmitted gradients are approximated by low-rank matrices to reduce communication, offers a promising remedy. Existing methods typically adopt either randomized or greedy compression strategies: randomized approaches project gradients onto randomly chosen subspaces, introducing high variance and degrading empirical performance; greedy methods select the most informative subspaces, achieving strong empirical results but lacking convergence guarantees. To address this gap, we propose GreedyLore--the first Greedy Low-Rank gradient compression algorithm for distributed learning with rigorous convergence guarantees. GreedyLore incorporates error feedback to correct the bias introduced by greedy compression and introduces a semi-lazy subspace update that ensures the compression operator remains contractive throughout all iterations. With these techniques, we prove that GreedyLore achieves a convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(\sigma/\sqrt{NT} + 1/T)$ under standard optimizers such as MSGD and Adam--marking the first linear speedup convergence rate for low-rank gradient compression. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Optimality conditions for problems over symmetric cones and a simple augmented Lagrangian method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.05298</link>
      <description>arXiv:1701.05298v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we are interested in nonlinear symmetric cone problems (NSCPs), which contain as special cases nonlinear semidefinite programming, nonlinear second order cone programming and the classical nonlinear programming problems. We explore the possibility of reformulating NSCPs as common nonlinear programs (NLPs), with the aid of squared slack variables. Through this connection, we show how to obtain second order optimality conditions for NSCPs in an easy manner, thus bypassing a number of difficulties associated to the usual variational analytical approach. We then discuss several aspects of this connection. In particular, we show a "sharp" criterion for membership in a symmetric cone that also encodes rank information. Also, we discuss the possibility of importing convergence results from nonlinear programming to NSCPs, which we illustrate by discussing a simple augmented Lagrangian method for nonlinear symmetric cones. We show that, employing the slack variable approach, we can use the results for NLPs to prove convergence results, thus extending a special case (i.e., the case with strict complementarity) of an earlier result by Sun, Sun and Zhang for nonlinear semidefinite programs.</description>

      <title>A Stability Condition for Online Feedback Optimization without Timescale Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10964v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Online Feedback Optimization (OFO) is a control approach to drive a dynamical plant to an optimal steady state. By interconnecting optimization algorithms with real-time plant measurements, OFO provides all the benefits of feedback control, yet without requiring exact knowledge of plant dynamics for computing a setpoint. On the downside, existing stability guarantees for OFO require the controller to evolve on a sufficiently slower timescale than the plant, possibly affecting transient performance and responsiveness to disturbances. In this paper, we prove that, under suitable conditions, OFO ensures stability without any timescale separation. In particular, the condition we propose is independent of the time constant of the plant, hence it is scaling-invariant. Our analysis leverages a composite Lyapunov function, which is the $\max$ of plant-related and controller-related components. We corroborate our theoretical results with numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Stability analysis through folds: An end-loaded elastic with a lever arm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04729v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many physical systems can be modelled as parameter-dependent variational problems. In numerous cases, multiple equilibria co-exist, requiring the evaluation of their stability, and the monitoring of transitions between them. Generally, the stability characteristics of the equilibria change near folds in the parameter space. The direction of stability changes is embedded in a specific projection of the solutions, known as distinguished bifurcation diagrams. In this article, we identify such projections for variational problems characterized by fixed-free ends -- a class of problems frequently encountered in mechanics. Using these diagrams, we study an Elastica subject to an end load applied through a rigid lever arm. Several instances of snap-back instability are reported, along with their dependence on system parameters through numerical examples. These findings have potential applications in the design of soft robot arms and other actuator designs.</description>

      <title>Tropical Fr\'echet Means</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05322v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Fr\'echet mean is a key measure of central tendency as a barycenter for a given set of points in a general metric space. It is computed by solving an optimization problem and is a fundamental quantity in statistics. In this paper, we study Fr\'echet means in tropical geometry -- a piecewise linear, combinatorial, and polyhedral variant of algebraic geometry that has gained prominence in applications. A key property of Fr\'echet means is that uniqueness is generally not guaranteed, which is true in tropical settings. In solving the tropical Fr\'echet mean optimization problem, we obtain a geometric characterization of the collection of all Fr\'echet means in a general tropical space as a tropically and classically convex polytope. Furthermore, we prove that a certificate of positivity for finitely many quadratic polynomials in $\mathbb{R}[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ always exists, given that their quadratic homogeneous components are sums of squares. We propose an algorithm to symbolically compute the Fr\'echet mean polytope based on our exact quadratic optimization result and study its complexity.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of the Efficiency and Comparison of Different Numerical Differentiation Methods on Three Case Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10285v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Without question regarding its pivotal significance, the computation of function derivatives carries substantial weight within a multitude of engineering and applied mathematical fields. These encompass optimization, the development of nonlinear control systems, and the assessment of noisy time signals, among others. In this study, we have chosen three illustrative cases: the logistic model for population dynamics, temperature variation within buildings, and the determination of market equilibrium prices. The primary objective is to assess the effectiveness of various numerical differentiation techniques and conduct a comparative analysis of the outcomes for each of these case studies. To achieve this objective, we employed three distinct numerical differentiation techniques: The Forward, Backward, and Centered FiniteDifference methods, each executed in two different levels of precision, totaling six variations. Our findings clearly indicate that, for the initial case study, the methods characterized by lower computational costs (specifically, the Forward and Backward Finite-Difference methods) yield superior outcomes. In contrast, for the second case study, the Centered Finite-Difference method delivers better results. In the case of the third case study, our results reveal that none of the methods produce estimations that meet acceptable standards. It is noteworthy that the empirical equations for each case study have been validated against previous literature.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Distributional Robustness in Principal Component Analysis by Wasserstein Distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02494v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the distributionally robust optimization (DRO) model of principal component analysis (PCA) to account for uncertainty in the underlying probability distribution. The resulting formulation leads to a nonsmooth constrained min-max optimization problem, where the ambiguity set captures the distributional uncertainty by the type-$2$ Wasserstein distance. We prove that the inner maximization problem admits a closed-form optimal value. This explicit characterization equivalently reformulates the original DRO model into a minimization problem on the Stiefel manifold with intricate nonsmooth terms, a challenging formulation beyond the reach of existing algorithms. To address this issue, we devise an efficient smoothing manifold proximal gradient algorithm. Our analysis establishes Riemannian gradient consistency and global convergence of our algorithm to a stationary point of the nonsmooth minimization problem. We also provide the iteration complexity $O(\epsilon^{-3})$ of our algorithm to achieve an $\epsilon$-approximate stationary point. Finally, numerical experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness and scalability of our algorithm, as well as to highlight the necessity and rationality of adopting the DRO model for PCA.</description>

      <title>Topological feature selection for time series data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.17494v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use tools from applied topology for feature selection on time series data. Given a multivariate time series, we employ persistent homology to assign weights to individual components and construct weighted embeddings whose topological features are optimized according to a chosen objective. We show that, along affine paths in the space of weights, the persistence diagram evolves piecewise linearly. This enables explicit and efficient computation of directional derivatives and gradient-based optimization. We prove that for objective functions on persistence diagrams that are Lipschitz with respect to a $p$-Wasserstein distance, the evaluation of the function along a gradient-descent path is Lipschitz. We apply our method to synthetic and biological data sets and demonstrate that our approach selects informative combinations of variables that recover the coordinated dynamics.</description>

      <title>Graph Convolutional Branch and Bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03099v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article explores the integration of deep learning models into combinatorial optimization pipelines, specifically targeting NP-hard problems. Traditional exact algorithms for such problems often rely on heuristic criteria to guide the exploration of feasible solutions. In this work, we propose using neural networks to learn informative heuristics-most notably, an optimality score that estimates a solution's proximity to the optimum. This score is used to evaluate nodes within a branch-and-bound framework, enabling a more efficient traversal of the solution space. Focusing on the Traveling Salesman Problem, we describe two exact solvers-1-tree branch-and-bound and Concorde-and introduce a hybrid approach called Graph Convolutional Branch and Bound, which augments these solvers with a graph convolutional neural network along with a novel unsupervised training strategy that facilitates generalization to graphs of varying sizes without requiring labeled data. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, showing a significant reduction in the number of explored branch-and-bound nodes and overall computational time.</description>

      <title>Online convex optimization for constrained control of nonlinear systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00922v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a modular approach that combines the online convex optimization framework and reference governors to solve a constrained control problem featuring time-varying and a priori unknown cost functions. Compared to existing results, the proposed framework is uniquely applicable to nonlinear dynamical systems subject to state and input constraints. Furthermore, our method is general in the sense that we do not limit our analysis to a specific choice of online convex optimization algorithm or reference governor. We show that the dynamic regret of the proposed framework is bounded linearly in both the dynamic regret and the path length of the chosen online convex optimization algorithm, even though the online convex optimization algorithm does not account for the underlying dynamics. We prove that a linear bound with respect to the online convex optimization algorithm's dynamic regret is optimal, i.e., cannot be improved upon. Furthermore, for a standard class of online convex optimization algorithms, our proposed framework attains a bound on its dynamic regret that is linear only in the variation of the cost functions, which is known to be an optimal bound. Finally, we demonstrate implementation and flexibility of the proposed framework by comparing different combinations of online convex optimization algorithms and reference governors to control a nonlinear chemical reactor in a numerical experiment.</description>

      <title>A Fundamental Bound for Robust Quantum Gate Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01215v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive a universal performance limit for coherent quantum control in the presence of modeled and unmodeled uncertainties. For any target unitary $W$ that is implementable in the absence of error, we prove that the worst-case (and hence the average) gate fidelity obeys the lower bound $F \ge \Flb\bigl(\tf \Omeff\bigr)$, where $\tf$ is the gate duration and $\Omeff$ is a single frequency-like measure that aggregates \emph{all} bounded uncertainty sources, e.g., coherent control imperfections, unknown couplings, and residual environment interactions, without assuming an initially factorizable system-bath state or a completely positive map. The bound is obtained by combining an interaction-picture averaging method with a Bellman-Gronwall inequality and holds for any finite-norm Hamiltonian decomposition. Hence it applies equally to qubits, multi-level qudits, and ancilla-assisted operations. Because $\Flb$ depends only on the dimensionless product $\tf\Omeff$, it yields a device-independent metric that certifies whether a given hardware platform can, in principle, reach a specified fault-tolerance threshold, and also sets a quantitative target for robust-control synthesis and system identification.</description>

      <title>Global Energy Minimization for Simplex Mesh Optimization: A Radius Ratio Approach to Sliver Elimination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01762v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quality of simplex mesh is crucial for the stability and accuracy of numerical simulations in finite element analysis and computational geometry. However, the presence of sliver elements in 3D simplex mesh can severely impact the results. This paper presents a novel method based on a radius ratio energy function to optimize the quality of simplex mesh elements. This method can effectively eliminate sliver elements, thereby enhancing mesh quality.The gradient of the proposed energy function can be decomposed into a matrix-vector product. With minor processing, the matrix becomes symmetric positive definite, and this symmetric positive definite matrix can serve as a preconditioner to significantly accelerate the optimization process. Experimental results demonstrate that this method has significant advantages in eliminating sliver elements and improving mesh quality.</description>
