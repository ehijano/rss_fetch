      <title>Disaster Informatics after the COVID-19 Pandemic: Bibliometric and Topic Analysis based on Large-scale Academic Literature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive bibliometric and topic analysis of the disaster informatics literature published between January 2020 to September 2022. Leveraging a large-scale corpus and advanced techniques such as pre-trained language models and generative AI, we identify the most active countries, institutions, authors, collaboration networks, emergent topics, patterns among the most significant topics, and shifts in research priorities spurred by the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings highlight (1) countries that were most impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic were also among the most active, with each country having specific research interests, (2) countries and institutions within the same region or share a common language tend to collaborate, (3) top active authors tend to form close partnerships with one or two key partners, (4) authors typically specialized in one or two specific topics, while institutions had more diverse interests across several topics, and (5) the COVID-19 pandemic has influenced research priorities in disaster informatics, placing greater emphasis on public health. We further demonstrate that the field is converging on multidimensional resilience strategies and cross-sectoral data-sharing collaborations or projects, reflecting a heightened awareness of global vulnerability and interdependency. Collecting and quality assurance strategies, data analytic practices, LLM-based topic extraction and summarization approaches, and result visualization tools can be applied to comparable datasets or solve similar analytic problems. By mapping out the trends in disaster informatics, our analysis offers strategic insights for policymakers, practitioners, and scholars aiming to enhance disaster informatics capacities in an increasingly uncertain and complex risk landscape.</description>

      <title>EVOLVE-X: Embedding Fusion and Language Prompting for User Evolution Forecasting on Social Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social media platforms serve as a significant medium for sharing personal emotions, daily activities, and various life events, ensuring individuals stay informed about the latest developments. From the initiation of an account, users progressively expand their circle of friends or followers, engaging actively by posting, commenting, and sharing content. Over time, user behavior on these platforms evolves, influenced by demographic attributes and the networks they form. In this study, we present a novel approach that leverages open-source models Llama-3-Instruct, Mistral-7B-Instruct, Gemma-7B-IT through prompt engineering, combined with GPT-2, BERT, and RoBERTa using a joint embedding technique, to analyze and predict the evolution of user behavior on social media over their lifetime. Our experiments demonstrate the potential of these models to forecast future stages of a user's social evolution, including network changes, future connections, and shifts in user activities. Experimental results highlight the effectiveness of our approach, with GPT-2 achieving the lowest perplexity (8.21) in a Cross-modal configuration, outperforming RoBERTa (9.11) and BERT, and underscoring the importance of leveraging Cross-modal configurations for superior performance. This approach addresses critical challenges in social media, such as friend recommendations and activity predictions, offering insights into the trajectory of user behavior. By anticipating future interactions and activities, this research aims to provide early warnings about potential negative outcomes, enabling users to make informed decisions and mitigate risks in the long term.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Simulation Framework for Disinformation Dissemination and Correction With Social Bots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the human-bot symbiotic information ecosystem, social bots play key roles in spreading and correcting disinformation. Understanding their influence is essential for risk control and better governance. However, current studies often rely on simplistic user and network modeling, overlook the dynamic behavior of bots, and lack quantitative evaluation of correction strategies. To fill these gaps, we propose MADD, a Multi Agent based framework for Disinformation Dissemination. MADD constructs a more realistic propagation network by integrating the Barabasi Albert Model for scale free topology and the Stochastic Block Model for community structures, while designing node attributes based on real world user data. Furthermore, MADD incorporates both malicious and legitimate bots, with their controlled dynamic participation allows for quantitative analysis of correction strategies. We evaluate MADD using individual and group level metrics. We experimentally verify the real world consistency of MADD user attributes and network structure, and we simulate the dissemination of six disinformation topics, demonstrating the differential effects of fact based and narrative based correction strategies.</description>

      <title>Cross-Subreddit Behavior as Open-Source Indicators of Coordinated Influence: A Case Study of r/Sino &amp; r/China</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates potential indicators of coordinated influence activity among users participating in both r/Sino and r/China, two ideologically divergent Reddit communities focused on Chinese political discourse. Topic modeling and sentiment analysis are applied to all posts and comments authored by dual-subreddit users to construct a user-topic sentiment matrix. Individual sentiment patterns are compared to global topic baselines derived from the broader r/Sino and r/China populations. Behavioral profiling is performed using full user activity histories and metadata, incorporating measures such as lexical diversity, language consistency, account age, posting frequency, and karma distribution. Users exhibiting multiple behavioral anomalies are identified and examined within a subreddit co-participation network to assess structural overlap. The combined linguistic and behavioral analysis enables the identification of patterns consistent with inauthentic or strategically structured participation. These findings demonstrate the utility of integrating content and activity-based signals in the analysis of online influence behavior within contested information environments.</description>

      <title>Who Leads in the Shadows? ERGM and Centrality Analysis of Congressional Democrats on Bluesky</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following the 2024 U.S. presidential election, Democratic lawmakers and their supporters increasingly migrated from mainstream social media plat-forms like X (formerly Twitter) to decentralized alternatives such as Bluesky. This study investigates how Congressional Democrats use Bluesky to form networks of influence and disseminate political messaging in a platform environment that lacks algorithmic amplification. We employ a mixed-methods approach that combines social network analysis, expo-nential random graph modeling (ERGM), and transformer-based topic mod-eling (BERTopic) to analyze follows, mentions, reposts, and discourse pat-terns among 182 verified Democratic members of Congress. Our findings show that while party leaders such as Hakeem Jeffries and Elizabeth War-ren dominate visibility metrics, overlooked figures like Marcy Kaptur, Donald Beyer, and Dwight Evans occupy structurally central positions, suggesting latent influence within the digital party ecosystem. ERGM re-sults reveal significant homophily along ideological, state, and leadership lines, with Senate leadership exhibiting lower connectivity. Topic analysis identifies both shared themes (e.g., reproductive rights, foreign conflicts) and subgroup-specific issues, with The Squad showing the most distinct discourse profile. These results demonstrate the potential of decentralized platforms to reshape intra-party communication dynamics and highlight the need for continued computational research on elite political behavior in emerging digital environments.</description>

      <title>Weak Links in LinkedIn: Enhancing Fake Profile Detection in the Age of LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made it easier to create realistic fake profiles on platforms like LinkedIn. This poses a significant risk for text-based fake profile detectors. In this study, we evaluate the robustness of existing detectors against LLM-generated profiles. While highly effective in detecting manually created fake profiles (False Accept Rate: 6-7%), the existing detectors fail to identify GPT-generated profiles (False Accept Rate: 42-52%). We propose GPT-assisted adversarial training as a countermeasure, restoring the False Accept Rate to between 1-7% without impacting the False Reject Rates (0.5-2%). Ablation studies revealed that detectors trained on combined numerical and textual embeddings exhibit the highest robustness, followed by those using numerical-only embeddings, and lastly those using textual-only embeddings. Complementary analysis on the ability of prompt-based GPT-4Turbo and human evaluators affirms the need for robust automated detectors such as the one proposed in this study.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of temporal influence in polarised networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In social networks, it is often of interest to identify the most influential users who can successfully spread information to others. This is particularly important for marketing (e.g., targeting influencers for a marketing campaign) and to understand the dynamics of information diffusion (e.g., who is the most central user in the spreading of a certain type of information). However, different opinions often split the audience and make the network polarised. In polarised networks, information becomes soiled within communities in the network, and the most influential user within a network might not be the most influential across all communities. Additionally, influential users and their influence may change over time as users may change their opinion or choose to decrease or halt their engagement on the subject. In this work, we aim to study the temporal dynamics of users' influence in a polarised social network. We compare the stability of influence ranking using temporal centrality measures, while extending them to account for community structure across a number of network evolution behaviours. We show that we can successfully aggregate nodes into influence bands, and how to aggregate centrality scores to analyse the influence of communities over time. A modified version of the temporal independent cascade model and the temporal degree centrality perform the best in this setting, as they are able to reliably isolate nodes into their bands.</description>

      <title>Quotegraph: A Social Network Extracted from Millions of News Quotations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Quotegraph, a novel large-scale social network derived from speaker-attributed quotations in English news articles published between 2008 and 2020. Quotegraph consists of 528 thousand unique nodes and 8.63 million directed edges, pointing from speakers to persons they mention. The nodes are linked to their corresponding items in Wikidata, thereby endowing the dataset with detailed biographic entity information, including nationality, gender, and political affiliation. Being derived from Quotebank, a massive corpus of quotations, relations in Quotegraph are additionally enriched with the information about the context in which they are featured. Each part of the network construction pipeline is language agnostic, enabling the construction of similar datasets based on non-English news corpora. We believe Quotegraph is a compelling resource for computational social scientists, complementary to online social networks, with the potential to yield novel insights into the behavior of public figures and how it is captured in the news.</description>

      <title>Triadic First-Order Logic Queries in Temporal Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motif counting is a fundamental problem in network analysis, and there is a rich literature of theoretical and applied algorithms for this problem. Given a large input network $G$, a motif $H$ is a small "pattern" graph indicative of special local structure. Motif/pattern mining involves finding all matches of this pattern in the input $G$. The simplest, yet challenging, case of motif counting is when $H$ has three vertices, often called a "triadic" query. Recent work has focused on "temporal graph mining", where the network $G$ has edges with timestamps (and directions) and $H$ has time constraints.
  Inspired by concepts in logic and database theory, we introduce the study of "thresholded First Order Logic (FOL) Motif Analysis" for massive temporal networks. A typical triadic motif query asks for the existence of three vertices that form a desired temporal pattern. An "FOL" motif query is obtained by having both existential and thresholded universal quantifiers. This allows for query semantics that can mine richer information from networks. A typical triadic query would be "find all triples of vertices $u,v,w$ such that they form a triangle within one hour". A thresholded FOL query can express "find all pairs $u,v$ such that for half of $w$ where $(u,w)$ formed an edge, $(v,w)$ also formed an edge within an hour".
  We design the first algorithm, FOLTY, for mining thresholded FOL triadic queries. The theoretical running time of FOLTY matches the best known running time for temporal triangle counting in sparse graphs. We give an efficient implementation of FOLTY using specialized temporal data structures. FOLTY has excellent empirical behavior, and can answer triadic FOL queries on graphs with nearly 70M edges is less than hour on commodity hardware. Our work has the potential to start a new research direction in the classic well-studied problem of motif analysis.</description>

      <title>Influence Maximization in Temporal Networks with Persistent and Reactive Behaviors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20936v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Influence maximization in temporal social networks presents unique challenges due to the dynamic interactions that evolve over time. Traditional diffusion models often fall short in capturing the real-world complexities of active-inactive transitions among nodes, obscuring the true behavior of influence spread. In dynamic networks, nodes do not simply transition to an active state once; rather, they can oscillate between active and inactive states, with the potential for reactivation and reinforcement over time. This reactivation allows previously influenced nodes to regain influence potency, enhancing their ability to spread influence to others and amplifying the overall diffusion process. Ignoring these transitions can thus conceal the cumulative impact of influence, making it essential to account for them in any effective diffusion model. To address these challenges, we introduce the Continuous Persistent Susceptible-Infected Model with Reinforcement and Re-activation (cpSI-R), which explicitly incorporates active-inactive transitions, capturing the progressive reinforcement that makes nodes more potent spreaders upon reactivation. This model naturally leads to a submodular and monotone objective function, which supports efficient optimization for seed selection in influence maximization tasks. Alongside cpSI-R, we propose an efficient temporal snapshot sampling method, simplifying the analysis of evolving networks. We then adapt the prior algorithms of seed selection to our model and sampling strategy, resulting in reduced computational costs and enhanced seed selection efficiency. Experimental evaluations on diverse datasets demonstrate substantial improvements in performance over baseline methods, underscoring the effectiveness of cpSI-R for real-world temporal networks</description>

      <title>Exact Matching in Correlated Networks with Node Attributes for Improved Community Recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02851v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study community detection in multiple networks with jointly correlated node attributes and edges. This setting arises naturally in applications such as social platforms, where a shared set of users may exhibit both correlated friendship patterns and correlated attributes across different platforms. Extending the classical Stochastic Block Model (SBM) and its contextual counterpart (Contextual SBM or CSBM), we introduce the correlated CSBM, which incorporates structural and attribute correlations across graphs. To build intuition, we first analyze correlated Gaussian Mixture Models, wherein only correlated node attributes are available without edges, and identify the conditions under which an estimator minimizing the distance between attributes achieves exact matching of nodes across the two databases. For the correlated CSBMs, we develop a two-step procedure that first applies $k$-core matching to most nodes using edge information, then refines the matching for the remaining unmatched nodes by leveraging their attributes with a distance-based estimator. We identify the conditions under which the algorithm recovers the exact node correspondence, enabling us to merge the correlated edges and average the correlated attributes for enhanced community detection. Crucially, by aligning and combining graphs, we identify regimes in which community detection is impossible in a single graph but becomes feasible when side information from correlated graphs is incorporated. Our results illustrate how the interplay between graph matching and community recovery can boost performance, broadening the scope of multi-graph, attribute-based community detection.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Graph Embedding Through Hub-aware Random Walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17764v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The role of high-degree nodes, or hubs, in shaping graph dynamics and structure is well-recognized in network science, yet their influence remains underexplored in the context of dynamic graph embedding. Recent advances in representation learning for graphs have shown that random walk-based methods can capture both structural and temporal patterns, but often overlook the impact of hubs on walk trajectories and embedding stability. In this paper, we introduce DeepHub, a method for dynamic graph embedding that explicitly integrates hub sensitivity into random walk sampling strategies. Focusing on dynnode2vec as a representative dynamic embedding method, we systematically analyze the effect of hub-biased walks across nine real-world temporal networks. Our findings reveal that standard random walks tend to overrepresent hub nodes, leading to embeddings that underfit the evolving local context of less-connected nodes. By contrast, hub-aware walks can balance exploration, resulting in embeddings that better preserve temporal neighborhood structure and improve downstream task performance. These results suggest that hub-awareness is an important yet overlooked factor in dynamic graph embedding, and our work provides a foundation for more robust, structure-sensitive representation learning in evolving networks.</description>

      <title>TwiUSD: A Benchmark Dataset and Structure-Aware LLM Framework for User Stance Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13343v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: User-level stance detection (UserSD) remains challenging due to the lack of high-quality benchmarks that jointly capture linguistic and social structure. In this paper, we introduce TwiUSD, the first large-scale, manually annotated UserSD benchmark with explicit followee relationships, containing 16,211 users and 47,757 tweets. TwiUSD enables rigorous evaluation of stance models by integrating tweet content and social links, with superior scale and annotation quality. Building on this resource, we propose MRFG: a structure-aware framework that uses LLM-based relevance filtering and feature routing to address noise and context heterogeneity. MRFG employs multi-scale filtering and adaptively routes features through graph neural networks or multi-layer perceptrons based on topological informativeness. Experiments show MRFG consistently outperforms strong baselines (including PLMs, graph-based models, and LLM prompting) in both in-target and cross-target evaluation.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Preserving Multimodal News Recommendation through Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15460v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Personalized News Recommendation systems (PNR) have emerged as a solution to information overload by predicting and suggesting news items tailored to individual user interests. However, traditional PNR systems face several challenges, including an overreliance on textual content, common neglect of short-term user interests, and significant privacy concerns due to centralized data storage. This paper addresses these issues by introducing a novel multimodal federated learning-based approach for news recommendation. First, it integrates both textual and visual features of news items using a multimodal model, enabling a more comprehensive representation of content. Second, it employs a time-aware model that balances users' long-term and short-term interests through multi-head self-attention networks, improving recommendation accuracy. Finally, to enhance privacy, a federated learning framework is implemented, enabling collaborative model training without sharing user data. The framework divides the recommendation model into a large server-maintained news model and a lightweight user model shared between the server and clients. The client requests news representations (vectors) and a user model from the central server, then computes gradients with user local data, and finally sends their locally computed gradients to the server for aggregation. The central server aggregates gradients to update the global user model and news model. The updated news model is further used to infer news representation by the server. To further safeguard user privacy, a secure aggregation algorithm based on Shamir's secret sharing is employed. Experiments on a real-world news dataset demonstrate strong performance compared to existing systems, representing a significant advancement in privacy-preserving personalized news recommendation.</description>

Abstract: Visual content on social media plays a key role in entertainment and information sharing, yet some images gain more engagement than others. We propose that image memorability - the ability to be remembered - may predict viral potential. Using 1,247 Reddit image posts across three timepoints, we assessed memorability with neural network ResMem and correlated the predicted memorability scores with virality metrics. Memorable images are consistently associated with more comments, even after controlling for image categories with ResNet-152. Semantic analysis revealed that memorable images relate to more neutral-affect comments, suggesting a distinct pathway to virality from emotional contents. Additionally, visual consistency analysis showed that memorable posts inspired diverse, externally-associated comments. By analyzing ResMem's layers, we found that semantic distinctiveness was key to both memorability and virality even after accounting for image category effects. This study highlights memorability as a unique correlate of social media virality, offering insights into how visual features and human cognitive behavioral interactions are associated with online engagement.</description>
