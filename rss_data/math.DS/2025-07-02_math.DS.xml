      <title>Entropy for Generalized Parabolic Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend the concept of generalized entropy to uniform spaces, allowing computations beyond metrizable settings. We apply this to parabolic dynamics - systems with a unique fixed point uniformly attracting all compact subsets in both time directions - and introduce a broader class, called generalized parabolic dynamics. Within this, we identify a significant subclass and prove its linear entropy, offering several equivalent characterizations linking the generalized entropy of the space, the non-wandering set, and families of mutually singular subsets. We also study homeomorphisms of compact surfaces with a singleton non-wandering set but non-parabolic dynamics. The examples that we present have at least quadratic entropy, bounded above by the supremum of polynomial growth rates. For any growth rate with the linear invariant property within these bounds, we construct a homeomorphism whose generalized entropy realizes the prescribed growth, with the non-wandering set reduced to a point.</description>

      <title>Nonautonomous scalar concave-convex differential equations: conditions for uniform stability or bistability in a model of optical fluorescence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The long-term dynamics of a Bonifacio-Lugiato model of optical superfluorescence is investigated. The scalar ordinary differential equation modelling the phenomenon is given by a concave-convex autonomous function of the state variable that is excited by a time-dependent input, $I(t)$. The system's response is described in terms of the dynamical characteristics of the input function, with particular focus on uniform stability or bistability cases. Building on previous published results, the open interval defined by the constant input values for which the equation exhibits uniform stability or bistability is considered, and it is proved that bistability occurs when $I(t)$ lies within this interval. This condition is sufficient but not necessary. Applying nonautonomous bifurcation methods and imposing more restrictive conditions on the variation of $I(t)$ makes it possible to determine the necessary and sufficient conditions for bistability and to prove that the general response is uniform stability when these conditions are not satisfied. Finally, the case of a periodic input that varies on a slow timescale is analyzed using fast-slow system methods to rigorously establish either a uniformly stable or a bistable response.</description>

      <title>Variational principles for BS dimension of subsets under amenable group actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we focus on the investigation of the BS dimension and BS packing dimension under amenable group actions. Firstly, we obtain two Bowen's equations which illustrate the relation of BS dimension to the Pesin-Pitskel topological pressure under amenable group actions, and BS packing dimension to the packing topological pressure under amenable group actions. Moreover, we establish the variational principle and inverse variational principle for BS dimension and BS packing dimension under amenable group actions.</description>

      <title>SINDy on slow manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) has been established as an effective method to learn interpretable models of dynamical systems from data. However, for high-dimensional slow-fast dynamical systems, the regression problem becomes simultaneously computationally intractable and ill-conditioned. Although, in principle, modeling only the dynamics evolving on the underlying slow manifold addresses both of these challenges, the truncated fast variables have to be compensated by including higher-order nonlinearities as candidate terms for the model, leading to an explosive growth in the size of the SINDy library. In this work, we develop a SINDy variant that is able to robustly and efficiently identify slow-fast dynamics in two steps: (i) identify the slow manifold, that is, an algebraic equation for the fast variables as functions of the slow ones, and (ii) learn a model for the dynamics of the slow variables restricted to the manifold. Critically, the equation learned in (i) is leveraged to build a manifold-informed function library for (ii) that contains only essential higher-order nonlinearites as candidate terms. Rather than containing all monomials of up to a certain degree, the resulting custom library is a sparse subset of the latter that is tailored to the specific problem at hand. The approach is demonstrated on numerical examples of a snap-through buckling beam and the flow over a NACA 0012 airfoil. We find that our method significantly reduces both the condition number and the size of the SINDy library, thus enabling accurate identification of the dynamics on slow manifolds.</description>

      <title>Linear dynamics of random products of operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the linear dynamics of the random sequence $(T_n(.))_{n \geq 1}$ of the operators $T_n(\omega) = T(\tau^{n-1}\omega) \dotsm T(\tau \omega) T(\omega), n \geq 1$. These products depend on an ergodic measure-preserving transformation $\tau : \mathbb{T} \to \mathbb{T}$ on the probability space $(\mathbb{T}, m)$ and on a strongly measurable map $T : \mathbb{T} \to \mathcal{B}(X)$, where $X$ is a separable Fr\'echet space. We will be focusing on the case where $T(\omega)$ is equal to an operator $T_1$ on $X$ for every $\omega \in A_1$ and equal to an operator $T_2$ on $X$ for every $\omega \in A_2$, where $A_1, A_2$ are two disjoint Borel subsets of $[0,1)$ such that $A_1 \cup A_2 = [0,1)$ and $m(A_k) &gt; 0$ for $k = 1,2$. More precisely, we will be focusing on the case where the operators $T_1$ and $T_2$ are adjoints of multiplication operators on the Hardy space $H^2(\mathbb{D})$, as well as the case where $T_1$ and $T_2$ are entire functions of exponential type of the derivation operator on the space of entire functions. Finally, we will study the linear dynamics of a case of a random product $T_n(\omega)$ for which the operators $T(\tau^i \omega), i \geq 0$, do not commute.We will give particular importance to the case where the ergodic transformation is an irrational rotation or the doubling map on $\mathbb{T}$.</description>

      <title>On quantum ergodicity for higher dimensional cat maps modulo prime powers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A discrete model of quantum ergodicity of linear maps generated by symplectic matrices $A \in \mathrm{Sp}(2d,\mathbb{Z})$ modulo an integer $N\ge 1$, has been studied for $d=1$ and almost all $N$ by P. Kurlberg and Z. Rudnick (2001). Their result has been strengthened by J. Bourgain (2005) and subsequently by A. Ostafe, I. E. Shparlinski, and J. F. Voloch (2023). For arbitrary $d$ this has been studied by P. Kurlberg, A. Ostafe, Z. Rudnick and I. E. Shparlinski (2024). The corresponding equidistribution results, for certain eigenfunctions, share the same feature: they apply to almost all moduli $N$ and are unable to provide an explicit construction of such ``good'' values of $N$. Here, using a bound of I. E. Shparlinski (1978) on exponential sums with linear recurrence sequences modulo a power of a fixed prime, we construct such an explicit sequence of $N$, with a power saving on the discrepancy.</description>

      <title>Sums and products in sets of positive density</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop an analytic approach that draws on tools from Fourier analysis and ergodic theory to study Ramsey-type problems involving sums and products in the integers. Suppose $Q$ denotes a polynomial with integer coefficients. We establish two main results. First, we show that if $Q(1) = 0$, then any set of natural numbers with positive upper logarithmic density contains a pair of the form $\{x + Q(y), xy\}$ for some $x, y \in \mathbb{N} \setminus \{1\}$. Second, we prove that if $Q(0) = 0$, then any set of natural numbers with positive density relative to a new multiplicative notion of density, which arises naturally in the context of such problems, contains $\{x + Q(y), xy\}$ for some $x, y \in \mathbb{N}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we present Chaoticus, a Python-based package for the GPU-accelerated integration of ODE systems and the computation of chaos indicators, including SALI, GALI, Lagrangian Descriptors based indicators and the Lyapunov exponent spectrum. By leveraging GPU parallelization, our package significantly reduces the computation times by several orders of magnitude compared to CPU-based approaches. This significant reduction in computing time facilitates the generation of extensive datasets, crucial for the in-depth analysis of complex dynamics in Hamiltonian systems.</description>

      <title>Learning dynamical systems from data: Gradient-based dictionary optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04775v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Koopman operator plays a crucial role in analyzing the global behavior of dynamical systems. Existing data-driven methods for approximating the Koopman operator or discovering the governing equations of the underlying system typically require a fixed set of basis functions, also called dictionary. The optimal choice of basis functions is highly problem-dependent and often requires domain knowledge. We present a novel gradient descent-based optimization framework for learning suitable and interpretable basis functions from data and show how it can be used in combination with EDMD, SINDy, and PDE-FIND. We illustrate the efficacy of the proposed approach with the aid of various benchmark problems such as the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, Chua's circuit, a nonlinear heat equation, as well as protein-folding data.</description>

      <title>Measures and dynamics on Pascal-Bratteli diagrams</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06280v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce and study dynamical systems and measures on stationary generalized Bratteli diagrams $B$ that are represented as the union of countably many classical Pascal-Bratteli diagrams. We describe all ergodic tail invariant measures on $B$. For every probability tail invariant measure $\nu_p$ on the classical Pascal-Bratteli diagram, we approximate the support of $\nu_p$ by the path space of a subdiagram. By considering various orders on the edges of $B$, we define dynamical systems with various properties. We show that there exist orders such that the sets of infinite maximal and infinite minimal paths are empty. This implies that the corresponding Vershik map is a homeomorphism. We also describe orders on both $B$ and the classical Pascal-Bratteli diagram that generate either uncountably many minimal infinite and uncountably many maximal infinite paths, or uncountably many minimal infinite paths alongside countably infinitely many maximal infinite paths.</description>

Abstract: We introduce two abstract constructions for building new measurable dynamical systems from existing ones and study their ergodic properties. The first of these constructions, a "reciprocal transformation," produces a type of non-singular transformation where the measures of subsets are distorted in a simple way. We then introduce the "discrete Maharam extension" which associates an infinite measure-preserving transformation to each reciprocal transformations. We give some preliminary results about the ergodic theory of each of these constructions, mention ongoing work, as well as conjectures and questions for future research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19312v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish the existence and finiteness of equilibrium states for a class of partially hyperbolic endomorphisms. In our first result, we assume that the central direction is simple. In the second result, we consider the case where there exists a dominated splitting along the central direction, which is decomposed into one-dimensional subbundles. This latter result extends the work of C. Alvarez and M. Cantarino \cite{alvarez2022existence} to higher-dimensional central directions. Finally, we demonstrate the finiteness of measures of maximal entropy under the assumption that the central direction is one-dimensional and the integrated Lyapunov exponent is bounded away from zero.</description>

      <title>On the holomorphic foliations admitting a common invariant algebraic set</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11172v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the holomorphic foliations admitting a common invariant algebraic set $C$ defined by a polynomial $f$ in $ \mathbb{K}[x_1,x_2,...,x_n]$ over any characteristic $0$ subfield $\mathbb{K}\subseteq\mathbb{C}$. For the $\mathbb{K}[x_1,x_2,...,x_n]$-module $V_f$ of vector fields generating foliations that admit $C$ as an invariant set, we provide several conditions under which the module $V_f$ can be freely generated by a minimal generating set. In particular, when $n=2$ and $f$ is a weakly tame polynomial, we show that the $\mathbb{K}[x,y]$-module $V_f$ is freely generated by two polynomial vector fields, one of which is the Hamiltonian vector field induced by $f$, if and only if, $f$ belongs to the Jacobian ideal $\langle f_x, f_y\rangle$ in $\mathbb{K}[x,y]$. Our proof employs a purely elementary method.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium States, Zero Temperature Limits and Entropy Continuity for Almost-Additive Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16729v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to study the equilibrium states for almost-additive potentials defined over topologically mixing countable Markov shifts (that is a non-compact space) without the big images and preimages (BIP) property. Let $\F$ be an almost-additive and summable potential with bounded variation potential. We prove that there exists an unique equilibrium state $\mu_{t\F}$ for each $t&gt;1$ and there exists an accumulation point $\mu_{\infty}$ for the family $(\mu_{t\F})_{t&gt;1}$ as $t\to\infty$. We also obtain that the Gurevich pressure $P_{G}(t\F)$ is $C^1$ on $(1,\infty)$ and the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy $h(\mu_{t\F})$ is continuous at $(1,\infty)$. As two applications, we extend completely the results for the zero temperature limit [J. Stat. Phys. ,155 (2014),pp. 23-46] and entropy continuity at infinity [J. Stat. Phys., 126 (2007),pp. 315-324] beyond the finitely primitive case. We also extend the result [Trans. Amer. Math. Soc., 370 (2018), pp. 8451-8465] for almost-additive potentials.</description>

      <title>The Competive Spectral Radius of Families of Nonexpansive Mappings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21097v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a new class of repeated zero-sum games in which the payoff is the escape rate of a switched dynamical system, where at every stage, the transition is given by a nonexpansive operator depending on the actions of both players. This generalizes to the two-player (and non-linear) case the notion of joint spectral radius of a family of matrices. We show that the value of this game does exist, and we characterize it in terms of an infinite dimensional non-linear eigenproblem. This provides a two-player analogue of Ma\~ne's lemma from ergodic control. This also extends to the two-player case results of Kohlberg and Neyman (1981), Karlsson (2001), and Vigeral and the second author (2012), concerning the asymptotic behavior of nonexpansive mappings. We discuss two special cases of this game: order preserving and positively homogeneous self-maps of a cone equipped with Funk's and Thompson's metrics, and groups of translations.</description>

Abstract: The estimation of static parameters in dynamical systems and control theory has been extensively studied, with significant progress made in estimating varying parameters in specific system types. Suppose, in the general case, we have data from a system with parameters that depend on an independent variable such as time or space. Further, suppose the system's model structure is known, but our aim is to identify functions describing parameter-varying elements as they change with respect to time or another variable. Focusing initially on the subclass of problems where parameters are discretely switching piecewise constant functions, we develop an algorithmic framework for detecting discrete parameter switches and fitting a piecewise constant model to data using optimization-based parameter estimation. Our modular framework allows for customization of switch detection, numerical integration, and optimization sub-steps to suit user requirements. Binary segmentation is used for switch detection, with Nelder-Mead and Powell methods employed for optimization. To address broader problems, we extend our framework using dictionary-based sparse regression with trigonometric and polynomial functions to obtain continuously varying parameter functions. Finally, we assess the framework's robustness to measurement noise. We demonstrate its capabilities across several examples, including time-varying promoter-gene expression, a genetic toggle switch, a parameter-switching manifold, the heat equation with a time-varying diffusion coefficient, and the advection-diffusion equation with a continuously varying parameter.</description>
