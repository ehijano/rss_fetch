      <title>Exceeding the maximum classical energy density in fully charged quantum batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum batteries are anticipated to achieve significant advancements in energy storage capacity. In classical batteries, the energy density at each subsystem reaches its maximum value, denoted as $E_C$, which is determined by dividing the maximum energy by the number of subsystems. We demonstrate that this limit can be surpassed in quantum batteries by protocols of Quantum Energy Teleportaion (QET), allowing for the energy density at a subsystem to exceed the value of $E_C$. Our protocol offers enhanced efficiency, reduces experimental complexity on quantum computers, and enables instantaneous energy charging through Local Operations and Classical Communication (LOCC). Leveraging quantum entanglement, this protocol significantly improves quantum energy storage systems, promising advances in quantum computing and new technological applications. This work represents a crucial step towards revolutionizing quantum energy storage and transfer.</description>

      <title>The role of the effective range in strongly-interacting few-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strongly interacting systems appear in several areas of physics and are characterized by attractive interactions that can almost, or just barely, loosely bind two particles. Although this definition is made at the two-body level, this gives rise to fascinating effects in larger systems, including the so-called Efimov physics. In this context, the zero-range theory aims to describe low-energy properties based only on the scattering length. However, for a broad range of physical applications, the finite range of the interactions plays an important role. In this work, I discuss some aspects of finite-range effects in strongly interacting systems. I present the zero-range and shapeless universalities in two-body systems with applications in atomic and nuclear physics. I derived an analytical expression for the $s$-wave bound-state spectrum of the modified P\"oschl-Teller potential for two particles in three dimensions, which is compared with the approximations to illustrate their usefulness. Concerning three identical bosons, I presented a trimer energy scaling function that explicitly includes the effective range. The implications for larger systems are briefly discussed.</description>
