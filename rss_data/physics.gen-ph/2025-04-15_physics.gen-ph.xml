      <title>Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation within the Zwicky Tired Light Hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At high red-shifts, the distribution of angular separations between galaxies in clusters is in tension with the standard cosmological model. The JWST data at even higher red-shifts have exacerbated this tension. However, Zwick Tired Light (TL) model fits well with these high red shift data, bringing the TL model back into the spotlight. In the TL model, red-shift is attributed to the energy loss of photons during propagation. However, some argue that this hypothesis cannot explain the shape and primordial nature of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Assuming that the CMB source is the microwave radiation from galaxies, we show that the TL model can produce a CMB spectrum consistent with the COBE FIRAS data. The TL model predicts a finite optical path per Hubble radius, which defines an opaque region, a sphere with radius of 240 Mpc (red shift 0.051) centred on the Milky Way, within this region, the galaxy's microwave radiation superposition behaves like a black body. Additionally, the TL scenario (microwave radiation superposition) allows us to determine the angular size of the CMB temperature fluctuations, in agreement with the observed CMB power spectrum, and provides insight into the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect.</description>

      <title>Confining Quantum Chromodynamics Model for 3-Quark Baryons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss a model for the relativistic bound states of 3-quark baryons based on confining quantum chromoynamics (QCD) with general Yang-Mills symmetry. The model postulates that 3-quark states are formed by consecutive 2-body collisions. For a proton, d and u quarks get together first, and then they capture another u quark so that the d quark is at the core to form a stable proton state with intergral electric charge. The two u quarks form a quantum spheric shell and move in a confining potential $C(r)= Q' r$ of the core d quark. The confining potential $C(r)$ is a static solution of new `phase' fields satisfying the fourth-order equation based on general Yang-Mills symmetry. The two u quarks with the confining potentials $C(r)$ in the spherical shell can produce an effective quark Hooke potential $V_{qH}(r)=Qr^2 + V_o$ for the d quark at the core, where Q and $Q'$ are not independent. The proton mass is assumed to be approximately given by
  $ E(d) + 2E(u)$, which can be obtained analytically from Dirac Hamiltonians involving $V_{qH}(r)$ and $C(r)$ for d and two u quarks respectively. The model gives a reasonable understanding of roughly 120 baryon masses based on two different coupling constants and one free parameter $V_o$ for sub-spectra specfied by $J^P$. These results are roughly within 20\% in percent deviation, which appears to be independent of the assumption of color charges. The confining QCD model also gives the neutron-proton mass difference $\approx 0.6 MeV$.</description>

      <title>Amelino-Camelia DSR effects on charged Dirac oscillators: Modulated spinning magnetic vortices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work explores the two-dimensional Dirac oscillator (DO) within the framework of Amelino-Camelia doubly special relativity (DSR), employing a modified Dirac equation that preserves the first-order nature of the relativistic wave equation. By introducing non-minimal couplings, the system provides an exact analytical solution in terms of confluent hypergeometric functions, along with closed-form expressions for the energy spectrum (indulging a Landau-like signature along with accidental spin-degeneracies)-. In the low-energy limit, the results reproduce the well-known two-dimensional Dirac oscillator spectrum, and in the nonrelativistic regime, the results reduce the Schr\"odinger oscillator spectrum. First-order corrections in this DSR model introduce a mass-splitting term proportional to $\pm \mathcal{E}_{\circ}/\mathcal{E}_p$, where $\mathcal{E}_{\circ} = mc^2$ is the rest energy and $\mathcal{E}_p$ is the Planck energy. These corrections preserve the symmetry between the energies of particles and antiparticles around zero energy, but induce a shift in the energy levels that becomes more significant for higher excited states ($n &gt; 0$). By mapping the system to a DSR-deformed charged Dirac oscillator in the presence of an out-of-plane uniform magnetic field, we show that the leading-order Planck-scale corrections vanish at a critical magnetic field $\mathcal{B}^{c}_{0}$, and as the magnetic field approaches this critical value, the relativistic energy levels approach $\mathcal{E}_{n,\pm} = \pm \mathcal{E}_{\circ}$. Finally, we identify a previously undetermined feature in two-dimensional charged Dirac oscillator systems in a magnetic field, revealing that the corresponding modes manifest as spinning magnetic vortices.</description>
