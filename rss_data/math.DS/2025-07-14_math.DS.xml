      <title>Ratio limits and pressure function for group extensions of Gibbs Markov maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ratio limit theorems for random walks on (various) groups are known. We obtain a generalization of this type of ratio limit for deterministic walks on certain groups driven by Gibbs Markov maps. In terms of proofs, the main difficulty comes down to the absence of a convolution structure. Also, for (finitely generated) group extensions of Gibbs Markov maps we obtain a characterization of the pressure function without a symmetry assumption.</description>

      <title>Formal proof of the approximation of a random phenomenon by a chaotic phenomenon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article examines the subtle relationship between chaos and randomness, two concepts that, although they refer to seemingly unpredictable phenomenon, are based on fundamentally different principles. Chaos manifests in deterministic systems where small variations in initial conditions lead to unpredictable long-term behaviors, while randomness pertains to intrinsically probabilistic processes, characterized by fundamental uncertainty. Although these phenomena are based on distinct mechanisms, they can interact and converge in contexts as varied as the modeling of natural phenomena, climate forecasts, or financial markets. Despite their differences, these two phenomena share common characteristics, such as the absence of apparent order and an unpredictability that defies our attempts at long-term prediction. Through an analysis of chaos theory and probability, this article aims to clarify the distinctions and highlight the deep connections between these two concepts in real systems. The objective of this article is to present a comprehensive approach aimed at demonstrating that, under certain conditions, a random phenomenon can be effectively represented and approximated by a chaotic phenomenon. By examining this possibility, we seek to establish the theoretical foundations that connect these two concepts, often perceived as distinct, but whose dynamics could prove to be analogous in certain contexts.</description>

      <title>On the Birkhoff conjecture for Kepler billiards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the integrability of Kepler billiards-mechanical billiard systems in which a particle moves under the influence of a Keplerian potential and reflects elastically at the boundary of a strictly convex planar domain. Our main result establishes that, except possibly for one location of the gravitational center, analytic integrability at high energies occurs only when the domain is an ellipse and the center is placed at one of its foci. This provides a partial affirmative answer to a Keplerian analogue of the classical Birkhoff-Poritsky Conjecture.
  Our approach is based on the construction of symbolic dynamics arising from chaotic subsystems that emerge in the high-energy regime. Depending on the geometric configuration of the boundary and the location of the attraction center, we construct three types of symbolic dynamics by shadowing chains of punctured Birkhoff-type trajectories. These constructions yield subsystems conjugated to Bernoulli shifts, implying positive topological entropy and precluding analytic integrability.
  We further analyze the notion of focal points of the second kind, showing that in real-analytic, non-elliptic domains there can be at most one such point, while ellipses are the only domains admitting two-coinciding with their classical foci. Finally, we demonstrate the existence of an infinite-dimensional family of non-elliptic domains possessing a focal point of the second kind, and conclude with numerical simulations illustrating chaotic behavior in such cases.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Stabilisation of Unstable Periodic Orbits of the Three-Body Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many different models of the physical world exhibit chaotic dynamics, from fluid flows and chemical reactions to celestial mechanics. The study of the three-body problem (3BP) and its many different families of unstable periodic orbits (UPOs) have provided fundamental insight into chaotic dynamics as far back as the 19th century. The 3BP, a conservative system, is inherently challenging to sample due to its volume-preservation property. In this paper we present an interpretable data-driven approach for the state-dependent control of UPOs in the 3BP, through leveraging the inherent sensitivity of chaos and the local manifold structure. We overcome the sampling challenge by utilising prior knowledge of UPOs and a novel augmentation strategy. This enables sample-efficient discovery of a verifiable and accurate local Poincar\'{e} map in as few as 55 data points. We suggest that the Poincar\'{e} map is best discovered at a surface of section where the norm of the monodromy matrix, i.e. the local sensitivity to small perturbations, is the smallest. To stabilise the UPOs, we apply small velocity impulses once each period, determined by solving a convex system of linear matrix inequalities based on the linearised map. We constrain the norm of the decision variables used to solve this system, resulting in locally optimal velocity impulses directed along the local stable manifold. Critically, this behaviour is achieved in a computationally efficient manner. We demonstrate this sample-efficient and low-energy method across several orbit families in the 3BP, with potential applications ranging from robotics and spacecraft control to fluid dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformers excel when dealing with sequential data. Generalizing transformer models to geometric domains, such as manifolds, we encounter the problem of not having a well-defined global order. We propose a solution with attention heads following a space-filling curve. As a first experimental example, we present the Spiroformer, a transformer that follows a polar spiral on the $2$-sphere.</description>

      <title>Shape and Spectrum: On the Heat and Volume of Self-Similar Fractals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we examine the relationship between geometry and spectrum of regions with fractal boundary. The relationship is well-understood for fractal harps in one dimension, but largely open for fractal drums in larger dimensions. To that end, we study fractals arising as attractors of self-similar iterated function systems with some separation conditions. On the geometric side, we analyze the tube zeta functions and their poles, called complex dimensions, which govern the asymptotics of the volume of tubular neighborhoods of such fractals. On the spectral side, we study a Dirichlet problem for the heat equation, closely related to spectrum of the Laplacian. We show that the asymptotics of the total heat content are controlled by the same set of possible complex dimensions. Our method is to establish scaling functional equations and to solve by means of truncated Mellin transforms, wherefrom the scaling ratios of the underlying dynamics can be seen to govern both the geometry and spectra of these self-similar fractal drums.</description>

      <title>Counting the number of $2$-periodic integral points of a discrete dynamical system with applications from arithmetic statistics, IV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this follow-up paper, we inspect a surprising relationship between the set of $2$-periodic points of a polynomial map $\varphi_{d, c}$ defined by $\varphi_{d, c}(z) = z^d + c$ for all $c, z \in \mathbb{Z}$ and the coefficient $c$, where $d&gt;2$ is an integer. As in the previous articles, we again wish to study here counting problems that are inspired by exciting advances of Bhargava-Shankar-Tsimerman and their collaborators on $2$-torsion point-counting in arithmetic statistics, and also by Hutz's conjecture and Panraksa's work on $2$-periodic point-counting in arithmetic dynamics. In doing so, we then first prove that for any given prime $p\geq 3$, the average number of distinct $2$-periodic integral points of any polynomial map $\varphi_{p, c}$ modulo $p$ is either zero or unbounded as $c$ tends to infinity. Furthermore, inspired by a conjecture of Hutz on $2$-periodic rational points of any polynomial map $\varphi_{p-1, c}$ for any given prime $p\geq 5$ in arithmetic dynamics, we then also prove that the average number of distinct $2$-periodic integral points of any $\varphi_{p-1, c}$ modulo $p$ is equal to $1$ or $2$ or $0$ as $c$ tends to infinity. Finally, as in the previous follow-up articles, we then also apply here density and number field-counting results from arithmetic statistics, and consequently obtain again several counting and statistical results on the irreducible monic integer polynomials and on the algebraic number fields arising naturally in our dynamical setting.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Nonlinear Vector Autoregression: Robust Forecasting for Noisy Chaotic Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear vector autoregression (NVAR) and reservoir computing (RC) have shown promise in forecasting chaotic dynamical systems, such as the Lorenz-63 model and El Nino-Southern Oscillation. However, their reliance on fixed nonlinearities - polynomial expansions in NVAR or random feature maps in RC - limits their adaptability to high noise or real-world data. These methods also scale poorly in high-dimensional settings due to costly matrix inversion during readout computation. We propose an adaptive NVAR model that combines delay-embedded linear inputs with features generated by a shallow, learnable multi-layer perceptron (MLP). The MLP and linear readout are jointly trained using gradient-based optimization, enabling the model to learn data-driven nonlinearities while preserving a simple readout structure. Unlike standard NVAR, our approach avoids the need for an exhaustive and sensitive grid search over ridge and delay parameters. Instead, tuning is restricted to neural network hyperparameters, improving scalability. Initial experiments on chaotic systems tested under noise-free and synthetically noisy conditions showed that the adaptive model outperformed the standard NVAR in predictive accuracy and showed robust forecasting under noisy conditions with a lower observation frequency.</description>

      <title>Long-time relative error analysis for linear ODEs with perturbed initial value</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the propagation of initial value perturbations along the solution of a linear ODE \( y'(t) = Ay(t) \). This propagation is analized using the relative error rather than the absolute error. Our focus is on the long-term behavior of this relative error, which differs significantly from that of the absolute error. Understanding this long-term behavior provides insights into the growth of the relative error over all times, not just at large times. Therefore, it represents a crucial and fundamental aspect of the conditioning of linear ODEs, with applications in, for example, non-normal dynamics. The author hopes that this paper will stimulate attention to the role of relative error in dynamic contexts.</description>

      <title>State Estimation Using Sparse DEIM and Recurrent Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15982v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sparse Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method (S-DEIM) was recently proposed for state estimation in dynamical systems when only a sparse subset of the state variables can be observed. The S-DEIM estimate involves a kernel vector whose optimal value is inferred through a data assimilation algorithm. This data assimilation step suffers from two drawbacks: (i) It requires the knowledge of the governing equations of the dynamical system, and (ii) It is not generally guaranteed to converge to the optimal kernel vector. To address these issues, here we introduce an equation-free S-DEIM framework that estimates the optimal kernel vector from sparse observational time series using recurrent neural networks (RNNs). We show that the recurrent architecture is necessary since the kernel vector cannot be estimated from instantaneous observations. But RNNs, which incorporate the past history of the observations in the learning process, lead to nearly optimal estimations. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method on three numerical examples with increasing degree of spatiotemporal complexity: a conceptual model of atmospheric flow known as the Lorenz-96 system, the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, and the Rayleigh-Benard convection. In each case, the resulting S-DEIM estimates are satisfactory even when a relatively simple RNN architecture, namely the reservoir computing network, is used.</description>

      <title>Natural extensions of embeddable semigroup actions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05536v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semigroup actions and their invertible extensions are discussed. First, we develop a theory of natural extensions for continuous actions of countable, embeddable semigroups. Second, we demonstrate that not every surjective such action of a semigroup, which embeds into a group and generates it, can be extended to an action of said group, and that this phenomenon is specific to non-reversible semigroups. Furthermore, we characterize the free group on a semigroup (the group together with the embedding) as the unique pair that always admits such an extension, showing that both the choice of the receiving group and the embedding are crucial for this construction. Next, we prove that the classical notion of a natural extension -- requiring all other invertible extensions to factor through it -- only works in the context of compact extensions of left reversible semigroup actions and fails outside of it, thus providing a characterization of left reversibility. We finish by briefly studying topological dynamical properties of the natural extension in the amenable case.</description>

      <title>Data-driven system identification using quadratic embeddings of nonlinear dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08202v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel data-driven method called QENDy (Quadratic Embedding of Nonlinear Dynamics) that not only allows us to learn quadratic representations of highly nonlinear dynamical systems, but also to identify the governing equations. The approach is based on an embedding of the system into a higher-dimensional feature space in which the dynamics become quadratic. Just like SINDy (Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics), our method requires trajectory data, time derivatives for the training data points, which can also be estimated using finite difference approximations, and a set of preselected basis functions, called dictionary. We illustrate the efficacy and accuracy of QENDy with the aid of various benchmark problems and compare its performance with SINDy and a deep learning method for identifying quadratic embeddings. Furthermore, we analyze the convergence of QENDy and SINDy in the infinite data limit, highlight their similarities and main differences, and compare the quadratic embedding with linearization techniques based on the Koopman operator.</description>

      <title>Dynamical systems on torus related to general Heun equations: phase-lock areas and constriction breaking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07282v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The overdamped Josephson junction in superconductivity is modeled by a family of dynamical systems on two-dimensional torus: the so-called RSJ model. As was discovered by V.M. Buchstaber and S.I. Tertychnyi, this family admits an equivalent description by a family of second order differential equations: special double confluent Heun equations. In the present paper we construct two new families of dynamical systems on torus that can be equivalently described by a family of general Heun equations (GHE), with four singular points, and confluent Heun equations, with three singular points. The first family, related to GHE, is a deformation of the RSJ model, which will be denoted by dRSJ. The phase-lock areas of a family of dynamical systems on torus are those level subsets of the rotation number function that have non-empty interiors. For the RSJ model, V.M. Buchstaber, O.V. Karpov and S.I. Tertychnyi discovered the Rotation Number Quantization Effect: phase-lock areas exist only for integer rotation number values. As was shown by A.V. Klimenko and O.L. Romaskevich, each phase-lock area is a chain of domains separated by points. Those separation points that do not lie in the abscissa axis are called constrictions. In the present paper we study phase-lock areas in the new family dRSJ. The Quantization Effect remains valid in this family. On the other hand, we show that in the new family dRSJ the constrictions break down.</description>

      <title>Ergodic and foliated kernel-differentiation method for linear responses of random systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10138v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the kernel-differentiation method for the linear response (parameter-derivative of averaged observables) of random dynamical systems. First, for the linear response of physical (or stationary) measures, we extend the method to an ergodic version, which is sampled by an infinitely long sample path, so it is more efficient than previous results. This is achieved by combining the likelihood ratio trick, decay of correlations, and ergodic theorem. Second, when the noise and perturbation are along a given foliation, we show that the method is still valid for both finite and infinite time. These results are derived using basic calculus via a microscopic view of transfer operators.
  We use the ergodic formula to numerically compute the linear response of a tent map with additive noise. We use the foliated formula to compute the linear response of an unstable neural network with 51 layers $\times$ 9 neurons, with respect to the bias parameter. We show that adding foliated noise incurs a smaller error than adding noise in all directions, in terms of approximating the trend between the averaged observable and the parameter. We give a rough error analysis of the kernel-differentiation method and show that it can be expensive for small noise.
  Finally, we derive the three basic linear response methods (path-perturbation, divergence, and kernel-differentiation methods) in simplified settings, and propose a potential future program unifying them.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Tits alternative for groups of almost automorphisms of trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08784v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a dynamical variant of the Tits alternative for the group of almost automorphisms of a locally finite tree $\mathcal{T}$: a group of almost automorphisms of $\mathcal{T}$ either contains a nonabelian free group playing ping-pong on the boundary $\partial \mathcal{T}$, or the action of the group on $\partial \mathcal{T}$ preserves a probability measure. This generalises to all groups of tree almost automorphisms a result of S. Hurtado and E. Militon for Thompson's group $V$, with a hopefully simpler proof.</description>

      <title>A Stability Condition for Online Feedback Optimization without Timescale Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10964v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Online Feedback Optimization (OFO) is a control approach to drive a dynamical plant to an optimal steady state. By interconnecting optimization algorithms with real-time plant measurements, OFO provides all the benefits of feedback control, yet without requiring exact knowledge of plant dynamics for computing a setpoint. On the downside, existing stability guarantees for OFO require the controller to evolve on a sufficiently slower timescale than the plant, possibly affecting transient performance and responsiveness to disturbances. In this paper, we prove that, under suitable conditions, OFO ensures stability without any timescale separation. In particular, the condition we propose is independent of the time constant of the plant, hence it is scaling-invariant. Our analysis leverages a composite Lyapunov function, which is the $\max$ of plant-related and controller-related components. We corroborate our theoretical results with numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Hyperchaos and complex dynamical regimes in $N$-dimensional neuron lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03051v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of $N$-dimensional lattices of nonchaotic Rulkov neurons coupled with a flow of electrical current. We consider both nearest-neighbor and next-nearest-neighbor couplings, homogeneous and heterogeneous neurons, and small and large lattices over a wide range of electrical coupling strengths. As the coupling strength is varied, the neurons exhibit a number of complex dynamical regimes, including unsynchronized chaotic spiking, local quasi-bursting, synchronized chaotic bursting, and synchronized hyperchaos. For lattices in higher spatial dimensions, we discover dynamical effects arising from the "destructive interference" of many connected neurons and miniature "phase transitions" from coordinated spiking threshold crossings. In large two- and three-dimensional neuron lattices, we observe emergent dynamics such as local synchronization, quasi-synchronization, and lag synchronization. These results illustrate the rich dynamics that emerge from coupled neurons in multiple spatial dimensions, highlighting how dimensionality, connectivity, and heterogeneity critically shape the collective behavior of neuronal systems.</description>
