      <title>Why and How do Complex Systems Self-Organize at All? Average Action Efficiency as a Predictor, Measure, Driver, and Mechanism of Self-Organization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-organization in complex systems is a process in which randomness is reduced and emergent structures appear that allow the system to function in a more competitive way with other states of the system or with other systems. It occurs only in the presence of energy gradients, facilitating energy transmission through the system and entropy production. Being a dynamic process, self-organization requires a dynamic measure and dynamic principles. The principles of decreasing unit action and increasing total action are two dynamic variational principles that are viable to utilize in a self-organizing system. Based on this, average action efficiency can serve as a quantitative measure of the degree of self-organization. Positive feedback loops connect this measure with all other characteristics of a complex system, providing all of them with a mechanism for exponential growth, and indicating power law relationships between each of them as confirmed by data and simulations. In this study, we apply those principles and the model to agent-based simulations. We find that those principles explain self-organization well and that the results confirm the model. By measuring action efficiency we can have a new answer to the question: "What is complexity and how complex is a system?". This work shows the explanatory and predictive power of those models, which can help understand and design better complex systems.</description>

      <title>Recovery of synchronized oscillations on multiplex networks by tuning dynamical time scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00368v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The heterogeneity among interacting dynamical systems or variations in the pattern of their interactions occur naturally in many real complex systems. Often they lead to partially synchronized states like chimeras or oscillation suppressed states like in-homogeneous or homogeneous steady states. In such cases, it is a challenge to get synchronized oscillations in spite of prevailing heterogeneity. In this study, we present a formalism for controlling multi layer, multi timescale systems and show how synchronized oscillations can be restored by tuning the dynamical time scales between the layers. Specifically, we use the model of a multiplex network, where the first layer of coupled oscillators is multiplexed with an environment layer, that can generate various types of chimera states and suppressed states. We show that by tuning the time scale mismatch between the layers, we can revive the synchronized oscillations. We analyse the nature of the transition of the system to synchronization from various dynamical states and the role of time scale mismatch and strength of inter layer coupling in this scenario. We also consider a three layer multiplex system, where two system layers interact with the common environment layer. In this case, we observe anti synchronization and in-homogeneous steady states on the system layers and by tuning their time scale difference with the environment layer, they undergo transition to synchronized oscillations.</description>
