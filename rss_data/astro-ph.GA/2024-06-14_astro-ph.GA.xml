      <title>AGN Feedback in Quiescent Galaxies at Cosmic Noon Traced by Ionized Gas Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze ionized gas emission lines in deep rest-frame optical spectra of 16 quiescent galaxies at redshift $1.7&lt;z&lt;3.5$ observed with JWST/NIRSpec by the Blue Jay survey. Robust detection of emission lines in $75\%$ of the sample indicates the presence of ongoing ionizing sources in this passive population. The H$\alpha$ line luminosities confirm that the population is quiescent, with star formation rates that are at least ten times lower than the main sequence of star formation. The quiescent sample is clearly separate from the star-forming population in line diagnostic diagrams, and occupies a region usually populated by active galactic nuclei (AGN). Analysis of the observed line ratios, equivalent widths, and velocity dispersions leads us to conclude that in most cases the gas is ionized by AGN activity, despite the lack of X-ray detections. A subset of the sample also hosts ionized and/or neutral outflows. Our results show, for the first time using a representative sample, that low luminosity AGN are extremely common among quiescent galaxies at high redshift. These low luminosity AGN may play a key role in quenching star formation and in maintaining massive galaxies quiescent from Cosmic Noon to $z\sim0$.</description>

      <title>Theory and Observation of Winds from Star-Forming Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galactic winds shape the stellar, gas, and metal content of galaxies. To quantify their impact, we must understand their physics. We review potential wind-driving mechanisms and observed wind properties, with a focus on the warm ionized and hot X-ray-emitting gas. Energy and momentum injection by supernovae (SNe), cosmic rays, radiation pressure, and magnetic fields are considered in the light of observations: (1) Emission and absorption line measurements of cool/warm gas provide our best physical diagnostics of galactic outflows. (2) The critical unsolved problem is how to accelerate cool gas to the high velocities observed. Although conclusive evidence for no one mechanism exists, the momentum, energy, and mass-loading budgets observed compare well with theory. (3) A model where star formation provides a force $\sim L/c$, where $L$ is the bolometric luminosity, and cool gas is pushed out of the galaxy's gravitational potential, compares well with available data. The wind power is $\sim0.1$ that provided by SNe. (4) The very hot X-ray emitting phase, may be a (or the) prime mover. Momentum and energy exchange between the hot and cooler phases is critical to the gas dynamics. (5) Gaps in our observational knowledge include the hot gas kinematics and the size and structure of the outflows probed with UV absorption lines. Simulations are needed to more fully understand mixing, cloud-radiation, cloud-cosmic ray, and cloud-hot wind interactions, the collective effects of star clusters, and both distributed and clustered SNe. Observational works should seek secondary correlations in the wind data that provide evidence for specific mechanisms and compare spectroscopy with the column density-velocity results from theory.</description>

      <title>Large scale compressible turbulence in the ism of CSWA13, a star-Forming Lensed Galaxy at z = 1.87 with outflowing wind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, an observational paper presented spatially resolved observations of a wind outflow in CSWA13, a gravitationally lensed Star-Forming galaxy at z = 1.87. The gravitational lensing allowed for a substantially improved spatial and kinematic resolution of the wind and of the nebular gas. In this paper we take advantage of the resolved data to test for the existence of turbulence and to study its nature. We derive the spatial structure functions of the residual nebular and wind velocities along the major axis of the galaxy. The structure functions, of both velocity fields, reveal a supersonic compressible large scale turbulence. The turbulent timescale corresponding to the largest scale is about 200 Myr, an order of magnitude larger than the estimated age of the wind and of the young stars. This implies that the turbulence in the ism formed well before the wind and the young stars. Given the large spatial scale of the turbulence, it is plausible that the source of the turbulence is a large scale one e.g. a merger or tidal event that triggered the formation of molecular clouds, in the cores of which the young stars formed. A steepening of the structure functions on the smaller scales provides an estimate of the effective depth along the line of sight of the turbulent layer. The latter turns out to be about 2kpc.

      <title>The SDSS-V Black Hole Mapper Reverberation Mapping Project: CIV BAL Acceleration in the Quasar SBS 1408+544</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results of an investigation of a highly variable CIV broad absorption-line feature in the quasar SBS 1408+544 (z=2.337) that shows a significant shift in velocity over time. This source was observed as a part of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Reverberation Mapping Project and the SDSS-V Black Hole Mapper Reverberation Mapping Project, and has been included in two previous studies, both of which identified significant variability in a high-velocity CIV broad absorption line (BAL) on timescales of just a few days in the quasar rest frame. Using ~130 spectra acquired over eight years of spectroscopic monitoring with SDSS, we have determined that this BAL is not only varying in strength, but is also systematically shifting to higher velocities. Using cross-correlation methods, we measure the velocity shifts (and corresponding acceleration) of the BAL on a wide range of timescales, measuring an overall velocity shift of delta v = -683 (+89, -84) km s-1 over the 8-year monitoring period. This corresponds to an average rest-frame acceleration of a=1.04 (+0.14, -0.13) cm s-2, though the magnitude of the acceleration on shorter timescales is not constant throughout. We place our measurements in the context of BAL-acceleration models and examine various possible causes of the observed velocity shift.</description>

      <title>The turbulent life of NGC 4696 as told by its globular cluster system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we perform the photometric analysis of the globular cluster system (GCS) of the giant elliptical NGC4696, which is the brightest member of Centaurus, a rich and dynamically young galaxy cluster. We obtained deep Magellan 6.5 m/MegaCam (g', r', i') photometry, with which we identified a sample of 3818 stellar clusters around NGC4696 that were analyzed in the context of possible interactions and its assembly history. After carefully modeling and subtracting the galaxy light, we used selection criteria based on the shape, colors, and magnitudes to identify GC candidates. We find a number of features that indicate a disturbed GCS that points toward a complex evolution with other neighboring members of Centaurus. Formally, two subpopulations could be found at (g'-i')_0 = 0.763 $\pm$ 0.004 and (g'-i')_0=1.012 $\pm$ 0.004. Moreover, the color distribution does not show the presence of a significant blue tilt, but it presents a trend with the radius, where at small galactocentric distances a unimodal distribution is preferable to a bimodal one, suggesting the presence of an intermediate GC population. Besides the color distribution, the metallicity distribution also shows a bimodal trend, with peaks at [Fe/H]=-1.363 $\pm$ 0.010 and [Fe/H]=-0.488 $\pm$ 0.012. The radial density profiles show different slopes for the blue and red populations and the azimuthal distributions are well fitted by an asymmetrical sinusoidal function, with peaks projecting toward two nearby galaxies, NGC4696B and NGC4709, indicating past interactions among these three galaxies. Finally, we derived a GC specific frequency of S_N=6.8 $\pm$ 0.9, in good agreement with the values obtained for other giant ellipticals and with previously estimated S_N of NGC4696. All these results point toward a complex GCS, strongly influenced by the interaction history of NGC4696 with the other galaxies of the Centaurus cluster.</description>

      <title>ODIN: Identifying Protoclusters and Cosmic Filaments Traced by Ly$\alpha$-emitting Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To understand the formation and evolution of massive cosmic structures, studying them at high redshift, in the epoch when they formed the majority of their mass is essential. The One-hundred-deg$^2$ DECam Imaging in Narrowbands (ODIN) survey is undertaking the widest-area narrowband program to date, to use Ly$\alpha$-emitting galaxies (LAEs) to trace the large-scale structure (LSS) of the Universe at three cosmic epochs. In this work, we present results at $z$ = 3.1 based on early ODIN data in the COSMOS field. We identify and characterize protoclusters and cosmic filaments using multiple methods and discuss their strengths and weaknesses. We then compare our observations against the IllustrisTNG suite of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. The two are in excellent agreement, with a similar number and angular size of structures identified above a specified density threshold. We are able to recover the simulated protoclusters with $\log$(M$_{z=0}$/$M_\odot$) $\gtrsim$ 14.4 in $\sim$ 60\% of the cases. With these objects we show that the descendant masses of the protoclusters in our sample can be estimated purely based on our 2D measurements, finding a median $z$ = 0 mass of $\sim10^{14.5}$M$_\odot$. The lack of information on the radial extent of each protocluster introduces a $\sim$0.4~dex uncertainty in its descendant mass. Finally, we show that the recovery of the cosmic web in the vicinity of protoclusters is both efficient and accurate. The similarity of our observations and the simulations imply that our structure selection is likewise robust and efficient, demonstrating that LAEs are reliable tracers of the LSS.</description>

      <title>Updated Picture of the Active Galactic Nuclei with Dusty/Dust-free Gas Structures and Effects of the Radiation Pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the properties of two gas structures of X-ray selected active galactic nuclei (AGNs), that is, dusty and dust-free gas components, by separating them with the line-of-sight dust extinction ($A_V$) and the neutral gas column density ($N_{\mathrm{H}}$). The typical column density of the dusty and dust-free gas differs depending on the Seyfert type, indicating that both structures have anisotropic column density distributions. The number of targets with the dusty gas column density ($N_{\mathrm{H,d}}$) of $\log N_{\mathrm{H,d}}\ [\mathrm{cm^{-2}}]&gt;23$ is much smaller than that with the same column density of the dust-free gas. This result indicates that the optically-thick part of the dusty gas structure is very thin. There are very few targets with a larger Eddington ratio ($f_{\mathrm{Edd}}$) than the effective Eddington limit of the dusty gas and the covering factor of the dusty gas with $22\leq \log N_{\mathrm{H,d}}\ [\mathrm{cm^{-2}}]&lt;24$ exhibits a clear drop at the effective Eddington limit. These results support the scenario wherein the covering factor of the dusty torus decreases in a high Eddington ratio owing to the radiation-driven dusty gas outflow. The covering factor of the dust-free gas with the column density ($N_{\mathrm{H,df}}$) of $22\leq \log N_{\mathrm{H,df}}\ [\mathrm{cm^{-2}}]&lt;24$ similarly exhibits the decrease in high Eddington ratio, although it may be owing to the dust-free gas outflow driven by certain other mechanisms than the radiation pressure. Finally, we propose an updated picture of the AGN gas structure based on our results and the literature.</description>

      <title>Effects of Halo Spin on Bar Formation in Disk Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spin of dark halos has been shown to significantly affect bar formation and evolution in disk galaxies. To understand the physical role of the halo spin on bar formation, we run $N$-body simulations of isolated, Milky Way-sized galaxies by varying the halo spin parameter in the range $-0.16 \leq \lambda \leq 0.16$ and the bulge mass. We find that our adopted halo \emph{alone} is subject to swing amplification of an $m=2$ non-axisymmetric mode rotating in the same sense as the halo, which assists or inhibits the bar formation in a disk depending on its sense of rotation. The $m=2$ mode in the disk, growing via swing amplification, interacts constructively (destructively) with the $m=2$ mode in the prograde (retrograde) halo, promoting (delaying) bar formation. A bar grows by losing its angular momentum primarily to a halo. Since the halo particles inside (outside) the corotation resonance with the bar can emit (absorb) angular momentum to (from) the bar, the bar pattern speed decays slower for larger $\lambda&gt;0$, while it decreases relatively fast almost independent of $\lambda\leq0$. Models with a strong bar develop a boxy peanut-shaped bulge. In models without a bulge, this occurs rapidly via buckling instability, while the bars with a bulge thicken gradually without undergoing buckling instability. Among the models considered in the present work, the bar in the $\lambda = 0.06$ model with a bulge of 10\% of the disk mass best describes the Milky Way in terms of the bar length and pattern speed.</description>

      <title>Spatially resolved analysis of Stellar Populations in NGC 2992: Impact of AGN feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In NGC 2992, a galaxy-scale ionized gas outflow driven by AGN has long been recognized, yet its impact on the host galaxy has remained elusive. In this paper, we utilize data from the archival Very Large Telescope (VLT)/MUSE to present a spatially resolved analysis of stellar populations in this galaxy. Two different stellar population templates are employed to fit the stellar continuum, allowing us to determine the light-weighted stellar age, metallicity, the fraction of the young stellar population (age $&lt;100$ Myr, $P_{\rm Y}$), and the average age and metallicity of $P_{\rm Y}$. Our results reveal the presence of a very young stellar population ($\leq40$ Myr) within the dust lane and nearly along the galaxy's major axis. The light-weighted stellar age and the fraction of $P_{\rm Y}$ show negative trends along the major and minor axes. The average age and metallicity of $P_{\rm Y}$ present positive trends with increasing distance, except along the northern direction of the major axis. Within the circumnuclear region ($&lt;1$ kpc), the distribution of the young stellar population is spatially anti-correlated with the AGN outflow cone. The highest fraction of $P_{\rm Y}$ is observed at the outskirts of the nuclear radio bubble in the northern region near the nucleus. Considering the coupling efficiency and timescales, we propose that the AGN outflow in this galaxy may exert both negative and positive feedback on its host. Additionally, the star formation and the AGN activities could be attributed to the interaction between NGC 2992 and NGC 2993.</description>

      <title>Testing MOND using the dynamics of nearby stellar streams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stellar halo of the Milky Way is built up, at least in part, from debris from past mergers. Stars from such merger events define substructures in phase-space, for example in the form of streams, which are groups of stars moving on similar trajectories. The nearby Helmi streams discovered more than two decades ago are a well-known example. Using 6D phase-space information from the Gaia space mission, Dodd et al. (2022) have recently reported that the Helmi streams are split into two clumps in angular momentum space. Such substructure can be explained and sustained in time if the dark matter halo of the Milky Way takes a prolate shape in the region probed by the orbits of the stars in the streams. Here, we explore the behaviour of the two clumps identified in the Helmi streams in a Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) framework to test this alternative model of gravity. We perform orbit integrations of Helmi streams member stars in a simplified MOND model of the Milky Way and using the more sophisticated Phantom of RAMSES simulation framework. We find with both approaches that the two Helmi streams clumps do not retain their identity and dissolve after merely 100 Myr. This extremely short timescale would render the detection of two separate clumps as very unlikely in MONDian gravity. The observational constraints provided by the streams, which MOND fails to reproduce in its current formulation, could potentially also be used to test other alternative gravity models.</description>

      <title>Kinematics and star formation of hub-filament systems in W49A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: W49A is a prominent giant molecular cloud (GMC) that exhibits strong star formation activities, yet its structural and kinematic properties remain uncertain. Our study aims to investigate the large-scale structure and kinematics of W49A, and elucidate the role of filaments and hub-filament systems (HFSs) in its star formation activity. We utilized continuum data from Herschel and the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) as well as the molecular lines 12CO (3-2), 13CO (3-2), and C18O (3-2) to identify filaments and HFS structures within W49A. Further analysis focused on the physical properties, kinematics, and mass transport within these structures. Additionally, recombination line emission from the H I/OH/Recombination (THOR) line survey was employed to trace the central H II region and ionized gas. Our findings reveal that W49A comprises one blue-shifted (B-S) HFS and one red-shifted (R-S) HFS, each with multiple filaments and dense hubs. Notably, significant velocity gradients were detected along these filaments, indicative of material transport toward the hubs. High mass accretion rates along the filaments facilitate the formation of massive stars in the HFSs. Furthermore, the presence of V-shaped structures around clumps in position-velocity diagrams suggests ongoing gravitational collapse and local star formation within the filaments. Our results indicate that W49A consists of one R-S HFS and one B-S HFS, and that the material transport from filaments to the hub promotes the formation of massive stars in the hub. These findings underscore the significance of HFSs in shaping the star formation history of W49A.</description>

      <title>AuriDESI: Mock Catalogues for the DESI Milky Way Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Milky Way Survey (DESI MWS) will explore the assembly history of the Milky Way by characterising remnants of ancient dwarf galaxy accretion events and improving constraints on the distribution of dark matter in the outer halo. We present mock catalogues that reproduce the selection criteria of MWS and the format of the final MWS data set. These catalogues can be used to test methods for quantifying the properties of stellar halo substructure and reconstructing the Milky Way's accretion history with the MWS data, including the effects of halo-to-halo variance. The mock catalogues are based on a phase-space kernel expansion technique applied to star particles in the Auriga suite of six high-resolution $\Lambda$CDM magneto-hydrodynamic zoom-in simulations. They include photometric properties (and associated errors) used in DESI target selection and the outputs of the MWS spectral analysis pipeline (radial velocity, metallicity, surface gravity, and temperature). They also include information from the underlying simulation, such as the total gravitational potential and information on the progenitors of accreted halo stars. We discuss how the subset of halo stars observable by MWS in these simulations corresponds to their true content and properties. These mock Milky Ways have rich accretion histories, resulting in a large number of substructures that span the whole stellar halo out to large distances and have substantial overlap in the space of orbital energy and angular momentum.</description>

      <title>Tully-Fisher Relation of Late-type Galaxies at $0.6 \leq z \leq 2.5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a study of the stellar and baryonic Tully-Fisher relation within the redshift range of $0.6 \leq z \leq 2.5$ utilizing observations of \sfgs. This dataset, as explored in \citet{GS23}, comprises of disk-like galaxies spanning a stellar mass range of $8.89 \leq \log(M_{star} \ [\mathrm{M_\odot}]) \leq 11.5$, baryonic mass range of $9.0 \leq \log(M_{bar} [\mathrm{M_\odot}]) \leq 11.5$, and circular velocity range of $1.65 \leq \log(V_c \ [{\rm km/s}]) \leq 2.85$. Stellar masses of these objects are estimated using spectral energy distribution fitting techniques, while gas masses are determined via scaling relations. Circular velocities are directly derived from the Rotation Curves (RCs), after meticulously correcting for beam smearing and pressure support. Our analysis confirms that our sample adheres to the fundamental mass-size relations of galaxies and reflects the evolution of velocity dispersion in galaxies, in line with previous findings. This reaffirms the reliability of our photometric and kinematic parameters (i.e., $M_{star}$ and $V_c$), thereby enabling a comprehensive examination of the Tully-Fisher relation. To attain robust results, we employed a novel orthogonal likelihood fitting technique designed to minimize intrinsic scatter around the best-fit line, as required at \hz. For the STFR, we obtained a slope of $\alpha=3.03\pm 0.25$, an offset of $\beta = 3.34\pm 0.53$, and an intrinsic scatter of $\zeta_{int}=0.08$ dex. Correspondingly, the BTFR yielded $\alpha=3.21\pm 0.28$, $\beta=3.16\pm 0.61$, and $\zeta_{int}=0.09$ dex. Our findings suggest a subtle deviation in the stellar and baryonic Tully-Fisher relation with respect to local studies, which is most-likely due to the evolutionary processes governing disk formation.</description>

      <title>Dense Outflowing Molecular Gas in Massive Star-forming Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dense outflowing gas, traced by transitions of molecules with large dipole moment, is important for understanding mass loss and feedback of massive star formation. HCN 3-2 and HCO$^+$ 3-2 are good tracers of dense outflowing molecular gas, which are closely related to active star formation. In this study, we present on-the-fly (OTF) mapping observations of HCN 3-2 and HCO$^+$ 3-2 toward a sample of 33 massive star-forming regions using the 10-m Submillimeter Telescope (SMT). With the spatial distribution of line wings of HCO$^+$ 3-2 and HCN 3-2, outflows are detected in 25 sources, resulting in a detection rate of 76$\%$. The optically thin H$^{13}$CN and H$^{13}$CO$^+$ 3-2 lines are used to identify line wings as outflows and estimate core mass. The mass $M_{out}$, momentum $P_{out}$, kinetic energy $E_{K}$, force $F_{out}$ and mass loss rate $\dot M_{out}$ of outflow and core mass, are obtained for each source. A sublinear tight correlation is found between the mass of dense molecular outflow and core mass, with an index of $\sim$ 0.8 and a correlation coefficient of 0.88.</description>

      <title>The Milky Way as seen by Classical Cepheids I: distances based on mid-infrared photometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical Cepheids are the archetype of the standard candle, thanks to the period-luminosity relation which allows to measure their intrinsic brightness. They are also relatively young and bright, potentially making them excellent tracers of the young stellar population that is responsible for shaping the visible aspect of our Galaxy, the Milky Way. However, being observers embedded in the dusty interstellar medium of the Galaxy, deriving reliable photometric distances to classical Cepheids of the Milky Way is a challenge. The typical approach is to use reddening-free indices, such as Wesenheit magnitudes, to obviate the need for an extinction correction. However, this approach is not reliable - especially toward the inner Galaxy - as its assumption of a universal total-to-selective extinction ratio is not satisfied, particularly in lines-of-sight where the extinction is high and crosses spiral arms. We instead estimate new distances for 3425 Cepheids based on mid-IR photometry from WISE, which suffers minimally from extinction, and by adopting a 3D extinction map to calculate the necessary (albeit small) extinction corrections. We show that our distances are consistent with Gaia's parallaxes for the subset with relative parallax errors smaller than 10%, verifying that our mean distance errors are of the order of 13% and that the mean parallax zero point for this subsample is 7 $\mu$as. The catalog of Cepheid distances is made available online.</description>

      <title>The Milky Way as Seen by Classical Cepheids II: Spiral Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a relatively young and bright population, and the archetype of standard candles, classical Cepheids make an ideal population to trace non-axisymmetric structure in the young stellar disk to large distances. We use the new distances derived in Paper I based on mid-IR WISE photometry for a selected sample of 2857 dynamically young Cepheids to trace the spiral arms of the Milky Way. The Perseus and Sagittarius-Carina arms are clearly evident in the third and fourth Galactic quadrants, while the Local and Scutum arms are much weaker, with extinction severely limiting our view of the latter, inner-most spiral arm. Pitch angles are derived for each arm over various ranges of galactic azimuth, each covering at least 90{\deg} in azimuth. Our method of detecting spiral arms and deriving pitch angles does not rely on pre-assigning sources to specific arms. While spiral structure in the first and second quadrant is not obvious, in part due to extinction effects, it is not inconsistent with that seen in the third and fourth quadrants. In summary, the Cepheids allow us to map spiral structure in the third and fourth Galactic quadrants where there are currently few masers with astrometric parallaxes, thus significantly extending our picture of the Milky Way on large-scales.</description>

      <title>The Cygnus Allscale Survey of Chemistry and Dynamical Environments: CASCADE III. The large scale distribution of DCO+, DNC and DCN in the DR21 filament</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deuterated molecules and their molecular D/H-ratios (RD(D)) are important diagnostic tools to study the physical conditions of star-forming regions. The degree of deuteration, RD(D), can be significantly enhanced over the elemental D/H-ratio depending on physical parameters. Within the Cygnus Allscale Survey of Chemistry and Dynamical Environments (CASCADE), we aim to explore the large-scale distribution of deuterated molecules in the nearby Cygnus-X region. We focus on the analysis of large-scale structures of deuterated molecules in the filamentary region hosting the prominent Hii region DR21 and DR21(OH). Here we discuss the HCO+, HNC and HCN molecules and their deuterated isotopologues DCO+, DNC and DCN. The spatial distributions of integrated line emissions from DCO+, DNC, and DCN reveal morphological differences. DCO+ displays the most extended emission, characterized by several prominent peaks. Likewise, DNC exhibits multiple peaks, although its emission appears less extended compared to DCO+. In contrast to the extended emission of DCO+ and DNC, DCN appears the least extended, with distinct peaks. Focusing only on the regions where all three molecules are observed, the mean deuteration ratios for each species are 0.01 for both DNC and DCN, and = 0.005 for DCO+. Anti-correlations are found with deuterated molecules and dust temperature or N(H2). The strongest anti-correlation is found with RD(DCO+) and N(H2). The anti-correlation of RD(DCO+) and N(H2) is suggested to be a result of a combination of an increased photodissociation degree and shocks. A strong positive correlation between the ratio of integrated intensities of DCN and DNC with their 13C-isotopologues, are found in high column density regions. The positive relationship between the ratios implies that the D-isotopologue of the isomers could potentially serve as a tracer for the kinetic gas temperature.</description>

      <title>Three New Galactic Globular Cluster Candidates: FSR1700, Teutsch67, and CWNU4193</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The VISTA Variables in the Via L\'actea Extended Survey (VVVX) enables exploration of previously uncharted territories within the inner Milky Way (MW), particularly those obscured by stellar crowding and intense extinction. Our objective is to identify and investigate new star clusters to elucidate their intrinsic characteristics. Specifically, we are focused on uncovering new candidate Globular Clusters (GCs) situated at low Galactic latitudes, with the ultimate goal of completing the census of the MW GC system. Leveraging a combination of Near-InfraRed (NIR) data from the VVVX survey and Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS), along with optical photometry and precise proper motions (PMs) from the Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3), we are conducting a systematic characterisation of new GCs. As a result, we report the discovery and characterisation of four new Galactic clusters named FSR 1700, FSR 1415, CWNU 4193, and Teutsch 67, all located within the MW disk. We estimate a wide range of reddening, with values ranging from 0.44 to 0.73 mag for E(J-Ks). The heliocentric distances span from 10.3 to 13.2 kpc. Additionally, we determine their metallicities and ages, finding a range of -0.85 to -0.75 dex for [Fe/H] and ages approximately close to 11 Gyr, respectively. FSR 1415 is an exception, it is an old open cluster with age = 3 Gyr and [Fe/H] = -0.10. Furthermore, we fitted the radial density profiles to derive their structural parameters like tidal radius, core radius, and concentration parameters. In conclusion, based on their positions, kinematics, metallicities, and ages, and comparing our findings with existing literature, we categorise FSR 1700, Teutsch 67 and CWNU 4193 as genuine GC candidates, while FSR 1415 is an old open cluster exhibiting characteristics of a post core-collapse cluster.</description>

      <title>A 100 kpc Ram Pressure Tail Trailing the Group Galaxy NGC 2276</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the discovery of a 100 kpc low-frequency radio tail behind the nearby group galaxy, NGC 2276. The extent of this tail is a factor of ten larger than previously reported from higher-frequency radio and X-ray imaging. The radio morphology of the galaxy disc and tail suggest that the tail was produced via ram-pressure stripping, cementing NGC 2276 as the clearest known example of ram-pressure stripping in a low-mass group. With multi-frequency imaging, we extract radio continuum spectra between ~50 MHz and 1.2 GHz as a function of projected distance along the tail. All of the spectra are well fit by a simple model of spectral ageing due to synchrotron and inverse-Compton losses. From these fits we estimate a velocity of 870 km/s for the stripped plasma across the plane of the sky, and a three-dimensional orbital velocity of 970 km/s for NGC 2276. The orbital speed that we derive is in excellent agreement with the previous estimate from Rasmussen et al., despite it being derived with a completely independent methodology.</description>

      <title>Ray-tracing vs. Born approximation in full-sky weak lensing simulations of the MillenniumTNG project</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Weak gravitational lensing is a powerful tool for precision tests of cosmology. As the expected deflection angles are small, predictions based on non-linear N-body simulations are commonly computed with the Born approximation. Here we examine this assumption using ${\small DORIAN}$, a newly developed full-sky ray-tracing scheme applied to high-resolution mass-shell outputs of the two largest simulations in the MillenniumTNG suite, each with a 3000 Mpc box containing almost 1.1 trillion cold dark matter particles in addition to 16.7 billion particles representing massive neutrinos. We examine simple two-point statistics like the angular power spectrum of the convergence field, as well as statistics sensitive to higher order correlations such as peak and minimum statistics, void statistics, and Minkowski functionals of the convergence maps. Overall, we find only small differences between the Born approximation and a full ray-tracing treatment. While these are negligibly small at power-spectrum level, some higher order statistics show more sizable effects; ray-tracing is necessary to achieve percent level precision. At the resolution reached here, full-sky maps with 0.8 billion pixels and an angular resolution of 0.43 arcmin, we find that interpolation accuracy can introduce appreciable errors in ray-tracing results. We therefore implemented an interpolation method based on nonuniform fast Fourier transforms (NUFFT) along with more traditional methods. Bilinear interpolation introduces significant smoothing, while nearest grid point sampling agrees well with NUFFT, at least for our fiducial source redshift, $z_s=1.0$, and for the 1 arcmin smoothing we use for higher-order statistics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Like many areas of astrophysics and cosmology, the Vera C. Rubin Observatory will be transformational for almost all the applications of strong lensing, thanks to the dramatic increase in the number of known strong lenses by two orders of magnitude or more and the readily available time-domain data for the lenses with transient sources. In this article, we provide an overview of the forecasted number of discovered lenses of different types and describe the primary science cases these large lens samples will enable. We provide an updated forecast on the joint constraint for the dark energy equation-of-state parameters, $w_0$ and $w_a$, from combining all strong lensing probes of dark energy. We update the previous forecast from the Rubin Observatory Dark Energy Science Collaboration's Science Review Document by adding two new crucial strong lensing samples: lensed Type Ia supernovae and single-deflector lenses with measured stellar kinematics. Finally, we describe the current and near-future activities and collaborative efforts within the strong lensing community in preparation for the arrival of the first real dataset from Rubin in early 2026.</description>

      <title>Overtone Transition $2\nu_1$ of $\text{HCO}^+$ and $\text{HOC}^+$: Origin, Radiative Lifetime, Collisional Quenching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present spectra of the first overtone vibration transition of $\text{C-H}$/$\text{O-H}$ stretch ($2\nu_1$) in $\text{HCO}^+$ and $\text{HOC}^+$, recorded using a laser induced reaction action scheme inside a cryogenic 22 pole radio frequency trap. Band origins have been located at 6078.68411(19) and 6360.17630(26) $\text{cm}^{-1}$, respectively. We introduce a technique based on mass selective ejection from the ion trap for recording background free action spectra. Varying the number density of the neutral action scheme reactant ($\text{CO}_2$ and Ar, respectively) and collisional partner reactant inside the ion trap, permitted us to estimate the radiative lifetime of the state to be 1.53(34) and 1.22(34) ms, respectively, and the collisional quenching rates of $\text{HCO}^+$ ($2\nu_1$) with He, H$_2$, and N$_2$.</description>

      <title>E(2)-Equivariant Features in Machine Learning for Morphological Classification of Radio Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the growth of data from new radio telescope facilities, machine-learning approaches to the morphological classification of radio galaxies are increasingly being utilised. However, while widely employed deep-learning models using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are equivariant to translations within images, neither CNNs nor most other machine-learning approaches are equivariant to additional isometries of the Euclidean plane, such as rotations and reflections. Recent work has attempted to address this by using G-steerable CNNs, designed to be equivariant to a specified subset of 2-dimensional Euclidean, E(2), transformations. Although this approach improved model performance, the computational costs were a recognised drawback. Here we consider the use of directly extracted E(2)-equivariant features for the classification of radio galaxies. Specifically, we investigate the use of Minkowski functionals (MFs), Haralick features (HFs) and elliptical Fourier descriptors (EFDs). We show that, while these features do not perform equivalently well to CNNs in terms of accuracy, they are able to inform the classification of radio galaxies, requiring ~50 times less computational runtime. We demonstrate that MFs are the most informative, EFDs the least informative, and show that combinations of all three result in only incrementally improved performance, which we suggest is due to information overlap between feature sets.</description>

      <title>Jet formation in post-AGB binaries: Confronting cold magnetohydrodynamic disc wind wind models with observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aims: We consider cold self-similar magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) disc wind solutions to describe jets launching from the circumcompanion accretion discs in post-AGB binaries. Resulting predictions are matched to observations for five different post-AGB binaries. This both tests the physical validity of the MHD disc wind paradigm and reveals the accretion disc properties.
  Results: Many of the time-series' properties are reproduced well by the models, though systematic mismatches, such as overestimated rotation, remain. Four targets imply accretion discs that reach close to the secondary's stellar surface, while one is fitted with an unrealistically large inner radius of about 20 stellar radii. Some fits imply inner disc temperatures over 10 000 K, seemingly discrepant with a previous observational estimate from H band interferometry. This estimate is, however, shown to be biased. Fitted mass-accretion rates range from about 10^-6 to 10^-3 solar masses per year. Relative to jets launched from young stellar objects (YSOs), all targets prefer winds with higher ejection efficiencies, lower magnetizations and thicker discs.
  Conclusions: Our models show that current cold MHD disc wind solutions can explain many of the jet-related Balmer alpha features seen in post-AGB binaries, though systematic discrepancies remain. This includes, but is not limited to, overestimated rotation and underestimated post-AGB circumbinary disc lifetimes. The consideration of thicker discs and the inclusion of irradiation from the post-AGB primary, leading to warm magnetothermal wind launching, might alleviate these.</description>

      <title>JWST Measurements of Neutral Hydrogen Fractions and Ionized Bubble Sizes at $z=7-12$ Obtained with Ly$\alpha$ Damping Wing Absorptions in 27 Bright Continuum Galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.00487v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present volume-averaged neutral hydrogen fractions $x_{\rm \HI}$ and ionized bubble radii $R_{\rm b}$ measured with Ly$\alpha$ damping wing absorption of galaxies at the epoch of reionization. We combine JWST/NIRSpec spectra taken by CEERS, GO-1433, DDT-2750, and JADES programs, and obtain a sample containing 27 bright UV-continuum ($M_{\rm UV}&lt;-18.5~{\rm mag}$) galaxies at $7&lt;z&lt;12$. We construct 4 composite spectra binned by redshift, and find the clear evolution of softening break towards high redshift at the rest-frame $1216$ {\AA}, suggesting the increase of Ly$\alpha$ damping wing absorption. We estimate Ly$\alpha$ damping wing absorption in the galaxy spectra with realistic templates including Ly$\alpha$ emission and circum-galactic medium absorptions. Assuming the standard inside-out reionization picture having an ionized bubble with radius $R_b$ around a galaxy embedded in the intergalactic medium with $x_{\rm \HI}$, we obtain $x_{\rm \HI}$ ($R_{\rm b}$) values generally increasing (decreasing) from $x_{\rm \HI}={0.53}^{+0.18}_{-0.47}$ to ${0.92}^{+0.08}_{-0.10}$ ($\log R_{\rm b}={1.67}^{+0.14}_{-0.16}$ to ${-0.69}^{+0.89}_{-0.24}$ comoving Mpc) at redshift $7.12^{+0.06}_{-0.08}$ to $9.91^{+1.49}_{-1.15}$. The redshift evolution of $x_{\rm \HI}$ indicates a moderately late reionization history consistent with the one previously suggested from the electron scattering of cosmic microwave background and the evolution of UV luminosity function with an escape fraction $f_{\rm esc}\sim 0.2$. Our ${R_{\rm b}}$ measurements suggest that bubble sizes could be up to a few dex larger than the cosmic average values estimated by analytic calculations for a given $x_{\rm \HI}$, while our $R_{\rm b}$ measurements are roughly comparable with the values for merged ionized bubbles around bright galaxies predicted by recent numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Figuring Out Gas &amp; Galaxies In Enzo (FOGGIE) VII: The (Dis)Assembly of Stellar Halos</title>

Abstract: Over the next decade, the astronomical community will be commissioning multiple wide-field observatories well-suited for studying stellar halos in both integrated light and resolved stars. In preparation for this, we use five high-resolution cosmological simulations of Milky Way-like galaxies from the FOGGIE suite to explore the properties and components of stellar halos. These simulations are run with high time (5 Myr) and stellar mass (1000 M$_\odot$) resolution to better model the properties and origins of low density regions like stellar halos. We find that the FOGGIE stellar halos have masses, metallicity gradients, and surface brightness profiles that are consistent with observations. In agreement with other simulations, the FOGGIE stellar halos receive 30-40% of their mass from in situ stars. However, this population is more centrally concentrated in the FOGGIE simulations and therefore does not contribute excess light to the halo outskirts. The remaining stars are accreted from 10-50 other galaxies, with the majority of the accreted mass originating in 2-4 galaxies. While the inner halo ($r&lt;50$ kpc) of each FOGGIE galaxy has a large number of contributors, the halo outskirts of three of the five galaxies are primarily made up of stars from only a few contributors. We predict that upcoming wide-field observatories, like the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, will probe stellar halos around Milky Way-like galaxies out to ~100 kpc in integrated light and will be able to distinguish the debris of dwarf galaxies with extended star formation histories from the underlying halo with resolved color-magnitude diagrams.</description>

      <title>MIDIS: Unveiling the Role of Strong Ha-emitters during the Epoch of Reionization with JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15671v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By using the ultra-deep \textit{JWST}/MIRI image at 5.6 $\mu m$ in the Hubble eXtreme Deep Field, we constrain the role of strong H$\alpha$-emitters (HAEs) during Cosmic Reionization at $z\simeq7-8$. Our sample of HAEs is comprised of young ($&lt;35\;\rm Myr$) galaxies, except for one single galaxy ($\approx 300\;\rm Myr$), with low stellar masses ($\lesssim 10^{9}\;\rm M_{\odot}$). These HAEs show a wide range of UV-$\beta$ slopes, with a median value of $\beta = -2.15\pm0.21$ which broadly correlates with stellar mass. We estimate the ionizing photon production efficiency ($\xi_{ion,0}$) of these sources (assuming $f_{esc,LyC} = 0\%$), which yields a median value $\rm log_{10}(\xi_{ion,0}/(Hz\;erg^{-1})) = 25.50^{+0.10}_{-0.12}$. We show that $\xi_{ion,0}$ positively correlates with EW$_{0}$(H$\alpha$) and specific star formation rate (sSFR). Instead $\xi_{ion,0}$ weakly anti-correlates with stellar mass and $\beta$. Based on the $\beta$ values, we predict $f_{esc, LyC}=4\%^{+3}_{-2}$, which results in $\rm log_{10}(\xi_{ion}/(Hz\;erg^{-1})) = 25.55^{+0.11}_{-0.13}$. Considering this and related findings from the literature, we find a mild evolution of $\xi_{ion}$with redshift. Additionally, our results suggest that these HAEs require only modest escape fractions ($f_{esc, rel}$) of 6$-$15\% to reionize their surrounding intergalactic medium. By only considering the contribution of these HAEs, we estimated their total ionizing emissivity ($\dot{N}_{ion}$) as $\dot{N}_{ion} = 10^{50.53 \pm 0.45}; \text{s}^{-1}\text{Mpc}^{-3}$. When comparing their $\dot{N}_{ion}$ with "non-H$\alpha$ emitter" galaxies across the same redshift range, we find that that strong, young, and low-mass emitters may have played an important role during Cosmic Reionization.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the hidden universe with JWST: The contribution of dust-obscured galaxies to the stellar mass function at $z\sim3-8$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03787v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the advent of JWST, we can probe the rest-frame optical emission of galaxies at $z&gt;3$ with high sensitivity and spatial resolution, making it possible to accurately characterise red, optically-faint galaxies and thus move towards a more complete census of the galaxy population at high redshifts. To this end, we present a sample of 148 massive, dusty galaxies from the JWST/CEERS survey, colour-selected using solely JWST bands. With deep JWST/NIRCam data from 1.15$\mu$m to 4.44$\mu$m and ancillary HST/ACS and WFC3 data, we determine the physical properties of our sample using spectral energy distribution fitting with BAGPIPES. We demonstrate that our selection method efficiently identifies massive ($\mathrm{\langle \log M_\star/M_\odot \rangle \sim 10}$) and dusty ($\mathrm{\langle A_V\rangle \sim 2.7\ mag}$) sources, with a majority at $z&gt;3$ and predominantly lying on the galaxy main-sequence. The main results of this work are the stellar mass functions (SMF) of red, optically-faint galaxies from redshifts between $3&lt;z&lt;8$: these galaxies make up a significant relative fraction of the pre-JWST total SMF at $3&lt;z&lt;4$ and $4&lt;z&lt;6$, and dominate the high-mass end of the pre-JWST SMF at $6&lt;z&lt;8$, suggesting that our census of the galaxy population needs amendment at these epochs. While larger areas need to be surveyed in the future, our results suggest already that the integrated stellar mass density at $\mathrm{\log M_\star/M_\odot\geq9.25}$ may have been underestimated in pre-JWST studies by up to $\sim$15-20\% at $z\sim3-6$, and up to $\sim$45\% at $z\sim6-8$, indicating the rapid onset of obscured stellar mass assembly in the early universe.</description>

      <title>GA-NIFS: The core of an extremely massive proto-cluster at the Epoch of Reionization probed with JWST/NIRSpec</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.00899v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The SPT0311-58 system resides in a massive dark matter halo at z ~ 6.9. It hosts two dusty galaxies (E and W) with a combined star formation rate of ~3500 Msun/yr. Its surrounding field exhibits an overdensity of sub-mm sources, making it a candidate proto-cluster.
  We use spatially-resolved spectroscopy provided by the JWST/NIRSpec Integral Field Unit (IFU) to probe a field of view (FoV) ~ 17 x 17 kpc^2 around this object.
  These observations have revealed ten new galaxies at z ~ 6.9, characterised by dynamical masses spanning from ~10^9 to 10^10 Msun and a range in radial velocities of ~ 1500 km/s, in addition to the already known E and W galaxies. The implied large number density, and the wide spread in velocities, indicate that SPT0311-58 is at the core of a proto-cluster, immersed in a very massive dark matter halo of ~ 5 x 10^12 Msun. Hence, it represents the most massive proto-cluster ever found at the EoR. We also study the dynamical stage of the system and find that it likely is not fully virialised.
  The galaxies exhibit a great diversity of properties showing a range of evolutionary stages. We derive their ongoing Ha-based unobscured SFR, and find that its contribution to the total SF varies significantly across the galaxies in the system. Their ionization conditions range from those typical of field galaxies at similar redshift recently studied with JWST to those found in more evolved objects at lower z. The metallicity spans more than 0.8 dex across the FoV, reaching nearly solar values in some cases. The detailed IFU spectroscopy of the E galaxy reveals that it is actively assembling its stellar mass, showing sub-kpc inhomogeneities, and a metallicity gradient that can be explained by accretion of low metallicity gas from the IGM. The kinematic maps indicate departures from regular rotation, high turbulence, and a possible pre-collision minor merger. (Abridged)</description>

      <title>Predicting the Ages of Galaxies with an Artificial Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09857v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new method of predicting the ages of galaxies using a machine learning (ML) algorithm with the goal of providing an alternative to traditional methods. We aim to match the ability of traditional models to predict the ages of galaxies by training an artificial neural network (ANN) to recognise the relationships between the equivalent widths of spectral indices and the mass-weighted ages of galaxies estimated by the MAGPHYS model in data release 3 (DR3) of the Galaxy and Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey. We discuss the optimisation of our hyperparameters extensively and investigate the application of a custom loss function to reduce the influence of errors in our input data. To quantify the quality of our predictions we calculate the mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE) and R^2 score for which we find MSE = 0.020, MAE = 0.108 and R^2 = 0.530. We find our predicted ages have a similar distribution with standard deviation sigma_p = 0.182 compared with the GAMA true ages sigma_t = 0.207. This is achieved in approximately 23s to train our ANN on an 11th Gen Intel Core i9-11900H running at 2.50GHz using 32GB of RAM. We report our results for when light-weighted ages are used to train the ANN, which improves the accuracy of the predictions. Finally, we detail an evaluation of our method relating to physical properties and compare with other ML techniques to encourage future applications of ML techniques in Astronomy.</description>

      <title>ALMA-IMF XIII: N$_2$H$^+$ kinematic analysis on the intermediate protocluster G353.41</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07363v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ALMA-IMF Large Program provides multi-tracer observations of 15 Galactic massive protoclusters at matched sensitivity and spatial resolution. We focus on the dense gas kinematics of the G353.41 protocluster traced by N$_2$H$^+$ (1$-$0), with an spatial resolution $\sim$0.02 pc. G353.41, at a distance of $\sim$2 kpc, has a mass of $\sim$2500 M$_{\odot}$ within $1.3\times1.3$ pc$^2$. We extract the N$_2$H$^+$ isolated line component and we decompose it by fitting up to 3 Gaussian velocity components. This allows us to identify velocity structures that are impossible to identify in the traditional position-velocity diagram. We identify multiple velocity gradients on large ($\sim$1 pc) and small scales ($\sim$0.2 pc). We find good agreement between the N$_2$H$^+$ velocities and the previously reported DCN core velocities, suggesting that cores are kinematically coupled to the dense gas in which they form. We measure 9 converging ``V-shaped'' velocity gradients ($\sim20$ km/s/pc), located in filaments, which are sometimes associated with cores near their point of convergence. The average inflow timescale is $\sim67$ kyr, or about twice the free-fall time of cores in the same area ($\sim33$ kyr) but substantially shorter than protostar lifetime estimates ($\sim$0.5 Myr). We derive mass accretion rates in the range of $(0.35-8.77)\,\times\,10^{-4}$ M$_{\odot}$/yr. This feeding might lead to further filament collapse and formation of new cores. We suggest that the protocluster is collapsing on large scales, but the velocity signature of collapse is slow compared to pure free-fall. These data are consistent with a comparatively slow global protocluster contraction under gravity, and faster core formation within, suggesting the formation of multiple generations of stars over the protocluster lifetime.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic Confirmation of an Ultra-Massive Galaxy in a Protocluster at $z \sim 4.9$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16036v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present spectroscopic confirmation of an ultra-massive galaxy (UMG) with $\log(M_\star/M_\odot) = 10.98 \pm 0.07$ at $z_\mathrm{spec} = 4.8947$ in the Extended Groth Strip (EGS), based on deep observations of Ly$\alpha$ emission with Keck/DEIMOS. The ultra-massive galaxy (UMG-28740) is the most massive member in one of the most significant overdensities in the EGS, with four additional photometric members with $\log(M_\star/M_\odot) &gt; 10.5$ within $R_\mathrm{proj} \sim 1$ cMpc. The Ly$\alpha$ profile is highly asymmetric ($A_f = 3.56$), suggesting the presence of neutral gas within the interstellar medium, circumgalactic medium, or via AGN-driven outflows. Spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting using a large suite of star formation histories and two sets of high-quality photometry from ground- and space-based facilities consistently estimates the stellar mass of UMG-28740 to be $\log(M_\star/M_\odot) \sim 11$ with a small standard deviation between measurements ($\sigma = 0.07$). While the best-fit SED models agree on stellar mass, we find discrepancies in the estimated star formation rate for UMG-28740, resulting in either a star-forming or quiescent system. JWST/NIRCam photometry of UMG-28740 strongly favors a quiescent scenario, demonstrating the need for high-quality mid-IR observations. Assuming the galaxy to be quiescent, UMG-28740 formed the bulk of its stars at $z &gt; 10$ and is quenching at $z \sim 8$, resulting in a high star formation efficiency at high redshift ($\epsilon \sim 0.2$ at $z \sim 5$ and $\epsilon \gtrsim 1$ at $z \gtrsim 8$). As the most massive galaxy in its protocluster environment, UMG-28740 is a unique example of the impossibly early galaxy problem.</description>

      <title>X-ray View of Little Red Dots: Do They Host Supermassive Black Holes?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19010v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The discovery of Little Red Dots (LRDs) -- a population of compact, high-redshift, dust-reddened galaxies -- is one of the most surprising results from JWST. However, the nature of LRDs is still debated: does the near-infrared emission originate from accreting supermassive black holes (SMBHs), or intense star formation? In this work, we utilize ultra-deep Chandra observations and study LRDs residing behind the lensing galaxy cluster, Abell~2744. We probe the X-ray emission from individual galaxies but find that they remain undetected and provide SMBH mass upper limits of $\lesssim(1.5-16)\times10^{6}~\rm{M_{\odot}}$ assuming Eddington limited accretion. To increase the signal-to-noise ratios, we conduct a stacking analysis of the full sample with a total lensed exposure time of $\approx87$~Ms. We also bin the galaxies based on their stellar mass, lensing magnification, and detected broad-line H$\alpha$ emission. For the LRDs exhibiting broad-line H$\alpha$ emission, there is a hint of a stacked signal ($\sim2.6\sigma$), corresponding to a SMBH mass of $\sim3.2\times10^{6}~\rm{M_{\odot}}$. Assuming unobscured, Eddington-limited accretion, this BH mass is at least 1.5 orders of magnitude lower than that inferred from virial mass estimates using JWST spectra. Given galaxy-dominated stellar mass estimates, our results imply that LRDs do not host over-massive SMBHs and/or accrete at a few percent of their Eddington limit. However, alternative stellar mass estimates may still support that LRDs host over-massive BHs. The significant discrepancy between the JWST and Chandra data hints that the scaling relations used to infer the SMBH mass from the H$\alpha$ line and virial relations may not be applicable for high-redshift LRDs.</description>

      <title>Photometric Classification of Stars Around the Milky Way's Central Black Hole: I. Central Parsec</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04166v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The presence of young massive stars in the Galactic Centre (GC) raises questions about star formation near the black hole Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*). Additionally, the initial mass function (IMF) in this region appears different from the standard Salpeter/Kroupa law. Extreme extinction and crowding limit our understanding of the stellar population, with spectroscopic data available only for selected bright sources. We aim to improve knowledge about the distribution and IMF of young, massive stars near Sgr A*. Using intermediate band (IB) photometry, we identify candidates for massive young stars through Bayesian inference, a neural network, and a gradient-boosted trees algorithm. We obtained spectral energy distributions for 6590 stars, 1181 of which have been previously classified spectroscopically. We identify 351 stars classified as early types by all three methods, including 155 newly identified candidates. The radial density profiles for late and early-type stars fit broken power laws, with a break radius of 9.2 +- 0.6'' for early-type stars. Late-type stars show a core-like distribution around Sgr A*, while early-type stars' density increases steeply towards the black hole. We infer a top-heavy IMF of young stars near Sgr A* (R &lt; 9''), with a power-law of 1.6 +- 0.1. At greater distances, a standard Salpeter/Kroupa IMF fits the data. IB photometry also constrains the metallicities of late-type stars, estimating metallicities for over 600 stars. The IMF variation with radial distance suggests different star formation mechanisms, with a top-heavy IMF near Sgr A* consistent with disc star formation.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background from Highly-Eccentric Stellar-Mass Binaries in the Milli-hertz Band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04832v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many gravitational wave (GW) sources are expected to have non-negligible eccentricity in the millihertz band. These highly eccentric compact object binaries may commonly serve as a progenitor stage of GW mergers, particularly in dynamical channels where environmental perturbations bring a binary with large initial orbital separation into a close pericenter passage, leading to efficient GW emission and a final merger. This work examines the stochastic GW background from highly eccentric ($e\gtrsim 0.9$), stellar-mass sources in the mHz band. Our findings suggest that these binaries can contribute a substantial GW power spectrum, potentially exceeding the LISA instrumental noise at $\sim 3-7$~mHz. This stochastic background is likely to be dominated by eccentric sources within the Milky Way, thus introducing anisotropy and time dependence in LISA's detection. However, given efficient search strategies to identify GW transients from highly eccentric binaries, the unresolvable noise level can be substantially lower, approaching $\sim 2$ orders of magnitude below the LISA noise curve. Therefore, we highlight the importance of characterizing stellar-mass GW sources with extreme eccentricity, especially their transient GW signals in the millihertz band.</description>

Abstract: Context: The light element (anti-)correlations shown by globular clusters (GCs) are the main spectroscopic signature of multiple stellar populations. These internal abundance variations provide us with fundamental constraints on the formation mechanism of stellar clusters. Aims: Using Gaia-ESO, the largest and most homogeneous survey of open clusters (OCs), we intend to check whether these stellar aggregates display the same patterns. Based on previous studies of many GCs, several young and massive clusters in the Magellanic Clouds, as well as a few OCs, we do not expect to find any anti-correlation, given the low mass of Milky Way OCs. Methods: We used the results based on UVES spectra of stars in Gaia-ESO to derive the distribution of Na and O abundances and seevwhether they show an unexplained dispersion or whether they are anti-correlated. By selecting only high-probability members with high-precision stellar parameters, we ended up with more than 700 stars in 74 OCs. We examined the O-Na distribution in 28 OCsvwith at least 4 stars available as well as the Na distribution in 24 OCs, with at least 10 stars available. Results: We find that the distribution of Na abundances is compatible with a single-value population, within the errors. The fewvapparent exceptions can be explained by differences in the evolutionary phase (main sequence and giant post first dredge-up episode) or by difficulties in analysing low gravity giants. We did not find any indication of an Na-O anti-correlation in any of the clusters for which O has been derived. Conclusions: Based on the very small spread we find, OCs maintain the status of single stellar populations. However, a definitive answer requires studying more elements and larger samples covering different evolutionary phases. This will be possible with the next generation of large surveys</description>
