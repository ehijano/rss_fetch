      <title>The Asymptotic Cost of Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a measure of learning efficiency for non-finite state spaces. We characterize the complexity of a learning problem by the metric entropy of its state space. We then describe how learning efficiency is determined by this measure of complexity. This is, then, applied to two models where agents learn high-dimensional states.</description>

      <title>Monetizing digital content with network effects: A mechanism-design approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We design the profit-maximizing mechanism to sell an excludable and non-rival good with network effects. Buyers have heterogeneous private values that depend on how many others also consume the good. We characterize an algorithm that implements the optimal allocation in dominant strategies. We apply our insights to digital content creation, and we are able to rationalize features seen in monetization schemes in this industry such as voluntary contributions, community subsidies, and exclusivity bids.</description>

      <title>Stochastic dominance for super heavy-tailed random variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a class of super heavy-tailed distributions and establish the inequality that any weighted average of independent and identically distributed super heavy-tailed random variables stochastically dominates one such random variable. We show that many commonly used extremely heavy-tailed (i.e., infinite-mean) distributions, such as the Pareto, Fr\'echet, and Burr distributions, belong to the class of super heavy-tailed distributions. The established stochastic dominance relation is further generalized to allow negatively dependent or non-identically distributed random variables. In particular, the weighted average of non-identically distributed random variables stochastically dominates their distribution mixtures. Applications of these results in portfolio diversification, goods bundling, and inventory management are discussed. Remarkably, in the presence of super heavy-tailedness, the results that hold for finite-mean models in these applications are flipped.</description>

      <title>Forecasting with Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.15062v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Systematically biased forecasts are typically interpreted as evidence of forecasters' irrationality and/or asymmetric loss. In this paper we propose an alternative explanation: when forecasts inform economic policy decisions, and the resulting actions affect the realization of the forecast target itself, forecasts may be optimally biased even under quadratic loss. The result arises in environments in which the forecaster is uncertain about the decision maker's reaction to the forecast, which is presumably the case in most applications. We illustrate the empirical relevance of our theory by reviewing some stylized properties of Green Book inflation forecasts and relating them to the predictions from our model. Our results point out that the presence of policy feedback poses a challenge to traditional tests of forecast rationality.</description>
