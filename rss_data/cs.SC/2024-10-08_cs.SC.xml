      <title>Learning to Solve Abstract Reasoning Problems with Neurosymbolic Program Synthesis and Task Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability to think abstractly and reason by analogy is a prerequisite to rapidly adapt to new conditions, tackle newly encountered problems by decomposing them, and synthesize knowledge to solve problems comprehensively. We present TransCoder, a method for solving abstract problems based on neural program synthesis, and conduct a comprehensive analysis of decisions made by the generative module of the proposed architecture. At the core of TransCoder is a typed domain-specific language, designed to facilitate feature engineering and abstract reasoning. In training, we use the programs that failed to solve tasks to generate new tasks and gather them in a synthetic dataset. As each synthetic task created in this way has a known associated program (solution), the model is trained on them in supervised mode. Solutions are represented in a transparent programmatic form, which can be inspected and verified. We demonstrate TransCoder's performance using the Abstract Reasoning Corpus dataset, for which our framework generates tens of thousands of synthetic problems with corresponding solutions and facilitates systematic progress in learning.</description>

      <title>On the dimension of the solution space of linear difference equations over the ring of infinite sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02219v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a linear difference equation with the coefficients being computable sequences, we establish algorithmic undecidability of the problem of determining the dimension of the solution space including the case when some additional prior information on the dimension is available.</description>

      <title>Persistent components in Canny's Generalized Characteristic Polynomial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01948v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When using resultants for elimination, one standard issue is that the resultant vanishes if the variety contains components of dimension larger than the expected dimension. J. Canny proposed an elegant construction, generalized characteristic polynomial, to address this issue by symbolically perturbing the system before the resultant computation. Such perturbed resultant would typically involve artefact components only loosely related to the geometry of the variety of interest. For removing these components, J.M. Rojas proposed to take the greatest common divisor of the results of two different perturbations. In this paper, we investigate this construction, and show that the extra components persistent under taking different perturbations must come either from singularities or from positive-dimensional fibers.</description>

      <title>Algorithm for globally identifiable reparametrizations of ODEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00762v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Structural global parameter identifiability indicates whether one can determine a parameter's value in an ODE model from given inputs and outputs. If a given model has parameters for which there is exactly one value, such parameters are called globally identifiable. Given an ODE model involving not globally identifiable parameters, first we transform the system into one with locally identifiable parameters. As a main contribution of this paper, then we present a procedure for replacing, if possible, the ODE model with an equivalent one that has globally identifiable parameters. We first derive this as an algorithm for one-dimensional ODE models and then reuse this approach for higher-dimensional models.</description>

      <title>Symbolic-numeric algorithm for parameter estimation in discrete-time models with $\exp$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16220v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamic models describe phenomena across scientific disciplines, yet to make these models useful in application the unknown parameter values of the models must be determined. Discrete-time dynamic models are widely used to model biological processes, but it is often difficult to determine these parameters. In this paper, we propose a symbolic-numeric approach for parameter estimation in discrete-time models that involve univariate non-algebraic (locally) analytic functions such as exp. We illustrate the performance (precision) of our approach by applying our approach to two archetypal discrete-time models in biology (the flour beetle 'LPA' model and discrete Lotka-Volterra competition model). Unlike optimization-based methods, our algorithm guarantees to find all solutions of the parameter values up to a specified precision given time-series data for the measured variables provided that there are finitely many parameter values that fit the data and that the used polynomial system solver can find all roots of the associated polynomial system with interval coefficients.</description>
