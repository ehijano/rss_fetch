      <title>SEER: Semantic Enhancement and Emotional Reasoning Network for Multimodal Fake News Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous studies on multimodal fake news detection mainly focus on the alignment and integration of cross-modal features, as well as the application of text-image consistency. However, they overlook the semantic enhancement effects of large multimodal models and pay little attention to the emotional features of news. In addition, people find that fake news is more inclined to contain negative emotions than real ones. Therefore, we propose a novel Semantic Enhancement and Emotional Reasoning (SEER) Network for multimodal fake news detection. We generate summarized captions for image semantic understanding and utilize the products of large multimodal models for semantic enhancement. Inspired by the perceived relationship between news authenticity and emotional tendencies, we propose an expert emotional reasoning module that simulates real-life scenarios to optimize emotional features and infer the authenticity of news. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our SEER over state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <title>A Novel APVD Steganography Technique Incorporating Pseudorandom Pixel Selection for Robust Image Security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Steganography is the process of embedding secret information discreetly within a carrier, ensuring secure exchange of confidential data. The Adaptive Pixel Value Differencing (APVD) steganography method, while effective, encounters certain challenges like the "unused blocks" issue. This problem can cause a decrease in security, compromise the embedding capacity, and lead to lower visual quality. This research presents a novel steganographic strategy that integrates APVD with pseudorandom pixel selection to effectively mitigate these issues. The results indicate that the new method outperforms existing techniques in aspects of security, data hiding capacity, and the preservation of image quality. Empirical results reveal that the combination of APVD with pseudorandom pixel selection significantly enhances key image quality metrics such as Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), Universal Image Quality Index (UIQ), and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), surpassing other contemporary methods in performance. The newly proposed method is versatile, able to handle a variety of cover and secret images in both color and grayscale, thereby ensuring secure data transmission without compromising the aesthetic quality of the image.</description>

      <title>HeCoFuse: Cross-Modal Complementary V2X Cooperative Perception with Heterogeneous Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-world Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) cooperative perception systems often operate under heterogeneous sensor configurations due to cost constraints and deployment variability across vehicles and infrastructure. This heterogeneity poses significant challenges for feature fusion and perception reliability. To address these issues, we propose HeCoFuse, a unified framework designed for cooperative perception across mixed sensor setups where nodes may carry Cameras (C), LiDARs (L), or both. By introducing a hierarchical fusion mechanism that adaptively weights features through a combination of channel-wise and spatial attention, HeCoFuse can tackle critical challenges such as cross-modality feature misalignment and imbalanced representation quality. In addition, an adaptive spatial resolution adjustment module is employed to balance computational cost and fusion effectiveness. To enhance robustness across different configurations, we further implement a cooperative learning strategy that dynamically adjusts fusion type based on available modalities. Experiments on the real-world TUMTraf-V2X dataset demonstrate that HeCoFuse achieves 43.22% 3D mAP under the full sensor configuration (LC+LC), outperforming the CoopDet3D baseline by 1.17%, and reaches an even higher 43.38% 3D mAP in the L+LC scenario, while maintaining 3D mAP in the range of 21.74% to 43.38% across nine heterogeneous sensor configurations. These results, validated by our first-place finish in the CVPR 2025 DriveX challenge, establish HeCoFuse as the current state-of-the-art on TUM-Traf V2X dataset while demonstrating robust performance across diverse sensor deployments.</description>

      <title>DailyLLM: Context-Aware Activity Log Generation Using Multi-Modal Sensors and LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rich and context-aware activity logs facilitate user behavior analysis and health monitoring, making them a key research focus in ubiquitous computing. The remarkable semantic understanding and generation capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently created new opportunities for activity log generation. However, existing methods continue to exhibit notable limitations in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and semantic richness. To address these challenges, we propose DailyLLM. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first log generation and summarization system that comprehensively integrates contextual activity information across four dimensions: location, motion, environment, and physiology, using only sensors commonly available on smartphones and smartwatches. To achieve this, DailyLLM introduces a lightweight LLM-based framework that integrates structured prompting with efficient feature extraction to enable high-level activity understanding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DailyLLM outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) log generation methods and can be efficiently deployed on personal computers and Raspberry Pi. Utilizing only a 1.5B-parameter LLM model, DailyLLM achieves a 17% improvement in log generation BERTScore precision compared to the 70B-parameter SOTA baseline, while delivering nearly 10x faster inference speed.</description>

      <title>TimeNeRF: Building Generalizable Neural Radiance Fields across Time from Few-Shot Input Views</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present TimeNeRF, a generalizable neural rendering approach for rendering novel views at arbitrary viewpoints and at arbitrary times, even with few input views. For real-world applications, it is expensive to collect multiple views and inefficient to re-optimize for unseen scenes. Moreover, as the digital realm, particularly the metaverse, strives for increasingly immersive experiences, the ability to model 3D environments that naturally transition between day and night becomes paramount. While current techniques based on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have shown remarkable proficiency in synthesizing novel views, the exploration of NeRF's potential for temporal 3D scene modeling remains limited, with no dedicated datasets available for this purpose. To this end, our approach harnesses the strengths of multi-view stereo, neural radiance fields, and disentanglement strategies across diverse datasets. This equips our model with the capability for generalizability in a few-shot setting, allows us to construct an implicit content radiance field for scene representation, and further enables the building of neural radiance fields at any arbitrary time. Finally, we synthesize novel views of that time via volume rendering. Experiments show that TimeNeRF can render novel views in a few-shot setting without per-scene optimization. Most notably, it excels in creating realistic novel views that transition smoothly across different times, adeptly capturing intricate natural scene changes from dawn to dusk.</description>

      <title>Cross-modal Causal Intervention for Alzheimer's Disease Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) serves as a prodromal stage of Alzheimer's Disease (AD), where early identification and intervention can effectively slow the progression to dementia. However, diagnosing AD remains a significant challenge in neurology due to the confounders caused mainly by the selection bias of multimodal data and the complex relationships between variables. To address these issues, we propose a novel visual-language causal intervention framework named Alzheimer's Disease Prediction with Cross-modal Causal Intervention (ADPC) for diagnostic assistance. Our ADPC employs large language model (LLM) to summarize clinical data under strict templates, maintaining structured text outputs even with incomplete or unevenly distributed datasets. The ADPC model utilizes Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), functional MRI (fMRI) images and textual data generated by LLM to classify participants into Cognitively Normal (CN), MCI, and AD categories. Because of the presence of confounders, such as neuroimaging artifacts and age-related biomarkers, non-causal models are likely to capture spurious input-output correlations, generating less reliable results. Our framework implicitly eliminates confounders through causal intervention. Experimental results demonstrate the outstanding performance of our method in distinguishing CN/MCI/AD cases, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) metrics across most evaluation metrics. The study showcases the potential of integrating causal reasoning with multi-modal learning for neurological disease diagnosis.</description>

      <title>Align Your Rhythm: Generating Highly Aligned Dance Poses with Gating-Enhanced Rhythm-Aware Feature Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17340v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Automatically generating natural, diverse and rhythmic human dance movements driven by music is vital for virtual reality and film industries. However, generating dance that naturally follows music remains a challenge, as existing methods lack proper beat alignment and exhibit unnatural motion dynamics. In this paper, we propose Danceba, a novel framework that leverages gating mechanism to enhance rhythm-aware feature representation for music-driven dance generation, which achieves highly aligned dance poses with enhanced rhythmic sensitivity. Specifically, we introduce Phase-Based Rhythm Extraction (PRE) to precisely extract rhythmic information from musical phase data, capitalizing on the intrinsic periodicity and temporal structures of music. Additionally, we propose Temporal-Gated Causal Attention (TGCA) to focus on global rhythmic features, ensuring that dance movements closely follow the musical rhythm. We also introduce Parallel Mamba Motion Modeling (PMMM) architecture to separately model upper and lower body motions along with musical features, thereby improving the naturalness and diversity of generated dance movements. Extensive experiments confirm that Danceba outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving significantly better rhythmic alignment and motion diversity.

      <title>Instruct-MusicGen: Unlocking Text-to-Music Editing for Music Language Models via Instruction Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18386v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-music editing, which employ text queries to modify music (e.g.\ by changing its style or adjusting instrumental components), present unique challenges and opportunities for AI-assisted music creation. Previous approaches in this domain have been constrained by the necessity to train specific editing models from scratch, which is both resource-intensive and inefficient; other research uses large language models to predict edited music, resulting in imprecise audio reconstruction. To Combine the strengths and address these limitations, we introduce Instruct-MusicGen, a novel approach that finetunes a pretrained MusicGen model to efficiently follow editing instructions such as adding, removing, or separating stems. Our approach involves a modification of the original MusicGen architecture by incorporating a text fusion module and an audio fusion module, which allow the model to process instruction texts and audio inputs concurrently and yield the desired edited music. Remarkably, Instruct-MusicGen only introduces 8% new parameters to the original MusicGen model and only trains for 5K steps, yet it achieves superior performance across all tasks compared to existing baselines, and demonstrates performance comparable to the models trained for specific tasks. This advancement not only enhances the efficiency of text-to-music editing but also broadens the applicability of music language models in dynamic music production environments.</description>

      <title>MuteSwap: Visual-informed Silent Video Identity Conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00498v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conventional voice conversion modifies voice characteristics from a source speaker to a target speaker, relying on audio input from both sides. However, this process becomes infeasible when clean audio is unavailable, such as in silent videos or noisy environments. In this work, we focus on the task of Silent Face-based Voice Conversion (SFVC), which does voice conversion entirely from visual inputs. i.e., given images of a target speaker and a silent video of a source speaker containing lip motion, SFVC generates speech aligning the identity of the target speaker while preserving the speech content in the source silent video. As this task requires generating intelligible speech and converting identity using only visual cues, it is particularly challenging. To address this, we introduce MuteSwap, a novel framework that employs contrastive learning to align cross-modality identities and minimize mutual information to separate shared visual features. Experimental results show that MuteSwap achieves impressive performance in both speech synthesis and identity conversion, especially under noisy conditions where methods dependent on audio input fail to produce intelligible results, demonstrating both the effectiveness of our training approach and the feasibility of SFVC.</description>
