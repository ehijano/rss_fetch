      <title>Capillary lubrication of a spherical particle near a fluid interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The lubricated motion of an object near a deformable boundary presents striking subtleties arising from the coupling between the elasticity of the boundary and lubricated flow, including but not limited to the emergence of a lift force acting on the object despite the zero Reynolds number. In this study, we characterize the hydrodynamic forces and torques felt by a sphere translating in close proximity to a fluid interface, separating the viscous medium of the sphere's motion from an infinitely-more-viscous medium. We employ lubrication theory and perform a perturbation analysis in capillary compliance. The dominant response of the interface owing to surface tension results in a long-ranged interface deformation, which leads to a modification of the forces and torques with respect to the rigid reference case, that we characterise in details with scaling arguments and numerical integrations.</description>

      <title>Enigmatic factor of 4/3 in electromagnetic momentum of a moving spherical capacitor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14884v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The electromagnetic energy-momentum of a moving charged spherical capacitor may be calculated by a 4-vector Lorentz transformation from the energy in the rest frame. However, energy-momentum of the moving system computed directly from electromagnetic fields yields extra terms; in particular a factor of 4/3 in momentum appears, similar to that encountered in the classical electron model, where this enigmatic factor has been a source of scourge for more than a century. There have been many attempts to eliminate this `unwanted' factor, noteworthy among them is a modification in electromagnetic field energy-momentum definition that has entered even standard textbooks. Here it is shown that in a moving charged spherical capacitor, some additional contributions to the electromagnetic energy-momentum arise naturally from electromagnetic forces in system or equivalently from terms in the Maxwell stress tensor; contributions that do not otherwise show up in 4-vector transformations. Furthermore, a similar factor of 4/3 in the momentum of a perfect fluid comprising a randomly moving ultra-relativistic gas molecules or an isotropic photon gas, filling an {\em uncharged} spherical capacitor in motion, appears owing to the contribution of pressure. Thus, genesis of the "enigmatic" factor of 4/3 can be traced to pressure or stress whose presence in the system may be of non-electromagnetic origin and where the proposed modifications in energy-momentum definition do not even come into picture. No modifications in the definitions of energy-momentum of moving fluids have ever been required; physics should be the same in electromagnetic case as well, implying there is nothing amiss in the standard definition of electromagnetic energy-momentum.</description>

      <title>Dynamical symmetries of supersymmetric oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.04747v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we describe the dynamical symmetries of classical supersymmetric oscillators, in one and two spatial (bosonic) dimensions. Our main ingredient is a generalized Poisson bracket, which is defined as a suitable classical counterpart to commutators and anticommutators. In one dimension, i.e., in the presence of one bosonic and one fermionic coordinate, the Hamiltonian admits a $U(1,1)$ symmetry, for which we explicitly compute the first integrals. It is found that suitable forms of the supercharges emerge in a natural way as fermionic conserved quantities. Following this, we describe classical supercharge operators based on the generalized Poisson bracket, and subsequently define supersymmetry transformations. We perform a straightforward generalization to two spatial dimensions, where the Hamiltonian has an overall $U(2,2)$ symmetry. We comment on plausible supersymmetric generalizations of the Pais-Uhlenbeck and isotonic oscillators, and also present the possibility of defining a generalized Nambu bracket within the classical formalism.</description>
