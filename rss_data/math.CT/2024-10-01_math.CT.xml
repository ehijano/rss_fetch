      <title>A comparison between weakly protomodular and protomodular objects in unital categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compare the concepts of protomodular and weakly protomodular objects within the context of unital categories. Our analysis demonstrates that these two notions are generally distinct. To establish this, we introduce left pseudocancellative unital magmas and characterise weakly protomodular objects within the variety of algebras they constitute. Subsequently, we present an example of a weakly protomodular object that is not protomodular in this category.</description>

      <title>Hall algebras via 2-Segal spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is an introduction to Hall algebras from the perspective of $2$-Segal spaces or decomposition spaces, as introduced by Dyckerhoff and Kapranov and G\'{a}lvez-Carrillo, Kock and Tonks, respectively. We explain how linearizations of the $2$-Segal space arising as the Waldhausen $\mathcal{S}_{\bullet}$-construction of a proto-exact category recover various previously known Hall algebras. We use the $2$-Segal perspective to study functoriality of the Hall algebra construction and explain how relative variants of $2$-Segal spaces lead naturally to representations of Hall algebras.</description>

      <title>Finite combinatorics implicit in the basic definitions of topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explain how to see finite combinatorics of preorders implicit in the {text} of basic topological definitions or arguments in (Bourbaki, General topology, Ch.I), and define a concise combinatorial notation such that complete definitions of connectedness, compactness, contractibility, having a generic point, subspace, closed subspace, fit into $2$ or $4$ bytes. This notation is homotopy theoretic in nature, and is based on the following observation:
  A number of basic properties of continuous maps and topological spaces are defined using a single category-theoretic operation, taking left or right orthogonal complement with respect to the Quillen lifting property, repeatedly applied to a simple example illustrating the definition or its failure. Moreover, for most of these definitions this example can be chosen to be a map of finite topological spaces (=preorders) of size at most $5$. This includes the properties of a space being connected, compact, contractible, discrete, having a generic point, and a map having dense image, being the inclusion of an (open or closed) subspace, or of a component into a disjoint union, and others. Our reformulations illustrate the generative power of the lifting property as a means of defining basic mathematical properties starting from their simplest or typical example. The exposition is accessible to a student.</description>

      <title>The decomposition space perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper provides an introduction to decomposition spaces and 2-Segal spaces, unifying the two perspectives. We begin by defining decomposition spaces using the active-inert factorization system on the simplicial category, and show their equivalence to 2-Segal spaces. Key results include the path space criterion, which characterizes decomposition spaces in terms of their upper and lower d\'ecalages, and the edgewise subdivision criterion. We also introduce free decomposition spaces arising from outer face complexes, providing a rich source of examples. Formal prerequisites are minimal -- readers should have a working knowledge of simplicial methods and basic category theory.</description>

      <title>Polynomial Universes and Dependent Types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Awodey, later with Newstead, showed how polynomial pseudomonads $(u,1,\Sigma)$ with extra structure (termed "natural models" by Awodey) hold within them the categorical semantics for dependent type theory. Their work presented these ideas clearly but ultimately led them outside of the category of polynomial functors in order to explain all of the structure possessed by such models of type theory.
  This paper builds off that work -- explicating the categorical semantics of dependent type theory by axiomatizing them \emph{entirely} in the language of polynomial functors. In order to handle the higher-categorical coherences required for such an explanation, we work with polynomial functors internally in the language of Homotopy Type Theory, which allows for higher-dimensional structures such as pseudomonads, etc. to be expressed purely in terms of the structure of a suitably-chosen $\infty$-category of polynomial functors. The move from set theory to Homotopy Type Theory thus has a twofold effect of enabling a simpler exposition of natural models, which is at the same time amenable to formalization in a proof assistant, such as Agda.
  Moreover, the choice to remain firmly within the setting of polynomial functors reveals many additional structures of natural models that were otherwise left implicit or not considered by Awodey \&amp; Newstead. Chief among these, we highlight the fact that every polynomial pseudomonad $(u,1,\Sigma)$ as above that is also equipped with structure to interpret dependent product types gives rise to a self-distributive law $u \triangleleft u\to u \triangleleft u$, which witnesses the usual distributive law of dependent products over dependent sums.</description>

      <title>Telescope conjecture via homological residue fields with applications to schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00601v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a big tt-category, we give a characterization of the Telescope Conjecture (TC) in terms of definable tensor-ideals generated by homological residue fields. We formulate a stalk-locality property of (TC) and prove that it holds in the case of the derived category of a quasi-compact quasi-separated scheme, strengthening a result \cite{HHZ21}. As an application, we find strong links between (TC) and separation properties of the adic topology on local rings. This allows us to recover known examples and counterexamples of when (TC) holds over a scheme, as well as to construct some new ones.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08082v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a ring $R$, we have a classical result stating that the ordinary category of modules is the abelianization of the category of augmented $R$-algebras. Analogously, using the framework of infinity categories and higher algebra, Francis showed that the infinity category of $R$-modules is the stabilization of the infinity category of augmented $R$-algebras. In this work we show a dual result for coalgebras over a cooperad $Q$: namely that given a coalgebra $C$, comodules over $C$ are the costabilization of coalgebras over $C$, which is the universal stable category with a finite colimit preserving functor to coalgebras over $C$.</description>

      <title>How the convex space-metric space compatability conditions determines Giry algebras on Polish spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14861v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There are two probability monads defined on the category of Polish spaces depending upon whether one uses measurable functions or continuous functions for the morphisms. In the first case the monad is called the $\mathcal{G}$-monad on standard Borel spaces, while the latter case yields the $\mathscr{P}$-monad on the category of Polish spaces. Given an arbitrary Polish space $X$ with a superconvex space structure we show there exist a $\mathcal{G}$-algebra ($\mathscr{P}$-algebra) on $X$ when $X$ satisfies the geometric convex space-metric space compatability condition $d_X(p x + (1-p) z, p y + (1-p) z) \le p\, d_X(x,y)$ for all points $x,y,z$ in $X$ and all $p \in [0,1]$. Every $\mathscr{P}$-algebra also specifies a $\mathcal{G}$-algebra but $\mathcal{G}$-algebras also arise from a discrete, and hence also mixed type, convex space structure on $X$ provided the discrete convex space structure is totally ordered as a poset.
  Those spaces which satisfy the compatability condition have a coseparator which allows us to establish the existence of the $\mathcal{G}$-algebras and $\mathscr{P}$-algebras. These algebras are the expectation operators $\mathcal{G}X \xrightarrow{\mathbb{E}_{\bullet}(\mathbf{1}_X)} X$ which come in two versions, measurable and continuous.</description>

      <title>The Club Sandwich: Gapless Phases and Phase Transitions with Non-Invertible Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17322v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a generalization of the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT) framework to characterize phase transitions and gapless phases with categorical symmetries. The central tool is the club sandwich, which extends the SymTFT setup to include an interface between two topological orders: there is a symmetry boundary, which is gapped, and a physical boundary that may be gapless, but in addition, there is also a gapped interface in the middle. The club sandwich generalizes so-called Kennedy-Tasaki (KT) transformations. Building on the results in [1, 2] on gapped phases with categorical symmetries, we construct gapless theories describing phase transitions with non-invertible symmetries by applying suitable KT transformations on known phase transitions provided by the critical Ising model and the 3-state Potts model. We also describe in detail the order parameters in these gapless theories characterizing the phase transitions, which are generally mixtures of conventional and string-type order parameters mixed together by the action of categorical symmetries. Additionally, removing the physical boundary from the club sandwiches results in club quiches, which characterize all possible gapped boundary phases with (possibly non-invertible) symmetries that can arise on the boundary of a bulk gapped phase. We also provide a mathematical characterization of gapped boundary phases with symmetries as pivotal tensor functors whose targets are pivotal multi-fusion categories.</description>

      <title>Pushing Tree Decompositions Forward Along Graph Homomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15184v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is folklore that tree-width is monotone under taking subgraphs (i.e. injective graph homomorphisms) and contractions (certain kinds of surjective graph homomorphisms). However, although tree-width is obviously not monotone under any surjective graph homomorphism, it is not clear whether contractions are canonically the only class of surjections with respect to which it is monotone. We prove that this is indeed the case: we show that - up to isomorphism - contractions are the only surjective graph homomorphisms that preserve tree decompositions and the shape of the decomposition tree. Furthermore, our results provide a framework for answering questions of this sort for many other kinds of combinatorial data structures (such as directed multigraphs, hypergraphs, Petri nets, circular port graphs, half-edge graphs, databases, simplicial complexes etc.) for which natural analogues of tree decompositions can be defined.</description>
