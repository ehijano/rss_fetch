      <title>Nonlinear elliptic Dirichlet boundary value problems on time scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish existence and uniqueness results for nonlinear elliptic Dirichlet boundary value problems on n-dimensional time scale domains. Time scales provide a unified framework that encompasses continuous, discrete, and hybrid settings. Under a Lipschitz condition on the nonlinearity bounded by the first eigenvalue, we prove existence and uniqueness using the contraction mapping theorem. Under a weaker one-sided growth condition, we establish existence using the Leray--Schauder fixed point theorem. To apply these functional analytic methods, we reformulate the problem as an operator equation, which requires developing the spectral theory for the Dirichlet Laplacian with mixed nabla-delta derivatives. We establish self-adjointness, positivity, and completeness of eigenfunctions, and the product eigenfunctions form a complete orthonormal basis in the n-dimensional setting.</description>

      <title>Fractional Hardy inequalities on $C^{1,1}$ open sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Omega$ be a bounded open set of class $C^{1,1}$ in $\mathbb{R}^N$ and $s\in(\frac{1}{2}, 1)$. We study a family of fractional Hardy-type inequalities \begin{equation} \frac{c_{N,s}}{2}\displaystyle\iint_{\Omega\times\Omega}\frac{(u(x)-u(y))^2}{|x-y|^{N+2s}}\ dxdy-\displaystyle\lambda\int_{\Omega}u^2\ dx\geq C\displaystyle\int_{\Omega}\frac{u^2}{\delta^{2s}}\ dx,~~~\quad\forall\lambda\in\mathbb{R},~~~~~~~(0.1) \end{equation} with $u\in C_c^\infty(\Omega)$ and $C=C(\Omega,s,N,\lambda)&gt;0$. We show that the best constant in $(0.1)$ is achieved if and only if $\lambda&gt;\lambda^*(s,\Omega)$, for some $\lambda^*(s,\Omega)\in\mathbb{R}$. As a by-product, we derive in particular that the best constant in Hardy inequality $\mu_{N,s}(\Omega)$ is achieved if and only if $\mu_{N,s}(\Omega)&lt;\mathfrak{h}_{N,s}$, with $\mathfrak{h}_{N,s}$ being the best constant for the fractional Hardy inequality in the half space. Moreover, if $\Omega$ is a convex open set, we obtain a lower bound for $\lambda^*(s,\Omega)$ in terms of the volume of $\Omega$. Specifically, we prove that $\lambda^*(s,\Omega)\geq a(N,s)|\Omega|^{-\frac{2s}{N}}$ with an explicit constant $a(N,s)&gt;0$. For general bounded $C^{1,1}$ open sets, we prove instead that $\lambda^*(s,\Omega)\geq0$ when $s$ is close to $\frac{1}{2}$. The aforementioned result is proved after showing that $\mu_{N,s}(\Omega)=\mathfrak{h}_{N,s}$ for $s$ close to $\frac{1}{2}$. In particular, we deduce that, whenever $s$ is sufficiently close to $\frac{1}{2}$, the Hardy constant $\mu_{N,s}(\Omega)$ is never achieved, hence, behaves differently from that in the local case. This result is completely new in the fractional setting, and was known only for convex open sets for the full range $s\in(\frac{1}{2}, 1)$.</description>

      <title>Stationary periodic solutions to Nonlinear Dirac equations with non-coercive potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain periodic solutions for nonlinear Dirac equations with a nonlinear term that is not necessarily coercive.
  This amounts to study the equation on a three-dimensional torus.
  The Palais-Smale condition is enhanced by involving a coercive perturbation.
  Uniform estimates for the critical levels as well as the Sobolev norms for the perturbed solutions are obtained, making it possible to pass to a limit which gives a nontrivial solution.</description>

      <title>Stability threshold for 3D Boussinesq equations with rotation near the Couette flow and stratified temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines the stability threshold at high Reynolds numbers $\textbf{Re}$ for the three-dimensional Boussinesq equations with rotation on the domain $\Omega=\{(x,\,y,\,z)\in \mathbb{T} \times \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{T}\}$ around the Couette flow $(y,0,0)$ and the vertically stratified temperature $\Theta_s=1+\alpha^2 z$. For the linear system without rotation, stratification not only suppresses the lift-up effect but also exhibits certain dispersion effects, except for some points where degradation occurs, which will bring essential difficulties to nonlinear estimates. In contrast, when rotation is taken into account, we observe that this degeneracy in dispersion effects disappears; furthermore, we can derive dispersive estimates for the second and third components of the simple-zero mode within the velocity field. Additionally, we develop three good unknowns to minimize linear coupling terms as much as possible while mitigating growth induced by linear stretching terms; through constructing a series of multipliers, we achieve enhanced dissipation and inviscid damping effects. In our analysis of the nonlinear system aimed at establishing an improved stability threshold, we utilize quasi-linearization methods to rectify deficiencies in dispersive estimates related to both the first component of velocity and temperature, as well as address regularity issues along vertical directions caused by buoyancy forces and stratification. Consequently, we demonstrate that if initial perturbations in velocity and temperature satisfy $\left\|u_{\mathrm{in}}\right\|_{H^{N+2}\cap W^{N+3,1}}+\left\|\theta_{\mathrm{in}}\right\|_{H^{N+1}\cap W^{N+3,1}}&lt;\delta \mathbf{Re}^{-\frac{14}{15}}$, for any $N\geq 11$ and some $\delta&gt;0$ independent of $\mathbf{Re}$, then the solution to the 3D Boussinesq equations with rotation is nonlinearly stable without transitioning away from the steady state.</description>

      <title>Free boundary regularity in obstacle problems with a degenerate forcing term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the properties of a special free boundary point in the following obstacle problem: The Laplacian of u equals f(x) multiplied by the characteristic function of the set where u is positive within the two-dimensional unit ball, where $f(x)=|x|$ is a degenerate forcing term. The key challenge stems from the degeneracy of $f(x)$, which leads to a more complex structure of the free boundary compared to the classical setting. To analyze it, we introduce the epiperimetric inequality developed by Weiss (Invent Math 138:23-50, 1999). Although this powerful tool was firstly introduced for the classical obstacle problem characterized by $f(x)&gt;0$ in B_1, it also proves effective in our degenerate setting. This allows us to first obtain the decay rate of the Weiss energy for all blow-ups at the origin, which in turn implies the uniqueness of the blow-up profiles. With this uniqueness established, we then prove a very weak directional monotonicity properties satisfied by the solutions. This finally yields the regularity of the free boundary at the origin if the origin is a regular point.</description>

      <title>Explicit form of relaxation tensor for isotropic extended Burgers model and its spectral inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Concerning the anelastic nature of Earth, the quasi-static extended Burgers model (abbreviated by q-EBM), an integro-differential system, is used to study the free oscillation of Earth (abbreviated by FOE). In this paper, we first provide a general method to obtain an explicit form of the relaxation tensor for inhomogeneous isotropic q-EBM. Then, we apply it to compute the eigenvalues of the free oscillation of Earth, assuming that Earth is a unit ball modeled as a homogeneous and isotropic q-EBM. So far, an analytical and systematic way to compute the eigenvalues of the FOE has been missing when modeling Earth as a q-EBM. In particular, we compute some clusters of eigenvalues (abbreviated by C-ev's). To be more precise, integrating by parts with respect to time of the q-EBM under the assumption that the initial strain is zero, the q-EBM becomes the sum of two terms. The first term, called the instantaneous term, doesn't have any integration with respect to time, but the second term, called the memory term, has such an integration. Then, consider the eigenvalues of the instantaneous part of the q-EBM. The eigenfunctions of C-ev's share the same eigenfunctions of the instantaneous part. However, the C-ev's may be shifted from the eigenvalues of the instantaneous part. Further, we analyze the structure of C-ev's and provide an inversion formula identifying the q-EBM from the C-ev's.</description>

      <title>Stabilization of nonautonomous Navier-Stokes flows under dynamic slip boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exponential stabilizability of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations under dynamic slip boundary conditions toward arbitrary time-dependent trajectories is proven. The feedback control law is constructed explicitly using oblique projections and realized through a finite number of spatially localized interior actuators, without requiring spectral assumptions. The approach extends to various slip boundary condition types (Navier, vorticity-type, and Neumann) and applies to multi-connected domains. Weak solution existence and exponential decay estimates are established, with the stabilization rate depending on the boundary dynamics parameters.</description>

      <title>Global strong solutions with large initial data for the Cauchy problem of the multi-dimensional compressible Navier-Stokes-Korteweg system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish global strong solutions for arbitrarily large initial data to the 2D and 3D compressible Navier-Stokes-Korteweg system, also referred to as the quantum Navier-Stokes equations, originally derived by Dunn and Serrin [Arch. Ration. Mech. Anal. 88(2):95-133, 1985]. Specifically, we prove the existence of global strong solutions for arbitrarily large initial data in the case $N=2$ when $\gamma \ge 1$, and $N=3$ with $1 \le \gamma &lt; 8/3$ for the associated Cauchy problem. By employing techniques from Littlewood-Paley theory, range truncation analysis, refined Nash-Moser and De Giorgi iteration methods, we derive positive upper and lower bounds for the density. As a consequence, we are able to treat the whole-space case with strictly positive far-field density. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result that establishes global strong solutions for physically relevant compressible Navier-Stokes equations in the whole space, without imposing any symmetry or special geometric assumptions on the initial data.</description>

      <title>The Wasserstein gradient flow of the Sinkhorn divergence between Gaussian distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Wasserstein gradient flow of the Sinkhorn divergence when both the source and the target are Gaussian distributions. We prove the existence of a flow that stays in the class of Gaussian distributions, and is unique in the larger class of measures with strongly-concave and smooth log-densities. We prove that the flow globally converges toward the target measure when the source's covariance matrix is not singular, and provide counter-examples to global convergence when it is, giving a first answer to an open question raised in [Carlier et al. 2024, \S4.2]. When the covariance matrix of the source distribution commutes with that of the target, we derive more quantitative results that showcase exponential convergence toward the target when the source and the target share their support, but dropping to linear rates (O(t^{-1})) if the target is concentrated on a strict subspace of the source's support.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we determine the wave front set of solutions to the Schr\"{o}dinger equation with time-dependent magnetic fields. We considered time-dependent and `not so small' magnetic fields through the method using the wave packet transform established by K. Kato, M. Kobayashi and S. Ito. Furthermore, we checked that the fundamental solution of the Schr\"odinger equation in a spatially decaying magnetic field has no singularities as a consequence of our result.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we derive asymptotic interface models for an elastic Muskat free boundary problem describing Darcy flow beneath an elastic membrane. In a weakly nonlinear regime of small interface steepness, we obtain nonlocal evolution equations that capture the free-boundary dynamics up to quadratic order. In the long-wave thin-film regime, we rewrite the kinematic condition in flux form, flatten the moving domain, and derive a lubrication-type equation. Moreover, we establish well-posedness for these models in suitable Wiener spaces.</description>

      <title>Discrete Quantitative Isocapacitary Inequality: Fluctuation Estimates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical isocapacitary inequality states that, among all sets of fixed volume, the ball uniquely minimizes the capacity. While this result holds in the continuum, it fails in the discrete setting, where the isocapacitary problem may admit multiple minimizers. In this paper we establish quantitative fluctuation estimates for the discrete isocapacitary problem on subsets of $\mathbb{Z}^d$
  as their cardinality diverges. Our approach relies on a careful extension of the associated variational problem from the discrete to the continuum setting, combined with sharp (continuum) quantitative isocapacitary inequalities.</description>

      <title>Cutoff Sobolev inequalities for local and non-local $p$-energies on metric measure spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For $p&gt;1$, we study subordination phenomena for local and non-local regular $p$-energies on metric measure spaces. Under suitable geometric assumptions, we show that if a local regular $p$-energy satisfies a Poincar\'e inequality together with a cutoff Sobolev inequality with scaling function $\Psi$, then all associated stable-like non-local $p$-energies with scaling functions strictly below $\Psi$ are regular and satisfy the corresponding non-local cutoff Sobolev inequalities. Moreover, if a stable-like non-local regular $p$-energy with scaling function $\Psi$ satisfies the corresponding non-local cutoff Sobolev inequality, then the same conclusion holds for all associated stable-like non-local $p$-energies with scaling functions below $\Psi$. These results provide a non-linear extension of the classical subordination principle beyond the Dirichlet form framework.</description>

      <title>PEST: Physics-Enhanced Swin Transformer for 3D Turbulence Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate simulation of turbulent flows is fundamental to scientific and engineering applications. Direct numerical simulation (DNS) offers the highest fidelity but is computationally prohibitive, while existing data-driven alternatives struggle with stable long-horizon rollouts, physical consistency, and faithful simulation of small-scale structures. These challenges are particularly acute in three-dimensional (3D) settings, where the cubic growth of spatial degrees of freedom dramatically amplifies computational cost, memory demand, and the difficulty of capturing multi-scale interactions. To address these challenges, we propose a Physics-Enhanced Swin Transformer (PEST) for 3D turbulence simulation. PEST leverages a window-based self-attention mechanism to effectively model localized PDE interactions while maintaining computational efficiency. We introduce a frequency-domain adaptive loss that explicitly emphasizes small-scale structures, enabling more faithful simulation of high-frequency dynamics. To improve physical consistency, we incorporate Navier--Stokes residual constraints and divergence-free regularization directly into the learning objective.

      <title>Wave scattering by a transversal defect in a discrete waveguide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study wave scattering by a finite transversal strip in a discrete square-lattice waveguide with Dirichlet boundary conditions imposed on the strip and the waveguide walls. The setting is motivated as a discrete analogue of the classical continuous waveguide problem with a screen. The corresponding Wiener--Hopf formulation leads to an equation with a $4 \times 4$ matrix kernel, which reduces to a $2 \times 2$ matrix kernel under some symmetry assumptions. The factorisation prospects of this kernel are discussed, but this route is not followed. Instead, an exact analytical solution is obtained using the pole removal technique. This contrasts with the continuous case, where only approximate solutions are currently available. The reflection and transmission coefficients resulting from an incident duct mode are computed with an accuracy up to $10^{-13}$, showing consistency with theoretical predictions from continuous waveguide theory. In particular, full reflection and zero transmission are recovered as the frequency approaches the cut-off value for the incident mode. Finally, the solution is validated against a numerical computation of the diffraction problem via the Boundary Algebraic Equations method with a tailored lattice Green's function.</description>

      <title>New logarithmic power nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations with super-Gaussons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new class of nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations with a logarithmic-power nonlinearity that admits exact localized solutions of super-Gaussian form. The resulting stationary states possess flat-top profiles with sharp edges and are referred to as super-Gaussons, in analogy with the Gaussian Gaussons of the classical logarithmic NLS (log-NLS). The model, which we call the logarithmic-power NLS (logp-NLS), is parameterized by an exponent $p\geq1$ that controls the degree of flatness of the soliton core and the sharpness of its decay. Mathematically, $p$ interpolates between the standard log-NLS ($p=1$) and increasingly flat-top profiles as $p$ increases, while physically it governs the stiffness of an underlying logarithmic-power compressibility law. The proposed equation is constructed so as to admit super-Gaussian stationary states and can be interpreted a posteriori within a generalized pressure-law framework, thereby extending the log-NLS. We investigate the dynamics of super-Gaussons in one spatial dimension through numerical simulations for various values of $p$, demonstrating how this parameter regulates both the internal structure of the soliton and its collision dynamics. The logp-NLS thus generalizes the standard log-NLS by admitting a broader family of localized states with distinctive structural and dynamical properties, suggesting its relevance for flat-top solitons in nonlinear optics, Bose-Einstein condensates, and related nonlinear media.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we classify the low energy $\varepsilon$-harmonic maps from the surfaces of constant curvature with positive genus into the round sphere. We find that all such maps with degree $\pm1$ are all quantitively close to a bubble configuration with bubbles forming at special points on the domain with bubbling radius proportional to $\varepsilon^{1/4}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.10914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we find analogues for $\varepsilon$-harmonic maps to the generalised energy identity and the existence of geodesic necks result discovered by Yuxiang Li and Youde Wang for $\alpha$-harmonic maps. In particular there exist specific quantities depending only on $\varepsilon$ and the bubbling radius which entirely determine if the full energy identity holds and if a neck forms. In the case these fail we can calculate the energy lost and the length of the geodesic neck based on only these quantities and the biharmonic energy of the bubble.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.10920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address data assimilation for linear and nonlinear dynamical systems via the so-called \emph{model reference adaptive system}. Continuing our theoretical developments in \cite{Tram_Kaltenbacher_2021}, we deliver the first practical implementation of this approach for online parameter identification with time series data. Our semi-implicit scheme couples a modified state equation with a parameter evolution law that is driven by model-data residuals. We demonstrate four benchmark problems of increasing complexity: the Darcy flow, the Fisher-KPP equation, a nonlinear potential equation and finally, an Allen-Cahn type equation. Across all cases, explicit model reference adaptive system construction, verified assumptions and numerically stable reconstructions underline our proposed method as a reliable, versatile tool for data assimilation and real-time inversion.</description>

Abstract: We consider an electrostatic system whose spatial factor is conformal to an $n$-dimensional Euclidean space. We provide a complete characterization of the most general ansatz, thereby reducing the associated electrostatic system of partial differential equations to an ordinary differential equation system. We prove that there are only two possibilities: either the cosmological constant is nonzero, in which case the solutions are necessarily invariant under rotations or translations, or the cosmological constant vanishes, and the solutions belong to the Majumdar-Papapetrou class with a degree of freedom associated with an invariant $(n-1)$-dimensional subgroup. As a result, we introduce a new solution to the electrovacuum system in the Majumdar-Papapetrou class that is invariant under an $(n-1)$-dimensional group of dilations.</description>

Abstract: We consider the Gibbs measure for the focusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation on the one-dimensional torus $\mathbb T$, that was introduced in a seminal paper by Lebowitz, Rose and Speer (1988). We show that in the large torus limit, the measure exhibits a phase transition, depending on the size of the nonlinearity. This phase transition was originally conjectured on the basis of numerical simulation by Lebowitz, Rose and Speer (1988). Its existence is however striking in view of a series of negative results by McKean (1995) and Rider (2002).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18907v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate boundary estimates for elliptic operators with stationary random coefficients exhibiting integrable correlations, arising from stochastic homogenization theory. As practical applications, we establish decay estimates for Green functions in both quenched and annealed senses. Furthermore, we derive notable annealed estimates for boundary correctors, including central limit theorem (CLT)-scaling type estimates. By extending the lemma of Bella, Giunti, and Otto [10] to accommodate boundary conditions, we ultimately obtain error estimates for the two-scale expansion of Green functions at the level of mixed derivatives, thereby establishing connections to other related fields.</description>

      <title>Quantitative low-temperature spectral asymptotics for reversible diffusions in temperature-dependent domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16082v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive novel low-temperature asymptotics for the spectrum of the infinitesimal generator of the overdamped Langevin dynamics. The novelty is that this operator is endowed with homogeneous Dirichlet conditions at the boundary of a domain which depends on the temperature. From the point of view of stochastic processes, this gives information on the long-time behavior of the diffusion conditioned on non-absorption at the boundary, in the so-called quasistationary regime. Our results provide precise estimates of the spectral gap and principal eigenvalue, extending the Eyring-Kramers formula. The phenomenology is richer than in the case of a fixed boundary and gives new insight into the sensitivity of the spectrum with respect to the shape of the domain near critical points of the energy function. Our work is motivated by--and is relevant to--the problem of finding optimal hyperparameters for accelerated molecular dynamics algorithms.</description>

      <title>Regularity of vectorial minimizers for non-uniformly elliptic anisotropic integrals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18917v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish the local boundedness of the local minimizers $u:\Omega\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{m}$ of non-uniformly elliptic integrals of the form $\int_{\Omega}f(x,Dv)\,dx$, where $\Omega$ is a bounded open subset of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ ($n\geq2)$ and the integrand satisfies anisotropic growth conditions of the type \[ \sum_{i=1}^{n}\lambda_{i}(x)|\xi_{i}|^{p_{i}}\le f(x,\xi)\le\mu(x)\left\{ 1+|\xi|^{q}\right\} \] for some exponents $q\geq p_{i}&gt;1$ and with non-negative functions $\lambda_{i},\mu$ fulfilling suitable summability assumptions. The main novelties here are the degenerate and anisotropic behaviour of the integrand and the fact that we also address the case of vectorial minimizers ($m&gt;1$). Our proof is based on the celebrated Moser iteration technique and employs an embedding result for anisotropic Sobolev spaces.</description>

Abstract: In this article we consider two different heat conducting fluids each modelled by the incompressible Navier-Stokes-Fourier system separated by a non-linear elastic Koiter shell. The motion of the shell changes the domain of definition of the two separated fluids. For this setting we show the existence of a weak solution. The heat capacity of the shell is given energetically. It allows to consider transmission laws ranging from insulation to superconductivity.We follow a variational approach for fluid-structure interactions. To include temperature a novel two step minimization scheme is used to produce an approximation. The weak solutions are energetically closed and include a strictly positive temperature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03360v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In these lecture notes, we provide an introduction to the theory of mixing for incompressible flows from a PDE perspective. We discuss both the Lagrangian (ODE) and Eulerian (PDE, continuity equation) viewpoints, and introduce suitable notions of mixing scales that quantify the degree to which a scalar field transported by a velocity field becomes mixed. We then address the problem of establishing universal lower bounds on the time evolution of the mixing scale. This is first done in the smooth setting, using energy estimates and flow-based arguments, and later in the Sobolev setting, relying on quantitative estimates for regular Lagrangian flows. Finally, we present recent results concerning the sharpness of these lower bounds, their implications for the geometry and regularity of regular Lagrangian flows, and connections with more recent developments in the literature.</description>

Abstract: The regularity theory for equations combining both local and nonlocal operators in sub-Riemannian geometries is a huge challenge. In this paper, we investigate the $C^{1,\alpha}$-regularity of weak solutions to mixed local and nonlocal degenerate elliptic equations on the Heisenberg group. We first derive a sophisticated iteration scheme of Morrey-type by leveraging horizontal difference combined with the fractional Sobolev-type inequality on the Heisenberg group. Then, the H\"{o}lder continuity of the weak solutions is established by applying the local boundedness, the iteration scheme of Morrey-type, an iterative method and the Morrey inequality. Finally, we use the H\"{o}lder continuity in conjunction with Theorem 1.2 from Mukherjee and Zhong\cite{MZ21} to prove the $C^{1,\alpha}$-regularity of weak solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06184v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a policy iteration method to solve an inverse problem for a mean-field game (MFG) model, specifically to reconstruct the obstacle function in the game from the partial observation data of value functions, which represent the optimal costs for agents. The proposed approach decouples this complex inverse problem, which is an optimization problem constrained by a coupled nonlinear forward and backward PDE system in the MFG, into several iterations of solving linear PDEs and linear inverse problems. This method can also be viewed as a fixed-point iteration that simultaneously solves the MFG system and inversion. We prove its linear rate of convergence. In addition, numerical examples in 1D and 2D, along with performance comparisons to a direct least-squares method, demonstrate the superior efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method for solving inverse MFGs.</description>

      <title>Long-time asymptotics of the Sawada-Kotera equation on the line</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17537v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Sawada-Kotera (SK) equation is an integrable system characterized by a third-order Lax operator and is related to the modified Sawada-Kotera (mSK) equation through a Miura transformation. This work formulates the Riemann-Hilbert problem associated with the SK and mSK equations by using direct and inverse scattering transforms. The long-time asymptotic behaviors of the solutions to these equations are then analyzed via the Deift-Zhou steepest descent method for Riemann-Hilbert problems. It is shown that the asymptotic solutions of the SK and mSK equations are categorized into four distinct regions: the decay region, the dispersive wave region, the Painlev\'{e} region, and the rapid decay region. Notably, the Painlev\'{e} region is governed by the F-XVIII equation in the Painlev\'{e} classification of fourth-order ordinary differential equations, a fourth-order analogue of the Painlev\'{e} transcendents. This connection is established through the Riemann-Hilbert formulation in this work. Similar to the KdV equation, the SK equation exhibits a transition region between the dispersive wave and Painlev\'{e} regions, arising from the special values of the reflection coefficients at the origin. Finally, numerical comparisons demonstrate that the asymptotic solutions agree excellently with results from direct numerical simulations.</description>

Abstract: We derive the short-time expansion of the heat trace on planar curvilinear polygons through order $t^{1/2}$, with both Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions. For such domains we show that the coefficient of $t^{1/2}$ in the expansion splits into a boundary integral of $\kappa^2$ and a sum of local corner contributions, one for each vertex. Each curved corner contribution depends only on the interior angle $\alpha$ and on the limiting curvatures $\kappa_{\pm}$ on the adjacent sides. For Dirichlet boundary conditions, using a conformal model and a parametrix construction on the sector heat space, we express this contribution in the form $c_{1/2}(\alpha)\,r_0(\alpha,\kappa_+, \kappa_-)$, where $c_{1/2}(\alpha)$ is given by the Hadamard finite part of an explicit trace over the exact sector. For right angles we compute $c_{1/2}(\pi/2)=1/(16\sqrt{\pi})$, which yields a closed formula for the $\sqrt t$ coefficient for domains with right-angled corners. Combined with previous work on the coefficients of $t^{-1}$, $t^{-1/2}$ and $t^0$ for such domains, this determines the remaining local heat trace coefficient for planar curvilinear polygons up to order $t^{1/2}$. As an inverse spectral application we extend a result in the literature by showing that any admissible curvilinear polygon that is Dirichlet isospectral to a polygon must itself be a polygon with straight sides.</description>
