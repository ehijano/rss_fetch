      <title>Extinction and Extirpation Conditions in Coalescent and Ecotonal Metacommunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we present extinction, extirpation and coexistence conditions where / when two communities combine. We consider one specific model where two communities coalesce, and another model where the communities coexist side by side, blending in a transitionary zone called the ecotone. Specifically, (1) we analytically calculate the shifts in abundances as a function of mixing strength. (2) Obtain a critical value for the mixing strength leading to extinction. (3) Derive an inequality condition for full coexistent mixing. (4) find how the individual communities penetrate into one other as a function of mixing strength. (5) derive the conditions for one species to cross the ecotone and invade an neighboring community and (6) conditions for a native species to get extirpated. Lastly, (7) we spatially investigate the species richness within the ecotone and derive a condition that determines whether the ecotone will have higher or lower richness compared to its surrounding habitats.</description>

      <title>A model of predation and survival in a system of three interacting species</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of interactions between multiple species in an ecosystem is an active and impactful direction of inquiry. This is true in particular for fragile systems in which even small perturbations of their functional parameters can produce dramatic effects like species endangerment or extinction, leading the system to enter an unsustainable regime and eventually collapse. In this context, it is important to understand which factors can lead to such effects and for which systems, so that one can act proactively and timely to prevent them. We built and studied a mathematical model that captures the natural interactions between three species, in which two species are predators of the third, but such that one of the predators also consumes the other (to which we refer as Owls, Snakes and Mice). The nonlinear components of the model were documented on existing literature and assembled as a system of Lotka-Volterra ordinary differential equations. Our analytical computations and numerical exploration explorations revealed sequences of transcritical and Hopf bifurcations that underlie counterintuitive transitions of the system into regions of vulnerability to external noise. We conclude that, in order to avoid extinction,one needs to rigorously prescribe a well-documented, prediction-based approach to population control.</description>

      <title>Savanna dynamics with grazing, browsing, and migration effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article explores the dynamics of savanna ecosystems with grazing, browsing, and migration effects. Covering over one-eighth of the Earth's land area and supporting about one-fifth of the global population, the savanna is an ecological system whose importance has only recently garnered significant attention from biologists. The interactions between organisms in this ecosystem are highly complex, and fundamental mathematical issues remain unresolved. We rigorously analyze traveling waves in savanna systems and focus on whether trees, grass, grazers, and browsers coexist. We demonstrate the existence of various traveling waves, including waves transitioning from extinction to co-existence and waves from a grass-vegetation state (where only grass and grazers exist) to co-existence. Due to the biodiversity of species in grassland ecosystems, it is not appropriate to consider overly simplified models of competition between grasses and trees. From both a biological and mathematical perspective, factors such as animal grazing, browsing, and migration (which facilitates seed dispersal) play a crucial role in promoting ecological stability and coexistence. Additionally, we estimate the nonzero minimum value of the total plant biomass within the savanna dynamic system to better understand the persistence and stability of sustainable development within the ecosystem.</description>

      <title>From trees to traits: A review of advances in PhyloG2P methods and future directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mapping genotypes to phenotypes (G2P) is a fundamental goal in biology. So called PhyloG2P methods are a relatively new set of tools that leverage replicated evolution in phylogenetically independent lineages to identify genomic regions associated with traits of interest. Here, we review recent developments in PhyloG2P methods, focusing on three key areas: methods based on replicated amino acid substitutions, methods detecting changes in evolutionary rates, and methods analysing gene duplication and loss. We discuss how the definition and measurement of traits impacts the utility of these methods, arguing that focusing on simple rather than compound traits will lead to more meaningful genotype-phenotype associations. We advocate for the use of methods that work with continuous traits directly rather than collapsing them to binary representations. We examine the strengths and limitations of different approaches to modeling genetic replication, highlighting the importance of explicit modeling of evolutionary processes. Finally, we outline promising future directions, including the integration of population-level variation, as well as epigenetic and environmental information. No one method is likely to identify all genomic regions of interest, so we encourage users to apply multiple methods that are capable of detecting a wide range of associations. The overall aim of this review is to provide practitioners a roadmap for understanding and applying PhyloG2P methods.</description>

      <title>Applied Probability Insights into Nonlinear Epidemic Dynamics with Independent Jumps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the analysis of a stochastic SAIRS-type epidemic model that explicitly incorporates the roles of asymptomatic and symptomatic infectious individuals in disease transmission dynamics. Asymptomatic carriers, often undetected due to the lack of symptoms, play a crucial role in the spread of many communicable diseases, including COVID-19. Our model also accounts for vaccination and considers the stochastic effects of environmental and population-level randomness using L\'evy processes. We begin by demonstrating the existence and uniqueness of a global positive solution to the proposed stochastic system, ensuring the model's mathematical validity. Subsequently, we derive sufficient conditions under which the disease either becomes extinct or persists over time, depending on the parameters and initial conditions. The analysis highlights the influence of random perturbations, asymptomatic transmission, and vaccination strategies on disease dynamics. Finally, we conduct comprehensive numerical simulations to validate the theoretical findings and illustrate the behavior of the model under various scenarios of randomness and parameter settings. These results provide valuable insights into the stochastic dynamics of epidemic outbreaks and inform strategies for disease management and control.</description>

      <title>Eco-evolutionary dynamics of a trait-structured predator-prey model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The coupling between evolutionary and ecological changes (eco-evolutionary dynamics) has been shown to be relevant among diverse species, and is also of interest outside of ecology, i.e. in cancer evolution. These dynamics play an important role in determining survival in response to climate change, motivating the need for mathematical models to capture this often complex interplay. Population genetics models incorporating eco-evolutionary dynamics often sacrifice analytical tractability to model the complexity of real systems, and do not explicitly consider the effect of population heterogeneity. In order to allow for population heterogeneity, transient, and long-term dynamics, while retaining tractability, we generalise a moment-based method applicable in the regime of small segregational variance to the case of time-dependent mortality and birth. These results are applied to a predator-prey model, where ecological parameters such as the contact rate between species are trait-structured. The trait-distribution of the prey species is shown to be approximately Gaussian with constant variance centered on the mean trait, which is asymptotically governed by an autonomous ODE. In this way, we make explicit the impact of eco-evolutionary dynamics on the transient behaviour and long-term fate of the prey species.</description>

      <title>A 2-approximation algorithm for the softwired parsimony problem on binary, tree-child phylogenetic networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18077v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Finding the most parsimonious tree inside a phylogenetic network with respect to a given character is an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem that for many network topologies is essentially inapproximable. In contrast, if the network is a rooted tree, then Fitch's well-known algorithm calculates an optimal parsimony score for that character in polynomial time. Drawing inspiration from this we here introduce a new extension of Fitch's algorithm which runs in polynomial time and ensures an approximation factor of 2 on binary, tree-child phylogenetic networks, a popular topologically-restricted subclass of phylogenetic networks in the literature. Specifically, we show that Fitch's algorithm can be seen as a primal-dual algorithm, how it can be extended to binary, tree-child networks and that the approximation guarantee of this extension is tight. These results for a classic problem in phylogenetics strengthens the link between polyhedral methods and phylogenetics and can aid in the study of other related optimization problems on phylogenetic networks.</description>
