      <title>The Role of High-mass Stellar Binaries in the Formation of High-mass Black Holes in Dense Star Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent detections of gravitational waves from mergers of binary black holes (BBHs) with pre-merger source-frame individual masses in the so-called upper mass-gap, expected due to (pulsational) pair instability supernova ((P)PISN), have created immense interest in the astrophysical production of high-mass black holes (BHs). Previous studies show that high-mass BHs may be produced via repeated BBH mergers inside dense star clusters. Alternatively, inside dense star clusters, stars with unusually low core-to-envelope mass ratios can form via mergers of high-mass stars, which then can avoid (P)PISN, but produce high-mass BHs via mass fallback. We simulate detailed star-by-star multi-physics models of dense star clusters using the Monte Carlo cluster evolution code, CMC, to investigate the role of primordial binary fraction among high-mass stars (&gt;=15 Msun) on the formation of high-mass BHs. We vary the high-mass stellar binary fraction (fb_15_prime) while keeping all other initial properties, including the population of high-mass stars, unchanged. We find that the number of high-mass BHs, as well as the mass of the most massive BH formed via stellar core-collapse are proportional to fb_15_prime. In contrast, there is no correlation between fb_15_prime and the number of high-mass BHs formed via BH-BH mergers. Since the total production of high-mass BHs is dominated by BH-BH mergers in old clusters, the overall number of high-mass BHs produced over the typical lifetime of globular clusters is insensitive to fb_15_prime. Furthermore, we study the differences in the demographics of BH-BH mergers as a function of fb_15_prime.</description>

      <title>High-Speed Outflows and Dusty Disks during the AGB to PN Transition: The PANORAMA survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As mass-losing asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars evolve to planetary nebulae (PNe), the mass outflow geometries transform from nearly spherical to extreme aspherical. The physical mechanisms governing this transformation are widely believed to be linked to binarity and the associated production of disks and fast jets during transitional (post-AGB) evolutionary stages. We are carrying out a systematic ALMA survey ($P$re-planet$A$ry $N$ebulae high-angular-res$O$lution su$R$vey with $A$L$MA$ or PANORAMA) of a representative sample of bipolar and multipolar post-AGB objects. We have obtained high angular-resolution (0".1-0".4) observations of the CO(3--2) and/or 6--5 emission in order to probe the spatio-kinematic structure of the collimated outflows and the central disk/torii. The results are remarkable, generally showing the presence of bipolar or multipolar high-velocity outflows, dense toroidal waists, and in one case, a geometrically-thin circular ring around the central bipolar nebula. A high degree of point-symmetry characterizes the morphology of the mass ejecta. In this contribution, we present these and other highlights from our survey. We aim to use 2D/3D radiative transfer modeling in order to derive accurate outflow momenta, masses and mass-loss rates for our sample, and build hydrodynamical models that can explain the observed spatio-kinematic structures. These results will then be used to distinguish between different classes of PN-shaping binary interaction models.</description>

      <title>Stability and fate of hierarchical triples comprising a central massive body and a tight binary in eccentric orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the stability and fate of gravitational triple systems comprising a central massive body and a tight binary of less massive pairs. Our present purpose is two fold; (1) to improve the Hill-type stability criterion for the binary in those systems, and (2) to examine the fate of the triple systems after the binary break-up, with particular attention to the effects of the eccentricities of the inner and outer orbits. We perform direct Newtonian N-body simulations over much longer integration times than previous studies, which is essential to determine the eventual fate of those systems statistically in a reliable fashion. We obtain an empirical fitting formula of the binary stability boundary that incorporates effects of the inner and outer eccentricities, the mutual inclination of the inner and outer orbits, and the mass ratios of the three bodies. We also find that those triple systems are stable for a much longer timescale after the binary break-up, and that their final fates (ejection of the outer body, merger to the central massive body, and collision of two less massive bodies) are very sensitive to the initial outer eccentricity.</description>

      <title>Planetary nebulae seen with TESS: New and revisited short-period binary central star candidates from Cycles 1 to 4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-precision and high-cadence photometric surveys such as Kepler or TESS are making huge progress not only in the detection of new extrasolar planets but also in the study of a great number of variable stars. This is the case for central stars of planetary nebulae (PNe), which have similarly benefited from the capabilities of these missions, increasing the number of known binary central stars and helping us to constrain the relationship between binarity and the complex morphologies of their host PNe. In this paper, we analyse the TESS light curves of a large sample of central stars of PNe with the aim of detecting signs of variability that may hint at the presence of short-period binary nuclei. We analysed 62 central stars of true, likely, or possible PNe and modelled the detected variability through an MCMC approach accounting for three effects: reflection, ellipsoidal modulations, and Doppler beaming. Among the 62 central stars, only 38 are amenable for this study. The remaining 24 show large contamination from nearby sources preventing an optimal analysis. Also, eight targets are already known binary central stars, which we revisit here with the new high precision of the TESS data. In addition, we find that 18 further central stars show clear signs of periodic variability in the TESS data, probably resulting from different physical effects compatible with the binary scenario. We propose them as new candidate binary central stars. We also discuss the origin of the detected variability in each particular case by using the TESS_localize algorithm. Finally, 12 targets show no or only weak evidence of variability at the sensitivity of TESS. Our study demonstrates the power of space-based photometric surveys in searching for close binary companions of central stars of PNe.</description>

      <title>A potential mass-gap black hole in a wide binary with a circular orbit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mass distribution of black holes identified through X-ray emission suggests a paucity of black holes in the mass range of 3 to 5 solar masses. Modified theories have been devised to explain this mass gap, and it is suggested that natal kicks during supernova explosion can more easily disrupt binaries with lower mass black holes. Although recent LIGO observations reveal the existence of compact remnants within this mass gap, the question of whether low-mass black holes can exist in binaries remains a matter of debate. Such a system is expected to be noninteracting without X-ray emission, and can be searched for using radial velocity and astrometric methods. Here we report Gaia DR3 3425577610762832384, a wide binary system including a red giant star and an unseen object, exhibiting an orbital period of approximately 880 days and near-zero eccentricity. Through the combination of radial velocity measurements from LAMOST and astrometric data from Gaia DR2 and DR3 catalogs, we determine a mass of $3.6^{+0.8}_{-0.5}$ $M_{\odot}$ of the unseen component. This places the unseen companion within the mass gap, strongly suggesting the existence of binary systems containing low-mass black holes. More notably, the formation of its surprisingly wide circular orbit challenges current binary evolution and supernova explosion theories.</description>

      <title>Searching for Stellar Activity Cycles using Flares: The Short and Long Timescale Activity Variations of TIC-272272592</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06631v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine 4 years of Kepler 30-min data, and 5 Sectors of TESS 2-min data for the dM3 star KIC-8507979/TIC-272272592. This rapidly rotating (P=1.2 day) star has previously been identified as flare active, with a possible long-term decline in its flare output. Such slow changes in surface magnetic activity are potential indicators of Solar-like activity cycles, which can yield important information about the structure of the stellar dynamo. We find that while TIC-272272592 shows evidence for both short and long timescale variations in its flare activity, it is unlikely physically motivated. Only a handful of stars have been subjected to such long baseline point-in-time flare studies, and we urge caution in comparing results between telescopes due to differences in bandpass, signal to noise, and cadence. In this work, we develop an approach to measure variations in the flare frequency distributions over time, which is quantified as a function of the observing baseline. For TIC-272272592, we find a $2.7\sigma$ detection of a Sector which has a flare deficit, therefore indicating the short term variation could be a result of sampling statistics. This quantifiable approach to describing flare rate variation is a powerful new method for measuring the months-to-years changes in surface magnetic activity, and provides important constraints on activity cycles and dynamo models for low mass stars.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Fields in a sample of planet-hosting M dwarf stars from Kepler, K2, and TESS observed by APOGEE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar magnetic fields have a major impact on space weather around exoplanets orbiting low-mass stars. From an analysis of Zeeman-broadened Fe I lines measured in near-infrared SDSS/APOGEE spectra, mean magnetic fields are determined for a sample of 29 M dwarf stars that host closely orbiting small exoplanets. The calculations employed the radiative transfer code Synmast and MARCS stellar model atmospheres. The sample M dwarfs are found to have measurable mean magnetic fields ranging between $\sim$0.2 to $\sim$1.5 kG, falling in the unsaturated regime on the $&lt;$B$&gt;$ vs P$_{\rm rot}$ plane. The sample systems contain 43 exoplanets, which include 23 from Kepler, nine from K2, and nine from TESS. We evaluated their equilibrium temperatures, insolation, and stellar habitable zones and found that only Kepler-186f and TOI-700d are inside the habitable zones of their stars. Using the derived values of $&lt;$B$&gt;$ for the stars Kepler-186 and TOI-700 we evaluated the minimum planetary magnetic field that would be necessary to shield the exoplanets Kepler-186f and TOI-700d from their host star's winds, considering reference magnetospheres with sizes equal to those of the present-day and young Earth, respectively. Assuming a ratio of 5$\%$ between large-to-small scale B-fields, and a young-Earth magnetosphere, Kepler-186f and TOI-700d would need minimum planetary magnetic fields of, respectively, 0.05 and 0.24 G. These values are considerably smaller than Earth's magnetic field of 0.25 G$\lesssim$B$\lesssim$0.65 G, which suggests that these two exoplanets might have magnetic fields sufficiently strong to protect their atmospheres and surfaces from stellar magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Weak mixing angle at direct detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current ton-scale direct detection experiments have started observing solar neutrinos. In this paper, we probe the weak mixing angle using the latest direct detection data. Utilizing the recent measurement of $^8$B solar neutrinos through coherent neutrino-nucleus scattering by PandaX-4T, we demonstrate that it can probe the weak mixing angle in a complementary region with an error bar comparable to that of dedicated neutrino experiments. Additionally, we show that the current XENONnT electron recoil data can probe the weak mixing angle through neutrino-electron scattering. This occurs in a momentum transfer region that is more than an order of magnitude smaller than the region probed by atomic parity violation experiments. Our findings show huge scope of probing a Standard Model parameter in an entirely new energy regime through the observation of neutrinos in future direct detection experiments.</description>

      <title>A Census of the beta Pic Moving Group and Other Nearby Associations with Gaia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I have used the third data release of the Gaia mission to improve the reliability and completeness of membership samples in the beta Pic moving group (BPMG) and other nearby associations with ages of 20-50 Myr (Sco Body, Carina, Columba, chi1 For, Tuc-Hor, IC 2602, IC 2391, NGC 2547). I find that Carina, Columba, and chi1 For are physically related and coeval, and that Carina is the closest fringe of a much larger association. Similarly, Tuc-Hor and IC 2602 form a coeval population that is spatially and kinematically continuous. Both results agree with hypotheses from Gagne et al. (2021). I have used the new catalogs to study the associations in terms of their initial mass functions, X-ray emission, ages, and circumstellar disks. For instance, using the model for Li depletion from Jeffries et al. (2023), I have derived an age of 24.7+0.9/-0.6 Myr for BPMG, which is similar to estimates from previous studies. In addition, I have used infrared photometry from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer to check for excess emission from circumstellar disks among the members of the associations, which has resulted in a dramatic increase in the number of known disks around M stars at ages of 30-50 Myr and a significant improvement in measurements of excess fractions for those spectral types and ages. Most notably, I find that the W3 excess fraction for M0-M6 initially declines with age to a minimum in BPMG &lt;0.015), increases to a maximum in Carina/Columba chi1 For (0.041+0.009/-0.007, 34 Myr), and declines again in the oldest two associations (40-50 Myr). The origin of that peak and the nature of the M dwarf disks at &gt;20 Myr are unclear.</description>

      <title>Y Dwarfs: The Challenge of Discovering the Coldest Substellar Population in the Solar Neighborhood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stars form in the Galaxy with a wide range in mass. If the mass is below 7% of the Sun's, then the object does not become hot enough for stable hydrogen burning. These substellar objects are called brown dwarfs. Maps of the sky at infrared wavelengths have found large numbers of brown dwarfs. However only 24 objects have been found (as of April 2017) that are cold enough to be classified as "Y dwarfs": these have atmospheres that are cooler than 500 K (or 200 C, 400 F) and have masses only 5 - 20 times that of Jupiter. The coolest Y dwarf currently known, discovered in 2014, has a temperature around freezing, has a mass of about 5 Jupiter masses, and is only 2 pc away from the Sun. These small and cold objects are faint and difficult to find. This chapter describes the discovery and characterization of the Y dwarfs. Finding more of these very cold planet-like brown dwarfs will require an as-yet unplanned space mission mapping large areas of sky at wavelengths around 5 microns.</description>

      <title>Formation and evolution of a protoplanetary disk: combining observations, simulations and cosmochemical constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a plausible and coherent view of the evolution of the protosolar disk that is consistent with the cosmochemical constraints and compatible with observations of other protoplanetary disks and sophisticated numerical simulations. The evidence that high-temperature condensates, CAIs and AOAs, formed near the protosun before being transported to the outer disk can be explained by either an early phase of vigorous radial spreading of the disk, or fast transport of these condensates from the vicinity of the protosun towards large disk radii via the protostellar outflow. The assumption that the material accreted towards the end of the infall phase was isotopically distinct allows us to explain the observed dichotomy in nucleosynthetic isotopic anomalies of meteorites and leads to intriguing predictions on the isotopic composition of refractory elements in comets. When the infall of material waned, the disk started to evolve as an accretion disk. Initially, dust drifted inwards, shrinking the radius of the dust component to ~ 45 au, probably about 1/2 of the width of the gas component. Then structures must have emerged, producing a series of pressure maxima in the disk which trapped the dust on My timescales. This allowed planetesimals to form at radically distinct times without changing significantly of isotopic properties. There was no late accretion of material onto the disk via streamers. The disk disappeared in ~5 Myr, as indicated by paleomagnetic data in meteorites. In conclusion, the evolution of the protosolar disk seems to have been quite typical in terms of size, lifetime, and dust behavior, suggesting that the peculiarities of the Solar system with respect to extrasolar planetary system probably originate from the chaotic nature of planet formation and not at the level of the parental disk.</description>

      <title>Contemporaneous Appearances of Local-Scale Auroral Spiral and Global-Scale Transpolar Arc: Changes of Auroras and Field-Aligned Current Profiles Before a Substorm and After Its Recovery Phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Local vortex-structured auroral spiral and a large-scale transpolar arc (TPA) were contemporaneously observed by the Polar ultraviolet imager (UVI), when a substorm almost recovered. The TPA grew along the dawnside auroral oval from the nightside to the dayside (oval-aligned TPA), and a chain of multiple auroral spots and spiral were located azimuthally near the poleward edge of the nightside auroral oval. Contemporaneous appearances of the TPA and the auroral spiral can be seen after the spiral appeared alone. Polar also detected the oval-aligned TPA and another dawnside TPA with the nightside end distorted toward the premidnight sector (J-shaped TPA) before and after the spiral's formation, respectively. To examine these associated magnetotail structures, we performed global magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations, based on two different types of code, BAT-S-RUS and improved REPPU, and examined how the field-aligned current (FAC) profiles varied in association with changes of the auroral form to TPA and/or auroral spiral. Global MHD simulations with the two different types of code can reproduce the TPAs and the associated FAC structures in the magnetotail. The auroral spiral and its nightside FAC profile, however, were not formed in both simulations, suggesting that its formation process cannot be treated within an MHD framework but is closely related to some kinetic process. When the J-shaped TPA and the auroral spiral contemporaneously appeared, the two MHD simulations could not reproduce the TPA, spiral and their associated magnetotail FAC structures, also advocating that a kinetic effect related to the spiral formation might prevent the TPA occurrence.</description>

      <title>Contour Analysis Tool: an interactive tool for background and morphology analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Contour Analysis Tool (CAT), a Python toolkit aimed at identifying and analyzing structural elements in density maps. CAT employs various contouring techniques, including the lowest-closed contour (LCC), linear and logarithmic Otsu thresholding, and average gradient thresholding. These contours can aid in foreground and background segmentation, providing natural limits for both, as well as edge detection and structure identification. Additionally, CAT provides image processing methods such as smoothing, background removal, and image masking. The toolkit features an interactive suite of controls designed for Jupyter environments, enabling users to promptly visualize the effects of different methods and parameters. We describe, test, and demonstrate the performance of CAT, highlighting its potential use cases. CAT is publicly available on GitHub, promoting accessibility and collaboration.</description>

      <title>IPA: Class 0 Protostars Viewed in CO Emission Using JWST</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.07807v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the bright CO fundamental emission in the central regions of five protostars in their primary mass assembly phase using new observations from JWST's Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) and Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI). CO line emission images and fluxes are extracted for a forest of $\sim$150 ro-vibrational transitions from two vibrational bands, $v=1-0$ and $v=2-1$. However, ${}^{13}$CO is undetected, indicating that ${}^{12}$CO emission is optically thin. We use H$_2$ emission lines to correct fluxes for extinction and then construct rotation diagrams for the CO lines with the highest spectral resolution and sensitivity to estimate rotational temperatures and numbers of CO molecules. Two distinct rotational temperature components are required for $v=1$ ($\sim600$ to 1000 K and 2000 to $\sim 10^4$ K), while one hotter component is required for $v=2$ ($\gtrsim 3500$ K). ${}^{13}$CO is depleted compared to the abundances found in the ISM, indicating selective UV photodissociation of ${}^{13}$CO; therefore, UV radiative pumping may explain the higher rotational temperatures in $v=2$. The average vibrational temperature is $\sim 1000$ K for our sources and is similar to the lowest rotational temperature components. Using the measured rotational and vibrational temperatures to infer a total number of CO molecules, we find that the total gas masses range from lower limits of $\sim10^{22}$ g for the lowest mass protostars to $\sim 10^{26}$ g for the highest mass protostars. Our gas mass lower limits are compatible with those in more evolved systems, which suggest the lowest rotational temperature component comes from the inner disk, scattered into our line of sight, but we also cannot exclude the contribution to the CO emission from disk winds for higher mass targets.</description>

      <title>Almost All Carbon/Oxygen White Dwarfs Can Host Double Detonations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19417v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Double detonations of sub-Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarfs (WDs) in unstably mass-transferring double WD binaries have become one of the leading contenders to explain most Type Ia supernovae. However, past theoretical studies of the explosion process have assumed relatively ad hoc initial conditions for the helium shells in which the double detonations begin. In this work, we construct realistic C/O WDs to use as the starting points for multidimensional double detonation simulations. We supplement these with simplified one-dimensional detonation calculations to gain a physical understanding of the conditions under which shell detonations can propagate successfully. We find that C/O WDs &lt; 1.0 Msol, which make up the majority of C/O WDs, are born with structures that can support double detonations. More massive C/O WDs require ~1e-3 Msol of accretion before detonations can successfully propagate in their shells, but such accretion may be common in the double WD binaries that host massive WDs. Our findings strongly suggest that if the direct impact accretion stream reaches high enough temperatures and densities during mass transfer from one WD to another, the accreting WD will undergo a double detonation. Furthermore, if the companion is also a C/O WD &lt; 1.0 Msol, it will undergo its own double detonation when impacted by the ejecta from the first explosion. Exceptions to this outcome may explain the newly discovered class of hypervelocity supernova survivors.</description>

      <title>X-Ray Flashes on Helium Novae</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02947v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A helium nova occurs on a white dwarf (WD) accreting hydrogen-deficient matter from a helium star companion. When the mass of a helium envelope on the WD reaches a critical value, unstable helium burning ignites to trigger a nova outburst. A bright soft X-ray phase appears in an early outbursting phase of a helium nova before it optically rises toward maximum. Such an X-ray bright phase is called the X-ray flash. We present theoretical light curves of X-ray flashes for 1.0, 1.2, and 1.35 $M_\odot$ helium novae with mass accretion rates of $(1.6-7.5) \times 10^{-7}~M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. Long durations of the X-ray flashes (100 days to 10 years) and high X-ray luminosities ($\sim 10^{38}$ erg s$^{-1}$) indicate that X-ray flashes are detectable as a new type of X-ray transients or persistent X-ray sources. An X-ray flash is a precursor of optical brightening, so that the detection of X-ray flashes on helium novae enables us to plan arranged observation for optical pre-maximum phases that have been one of the frontiers of nova study. We found a candidate object of helium-burning X-ray flash from literature on extra-galactic X-ray surveys. This X-ray transient source is consistent with our X-ray flash model of a $1.35 ~M_\odot$ WD.</description>

      <title>Cepheid Metallicity in the Leavitt Law (C- MetaLL) survey: VI: Radial abundance gradients of 29 chemical species in the Milky Way Disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17299v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Classical Cepheids (DCEPs) are crucial for calibrating the extragalactic distance ladder, ultimately enabling the determination of the Hubble constant through the PL and PW relations they exhibit. Hence it's vital to understand how the PL and PW relations depend on metallicity. This is the purpose of the C-MetaLL survey within which this work is situated. DCEPs are also very important tracers of the young populations placed along the Galactic disc. We aim to enlarge the sample of DCEPs with accurate abundances from high-resolution spectroscopy. Our goal is to extend the range of measured metallicities towards the metal-poor regime to better cover the parameter space. We observed objects in a wide range of Galactocentric radii, allowing us to study in detail the abundance gradients present in the Galactic disc. We present the results of the analysis of 331 spectra obtained for 180 individual DCEPs with a variety of high-resolution spectrographs. We derived accurate atmospheric parameters, radial velocities, and abundances for up to 29 different species. The iron abundances range between 0.5 and -1 dex with a rather homogeneous distribution in metallicity. The sample presented in this paper was complemented with that already published in the context of the C-MetaLL survey, resulting in a total of 292 pulsators whose spectra have been analysed in a homogeneous way. These data were used to study the abundance gradients of the Galactic disc in a range of Galactocentric radii spanning the range 5-20 kpc. For most of the elements we found a clear negative gradient, with a slope of -0.071\pm0.003 dex kpc^-1 for [Fe/H] case. Through a qualitative fit with the Galactic spiral arms we shown how our farthest targets (R_GC&gt;10 kpc) trace both the Outer and OSC arms. The homogeneity of the sample will be of pivotal importance for the study of the metallicity dependance of the DCEP PL relations.</description>

      <title>Application of Kaluza-Klein Theory in Modeling Compact Stars: Exploring Extra Dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16497v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A theoretical framework for calculating the mass-radius curve of compact stars in the Kaluza-Klein space-time is introduced, with one additional compact spatial dimension. Static, spherically symmetric solutions are considered, with the equation of state provided by a zero temperature, interacting multidimensional Fermi gas. To model the strong force between baryons, a repulsive potential is introduced, which is linear in the particle number density. The maximal mass of compact stars is calculated for different model parameters, and with a physical parameter choice, it satisfies observational data, meaning that it is possible to model simple, realistic objects within this framework. Based on this comparison, a limiting size for the observational regime of extra dimensions in compact stars is provided, with $r_c \gtrsim 0.2$~fm.</description>

      <title>Mapping radial abundance gradients with Gaia-ESO open clusters: Evidence of recent gas accretion in the Milky Way disk</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17395v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Context. Recent evidences from spectroscopic surveys point towards the presence of a metal-poor, young stellar population in the chemical thin disk. In this context, the investigation of the spatial distribution and time evolution of precise, unbiased abundances is fundamental to disentangle the scenarios of evolution of the Galaxy. Aims. We study the evolution of abundance gradients in the Milky Way by taking advantage of a large sample of open clusters, which are among the best tracers for this purpose. In particular, we use data from the last release of the Gaia-ESO survey. Methods. We perform careful selection of open cluster stars excluding those that may be affected by biases in spectral analysis. The cleaned open clusters sample is compared with detailed chemical evolution models for the Milky Way, using well tested stellar yields and prescription for radial migration. Different scenarios of Galaxy evolution are tested to explain the data, i.e. the two-infall and the three-infall frameworks, suggesting that the chemical thin disk is formed by one or two subsequent gas accretion episodes, respectively. Results. With the performed selection in cluster stars, we still find a metallicity decrease between intermediate age (1&lt;Age/Gyr&lt;3) and young (Age&lt;1Gyr) open clusters. This decrease cannot be explained in the context of the two-infall scenario, even by accounting for the effect of migration and yield prescriptions. The three-infall model, with its late gas accretion in the last 3 Gyr, can explain the low metallic content in young clusters. However, we invoke a milder metal dilution relative to previous findings. Conclusions. To explain the observed low metallic content in young clusters, we propose that a late gas accretion episode triggering metal dilution should have taken place, extending the framework of the three-infall model for the first time to the entire Galactic disk.</description>

      <title>The K2-24 planetary system revisited by CHEOPS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02995v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: K2-24 is a planetary system composed of two transiting low-density Neptunians locked in an almost perfect 2:1 resonance and showing large TTVs, i.e., an excellent laboratory to search for signatures of planetary migration. Previous studies performed with K2, Spitzer and RV data tentatively claimed a significant non-zero eccentricity for one or both planets, possibly high enough to challenge the scenario of pure disk migration through resonant capture. With 13 new CHEOPS light curves (seven of planet -b, six of planet -c), we carried out a global photometric and dynamical (RV+TTV) re-analysis by including all the available literature data as well. We got the most accurate set of planetary parameters to date for the K2-24 system, including radii and masses at 1% and 5% precision (now essentially limited by the uncertainty on stellar parameters) and non-zero eccentricities $e_b=0.0498_{-0.0018}^{+0.0011}$, $e_c=0.0282_{-0.0007}^{+0.0003}$ detected at very high significance for both planets. Such relatively large values imply the need for an additional physical mechanism of eccentricity excitation during or after the migration stage. Also, while the accuracy of the previous TTV model had drifted by up to 0.5 days at the current time, we constrained the orbital solution firmly enough to predict the forthcoming transits for the next ~15 years, thus enabling an efficient follow-up with top-level facilities such as JWST or ESPRESSO.</description>
