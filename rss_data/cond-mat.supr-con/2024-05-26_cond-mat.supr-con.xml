      <title>The magic angle of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$: optimizing correlation-driven superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fundamental understanding of unconventional superconductivity is crucial for engineering materials with specific order parameters or elevated superconducting transition temperatures. However, for many of these materials, such as Sr$_2$RuO$_4$, the pairing mechanism and the symmetry of the superconducting order parameter remain unclear; furthermore, reliable and efficient methods of predicting their response to tuning - e.g. via structural distortions through strain and octahedral rotations - are lacking. Here we investigate the response of superconductivity in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ to distortions via two numerical techniques, the random phase approximation (RPA) and functional renormalization group (FRG), starting from realistic models of the electronic structure. Comparison of the results from the two techniques suggests that RPA misses the important interplay of competing fluctuation channels, while FRG reproduces key experimental findings. In accordance with earlier studies by RPA and FRG, we confirm the experimentally observed tuneability of $T_c$ with uniaxial strain. With octahedral rotation, we find an even larger increase of $T_c$ before superconductivity is completely suppressed in FRG, a finding that confirms experiments but is not reproduced in RPA. Throughout the parameter space investigated here, we find a dominant $d_{x^2-y^2}$ pairing symmetry from FRG. To provide benchmark results for determining the pairing symmetry experimentally by quasiparticle interference using a Scanning Tunneling Microscope, we introduce the pairing interactions into continuum local density of states calculations, enabling experimental verification of the symmetry of the order parameter via phase-referenced Bogoliubov Quasiparticle Interference imaging.</description>

      <title>Determination of the magnetic penetration depth with measurements of vortex-penetration field for type-II superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a known distribution of the Meissner currents over the surface of an infinitely long superconducting slab with a rectangular cross section, we find an applied magnetic field at which vortices begin to penetrate into the superconductor. This vortex-penetration field is determined by an interplay of the geometrical and Bean-Livingston barriers. The obtained results enable one to find the lower critical field and the London penetration depth from measurements of the magnetic induction on the surface of the superconducting slab, using, e.g., the micro-Hall probes.</description>

      <title>Interfacially enhanced superconductivity in Fe(Te,Se)/Bi4Te3 heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Realizing topological superconductivity by integrating high-transition-temperature ($T_C$) superconductors with topological insulators can open new paths for quantum computing applications. Here, we report a new approach for increasing the superconducting transition temperature ($T_{C}^{onset}$) by interfacing the unconventional superconductor Fe(Te,Se) with the topological insulator Bi-Te system in the low-Se doping regime, near where superconductivity vanishes in the bulk. The critical finding is that the $T_{C}^{onset}$ of Fe(Te,Se) increases from nominally non-superconducting to as high as 12.5 K when $Bi_2Te_3$ is replaced with the topological phase $Bi_4Te_3$. Interfacing Fe(Te,Se) with $Bi_4Te_3$ is also found to be critical for stabilizing superconductivity in monolayer films where $T_{C}^{onset}$ can be as high as 6 K. Measurements of the electronic and crystalline structure of the $Bi_4Te_3$ layer reveal that a large electron transfer, epitaxial strain, and novel chemical reduction processes are critical factors for the enhancement of superconductivity. This novel route for enhancing $T_C$ in an important epitaxial system provides new insight on the nature of interfacial superconductivity and a platform to identify and utilize new electronic phases.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent evaluation of proximity and inverse proximity effects with pair-breaking in diffusive SN junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a planar superconducting-normal-metal (SN) junction with both inelastic and spin-flip scattering processes present. In the diffusive limit, we use a one-dimensional formulation of the Usadel equation to compute the self-consistent energy dependence of the single-particle density of states as a function of distance from the interface on both the superconducting and metallic sides for various spatial profiles of a pair-breaking spin-flip term. The pair-breaking processes fill in the superconducting gap at zero energy, which is reflected in the zero-bias tunneling conductance in scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy experiments, in the vicinity of the junction. We also investigate the impact of having a partially transparent interface at the junction. We compare our findings with the observed exponential rise in the zero-bias conductance at the 1H step edge in recent experiments on 4Hb-TaS$_2$ [A. K. Nayak et al., Nat. Phys. 17, 1413 (2021)].</description>

      <title>Interaction-induced strong zero modes in short quantum dot chains with time-reversal symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically explore the emergence of strong zero modes in a two-site chain consisting of two quantum dots coupled due to a central dot that mediates electron hopping and singlet superconducting pairing. In the presence of time-reversal symmetry, the on-site Coulomb interaction leads to a three-fold ground-state degeneracy when tuning the system to a sweet spot as a function of the inter-dot couplings. This degeneracy is protected against changes of the dot energies in the same way as "poor man's'' Majorana bound states in short Kitaev chains. In the limit of strong interactions, this protection is maximal and the entire spectrum becomes triply degenerate, indicating the emergence of a ''poor man's'' version of a strong zero mode. We explain the degeneracy and protection by constructing corresponding Majorana Kramers-pair operators and $\mathbb{Z}_3$-parafermion operators. The strong zero modes share many properties of Majorana bound states in short Kitaev chains, including the stability of zero-bias peaks in the conductance and the behavior upon coupling to an additional quantum dot. However, they can be distinguished through finite-bias spectroscopy and the exhibit a different behavior when scaling to longer chains.</description>

      <title>Pair correlations of the hybridized orbitals in a ladder model for the bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04304v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To clarify the nature of high-temperature superconductivity in the bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under pressure, we investigate, using the density-matrix renormalization group method, the pair correlations in the two-orbital $t$-$J$ ladder model. While the interchain-intraorbital pair correlations exhibit a slow power-law decay in both orbitals, the interorbital pair correlation also develops strongly enough to be comparable with the intraorbital correlations. These intra and interorbital pair correlations are enhanced by Hund's coupling, but more importantly, the interorbital pair correlation develops even when interorbital pairing glue mediated by Hund's coupling is absent. Our finding suggests that the pair correlation in the present system develops as a hybridized two-orbital entity, which may have some implications on the superconductivity in the bilayer nickelate.</description>

      <title>Measurements of the first-flux-penetration field in surface-treated and coated Nb: Distinguishing between surface pinning and an interface energy barrier</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15500v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report measurements of the first-flux-penetration field in surface-treated and coated Nb samples using muon spin rotation ($\mu$SR). Using thin Ag foils as energy moderators for the implanted muon spin-probes, we "profile" the vortex penetration field $\mu_{0} H_{\mathrm{vp}}$ at sub-surface depths on the order of $\sim 10$ $\mathrm{\mu}$m to $\sim 100$ $\mathrm{\mu}$m. In a coated sample [Nb$_3$Sn(2 $\mathrm{\mu}$m)/Nb], we find that $\mu_{0} H_{\mathrm{vp}}$ is depth-independent with a value of 234.5(35) mT, consistent with Nb's metastable superheating field and suggestive of surface energy barrier for flux penetration. Conversely, in a surface-treated sample [Nb baked in vacuum at 120 $^{\circ}$C for 48 h], vortex penetration onsets close to pure Nb's lower critical field $\mu_{0}H_\mathrm{c1} \approx 170$ mT, but increases with increasing implantation depth, consistent with flux-pinning localized at the surface. The implication of these results for technical applications of superconducting Nb, such as superconducting radio frequency (SRF) cavities, is discussed.</description>

      <title>Mean-field theory of first-order quantum superconductor-insulator transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08571v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent experimental studies on strongly disordered indium oxide films have revealed an unusual first-order quantum phase transition between the superconducting and insulating states (SIT). This transition is characterized by a discontinuous jump from non-zero to zero values of superfluid stiffness at the critical point, contradicting the conventional ``scaling scenario'' typically associated with SIT. In this paper, we present a theoretical framework for understanding this first-order transition. Our approach is based on the concept of competition between two fundamentally distinct ground states that arise from electron pairs initially localized by strong disorder: the superconducting state and the Coulomb glass insulator. These ground states are distinguished by two crucially different order parameters, suggesting a natural expectation of a discontinuous transition between them at $T=0$. This transition occurs when the magnitudes of the superconducting gap $\Delta$ and the Coulomb gap $E_C$ become comparable. Additionally, we extend our analysis to low non-zero temperatures and provide a mean-field ``phase diagram'' in the plane of $(T/\Delta,E_C/\Delta)$. Our results reveal the existence of a natural upper bound for the kinetic inductance of strongly disordered superconductors.</description>

      <title>Describing heat dissipation in the resistive state of three-dimensional superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10415v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we study the role of the heat diffusion equation in simulating the resistive state of superconducting films. By analyzing the current-voltage and current-resistance characteristic curves for temperatures close to $T_c$ and various heat removal scenarios, we demonstrate that heat diffusion notably influences the behavior of the resistive state, specially near the transition to the normal state, where heat significantly changes the critical current and the calculated resistance. Furthermore, we show how the efficiency of the substrate has important effects in the dynamics of the system, particularly for lower temperatures. Finally, we investigate the hysteresis loops, the role of the film thickness and of the Ginzburg-Landau parameter, the findings accounting for heat diffusion in accurately modeling the resistive state of superconducting films and provide valuable insights into its complex dynamics. To accomplish these findings, we have used the $3D$ generalized Ginzburg-Landau equation coupled with the heat diffusion equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10656v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Josephson effect in a superconductor/altermagnet/superconductor (S/AM/S) junction. We find anomalous phenomena including $0$-$\pi$ transition as well as multi-nodal current-phase relations. Similar to $d$-wave superconductor, $d$-wave altermagnet can support $\varphi$ junction where free energy minima locate neither $\varphi=0$ nor $\pm \pi$ with double degeneracy. These properties can be tunable by parameters, e.g., the exchange energy, the orientation of crystal axis, the length, and the applied gate voltage of altermagnet. These rich features lead to accessible functionality of S/AM/S junction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13405v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Landau Fermi liquid theory, a cornerstone in condensed matter physics, encounters limitations in explaining certain phenomena, like the peculiar behavior of strange metals in high-temperature superconductors. Non-Fermi liquids, like Bose metals with uncondensed bosonic ground state, offer potential explanations, yet constructing an elusive Bose metal phase in two dimensions (2D) remains a formidable challenge. Utilizing constraint path quantum Monte Carlo and functional renormalization group methods on a fermionic system with spin anisotropy in a 2D lattice, we reveal the emergence of a Cooper pair Bose metal in a highly anisotropic regime (a &lt; 0.30) with wide range of filling, most notably at a filling fraction of n~0.8. Our findings exhibit a visible nonzero momentum Bose surface in the Cooper-pair distribution function, accompanied by a distinct signal of dxy correlation between pairs. Our results highlight that spin-dependent anisotropy in the Fermi surface leads to versatile pairing forms. Platforms such as ultracold atoms in optical lattices and recently proposed altermagnets hold promise for realizing this intriguing phase.</description>

      <title>Exceptionally Slow, Long Range, and Non-Gaussian Critical Fluctuations Dominate the Charge Density Wave Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.09756v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: $(TaSe_4)_2I$ is a well-studied quasi-one-dimensional compound long-known to have a charge-density wave (CDW) transition around 263 K. We argue that the critical fluctuations of the pinned CDW order parameter near the transition can be inferred from the resistance noise on account of their coupling to the dissipative normal carriers. Remarkably, the critical fluctuations of the CDW order parameter are slow enough to survive the thermodynamic limit and dominate the low-frequency resistance noise. The noise variance and relaxation time show rapid growth (critical opalescence and critical slowing down) within a temperature window of $ \varepsilon \approx \pm 0.1$, where $\varepsilon$ is the reduced temperature. This is very wide but consistent with the Ginzburg criterion. We further show that this resistance noise can be quantitatively used to extract the associated critical exponents. Below $|\varepsilon | \lesssim 0.02$, we observe a crossover from mean-field to a fluctuation-dominated regime with the critical exponents taking anomalously low values. The distribution of fluctuations in the critical transition region is skewed and strongly non-Gaussian. This non-Gaussianity is interpreted as the breakdown of the validity of the central limit theorem as the diverging coherence volume becomes comparable to the macroscopic sample size. The large magnitude critical fluctuations observed over an extended temperature range, as well as the crossover from the mean-field to the fluctuation-dominated regime highlight the role of the quasi-one dimensional character in controlling the phase transition.</description>
