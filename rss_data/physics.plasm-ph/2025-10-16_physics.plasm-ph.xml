      <title>Narrow Operator Models of Stellarator Equilibria in Fourier Zernike Basis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical computation of the ideal Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equilibrium magnetic field is at the base of stellarator optimisation and provides the starting point for solving more sophisticated Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) like transport or turbulence models. Conventional approaches solve for a single stationary point of the ideal MHD equations, which is fully defined by three invariants and the numerical scheme employed by the solver. We present the first numerical approach that can solve for a continuous distribution of equilibria with fixed boundary and rotational transform, varying only the pressure invariant. This approach minimises the force residual by optimising parameters of multilayer perceptrons (MLP) that map from a scalar pressure multiplier to the Fourier Zernike basis as implemented in the modern stellarator equilibrium solver DESC.</description>

      <title>Unified kinetic theory of induced scattering: Compton, Brillouin, and Raman processes in magnetized electron and positron pair plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a unified theoretical framework for induced (stimulated) scattering-parametric instabilities of electromagnetic waves, including induced Compton, stimulated Brillouin, and stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) in strongly magnetized electron-positron pair plasma. By solving the dispersion relations derived from kinetic theory, taking into account the ponderomotive force due to the beat of incident and scattered waves, we obtain analytical expressions for the linear growth rates of the ordinary, neutral, and charged modes of density fluctuations. Our results clarify which type of scattering dominates under different thermal coupling, resonance, and density conditions. In strong magnetic fields, scattering of perpendicularly polarized waves is generally suppressed, but by different powers of the cyclotron frequency. Moreover, SRS, which is forbidden in unmagnetized electron and positron pair plasma, becomes possible in the charged mode. This framework enables a comprehensive evaluation of induced scattering in extreme astrophysical and laboratory plasma, such as fast radio burst (FRB) emission and propagation in magnetar magnetospheres.</description>

      <title>Plasma screening in mid-charged ions observed by K-shell line emission</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06233v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dense plasma environment affects the electronic structure of ions via variations of the microscopic electrical fields, also known as plasma screening. This effect can be either estimated by simplified analytical models, or by computationally expensive and to date unverified numerical calculations. We have experimentally quantified plasma screening from the energy shifts of the bound-bound transitions in matter driven by the x-ray free electron laser (XFEL). This was enabled by identification of detailed electronic configurations of the observed K{\alpha}, K\b{eta} and K{\gamma} lines. This work paves the way for improving plasma screening models including connected effects like ionization potential depression and continuum lowering, which will advance the understanding of atomic physics in Warm Dense Matter regime.</description>

      <title>Surrogate Models studies for laser-plasma accelerator electron source design through numerical optimisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15845v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Designing a high-quality plasma injector electron source driven by a laser beam relies on numerical parametric studies using particle-in-cell codes. The common input parameters to explore are laser characteristics, plasma species and density profiles produced by computational fluid dynamic studies. We demonstrate the construction of surrogate models using machine learning techniques for a laser-plasma injector (LPI) based on more than $3000$ particle-in-cell simulations of laser wakefield acceleration performed for sparsely spaced input parameters published by Drobniak [Phys. Rev. Accel. Beams, 26, 091302, (2023)]. Surrogate models are relevant for LPI design and optimisation, as they are approximately $10^7$ times faster than PIC simulations. Their speed enables more efficient design studies by allowing extensive exploration of the input-output relationship without significant computational cost. We develop and compare the performance of three surrogate models, namely, multilayer perceptron (MLP), decision trees (DT) and Gaussian processes (GP). We show that using a simple and frugal MLP-based model trained on a reasonable-size random scan data set of 500 particles in cell simulations, we can predict beam parameters with a coefficient determination score $R^2=0.93$ . The best surrogate model is used to quickly find optimal working points and stability regions and get targeted electron beam energy, charge, energy spread and emittance using different methods, namely random search, Bayesian optimisation and multi-objective Bayesian optimisation. This simple approach can serve more global design study of an LPI in a start-to-end linear laser-driven accelerator.on beam energy, charge and energy spread using different methods, namely random search, Bayesian optimisation and multi-objective Bayesian optimisation</description>

      <title>Machine-learning Closure for Vlasov-Poisson Dynamics in Fourier-Hermite Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13313v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate reduced models of turbulence are desirable to facilitate the optimization of magnetic-confinement fusion reactor designs. As a first step toward higher-dimensional turbulence applications, we use reservoir computing, a machine-learning (ML) architecture, to develop a closure model for a limiting case of electrostatic gyrokinetics. We implement a pseudo-spectral Eulerian code to solve the one-dimensional Vlasov-Poisson system on a basis of Fourier modes in configuration space and Hermite polynomials in velocity space. When cast onto the Hermite basis, the Vlasov equation becomes an infinitely coupled hierarchy of fluid moments, presenting a closure problem. We exploit the locality of interactions in the Hermite representation to introduce an ML closure model of the small-scale dynamics in velocity space. In the linear limit, when the kinetic Fourier-Hermite solver is augmented with the reservoir closure, the closure permits a reduction of the velocity resolution, with a relative error within two percent for the Hermite moment where the reservoir closes the hierarchy. In the strongly-nonlinear regime, the ML closure model more accurately resolves the low-order Fourier and Hermite spectra when compared to a na\"{i}ve closure by truncation and reduces the required velocity resolution by a factor of sixteen.</description>

      <title>High brightness multi-MeV photon source driven by a petawatt-scale laser wakefield accelerator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23718v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an experimental demonstration of a bright multi-MeV gamma source driven by a petawatt laser. The source generates on average $(1.2\pm0.6)\times10^9$ photons above 1 MeV per pulse, exceeding those of previous all-optical sources by a hundred times, and reached a peak spectral brightness of $(3.9 \pm 1.5)\times 10^{22}$ photons/mm$^2$/mrad$^2$/s/0.1%BW at $\epsilon_\gamma\approx11$ MeV. The source was produced by inverse Compton scattering of a laser wakefield accelerated GeV electron beam and its back-reflected driving laser pulse. Its performance is well described by a simple model of the laser and electron properties at the collision point that allows quantitative predictions and identifies clear strategies to further enhance radiation efficiency. Our results highlight the promise of this source for fundamental physics studies, as well as for applications of nuclear resonance fluorescence and nuclear transmutation.</description>

      <title>Long Living Hot and Dense Plasma from Relativistic Laser-Nanowire Array Interaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.09437v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Long-living, hot and dense plasmas generated by ultra-intense laser beams are of critical importance for laser-driven nuclear physics, bright hard X-ray sources, and laboratory astrophysics. We report the experimental observation of plasmas with nanosecond-scale lifetimes, near-solid density, and keV-level temperatures, produced by irradiating periodic arrays of composite nanowires with ultra-high contrast, relativistically intense femtosecond laser pulses. Jet-like plasma structures extending up to 1~mm from the nanowire surface were observed, emitting K-shell radiation from He-like Ti$^{20+}$ ions. High-resolution X-ray spectra were analyzed using 3D Particle-in-Cell (PIC) simulations of the laser-plasma interaction combined with collisional--radiative modeling (FLYCHK). The results indicate that the jets consist of plasma with densities of $10^{20}$-$10^{22}$ cm$^{-3}$ and keV-scale temperatures, persisting for several nanoseconds. We attribute the formation of these jets to the generation of kiloTesla-scale global magnetic fields during the laser interaction, as predicted by PIC simulations. These fields may drive long-timescale current instabilities that sustain magnetic fields of several hundred tesla, sufficient to confine hot, dense plasma over nanosecond durations.</description>

      <title>Investigating Solid-Fluid Phase Coexistence in DC Plasma Bilayer Crystals: The Role of Particle Pairing and Mode Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09491v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article presents a detailed investigation of solid-fluid phase coexistence in a bilayer dusty plasma crystal subjected to varying confinement ring bias voltages in a DC glow discharge argon plasma. Melamine formaldehyde particles were employed to form a stable, hexagonally ordered bilayer crystal within a confinement ring electrically isolated from the grounded cathode. By systematically adjusting the confinement ring bias, a distinct phase coexistence emerged: it is characterized by a fluid-like melted core surrounded by a solid crystalline periphery. Crucially, analysis of the phonon spectra revealed frequency shifts that deviate significantly from the predictions of classical monolayer Mode-Coupling Instability (MCI) theory. Stability analysis further demonstrated that dynamic interlayer particle pairing and non-reciprocal interactions play a pivotal role in destabilizing the bilayer structure. These findings highlight previously underappreciated mechanisms driving the melting transition in bilayer dusty plasmas, offering a more comprehensive understanding of phase behavior in complex plasma systems. The results underscore the importance of interlayer coupling and confinement effects in tuning structural transitions.</description>

      <title>Experimental evidence of production of directional muons from a laser-wakefield accelerator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20904v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report on experimental evidence of the generation of directional muons from a laser-wakefield accelerator driven by a PW-class laser. The muons were generated following the interaction of a GeV-scale high-charge electron beam with a 2cm-thick Pb target and were detected using a Timepix3 detector placed behind a suitable shielding configuration. Data analysis indicates a $(99.1\pm0.5)$% confidence of muon detection over noise, in excellent agreement with numerical modelling. Extrapolation of the experimental setup to higher electron energies and charges suggests the potential to guide and separate from noise approximately $10^4$ muons/s onto cm$^2$-scale areas for applications using a 10 Hz PW laser. These results demonstrate the possibility of generating and transporting directional muon beams using high-power lasers and establish a foundation for the systematic application of laser-driven high-energy muon beams.</description>

      <title>Galactic echoes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16512v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gaia has revealed a variety of substructures in the phase space of stars in the Solar neighborhood, including the vertical `Snail' in $(z,v_z)$ space. Such substructures are often interpreted as the incompletely phase-mixed response of the disc stars to a single perturbation, such as an impulsive encounter with a satellite galaxy. In this paper we consider the possibility that such structures contain manifestations of phase space echoes. First established in plasma physics in the 1960s, echoes arise when a collisionless system is perturbed twice: the macroscopic responses to both perturbations mix to small scales in phase space, whereupon they couple nonlinearly, producing a third macroscopic `echo' response without the need for a third perturbation. We derive the galactic analogue of the plasma echo theory using angle-action variables and apply it to a one-dimensional model of vertical motion in the Milky Way. We verify the predicted echo behavior using idealized test particle simulations, both with and without the inclusion of diffusion through orbital scattering off molecular clouds. While we conclude that the Gaia Snail itself is unlikely a (pure) echo effect, the basic physics we uncover is sufficiently generic that we expect phase-space echoes to be common in disc galaxies.</description>
