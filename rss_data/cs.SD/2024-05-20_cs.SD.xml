      <title>DAC-JAX: A JAX Implementation of the Descript Audio Codec</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an open-source implementation of the Descript Audio Codec (DAC) using Google's JAX ecosystem of Flax, Optax, Orbax, AUX, and CLU. Our codebase enables the reuse of model weights from the original PyTorch DAC, and we confirm that the two implementations produce equivalent token sequences and decoded audio if given the same input. We provide a training and fine-tuning script which supports device parallelism, although we have only verified it using brief training runs with a small dataset. Even with limited GPU memory, the original DAC can compress or decompress a long audio file by processing it as a sequence of overlapping "chunks." We implement this feature in JAX and benchmark the performance on two types of GPUs. On a consumer-grade GPU, DAC-JAX outperforms the original DAC for compression and decompression at all chunk sizes. However, on a high-performance, cluster-based GPU, DAC-JAX outperforms the original DAC for small chunk sizes but performs worse for large chunks.</description>

      <title>Neighborhood Attention Transformer with Progressive Channel Fusion for Speaker Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformer-based architectures for speaker verification typically require more training data than ECAPA-TDNN. Therefore, recent work has generally been trained on VoxCeleb1&amp;2. We propose a backbone network based on self-attention, which can achieve competitive results when trained on VoxCeleb2 alone. The network alternates between neighborhood attention and global attention to capture local and global features, then aggregates features of different hierarchical levels, and finally performs attentive statistical pooling. Additionally, we employ a progressive channel fusion strategy to expand the receptive field in the channel dimension as the network deepens. We trained the proposed PCF-NAT model on VoxCeleb2 and evaluated it on VoxCeleb1 and the validation sets of VoxSRC. The EER and minDCF of the shallow PCF-NAT are on average more than 20% lower than those of similarly sized ECAPA-TDNN. Deep PCF-NAT achieves an EER lower than 0.5% on VoxCeleb1-O.</description>

      <title>AudioSetMix: Enhancing Audio-Language Datasets with LLM-Assisted Augmentations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-modal learning in the audio-language domain has seen significant advancements in recent years. However, audio-language learning faces challenges due to limited and lower-quality data compared to image-language tasks. Existing audio-language datasets are notably smaller, and manual labeling is hindered by the need to listen to entire audio clips for accurate labeling.
  Our method systematically generates audio-caption pairs by augmenting audio clips with natural language labels and corresponding audio signal processing operations. Leveraging a Large Language Model, we generate descriptions of augmented audio clips with a prompt template. This scalable method produces AudioSetMix, a high-quality training dataset for text-and-audio related models.
  Integration of our dataset improves models performance on benchmarks by providing diversified and better-aligned examples. Notably, our dataset addresses the absence of modifiers (adjectives and adverbs) in existing datasets. By enabling models to learn these concepts, and generating hard negative examples during training, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Multi-speaker Text-to-speech Training with Speaker Anonymized Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The trend of scaling up speech generation models poses a threat of biometric information leakage of the identities of the voices in the training data, raising privacy and security concerns. In this paper, we investigate training multi-speaker text-to-speech (TTS) models using data that underwent speaker anonymization (SA), a process that tends to hide the speaker identity of the input speech while maintaining other attributes. Two signal processing-based and three deep neural network-based SA methods were used to anonymize VCTK, a multi-speaker TTS dataset, which is further used to train an end-to-end TTS model, VITS, to perform unseen speaker TTS during the testing phase. We conducted extensive objective and subjective experiments to evaluate the anonymized training data, as well as the performance of the downstream TTS model trained using those data. Importantly, we found that UTMOS, a data-driven subjective rating predictor model, and GVD, a metric that measures the gain of voice distinctiveness, are good indicators of the downstream TTS performance. We summarize insights in the hope of helping future researchers determine the goodness of the SA system for multi-speaker TTS training.</description>

      <title>Images that Sound: Composing Images and Sounds on a Single Canvas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spectrograms are 2D representations of sound that look very different from the images found in our visual world. And natural images, when played as spectrograms, make unnatural sounds. In this paper, we show that it is possible to synthesize spectrograms that simultaneously look like natural images and sound like natural audio. We call these spectrograms images that sound. Our approach is simple and zero-shot, and it leverages pre-trained text-to-image and text-to-spectrogram diffusion models that operate in a shared latent space. During the reverse process, we denoise noisy latents with both the audio and image diffusion models in parallel, resulting in a sample that is likely under both models. Through quantitative evaluations and perceptual studies, we find that our method successfully generates spectrograms that align with a desired audio prompt while also taking the visual appearance of a desired image prompt.

      <title>Multimodal Fish Feeding Intensity Assessment in Aquaculture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05058v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fish feeding intensity assessment (FFIA) aims to evaluate fish appetite changes during feeding, which is crucial in industrial aquaculture applications. Existing FFIA methods are limited by their robustness to noise, computational complexity, and the lack of public datasets for developing the models. To address these issues, we first introduce AV-FFIA, a new dataset containing 27,000 labeled audio and video clips that capture different levels of fish feeding intensity. Then, we introduce multi-modal approaches for FFIA by leveraging the models pre-trained on individual modalities and fused with data fusion methods. We perform benchmark studies of these methods on AV-FFIA, and demonstrate the advantages of the multi-modal approach over the single-modality based approach, especially in noisy environments. However, compared to the methods developed for individual modalities, the multimodal approaches may involve higher computational costs due to the need for independent encoders for each modality. To overcome this issue, we further present a novel unified mixed-modality based method for FFIA, termed as U-FFIA. U-FFIA is a single model capable of processing audio, visual, or audio-visual modalities, by leveraging modality dropout during training and knowledge distillation using the models pre-trained with data from single modality. We demonstrate that U-FFIA can achieve performance better than or on par with the state-of-the-art modality-specific FFIA models, with significantly lower computational overhead, enabling robust and efficient FFIA for improved aquaculture management.</description>

      <title>Multi-level Temporal-channel Speaker Retrieval for Zero-shot Voice Conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.07204v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Zero-shot voice conversion (VC) converts source speech into the voice of any desired speaker using only one utterance of the speaker without requiring additional model updates. Typical methods use a speaker representation from a pre-trained speaker verification (SV) model or learn speaker representation during VC training to achieve zero-shot VC. However, existing speaker modeling methods overlook the variation of speaker information richness in temporal and frequency channel dimensions of speech. This insufficient speaker modeling hampers the ability of the VC model to accurately represent unseen speakers who are not in the training dataset. In this study, we present a robust zero-shot VC model with multi-level temporal-channel retrieval, referred to as MTCR-VC. Specifically, to flexibly adapt to the dynamic-variant speaker characteristic in the temporal and channel axis of the speech, we propose a novel fine-grained speaker modeling method, called temporal-channel retrieval (TCR), to find out when and where speaker information appears in speech. It retrieves variable-length speaker representation from both temporal and channel dimensions under the guidance of a pre-trained SV model. Besides, inspired by the hierarchical process of human speech production, the MTCR speaker module stacks several TCR blocks to extract speaker representations from multi-granularity levels. Furthermore, to achieve better speech disentanglement and reconstruction, we introduce a cycle-based training strategy to simulate zero-shot inference recurrently. We adopt perpetual constraints on three aspects, including content, style, and speaker, to drive this process. Experiments demonstrate that MTCR-VC is superior to the previous zero-shot VC methods in modeling speaker timbre while maintaining good speech naturalness.</description>

      <title>Toward Deep Drum Source Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09663v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the past, the field of drum source separation faced significant challenges due to limited data availability, hindering the adoption of cutting-edge deep learning methods that have found success in other related audio applications. In this manuscript, we introduce StemGMD, a large-scale audio dataset of isolated single-instrument drum stems. Each audio clip is synthesized from MIDI recordings of expressive drums performances using ten real-sounding acoustic drum kits. Totaling 1224 hours, StemGMD is the largest audio dataset of drums to date and the first to comprise isolated audio clips for every instrument in a canonical nine-piece drum kit. We leverage StemGMD to develop LarsNet, a novel deep drum source separation model. Through a bank of dedicated U-Nets, LarsNet can separate five stems from a stereo drum mixture faster than real-time and is shown to significantly outperform state-of-the-art nonnegative spectro-temporal factorization methods.</description>

      <title>RALL-E: Robust Codec Language Modeling with Chain-of-Thought Prompting for Text-to-Speech Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03204v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present RALL-E, a robust language modeling method for text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis. While previous work based on large language models (LLMs) shows impressive performance on zero-shot TTS, such methods often suffer from poor robustness, such as unstable prosody (weird pitch and rhythm/duration) and a high word error rate (WER), due to the autoregressive prediction style of language models. The core idea behind RALL-E is chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, which decomposes the task into simpler steps to enhance the robustness of LLM-based TTS. To accomplish this idea, RALL-E first predicts prosody features (pitch and duration) of the input text and uses them as intermediate conditions to predict speech tokens in a CoT style. Second, RALL-E utilizes the predicted duration prompt to guide the computing of self-attention weights in Transformer to enforce the model to focus on the corresponding phonemes and prosody features when predicting speech tokens. Results of comprehensive objective and subjective evaluations demonstrate that, compared to a powerful baseline method VALL-E, RALL-E significantly improves the WER of zero-shot TTS from $5.6\%$ (without reranking) and $1.7\%$ (with reranking) to $2.5\%$ and $1.0\%$, respectively. Furthermore, we demonstrate that RALL-E correctly synthesizes sentences that are hard for VALL-E and reduces the error rate from $68\%$ to $4\%$.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Hallucination in Text, Image, Video, and Audio Foundation Models: A Comprehensive Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09589v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of foundation models (FMs) across language, image, audio, and video domains has shown remarkable capabilities in diverse tasks. However, the proliferation of FMs brings forth a critical challenge: the potential to generate hallucinated outputs, particularly in high-stakes applications. The tendency of foundation models to produce hallucinated content arguably represents the biggest hindrance to their widespread adoption in real-world scenarios, especially in domains where reliability and accuracy are paramount. This survey paper presents a comprehensive overview of recent developments that aim to identify and mitigate the problem of hallucination in FMs, spanning text, image, video, and audio modalities. By synthesizing recent advancements in detecting and mitigating hallucination across various modalities, the paper aims to provide valuable insights for researchers, developers, and practitioners. Essentially, it establishes a clear framework encompassing definition, taxonomy, and detection strategies for addressing hallucination in multimodal foundation models, laying the foundation for future research in this pivotal area.</description>
