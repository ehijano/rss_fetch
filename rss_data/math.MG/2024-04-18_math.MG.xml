      <title>Convex Sequence and Convex Polygon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we deal with the question; under what conditions the points $P_i(xi,yi)$ $(i = 1,\cdots, n)$ form a convex polygon provided $x_1 &lt; \cdots &lt; x_n$ holds. One of the main findings of the paper can be stated as follows: "Let $P_1(x_1,y_1),\cdots ,P_n(x_n,y_n)$ are $n$ distinct points ($n\geq3$) with $x_1&lt;\cdots&lt;x_n$. Then $\overline{P_1P_2},\cdots \overline{P_nP_1}$ form a convex $n$-gon that lies in the half-space \begin{equation*}{ \underline{\mathbb{H}}=\bigg\{(x,y)\big|\quad x\in\mathbb{R} \quad \mbox{and} \quad y\leq y_1+\bigg(\dfrac{x-x_1}{x_n-x_1}\bigg)(y_n-y_1)\bigg\}\subseteq{\mathbb{R}^{2}} } \end{equation*} if and only if the following inequality holds \begin{equation} \dfrac{y_i-y_{i-1}}{x_i-x_{i-1}} \leq \dfrac{y_{i+1}-y_{i}}{x_{i+1}-x_{i}} \quad \quad \mbox{for all} \quad \quad i\in\{2,\cdots,n-1\} ." \end{equation} Based on this result, we establish a linkage between the property of sequential convexity and convex polygon. We show that in a plane if any $n$ points are scattered in such a way that their horizontal and vertical distances preserve some specific monotonic properties; then those points form a $2$-dimensional convex polytope.</description>

      <title>Quantitative metric density and connectivity for sets of positive measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that in doubling, geodesic metric measure spaces (including, for example, Euclidean space), sets of positive measure have a certain large-scale metric density property. As an application, we prove that a set of positive measure in the unit cube of $\mathbb{R}^d$ can be decomposed into a controlled number of subsets that are "well-connected" within the original set, along with a "garbage set" of arbitrarily small measure. Our results are quantitative, i.e., they provide bounds independent of the particular set under consideration.</description>

      <title>Gromov-Hausdorff continuity of non-K\"ahler Calabi-Yau conifold transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the geometry of Calabi-Yau conifold transitions. This deformation process is known to possibly connect a K\"ahler threefold to a non-K\"ahler threefold. We use balanced and Hermitian-Yang-Mills metrics to geometrize the conifold transition and show that the whole operation is continuous in the Gromov-Hausdorff topology.</description>

      <title>Constructing metric spaces from systems of walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a general procedure for constructing metric spaces from systems of partitions. This generalises and provides analogues of Sageev's construction of dual CAT(0) cube complexes for the settings of hyperbolic and injective metric spaces.
  As applications, we produce a ``universal'' hyperbolic action for groups with strongly contracting elements, and show that many groups with ``coarsely cubical'' features admit geometric actions on injective metric spaces. In an appendix with Davide Spriano, we show that a large class of groups have an infinite-dimensional space of quasimorphisms.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic spaces that detect all strongly-contracting directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a geodesic metric space $X$, we construct a corresponding hyperbolic space, which we call the contraction space, that detects all strongly contracting directions in the following sense; a geodesic in $X$ is strongly contracting if and only if its parametrized image in the contraction space is a quasi-geodesic. If a finitely generated group $G$ acts geometrically on $X$, then all strongly-contracting elements act as WPD elements on the contraction space. If the space $X$ is CAT(0), or more generally Morse-dichotomous, that is if all Morse geodesics are strongly-contracting, then all generalized loxodromics act as WPD elements, implying that the action is what we call ``universally WPD''.</description>

      <title>Stability of Klartag's improved Lichnerowicz inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a recent work, Klartag gave an improved version of Lichnerowicz' spectral gap bound for uniformly log-concave measures, which improves on the classical estimate by taking into account the covariance matrix. We analyze the equality cases in Klartag's bound, showing that it can be further improved whenever the measure has no Gaussian factor. Additionally, we give a quantitative improvement for log-concave measures with finite Fisher information.</description>

      <title>Spaces of metrics are Baire</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04565v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a metrizable space, we consider the space of all metrics generating the same topology of the metrizable space, and this space of metrics is equipped with the supremum metric. In this paper, for every metrizable space, we establish that the space of metrics on the metrizable space is Baire. We also show that the set of all complete metrics is comeager in the space of metrics. Moreover, we investigate non--Archimedean analogues of these results.</description>

      <title>Coarse separation and large-scale geometry of wreath products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.18025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.18025v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we introduce and study a natural notion of coarse separation for metric spaces, with an emphasis on coarse separation by subspaces of polynomial or subexponential growth. For instance, we show that symmetric spaces of non-compact type different from $\mathbb{H}_\mathbb{R}^2$ and thick Euclidean buildings of rank $\geq 2$ cannot be coarsely separated by subspaces of subexponential growth; and that a connected nilpotent Lie group of growth degree $D \geq 2$ cannot be coarsely separated by a subspace of polynomial degree $\leq D-2$. We apply these results to the large-scale geometry of amalgamated free products and wreath products. The latter application is based on an Embedding Theorem that generalises previous work of the last two authors, and which is of independent interest. We also discuss some further applications to the distorsion of coarse embeddings between certain metric spaces.</description>

      <title>A unified approach to mass transference principle and large intersection property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00513v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The mass transference principle, discovered by Beresnevich and Velani [Ann Math (2), 2006], is a landmark result in Diophantine approximation that allows us to obtain the Hausdorff measure theory of $\limsup$ set. Another important tool is the notion of large intersection property, introduced and systematically studied by Falconer [J. Lond. Math. Soc. (2), 1994]. The former mainly focuses on passing between full (Lebesgue) measure and full Hausdorff measure statements, while the latter transfers full Hausdorff content statement to Hausdorff dimension. From this perspective, the proofs of the two results are quite similar but often treated in different ways.
  In this paper, we establish a general mass transference principle from the viewpoint of Hausdorff content, aiming to provide a unified proof for the aforementioned results. More precisely, this principle allows us to transfer the Hausdorff content bounds of a sequence of open sets $E_n$ to the full Hausdorff measure statement and large intersection property for $\limsup E_n$. One of the advantages of our approach is that the verification of the Hausdorff content bound does not require the construction of Cantor-like subset, resulting in a much simpler proof. As an application, we provide simpler proofs for several mass transference principles.</description>
