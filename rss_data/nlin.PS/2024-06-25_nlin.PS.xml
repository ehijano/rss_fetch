      <title>{Nonlinear lattices from the physics of ecosystems: The Lefever-Lejeune nonlinear lattice in $\mathbb{Z}^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We argue that the spatial discretization of the strongly nonlinear Lefever-Lejeune partial differential equation defines a nonlinear lattice that is physically relevant in the context of the nonlinear physics of ecosystems, modelling the dynamics of vegetation densities in dry lands. We study the system in the lattice $\mathbb{Z}^2$, which is especially relevant because of its natural dimension for the emergence of pattern formation. Theoretical results identify parametric regimes for the system that distinguish between extinction and potential convergence to non-trivial states. Importantly, we analytically identify conditions for Turing instability, detecting thresholds on the discretization parameter for the manifestation of this mechanism. Numerical simulations reveal the sharpness of the analytical conditions for instability and illustrate the rich potential for pattern formation even in the strongly discrete regime, emphasizing the importance of the interplay between higher dimensionality and discreteness.</description>

      <title>Stabilization of optical bubbles near the axis of a helical lightguide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is shown numerically that in a lightguide possessing a helical symmetry, stable solutions exist for the coupled nonlinear Schrodinger equations describing interaction between the left and the right circular polarizations of an optical wave in a defocusing Kerr medium with anomalous dispersion, in the form of stationary rotating oblong bubbles with attached several optical vortices. A bubble is an arbitrary long quasi-cylindrical three-dimensional cavity inside the first component, filled with the second component. At each of the two ends of the bubble, two stationary two-dimensional configurations are connected, in one of them only the first component with separated vortices is present while in the other one there is a single multiple vortex with a filled core. The cross-section of the lightguide, the screw pitch, the number of vortices, and the background intensity of the first component influence upon the profile of the bubble, but the total amount of the trapped second component does not.</description>

      <title>Deformation dynamics of an oil droplet into a crescent shape during the intermittent motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01161v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A paraffin droplet containing camphor and oil red O (dye) floating on the water surface shows spontaneous motion and deformation generated by the surface tension gradient around the droplet. We focused on the intermittent motion with a pronounced deformation into a crescent shape observed at specific concentrations of camphor and oil red O. We quantitatively analyzed the time changes in the droplet deformation and investigated the role of the oil red O by measuring the time-dependent paraffin/water interfacial tension with the pendant drop method. The observed effect can be explained by the active role of the oil red O molecules at the paraffin/water interface. The interfacial tension decreases gradually after the interface formation, allowing for the dynamic deformation of the droplet. The combination of the decrease in interfacial tension and the reduction in driving force related to camphor outflow generates intermittent motion with dynamic deformation into a crescent shape.</description>
