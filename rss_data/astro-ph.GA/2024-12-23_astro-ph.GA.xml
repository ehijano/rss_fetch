      <title>The effects of different cooling and heating function models on a simulated analog of NGC300</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gas cooling and heating rates are vital components of hydrodynamic simulations. However, they are computationally expensive to evaluate exactly with chemical networks or photoionization codes. We compare two different approximation schemes for gas cooling and heating in an idealized simulation of an isolated galaxy. One approximation is based on a polynomial interpolation of a table of Cloudy calculations, as is commonly done in galaxy formation simulations. The other approximation scheme uses machine learning for the interpolation instead on an analytic function, with improved accuracy. We compare the temperature-density phase diagrams of gas from each simulation run to assess how much the two simulation runs differ. Gas in the simulation using the machine learning approximation is systematically hotter for low-density gas with $-3 \lesssim \log{(n_b/\mathrm{cm}^{-3})} \lesssim -1$. We find a critical curve in the phase diagram where the two simulations have equal amounts of gas. The phase diagrams differ most strongly at temperatures just above and below this critical curve. We compare CII emission rates for collisions with various particles (integrated over the gas distribution function), and find slight differences between the two simulations. Future comparisons with simulations including radiative transfer will be necessary to compare observable quantities like the total CII luminosity.</description>

      <title>Deep view of the intracluster light in the Coma cluster of galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detection and study of the intracluster light in rich clusters of galaxies has been a problem of long standing challenge and interest. Using the lowest surface brightness images of the Coma cluster of galaxies in the g and r bands, from the Halos and Environment of Nearby Galaxies (HERON) Coma Cluster Project, we obtained the most extensive image of intracluster light (ICL) in a single cluster to date, spreading over 1.5 Mpc from the cluster core. The unprecedented wealth of spectroscopic data made publicly available by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Early Data Release, complemented with a compilation from the NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database and the literature, enabled the identification of 2,157 galaxy members within Coma, from which 42 distinct groups were identified. The synergy between these high-quality data allowed us to: 1) calculate ICL fractions of $19.9\pm0.5$\% and $19.6\pm0.6$\% in the g and r bands, respectively, consistent with a dynamically active cluster, 2) unveil Coma's faintest tidal features, and 3) provide a comprehensive picture of the dynamics and interactions within this complex system. Our findings indicate that the ICL connects several of these groups in a filamentous network, from which we infer the ongoing dynamical processes. In particular, we identified a faint stellar bridge linking the core of Coma with the galaxy NGC 4839, providing compelling evidence that this galaxy has already traversed the central region of the cluster.</description>

      <title>Supermassive black hole growth in hierarchically merging nuclear star clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supermassive black holes are prevalent at the centers of massive galaxies, and their masses scale with galaxy properties, increasing evidence suggesting that these trends continue to low stellar masses. Seeds are needed for supermassive black holes, especially at the highest redshifts explored by the James Webb Space Telescope. We study the hierarchical merging of galaxies via cosmological merger trees and argue that the seeds of supermassive black holes formed in nuclear star clusters via stellar black hole mergers at early epochs. Observable tracers include intermediate-mass black holes, nuclear star clusters, and early gas accretion in host dwarf galaxies, along with a potentially detectable stochastic gravitational wave background, ejection of intermediate and supermassive black holes, and consequences of a significant population of tidal disruption events and extreme-mass ratio inspirals.</description>

      <title>DESI Mg II Absorbers: Extinction Characteristics &amp; Quasar Redshift Accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study how absorption-line systems affect the spectra and redshifts of quasars (QSOs), using catalogs of Mg II absorbers from the early data release (EDR) and first data release (DR1) of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). We determine the reddening effect of an absorption system by fitting an un-reddened template spectrum to a sample of 50,674 QSO spectra that contain Mg II absorbers. We find that reddening caused by intervening absorbers (voff &gt; 3500 km/s) has an average color excess of E(B-V) = 0.04 magnitudes. We find that the E(B-V) tends to be greater for absorbers at low redshifts, or those having Mg II absorption lines with higher equivalent widths, but shows no clear trend with voff for intervening systems. However, the E(B-V) of associated absorbers, those at voff &lt; 3500 km/s, shows a strong trend with voff , increasing rapidly with decreasing voff and peaking (approximately 0.15 magnitudes) around voff = 0 km/s. We demonstrate that Mg II absorbers impact redshift estimation for QSOs by investigating the distributions of voff for associated absorbers. We find that at z &gt; 1.5 these distributions broaden and bifurcate in a nonphysical manner. In an effort to mitigate this effect, we mask pixels associated with the Mg II absorption lines and recalculate the QSO redshifts. We find that we can recover voff populations in better agreement with those for z &lt; 1.5 absorbers and in doing so typically shift background QSO redshifts by delta_z approximately equal to plus or minus 0.005.</description>

      <title>Dynamical friction in ultralight dark matter: Plummer sphere perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In models of dark matter composed of feebly interacting ultralight bosons in the state of Bose-Einstein condensate, the dynamical friction force acting on circularly moving globular clusters modelled as Plummer spheres is determined. Analytic expressions for both radial and tangential components of the dynamical friction force are given. We reveal that the dynamical friction force for the Plummer sphere deviates from that for a point probe of the same mass for the significantly large ratio of the Plummer sphere radius to its orbital radius as well as for large values of the Mach number.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Cosmic Chemistry II: "direct" $T_e$--based metallicity of galaxies at 3 $&lt; z &lt;$ 10 with JWST/NIRSpec</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the detection of the [O III] auroral line in 42 galaxies within the redshift range of $3 &lt; z &lt; 10$. These galaxies were selected from publicly available JWST data releases, including the JADES and PRIMALsurveys, and observed using both the low-resolution PRISM/CLEAR configuration and medium-resolution gratings. The measured electron temperatures in the high-ionization regions of these galaxies range from $T_e$([O III]) = 12,000 to 24,000 K, consistent with temperatures observed in local metal-poor galaxies and previous JWST studies. In 10 galaxies, we also detect the [O II] auroral line, allowing us to determine electron temperatures in the low-ionization regions, which range between $T_e$([O II]) = 10,830 and 20,000 K. The direct-$T_e$-based metallicities of our sample span from 12 + log(O/H) = 7.2 to 8.4, indicating these high-redshift galaxies are relatively metal-poor. By combining our sample with 25 galaxies from the literature, we expand the dataset to a total of 67 galaxies within $3 &lt; z &lt; 10$, effectively more than doubling the previous sample size for direct-$T_e$ based metallicity studies. This larger dataset allow us to derive empirical metallicity calibration relations based exclusively on high-redshift galaxies, using six key line ratios: R3, R2, R23, Ne3O2, O32, and O3N2. Notably, we derive a novel metallicity calibration relation for the first time using high-redshift $T_e$-based metallicities: $\hat{R}$ = 0.18log $R2$ + 0.98log $R3$. This new calibration significantly reduces the scatter in high-redshift galaxies compared to the $\hat{R}$ relation previously calibrated for low-redshift galaxies.</description>

      <title>Black Holes as Condensation Points of Fuzzy Dark Matter Cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We simulate the formation of Fuzzy Dark Matter (FDM) cores in the presence of a Black Hole (BH) to explore whether BHs can serve as seeds for FDM core condensation. Our analysis is based on the core-condensation via the kinetic relaxation process for random initial conditions of the FDM. We show that in general the BH merges with pre-collapsed mini-clusters and once they share location the BH oscillates within the core. The condensation takes place around the black hole and the FDM acquires a density profile consistent with the density of the stationary solution of the FDM+BH eigenvalue problem in average. The central density of the resulting core depends on the mass of the BH, which due to its motion relative to the FDM cloud produces a smaller time-averaged densities for bigger BH masses, which lead to a new diversity of central FDM core densities. Our results indicate that BHs can indeed act as focal points for FDM core condensation. As a collateral result, for our analysis we revised the construction of stationary solutions of FDM+BH and found a phenomenological formula for the FDM density that can be used to fit FDM cores around BHs.</description>

      <title>Optical QPOs with 550 day periodicity in the reverberation mapped broad line quasar PG 1411+442</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this manuscript, optical quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) with 550 day periodicity related to a candidate of sub-pc binary black hole (BBH) system are reported in the reverberation mapped broad line quasar PG 1411+442 but with different line profile of broad H$\alpha$ from that of broad H$\beta$ in its rms spectrum. First, considering sine function to describe the 18.8years-long light curves from the CSS, ASAS-SN and ZTF, 550days periodicity can be confirmed with confidence level higher than 5$\sigma$. Second, the stable 550days optical QPOs can be re-confirmed with confidence levels higher than 5$\sigma$ by the Generalized Lomb-Scargle periodogram, the sine-like phase-folded light curves and the WWZ technique determined power maps. Third, based on simulated light curves by CAR process, confidence level higher than $3.5\sigma$ can be confirmed for the optical QPOs not related to intrinsic AGN variability. Moreover, considering spatial separation of central two BH accreting systems smaller than expected sizes of broad emission line regions (BLRs), central total BH mass higher than $10^6{\rm M_\odot}$ could lead to few effects of supposed BBH systems on estimated virial BH masses. Meanwhile, disk precession is not preferred due to the similar estimated sizes of optical and NUV emission regions, and jet precession can be ruled out due to PG 1411+442 as a radio quiet quasar. The results strongly indicate it would be practicable by applying very different line profiles of broad Balmer emission lines to detect candidates of BBH systems in normal broad line AGN in the near future.</description>

      <title>From Galaxy Zoo DECaLS to BASS/MzLS: detailed galaxy morphology classification with unsupervised domain adaption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys (DESI-LIS) comprise three distinct surveys: the Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey (DECaLS), the Beijing-Arizona Sky Survey (BASS), and the Mayall z-band Legacy Survey (MzLS). The citizen science project Galaxy Zoo DECaLS 5 (GZD-5) has provided extensive and detailed morphology labels for a sample of 253,287 galaxies within the DECaLS survey. This dataset has been foundational for numerous deep learning-based galaxy morphology classification studies. However, due to differences in signal-to-noise ratios and resolutions between the DECaLS images and those from BASS and MzLS (collectively referred to as BMz), a neural network trained on DECaLS images cannot be directly applied to BMz images due to distributional mismatch. In this study, we explore an unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) method that fine-tunes a source domain model trained on DECaLS images with GZD-5 labels to BMz images, aiming to reduce bias in galaxy morphology classification within the BMz survey. Our source domain model, used as a starting point for UDA, achieves performance on the DECaLS galaxies' validation set comparable to the results of related works. For BMz galaxies, the fine-tuned target domain model significantly improves performance compared to the direct application of the source domain model, reaching a level comparable to that of the source domain. We also release a catalogue of detailed morphology classifications for 248,088 galaxies within the BMz survey, accompanied by usage recommendations.</description>

      <title>Radio filaments as Z-pinched Galactic center wind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this brief note, we tentatively investigate the possibility that the radio filaments are produced when the Galactic center wind washes over magnetic field structures. The electrons and ions, with their disparate charge-to-mass ratios, are deflected differently by the magnetic field, and a current results. The current is subsequently Z-pinched into filaments, creating an electron-accelerating electric field along the way, because the magnetic field necessarily rearranges during the dynamic constriction process. An axial magnetic field also arises, possibly via the diocotron channel, to eventually quench the pinching and stabilize the filaments against a variety of instabilities.</description>

      <title>A New Approach to Identifying Red Supergiant Stars in Metal-poor Galaxies: A Case Study of NGC 6822</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A complete sample of red supergiant stars (RSGs) is important for studying their properties. Identifying RSGs in extragalatic field first requires removing the Galactic foreground dwarfs. The color-color diagram (CCD) method, specifically using $r-z/z-H$ and $J-H/H-K$, has proven successful in several studies. However, in metal-poor galaxies, faint RSGs will mix into the dwarf branch in the CCD and would be removed, leading to an incomplete RSG sample. This work attempts to improve the CCD method in combination with the Gaia astrometric measurement to remove foreground contamination in order to construct a complete RSG sample in metal-poor galaxies. The empirical regions of RSGs in both CCDs are defined and modified by fitting the locations of RSGs in galaxies with a range of metallicity. The metal-poor galaxy NGC 6822 is taken as a case study for its low metallicity ([Fe/H] $\approx$ -1.0) and moderate distance (about 500 kpc). In the complete sample, we identify 1,184 RSG, 1,559 oxygen-rich AGB (O-AGBs), 1,075 carbon-rich AGB (C-AGBs), and 140 extreme AGB (x-AGBs) candidates, with a contamination rate of approximately 20.5%, 9.7%, 6.8%, and 5.0%, respectively. We also present a pure sample, containing only the sources away from the dwarf branch, which includes 843 RSG, 1,519 O-AGB, 1,059 C-AGB, and 140 x-AGB candidates, with a contamination rate of approximately 6.5%, 8.8%, 6.1%, and 5.0%, respectively. About 600 and 450 RSG candidates are newly identified in the complete and pure sample, respectively, compared to the previous RSG sample in NGC 6822.</description>

      <title>Multi-phase HI clouds in the Small Magellanic Cloud halo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. The Galactic ASKAP collaboration (GASKAP) is undertaking an HI emission survey of the 21cm line to map the Magellanic system and the Galactic plane with the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP). One of the first areas observed in the Pilot Phase I of the survey was the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). Previous surveys of the SMC have uncovered new structures in the periphery of the SMC, along relatively low column density lines of sight. Aims. In this work we aimed to uncover the phase distribution of three distinct structures in the periphery of the SMC. This work will add to the constraints we have on the existence and survival of the cold neutral medium (CNM) in the SMC. Methods. We used ROHSA, a Gaussian decomposition algorithm, to model the emission across each cloud and classify the HI emission into their respective phases based on the linewidths of the fitted Gaussians. We created maps of velocity and column density of each phase of the HI across these three clouds. We measured the HI mass and CNM number density for each cloud. We also compared the HI results across the different phases with other gas tracers. Results. We find that in two clouds, the ends of each cloud are almost completely CNM dominated. Analysis of these two clouds indicates they are experiencing a compressive force from the direction of the SMC main body. In the third cloud we find a uniform CNM distribution along one wall of what is likely a supershell structure. Comparison with previous measurements of CO clumps in two of the clouds show the CO and HI are co-moving within a few km/s in regions of high HI column density, particularly when considering just the CNM.</description>

Abstract: Deriving physical parameters from integrated galaxy spectra is paramount to interpret the cosmic evolution of star formation, chemical enrichment, and energetic sources. We develop modeling techniques to characterize the ionized gas properties in the subset of 2052 star-forming galaxies from the volume-limited, dwarf-dominated, z~0 ECO catalog. The MULTIGRIS statistical framework is used to evaluate the performance of various models using strong lines as constraints. The reference model involves physical parameters distributed as power-laws with free parameter boundaries. Specifically, we use combinations of 1D photoionization models (i.e., considering the propagation of radiation toward a single cloud) to match optical HII region lines, in order to provide probability density functions of the inferred parameters. The inference predicts non-uniform physical conditions within galaxies. The integrated spectra of most galaxies are dominated by relatively low-excitation gas with a metallicity around 0.3 solar. Using the average metallicity in galaxies, we provide a new fit to the mass-metallicity relationship which is in line with direct abundance method determinations from the calibrated range at low metallicity to stacks at high metallicity. The average metallicity shows a weakly bimodal distribution which may be due related to external (e.g., refueling of non-cluster early-type galaxies above ~10^9.5 solar masses) or internal processes (more efficient star-formation in metal-rich regions). The specific line set used for inference affects the results and we identify potential issues with the use of the [SII] line doublet. Complex modelling approaches are limited by the inherent 1D model database as well as caveats regarding the gas geometry. Our results highlight, however, the possibility to extract useful and significant information from integrated spectra.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Evolution of Substructured Star Clusters at 3 kpc from the Galactic Center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the evolution of initial fractal clusters at 3 kpc from the Galactic Center (GC) of the Milky Way and show how red supergiant clusters (RSGCs)-like objects, which are considered to be the result of active star formation in the Scutum complex, can form by 16 Myr. We find that initial tidal filling and tidal over-filling fractals are shredded by the tidal force, but some substructures can survive as individual subclusters, especially when the initial virial ratio is $\leq$0.5.These surviving subclusters are weakly mass segregated and show a top-heavy mass function. This implies the possibility that a single substructured star cluster can evolve into multiple `star clusters'.</description>

      <title>Cloud-scale elemental abundance variations and the CO-to-dust-mass conversion factor in M31</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From a spectroscopic survey of candidate H II regions in the Andromeda galaxy (M31) with MMT/Hectospec, we have identified 294 H II regions using emission line ratios and calculated elemental abundances from strong-line diagnostics (values ranging from sub-solar to super-solar) producing both Oxygen and Nitrogen radial abundance gradients. The Oxygen gradient is relatively flat, while the Nitrogen gradient is significantly steeper, indicating a higher N/O ratio in M31's inner regions, consistent with recent simulations of galaxy chemical evolution. No strong evidence was found of systematic galaxy-scale trends beyond the radial gradient. After subtracting the radial gradient from abundance values, we find an apparently stochastic and statistically significant scatter of standard deviation 0.06 dex, which exceeds measurement uncertainties. One explanation includes a possible collision with M32 200 - 800 Myrs ago. Using the two-point correlation function of the Oxygen abundance, we find that, similar to other spiral galaxies, M31 is well-mixed on sub-kpc scales but less so on larger (kpc) scales, which could be a result of an exponential decrease in mixing speed with spatial scale, and the aforementioned recent merger. Finally, the MMT spectroscopy is complemented by a dust continuum and CO survey of individual Giant Molecular Clouds, conducted with the Submillimeter Array. By combining the MMT and SMA observations, we obtain a unique direct test of the Oxygen abundance dependence of the $\alpha^{\prime}(^{12}\mathrm{CO})$ factor which is crucial to convert CO emission to dust mass. Our results suggest that within our sample there is no trend of the $\alpha^{\prime}(^{12}\mathrm{CO})$ with Oxygen abundance.</description>

Abstract: The Aether Scalar Tensor (AeST) theory is an extension of general relativity(GR) successful at reproducing galactic rotational curves, gravitational lensing, linear large scale structure and cosmic microwave background power spectrum observations. We solve the most general static spherically symmetric vacuum equations in the strong-field regime of AeST and find two classes of stealth black hole solutions -- those with exact GR geometries -- containing non-trivial secondary hair. In particular, one of these can be continuously joined to the cosmological solution of AeST. We also derive a non-black hole solution with zero spatial component in the vector field. This result proves the existence of mathematically and observationally consistent candidates for black holes in AeST, and creates a basis for testing the theory in the strong-field regime.</description>

      <title>Spin evolution and mass distribution of the Galactic Binary Neutron Stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Binary neutron stars (BNSs) detected in the Milky Way have the total masses distributing narrowly around $\sim2.6-2.7M_\odot$, while the BNS merger GW190425 detected via gravitational wave has a significantly larger mass ($\sim3.4M_\odot$). This difference is not well understood, yet. In this paper, we investigate the BNS spin evolution via an improved binary star evolution model and its effects on the BNS observability, with implementation of various relevant astrophysical processes. We find that the first-born neutron star component in low-mass BNSs can be spun up to millisecond pulsars by the accretion of Roche-lobe overflow from its companion and its radio lifetime can be comparable to the Hubble time. However, most high-mass BNSs have substantially shorter radio lifetime than the low-mass BNSs, and thus smaller probability being detected via radio emission. Adopting the star formation and metal enrichment history of the Milky Way given by observations, we obtain the survived Galactic BNSs with pulsar components from our population synthesis model and find that their distributions on the diagrams of spin period versus spin-period-time-derivative ($P-\dot{P}$) and orbital period versus eccentricity ($P_{\rm orb}-e$) can well match those of the observed Galactic BNSs. The total mass distribution of the observed Galactic BNSs can also be matched by the model. A significant fraction ($\sim19\%-22\%$) of merging BNSs at redshift $z\sim0$ have masses $\gtrsim3M_\odot$, which seems compatible with the GW observations. Future radio observations may detect many more Galactic BNSs, which will put strong constraint on the spin evolution of BNSs during their formation processes.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Zoom-In Simulations of Milky Way Host Size Dark Matter Halos with a Blue-Tilted Primordial Power Spectrum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent observations from the James Webb Space Telescope revealed a surprisingly large number of galaxies formed at high redshift. Along with strong lensing studies and nearby galaxy observations, these could challenge the standard Lambda Cold Dark Matter cosmology with a power-law primordial power spectrum. In this study, we conduct high-resolution cosmological zoom-in dark matter-only simulations of Milky Way host size halos with a blue, tilted primordial power spectrum ($P(k)\propto k^{m_s}$ with $m_s&gt;1$ at small scales $&gt;1~{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$). We find that the blue-tilted subhalo mass functions can be enhanced by more than a factor of two for subhalo masses $M_{\rm sub} \lesssim 10^{10}~ M_{\odot}$, whereas the subhalo $V_{\rm max}$ functions can be enhanced by a factor of four for maximum circular velocities $V_{\rm max}\lesssim 30 ~{\rm km/s}$. The blue-tilted scaled cumulative substructure fraction can be an order of magnitude higher at $\sim$10\% of the virial radius. The blue-tilted subhalos also have higher central densities, since the blue-tilted subhalos reach the same $V_{\rm max}$ at a smaller distance $R_{\rm max}$ from the center. We have also verified these findings with higher-resolution simulations.</description>

      <title>The radiative torque spin-up efficiency of ballistic dust grain aggregates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09968v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Aims. It is quintessential for the analysis of the observed dust polarization signal to understand the rotational dynamics of interstellar dust grains. Additionally, high rotation velocities may rotationally disrupt the grains, which impacts the grain-size distribution. We aim to constrain the set of parameters for an accurate description of the rotational spin-up process of ballistic dust grain aggregates driven by radiative torques (RATs).
  Methods. We modeled the dust grains as complex fractal aggregates grown by the ballistic aggregation of uniform spherical particles (monomers) of different sizes. A broad variation of dust materials, shapes, and sizes were studied in the presence of different radiation sources.
  Results. We find that the canonical parameterization for the torque efficiency overestimates the maximum angular velocity $\omega_{\mathrm{RAT}}$ caused by RATs acting on ballistic grain aggregates. To resolve this problem, we propose a new parameterization that predicts $\omega_{\mathrm{RAT}}$ more accurately. We find that RATs are most efficient for larger grains with a lower monomer density. Following the constant part, the parameterization has two power laws with different slopes that retain universality for all grain sizes. The maximum grain rotation does not scale linearly with radiation strength because different drag mechanisms dominate, depending on the grain material and environment. The angular velocity $\omega_{\mathrm{RAT}}$ of individual single dust grains has a wide distribution and may even differ from the mean by up to two orders of magnitude. Even though ballistic aggregates have a lower RAT efficiency, strong sources of radiation (stronger than $\approx 100$ times the typical interstellar radiation field) may still produce rotation velocities high enough to cause the rotational disruption of dust grains.</description>

      <title>BUFFALO Wild Wings: A High Precision Free-Form Lens Model of MACSJ0416 with Constraints on Dark Matter from Substructure and Highly Magnified Arcs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15978v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present new free-form and hybrid mass reconstructions of the galaxy cluster lens MACS J0416.1$-$2403 at $z=0.396$ using the lens inversion method GRALE. The reconstructions use 237 spectroscopically confirmed multiple images from Bergamini et. al. 2023 as the main input. Our primary model reconstructs images to a positional accuracy of 0.191", thus representing one of the most precise reconstructions of this lens to date. Our models find broad agreement with previous reconstructions, and identify two $\sim 10^{12} M_{\odot}$ light-unaffiliated substructures. We focus on two highly magnified arcs: Spock and Mothra. Our model features a unique critical curve structure around the Spock arc with 2 crossings. This structure enables sufficient magnification across this arc to potentially explain the large number of transients as microlensing events of supergiant stars. Additionally, we develop a model of the millilens substructure expected to be magnifying Mothra, which may be a binary pair of supergiants with $\mu \sim 6000$. This model accounts for flexibility in the millilens position while preserving the observed flux and minimizing image position displacements along the Mothra arc. We constrain the millilens mass and core radius to $\lesssim 10^6 M_{\odot}$ and $\lesssim 17$ pc, respectively, which would render it one of the smallest and most compact substructures constrained by lensing. If the millilens is dominated by wave dark matter, the axion mass is constrained to be $\lesssim 3.0 \times 10^{-21}$ eV. Further monitoring of this lens with JWST will uncover more transients, permitting tighter constraints on the structure surrounding these two arcs.</description>

      <title>Astraeus X: Indications of a top-heavy initial mass function in highly star-forming galaxies from JWST observations at z&gt;10</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00730v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has uncovered an abundance of $z&gt;10$ galaxies bright in the ultraviolet (UV) that has challenged traditional theoretical models at high redshifts. Recently, various new models have emerged to address this discrepancy by refining their description of star formation. Here we investigate whether modifications to the stellar initial mass function (IMF) alone can reproduce the $z&gt;10$ UV luminosity functions (UV LFs) when the star formation rate is used as a proxy for the fraction of massive stars. We incorporate an Evolving IMF into the {\sc astraeus} galaxy evolution and reionisation simulation framework, which becomes increasingly top-heavy as the gas density in a galaxy rises above a given threshold. Our implementation accounts for the IMF's effects on supernova (SN) feedback, metal enrichment, and the UV and ionising emissivities. For this Evolving IMF model, we find that (i) the maximum UV luminosity enhancement is twice as large in massive galaxies ($\Delta M_\mathrm{UV}\simeq2.6$) than those where star formation is strongly limited by SN feedback ($\Delta M_\mathrm{UV}\simeq1.3$); (ii) it successfully reproduces the observed UV LFs at $z=5-15$; (iii) galaxies with top-heavy IMFs exhibit the highest star formation rates, driven by their location in local density peaks, which facilitates higher gas accretion rates; (iv) the $1\sigma$ variances in the UV luminosity are only slightly higher compared to when assuming a Salpeter IMF, but the $2\sigma$ variances are significantly increased by a factor of $1.4-2$ boosting the abundance of UV-bright galaxies at $z&gt;10$; (v) reionisation begins earlier with more extended large ionised regions and fewer smaller ones during its initial stages, though these differences diminish at lower redshifts, leading to a similar end of reionisation at $z\simeq5.6$.}</description>

      <title>LMC Calls, Milky Way Halo Answers: Disentangling the Effects of the MW--LMC Interaction on Stellar Stream Populations</title>

Abstract: The infall of the LMC into the Milky Way (MW) has dynamical implications throughout the MW's dark matter halo. We study the impact of this merger on the statistical properties of populations of simulated stellar streams. Specifically, we investigate the radial and on-sky angular dependence of stream perturbations caused by the direct effect of stream--LMC interactions and/or the response of the MW dark matter halo. We use a time-evolving MW--LMC simulation described by basis function expansions to simulate streams. We quantify the degree of perturbation using a set of stream property statistics including the misalignment of proper motions with the stream track. In the outer halo, direct stream--LMC interactions produce a statistically significant effect, boosting the fraction of misaligned proper motions by ~25% relative to the model with no LMC. Moreover, there is on-sky angular dependence of stream perturbations: the highest fractions of perturbed streams coincide with the same on-sky quadrant as the present-day LMC location. In the inner halo, the MW halo dipole response primarily drives stream perturbations, but it remains uncertain whether this is a detectable signature distinct from the LMC's influence. For the fiducial MW--LMC model, we find agreement between the predicted fraction of streams with significantly misaligned proper motions, $\bar{\vartheta}&gt;10^{\circ}$, and Dark Energy Survey data. Finally, we predict this fraction for the Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) footprint. Using LSST data will improve our constraints on dark matter models and LMC properties as it is sensitive to both.</description>

      <title>The Kinematics of 30 Milky Way Globular Clusters and the Multiple Stellar Populations within</title>

Abstract: The spectroscopic and photometric classification of multiple stellar populations (MPs) in Galactic globular clusters (GCs) has enabled comparisons between contemporary observations and formation theories regarding the initial spatial configurations of the MPs. However, the kinematics of these MPs is an aspect that requires more attention. We investigated the 3D kinematics of 30 Galactic GCs, extending to 3-5 half-light radii, as well as their MPs, in order to uncover clues of the initial conditions of GCs and the MPs within. We have combined Hubble Space Telescope and Gaia DR3 proper motions together with a comprehensive set of line-of-sight velocities to determine the 3D rotation amplitudes, rotation axes, and anisotropy profiles of the clusters. We include radial velocities from new IFU observations of NGC 5024 and an analysis of archival MUSE data of NGC 6101. We compare our kinematic results with structural and orbital parameters of each cluster, reporting the most significant correlations and common features. We find significant rotation in 21 GCs, with no significant differences between the total rotational amplitudes of the MPs, except for NGC 104. We find no significant differences in the position angles or inclination angles. We find that the 3D rotational amplitude is strongly correlated with mass, relaxation time, enriched star fraction and concentration. We determine the anisotropy profiles of each cluster and the MPs where possible. We investigate correlations with the structural parameters, orbital parameters and accretion history of the clusters, finding that the dynamically young clusters with the highest central concentrations of primordial stars show radial anisotropy in their outer regions ($&gt;2$ half-light radii). The dynamically young clusters with a central concentration of enriched stars show significant tangential anisotropy or isotropy in their outer regions.</description>

      <title>X-ray cavities in TNG-Cluster: AGN phenomena in the full cosmological context</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21366v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback from supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at the centers of galaxy clusters plays a key role in regulating star formation and shaping the intracluster medium (ICM), often manifesting through prominent X-ray cavities embedded in the cluster's hot atmosphere. Here we show that X-ray cavities arise naturally due to AGN feedback in TNG-Cluster. This is a new suite of magnetohydrodynamic cosmological simulations of galaxy formation and evolution, and hence of galaxy clusters, whereby cold dark matter, baryon dynamics, galactic astrophysics, and magnetic fields are evolved together consistently. We construct mock Chandra X-ray observations of the central regions of the 352 simulated clusters at $z=0$ and find that $\sim$39 per cent contain X-ray cavities. Identified X-ray cavities vary in configuration (single, pairs, or multiples), with some still attached to SMBHs, while others have buoyantly risen. Their size ranges from a few to several tens of kpc. In terms of gas physical properties, TNG-Cluster X-ray cavities are underdense compared to the surrounding halo and filled with hot gas ($\sim$10$^8$K); 25 per cent of them are surrounded by an X-ray bright and compressed rim associated with a weak shock (Mach number $\sim 1.5$). Clusters exhibiting X-ray cavities are preferentially strong or weak cool-cores, are dynamically relaxed, and host SMBHs accreting at low Eddington rates. We show that TNG-Cluster X-ray cavities originate from episodic, wind-like energy injections from central AGN. Our results illustrate the existence and diversity of X-ray cavities simulated in state-of-the-art models within realistic cosmological environments and show that these can form without necessarily invoking bipolar, collimated, or relativistic jets.</description>

Abstract: We present new radio observations of the galaxy cluster merger CIZA J0107.7+5408 (CIZA0107), a large, roughly equal mass, post-core passage, dissociative binary system at z = 0.1066. CIZA0107 is an elongated, disturbed system, hosting two subclusters with optical galaxy number density peaks offset from their associated X-ray density peaks and double-peaked diffuse radio structure. We present new 240-470 MHz and 2.0-4.0 GHz Very Large Array observations of CIZA0107. We image the diffuse emission at high resolution, constrain its integrated spectrum, and map the spectral index distribution. We confirm the presence of steep-spectrum ($\alpha$ $\sim$ -1.3) emission on a scale of about 0.5 Mpc in both subclusters. We identify two smaller ultra-steep spectrum ($\alpha$ $&lt;$ -2) regions, superimposed on larger-scale radio emission associated with the southwestern subcluster. At 340 MHz, we detect a radio edge bounding the emission to the south and show that it is coincident with a weak (M $\sim$ 1.2) shock identified in the Chandra image. At 3 GHz, the emission does not show any corresponding edge-like feature, and in fact it extends beyond the shock. We investigate the nature of the emission in CIZA0107 and find that, while the system may host a double halo structure, we cannot rule out a scenario in which the emission arises from two relics projected on the central cluster regions.</description>
