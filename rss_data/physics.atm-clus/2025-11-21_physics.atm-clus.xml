      <title>Contact cluster modeling of allosteric communication in PDZ domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Allostery, the intriguing phenomenon of long-range communication between distant sites in proteins, plays a central role in biomolecular regulation and signal transduction. While it is commonly attributed to conformational rearrangements, the underlying dynamical mechanisms remain poorly understood. The contact cluster model of allostery [J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2024, 20, 10731] identifies localized groups of highly correlated contacts that mediate interactions between secondary structure elements. This framework proposes that allostery proceeds through a multistep process involving cooperative contact changes within clusters and communication between distant clusters, transmitted through rigid secondary structures. To demonstrate the validity and generality of the model, this Perspective employs extensive molecular dynamics simulations ($\sim 1\,$ms total simulation time) of four different photoswitchable PDZ domains and studies how different domains, ligands and perturbations influence both the contact clusters and their dynamical evolution. These analyses reveal several recurring clusters that represent shared flexible structural modules, such as loops connecting $\beta$-sheets, and show that the characteristic timescales of the nonequilibrium protein response can be directly associated with the motions of individual contact clusters. Thus, the dynamic decomposition of PDZ domains into contact clusters uncovers a modular, dynamics-based architecture that underlies and facilitates long-range allosteric communication.</description>

      <title>Exceptional-Point-Induced Sensitivity-Robustness Phase Transition in Quantum Interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum interference underpins many quantum information protocols but is typically studied in lossless Hermitian systems. Here, we reveal an exceptional point induced phase transition in two photon Hong Ou Mandel interference within a lossy coupled waveguide system. In the PT symmetric phase. interference is ultrasensitive to coupling strength, yielding sharp bunching antibunching switches. In the PT broken phase. it becomes robust oscillation free and propagation independent with coincidence probability stably tunable via coupling. These regimes enable enhanced quantum sensing and reliable two photon control for robust quantum information processing.</description>
