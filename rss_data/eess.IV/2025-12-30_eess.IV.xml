      <title>Field strength-dependent performance variability in deep learning-based analysis of magnetic resonance imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study quantitatively evaluates the impact of MRI scanner magnetic field strength on the performance and generalizability of deep learning-based segmentation algorithms. Three publicly available MRI datasets (breast tumor, pancreas, and cervical spine) were stratified by scanner field strength (1.5T vs. 3.0T). For each segmentation task, three nnU-Net-based models were developed: A model trained on 1.5T data only (m-1.5T), a model trained on 3.0T data only (m-3.0T), and a model trained on pooled 1.5T and 3.0T data (m-combined). Each model was evaluated on both 1.5T and 3.0T validation sets. Field-strength-dependent performance differences were investigated via Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP)-based clustering and radiomic analysis, including 23 first-order and texture features. For breast tumor segmentation, m-3.0T (DSC: 0.494 [1.5T] and 0.433 [3.0T]) significantly outperformed m-1.5T (DSC: 0.411 [1.5T] and 0.289 [3.0T]) and m-combined (DSC: 0.373 [1.5T] and 0.268[3.0T]) on both validation sets (p&lt;0.0001). Pancreas segmentation showed similar trends: m-3.0T achieved the highest DSC (0.774 [1.5T], 0.840 [3.0T]), while m-1.5T underperformed significantly (p&lt;0.0001). For cervical spine, models performed optimally on same-field validation sets with minimal cross-field performance degradation (DSC&gt;0.92 for all comparisons). Radiomic analysis revealed moderate field-strength-dependent clustering in soft tissues (silhouette scores 0.23-0.29) but minimal separation in osseous structures (0.12). These results indicate that magnetic field strength in the training data substantially influences the performance of deep learning-based segmentation models, particularly for soft-tissue structures (e.g., small lesions). This warrants consideration of magnetic field strength as a confounding factor in studies evaluating AI performance on MRI.</description>

      <title>AI-Enhanced Virtual Biopsies for Brain Tumor Diagnosis in Low Resource Settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Timely brain tumor diagnosis remains challenging in low-resource clinical environments where expert neuroradiology interpretation, high-end MRI hardware, and invasive biopsy procedures may be limited. Although deep learning has achieved strong performance in brain tumor analysis, real-world adoption is constrained by computational demands, dataset shift across scanners, and limited interpretability. This paper presents a prototype virtual biopsy pipeline for four-class classification of 2D brain MRI images using a lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) and complementary radiomics-style handcrafted features. A MobileNetV2-based CNN is trained for classification, while an interpretable radiomics branch extracts eight features capturing lesion shape, intensity statistics, and gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) texture descriptors. A late fusion strategy concatenates CNN embeddings with radiomics features and trains a RandomForest classifier on the fused representation. Explainability is provided via Grad-CAM visualizations and radiomics feature importance analysis. Experiments on a public Kaggle brain tumor MRI dataset show improved validation performance for fusion relative to single-branch baselines, while robustness tests under reduced resolution and additive noise highlight sensitivity relevant to low-resource imaging conditions. The system is framed as decision support and not a substitute for clinical diagnosis or histopathology.</description>

      <title>Complex Swin Transformer for Accelerating Enhanced SMWI Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Susceptibility Map Weighted Imaging (SMWI) is an advanced magnetic resonance imaging technique used to detect nigral hyperintensity in Parkinsons disease. However, full resolution SMWI acquisition is limited by long scan times. Efficient reconstruction methods are therefore required to generate high quality SMWI from reduced k space data while preserving diagnostic relevance. In this work, we propose a complex valued Swin Transformer based network for super resolution reconstruction of multi echo MRI data. The proposed method reconstructs high quality SMWI images from low resolution k space inputs. Experimental results demonstrate that the method achieves a structural similarity index of 0.9116 and a mean squared error of 0.076 when reconstructing SMWI from 256 by 256 k space data, while maintaining critical diagnostic features. This approach enables high quality SMWI reconstruction from reduced k space sampling, leading to shorter scan times without compromising diagnostic detail. The proposed method has the potential to improve the clinical applicability of SMWI for Parkinsons disease and support faster and more efficient neuroimaging workflows.</description>

      <title>Super-Resolution Enhancement of Medical Images Based on Diffusion Model: An Optimization Scheme for Low-Resolution Gastric Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Capsule endoscopy has enabled minimally invasive gastrointestinal imaging, but its clinical utility is limited by the inherently low resolution of captured images due to hardware, power, and transmission constraints. This limitation hampers the identification of fine-grained mucosal textures and subtle pathological features essential for early diagnosis.
  This work investigates a diffusion-based super-resolution framework to enhance capsule endoscopy images in a data-driven and anatomically consistent manner. We adopt the SR3 (Super-Resolution via Repeated Refinement) framework built upon Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) to learn a probabilistic mapping from low-resolution to high-resolution images. Unlike GAN-based approaches that often suffer from training instability and hallucination artifacts, diffusion models provide stable likelihood-based training and improved structural fidelity. The HyperKvasir dataset, a large-scale publicly available gastrointestinal endoscopy dataset, is used for training and evaluation.
  Quantitative results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms bicubic interpolation and GAN-based super-resolution methods such as ESRGAN, achieving PSNR of 27.5 dB and SSIM of 0.65 for a baseline model, and improving to 29.3 dB and 0.71 with architectural enhancements including attention mechanisms. Qualitative results show improved preservation of anatomical boundaries, vascular patterns, and lesion structures. These findings indicate that diffusion-based super-resolution is a promising approach for enhancing non-invasive medical imaging, particularly in capsule endoscopy where image resolution is fundamentally constrained.</description>

      <title>SemCovert: Secure and Covert Video Transmission via Deep Semantic-Level Hiding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video semantic communication, praised for its transmission efficiency, still faces critical challenges related to privacy leakage. Traditional security techniques like steganography and encryption are challenging to apply since they are not inherently robust against semantic-level transformations and abstractions. Moreover, the temporal continuity of video enables framewise statistical modeling over extended periods, which increases the risk of exposing distributional anomalies and reconstructing hidden content. To address these challenges, we propose SemCovert, a deep semantic-level hiding framework for secure and covert video transmission. SemCovert introduces a pair of co-designed models, namely the semantic hiding model and the secret semantic extractor, which are seamlessly integrated into the semantic communication pipeline. This design enables authorized receivers to reliably recover hidden information, while keeping it imperceptible to regular users. To further improve resistance to analysis, we introduce a randomized semantic hiding strategy, which breaks the determinism of embedding and introduces unpredictable distribution patterns. The experimental results demonstrate that SemCovert effectively mitigates potential eavesdropping and detection risks while reliably concealing secret videos during transmission. Meanwhile, video quality suffers only minor degradation, preserving transmission fidelity. These results confirm SemCovert's effectiveness in enabling secure and covert transmission without compromising semantic communication performance.</description>

      <title>MEGA-PCC: A Mamba-based Efficient Approach for Joint Geometry and Attribute Point Cloud Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Joint compression of point cloud geometry and attributes is essential for efficient 3D data representation. Existing methods often rely on post-hoc recoloring procedures and manually tuned bitrate allocation between geometry and attribute bitstreams in inference, which hinders end-to-end optimization and increases system complexity. To overcome these limitations, we propose MEGA-PCC, a fully end-to-end, learning-based framework featuring two specialized models for joint compression. The main compression model employs a shared encoder that encodes both geometry and attribute information into a unified latent representation, followed by dual decoders that sequentially reconstruct geometry and then attributes. Complementing this, the Mamba-based Entropy Model (MEM) enhances entropy coding by capturing spatial and channel-wise correlations to improve probability estimation. Both models are built on the Mamba architecture to effectively model long-range dependencies and rich contextual features. By eliminating the need for recoloring and heuristic bitrate tuning, MEGA-PCC enables data-driven bitrate allocation during training and simplifies the overall pipeline. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MEGA-PCC achieves superior rate-distortion performance and runtime efficiency compared to both traditional and learning-based baselines, offering a powerful solution for AI-driven point cloud compression.</description>

      <title>Semantic contrastive learning for orthogonal X-ray computed tomography reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray computed tomography (CT) is widely used in medical imaging, with sparse-view reconstruction offering an effective way to reduce radiation dose. However, ill-posed conditions often result in severe streak artifacts. Recent advances in deep learning-based methods have improved reconstruction quality, but challenges still remain. To address these challenges, we propose a novel semantic feature contrastive learning loss function that evaluates semantic similarity in high-level latent spaces and anatomical similarity in shallow latent spaces. Our approach utilizes a three-stage U-Net-based architecture: one for coarse reconstruction, one for detail refinement, and one for semantic similarity measurement. Tests on a chest dataset with orthogonal projections demonstrate that our method achieves superior reconstruction quality and faster processing compared to other algorithms. The results show significant improvements in image quality while maintaining low computational complexity, making it a practical solution for orthogonal CT reconstruction.</description>

      <title>SwinCCIR: An end-to-end deep network for Compton camera imaging reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compton cameras (CCs) are a kind of gamma cameras which are designed to determine the directions of incident gammas based on the Compton scatter. However, the reconstruction of CCs face problems of severe artifacts and deformation due to the fundamental reconstruction principle of back-projection of Compton cones. Besides, a part of systematic errors originated from the performance of devices are hard to remove through calibration, leading to deterioration of imaging quality. Iterative algorithms and deep-learning based methods have been widely used to improve reconstruction. But most of them are optimization based on the results of back-projection. Therefore, we proposed an end-to-end deep learning framework, SwinCCIR, for CC imaging. Through adopting swin-transformer blocks and a transposed convolution-based image generation module, we established the relationship between the list-mode events and the radioactive source distribution. SwinCCIR was trained and validated on both simulated and practical dataset. The experimental results indicate that SwinCCIR effectively overcomes problems of conventional CC imaging, which are expected to be implemented in practical applications.</description>

      <title>EIR: Enhanced Image Representations for Medical Report Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating medical reports from chest X-ray images is a critical and time-consuming task for radiologists, especially in emergencies. To alleviate the stress on radiologists and reduce the risk of misdiagnosis, numerous research efforts have been dedicated to automatic medical report generation in recent years. Most recent studies have developed methods that represent images by utilizing various medical metadata, such as the clinical document history of the current patient and the medical graphs constructed from retrieved reports of other similar patients. However, all existing methods integrate additional metadata representations with visual representations through a simple "Add and LayerNorm" operation, which suffers from the information asymmetry problem due to the distinct distributions between them. In addition, chest X-ray images are usually represented using pre-trained models based on natural domain images, which exhibit an obvious domain gap between general and medical domain images. To this end, we propose a novel approach called Enhanced Image Representations (EIR) for generating accurate chest X-ray reports. We utilize cross-modal transformers to fuse metadata representations with image representations, thereby effectively addressing the information asymmetry problem between them, and we leverage medical domain pre-trained models to encode medical images, effectively bridging the domain gap for image representation. Experimental results on the widely used MIMIC and Open-I datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.</description>

      <title>An Energy-Efficient RFET-Based Stochastic Computing Neural Network Accelerator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic computing (SC) offers significant reductions in hardware complexity for traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), but stochastic computing neural networks (SCNNs) still suffer from high resource usage due to components such as stochastic number generators (SNGs) and accumulative parallel counters (APCs), which limit performance. This paper introduces a novel SCNN architecture based on reconfigurable field-effect transistors (RFETs), whose device-level reconfigurability enables the design of highly efficient and compact SNGs, APCs, and other core modules. A dedicated SCNN accelerator architecture is also developed for system-level simulation. Using publicly available open-source standard cell libraries, experimental results show that the proposed RFET-based SCNN accelerator achieves substantial reductions in area, latency, and energy consumption compared to a FinFET-based design at the same technology node.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Motion Encoding in Video Diffusion Timesteps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text-to-video diffusion models synthesize temporal motion and spatial appearance through iterative denoising, yet how motion is encoded across timesteps remains poorly understood. Practitioners often exploit the empirical heuristic that early timesteps mainly shape motion and layout while later ones refine appearance, but this behavior has not been systematically characterized. In this work, we proxy motion encoding in video diffusion timesteps by the trade-off between appearance editing and motion preservation induced when injecting new conditions over specified timestep ranges, and characterize this proxy through a large-scale quantitative study. This protocol allows us to factor motion from appearance by quantitatively mapping how they compete along the denoising trajectory. Across diverse architectures, we consistently identify an early, motion-dominant regime and a later, appearance-dominant regime, yielding an operational motion-appearance boundary in timestep space. Building on this characterization, we simplify current one-shot motion customization paradigm by restricting training and inference to the motion-dominant regime, achieving strong motion transfer without auxiliary debiasing modules or specialized objectives. Our analysis turns a widely used heuristic into a spatiotemporal disentanglement principle, and our timestep-constrained recipe can serve as ready integration into existing motion transfer and editing methods.</description>

      <title>Fairness Evaluation of Risk Estimation Models for Lung Cancer Screening</title>

Abstract: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in adults worldwide. Screening high-risk individuals with annual low-dose CT (LDCT) can support earlier detection and reduce deaths, but widespread implementation may strain the already limited radiology workforce. AI models have shown potential in estimating lung cancer risk from LDCT scans. However, high-risk populations for lung cancer are diverse, and these models' performance across demographic groups remains an open question. In this study, we drew on the considerations on confounding factors and ethically significant biases outlined in the JustEFAB framework to evaluate potential performance disparities and fairness in two deep learning risk estimation models for lung cancer screening: the Sybil lung cancer risk model and the Venkadesh21 nodule risk estimator. We also examined disparities in the PanCan2b logistic regression model recommended in the British Thoracic Society nodule management guideline. Both deep learning models were trained on data from the US-based National Lung Screening Trial (NLST), and assessed on a held-out NLST validation set. We evaluated AUROC, sensitivity, and specificity across demographic subgroups, and explored potential confounding from clinical risk factors. We observed a statistically significant AUROC difference in Sybil's performance between women (0.88, 95% CI: 0.86, 0.90) and men (0.81, 95% CI: 0.78, 0.84, p &lt; .001). At 90% specificity, Venkadesh21 showed lower sensitivity for Black (0.39, 95% CI: 0.23, 0.59) than White participants (0.69, 95% CI: 0.65, 0.73). These differences were not explained by available clinical confounders and thus may be classified as unfair biases according to JustEFAB. Our findings highlight the importance of improving and monitoring model performance across underrepresented subgroups, and further research on algorithmic fairness, in lung cancer screening.</description>

      <title>Real-Time In-Cabin Driver Behavior Recognition on Low-Cost Edge Hardware</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.22298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In-cabin Driver Monitoring Systems (DMS) must recognize distraction- and drowsiness-related behaviors with low latency under strict constraints on compute, power, and cost. We present a single-camera in-cabin driver behavior recognition system designed for deployment on two low-cost edge platforms: Raspberry Pi 5 (CPU-only) and Google Coral Edge TPU. The proposed pipeline combines (i) a compact per-frame vision model, (ii) a confounder-aware label design to reduce visually similar false positives, and (iii) a temporal decision head that triggers alerts only when predictions are both confident and sustained. The system covers 17 behavior classes, including multiple phone-use modes, eating/drinking, smoking, reaching behind, gaze/attention shifts, passenger interaction, grooming, control-panel interaction, yawning, and eyes-closed sleep. Training and evaluation use licensed datasets spanning diverse drivers, vehicles, and lighting conditions (details in Section 6), and we further validate runtime behavior in real in-vehicle tests. The optimized deployments achieve about 16 FPS on Raspberry Pi 5 with INT8 inference (per-frame latency under 60 ms) and about 25 FPS on Coral Edge TPU, enabling real-time monitoring and stable alert generation on inexpensive hardware. Finally, we discuss how reliable in-cabin human-state perception can serve as an upstream input for human-centered vehicle intelligence, including emerging agentic vehicle concepts.</description>

      <title>JParc: Joint cortical surface parcellation with registration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.22485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cortical surface parcellation is a fundamental task in both basic neuroscience research and clinical applications, enabling more accurate mapping of brain regions. Model-based and learning-based approaches for automated parcellation alleviate the need for manual labeling. Despite the advancement in parcellation performance, learning-based methods shift away from registration and atlas propagation without exploring the reason for the improvement compared to traditional methods. In this study, we present JParc, a joint cortical registration and parcellation framework, that outperforms existing state-of-the-art parcellation methods. In rigorous experiments, we demonstrate that the enhanced performance of JParc is primarily attributable to accurate cortical registration and a learned parcellation atlas. By leveraging a shallow subnetwork to fine-tune the propagated atlas labels, JParc achieves a Dice score greater than 90% on the Mindboggle dataset, using only basic geometric features (sulcal depth, curvature) that describe cortical folding patterns. The superior accuracy of JParc can significantly increase the statistical power in brain mapping studies as well as support applications in surgical planning and many other downstream neuroscientific and clinical tasks.</description>

      <title>NOWA: Null-space Optical Watermark for Invisible Capture Fingerprinting and Tamper Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensuring the authenticity and ownership of digital images is increasingly challenging as modern editing tools enable highly realistic forgeries. Existing image protection systems mainly rely on digital watermarking, which is susceptible to sophisticated digital attacks. To address this limitation, we propose a hybrid optical-digital framework that incorporates physical authentication cues during image formation and preserves them through a learned reconstruction process. At the optical level, a phase mask in the camera aperture produces a Null-space Optical Watermark (NOWA) that lies in the Null Space of the imaging operator and therefore remains invisible in the captured image. Then, a Null-Space Network (NSN) performs measurement-consistent reconstruction that delivers high-quality protected images while preserving the NOWA signature. The proposed design enables tamper localization by projecting the image onto the camera's null space and detecting pixel-level inconsistencies. Our design preserves perceptual quality, resists common degradations such as compression, and establishes a structural security asymmetry: without access to the optical or NSN parameters, adversaries cannot forge the NOWA signature. Experiments with simulations and a prototype camera demonstrate competitive performance in terms of image quality preservation, and tamper localization accuracy compared to state-of-the-art digital watermarking and learning-based authentication methods.</description>

      <title>CoDS: Collaborative Perception via Digital Semantic Communication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.22513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semantic communication has been introduced into collaborative perception systems for autonomous driving, offering a promising approach to enhancing data transmission efficiency and robustness. Despite its potential, existing semantic communication approaches predominantly rely on analog transmission models, rendering these systems fundamentally incompatible with the digital architecture of modern vehicle-to-everything (V2X) networks and posing a significant barrier to real-world deployment. To bridge this critical gap, we propose CoDS, a novel collaborative perception framework based on digital semantic communication, designed to realize semantic-level transmission efficiency within practical digital communication systems. Specifically, we develop a semantic compression codec that extracts and compresses task-oriented semantic features while preserving downstream perception accuracy. Building on this, we propose a novel semantic analog-to-digital converter that converts these continuous semantic features into a discrete bitstream, ensuring integration with existing digital communication pipelines. Furthermore, we develop an uncertainty-aware network (UAN) that assesses the reliability of each received feature and discards those corrupted by decoding failures, thereby mitigating the cliff effect of conventional channel coding schemes under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CoDS significantly outperforms existing semantic communication and traditional digital communication schemes, achieving state-of-the-art perception performance while ensuring compatibility with practical digital V2X systems.</description>

      <title>Improved cystic hygroma detection from prenatal imaging using ultrasound-specific self-supervised representation learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.22730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cystic hygroma is a high-risk prenatal ultrasound finding that portends high rates of chromosomal abnormalities, structural malformations, and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Automated detection can increase reproducibility and support scalable early screening programs, but supervised deep learning methods are limited by small labelled datasets. This study assesses whether ultrasound-specific self-supervised pretraining can facilitate accurate, robust deep learning detection of cystic hygroma in first-trimester ultrasound images. We fine-tuned the Ultrasound Self-Supervised Foundation Model with Masked Autoencoding (USF-MAE), pretrained on over 370,000 unlabelled ultrasound images, for binary classification of normal controls and cystic hygroma cases used in this study. Performance was evaluated on the same curated ultrasound dataset, preprocessing pipeline, and 4-fold cross-validation protocol as for the DenseNet-169 baseline, using accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC). Model interpretability was analyzed qualitatively using Score-CAM visualizations. USF-MAE outperformed the DenseNet-169 baseline on all evaluation metrics. The proposed model yielded a mean accuracy of 0.96, sensitivity of 0.94, specificity of 0.98, and ROC-AUC of 0.98 compared to 0.93, 0.92, 0.94, and 0.94 for the DenseNet-169 baseline, respectively. Qualitative Score-CAM visualizations of model predictions demonstrated clinical relevance by highlighting expected regions in the fetal neck for both positive and negative cases. Paired statistical analysis using a Wilcoxon signed-rank test confirmed that performance improvements achieved by USF-MAE were statistically significant (p = 0.0057).</description>

      <title>Plug In, Grade Right: Psychology-Inspired AGIQA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing AGIQA models typically estimate image quality by measuring and aggregating the similarities between image embeddings and text embeddings derived from multi-grade quality descriptions. Although effective, we observe that such similarity distributions across grades usually exhibit multimodal patterns. For instance, an image embedding may show high similarity to both "excellent" and "poor" grade descriptions while deviating from the "good" one. We refer to this phenomenon as "semantic drift", where semantic inconsistencies between text embeddings and their intended descriptions undermine the reliability of text-image shared-space learning. To mitigate this issue, we draw inspiration from psychometrics and propose an improved Graded Response Model (GRM) for AGIQA. The GRM is a classical assessment model that categorizes a subject's ability across grades using test items with various difficulty levels. This paradigm aligns remarkably well with human quality rating, where image quality can be interpreted as an image's ability to meet various quality grades. Building on this philosophy, we design a two-branch quality grading module: one branch estimates image ability while the other constructs multiple difficulty levels. To ensure monotonicity in difficulty levels, we further model difficulty generation in an arithmetic manner, which inherently enforces a unimodal and interpretable quality distribution. Our Arithmetic GRM based Quality Grading (AGQG) module enjoys a plug-and-play advantage, consistently improving performance when integrated into various state-of-the-art AGIQA frameworks. Moreover, it also generalizes effectively to both natural and screen content image quality assessment, revealing its potential as a key component in future IQA models.</description>

      <title>Hash Grid Feature Pruning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hash grids are widely used to learn an implicit neural field for Gaussian splatting, serving either as part of the entropy model or for inter-frame prediction. However, due to the irregular and non-uniform distribution of Gaussian splats in 3D space, numerous sparse regions exist, rendering many features in the hash grid invalid. This leads to redundant storage and transmission overhead. In this work, we propose a hash grid feature pruning method that identifies and prunes invalid features based on the coordinates of the input Gaussian splats, so that only the valid features are encoded. This approach reduces the storage size of the hash grid without compromising model performance, leading to improved rate-distortion performance. Following the Common Test Conditions (CTC) defined by the standardization committee, our method achieves an average bitrate reduction of 8% compared to the baseline approach.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Networks with Transformer Fusion of Brain Connectivity Dynamics and Tabular Data for Forecasting Future Tobacco Use</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrating non-Euclidean brain imaging data with Euclidean tabular data, such as clinical and demographic information, poses a substantial challenge for medical imaging analysis, particularly in forecasting future outcomes. While machine learning and deep learning techniques have been applied successfully to cross-sectional classification and prediction tasks, effectively forecasting outcomes in longitudinal imaging studies remains challenging. To address this challenge, we introduce a time-aware graph neural network model with transformer fusion (GNN-TF). This model flexibly integrates both tabular data and dynamic brain connectivity data, leveraging the temporal order of these variables within a coherent framework. By incorporating non-Euclidean and Euclidean sources of information from a longitudinal resting-state fMRI dataset from the National Consortium on Alcohol and Neurodevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA), the GNN-TF enables a comprehensive analysis that captures critical aspects of longitudinal imaging data. Comparative analyses against a variety of established machine learning and deep learning models demonstrate that GNN-TF outperforms these state-of-the-art methods, delivering superior predictive accuracy for predicting future tobacco usage. The end-to-end, time-aware transformer fusion structure of the proposed GNN-TF model successfully integrates multiple data modalities and leverages temporal dynamics, making it a valuable analytic tool for functional brain imaging studies focused on clinical outcome prediction.</description>

      <title>NLCG-Net: A Model-Based Zero-Shot Learning Framework for Undersampled Quantitative MRI Reconstruction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12004v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Typical quantitative MRI (qMRI) methods estimate parameter maps in a two-step pipeline that first reconstructs images from undersampled k-space data and then performs model fitting, which is prone to biases and error propagation. We propose NLCG-Net, a model-based nonlinear conjugate gradient (NLCG) framework for joint T2/T1 estimation that incorporates a U-Net regularizer trained in a scan-specific, zero-shot fashion. The method directly estimates qMRI maps from undersampled k-space using mono-exponential signal modeling with scan-specific neural network regularization, enabling high-fidelity T1 and T2 mapping. Experimental results on T2 and T1 mapping demonstrate that NLCG-Net improves estimation quality over subspace reconstruction at high acceleration factors.</description>

      <title>Image and Video Quality Assessment using Prompt-Guided Latent Diffusion Models for Cross-Dataset Generalization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04654v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The design of image and video quality assessment (QA) algorithms is extremely important to benchmark and calibrate user experience in modern visual systems. A major drawback of the state-of-the-art QA methods is their limited ability to generalize across diverse image and video datasets with reasonable distribution shifts. In this work, we leverage the denoising process of diffusion models for generalized image QA (IQA) and video QA (VQA) by understanding the degree of alignment between learnable quality-aware text prompts and images or video frames. In particular, we learn cross-attention maps from intermediate layers of the denoiser of latent diffusion models (LDMs) to capture quality-aware representations of images or video frames. Since applying text-to-image LDMs for every video frame is computationally expensive for videos, we only estimate the quality of a frame-rate sub-sampled version of the original video. To compensate for the loss in motion information due to frame-rate sub-sampling, we propose a novel temporal quality modulator. Our extensive cross-database experiments across various user-generated, synthetic, low-light, frame-rate variation, ultra high definition, and streaming content-based databases show that our model can achieve superior generalization in both IQA and VQA.</description>

      <title>Re-Visible Dual-Domain Self-Supervised Deep Unfolding Network for MRI Reconstruction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03737v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is widely used in clinical practice, but suffered from prolonged acquisition time. Although deep learning methods have been proposed to accelerate acquisition and demonstrate promising performance, they rely on high-quality fully-sampled datasets for training in a supervised manner. However, such datasets are time-consuming and expensive-to-collect, which constrains their broader applications. On the other hand, self-supervised methods offer an alternative by enabling learning from under-sampled data alone, but most existing methods rely on further partitioned under-sampled k-space data as model's input for training, resulting in a loss of valuable information. Additionally, their models have not fully incorporated image priors, leading to degraded reconstruction performance. In this paper, we propose a novel re-visible dual-domain self-supervised deep unfolding network to address these issues when only under-sampled datasets are available. Specifically, by incorporating re-visible dual-domain loss, all under-sampled k-space data are utilized during training to mitigate information loss caused by further partitioning. This design enables the model to implicitly adapt to all under-sampled k-space data as input. Additionally, we design a deep unfolding network based on Chambolle and Pock Proximal Point Algorithm (DUN-CP-PPA) to achieve end-to-end reconstruction, incorporating imaging physics and image priors to guide the reconstruction process. By employing a Spatial-Frequency Feature Extraction (SFFE) block to capture global and local feature representation, we enhance the model's efficiency to learn comprehensive image priors. Experiments conducted on the fastMRI and IXI datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of reconstruction performance.</description>

      <title>UltraBoneUDF: Self-supervised Bone Surface Reconstruction from Ultrasound Based on Neural Unsigned Distance Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17912v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bone surface reconstruction is an essential component of computer-assisted orthopedic surgery(CAOS), forming the foundation for both preoperative planning and intraoperative guidance. Compared to traditional imaging modalities such as computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),ultrasound, an emerging CAOS technology, provides a radiation-free, cost-effective, and portable alternative. While ultrasound offers new opportunities in CAOS, technical shortcomings continue to hinder its translation into surgery. In particular, due to the inherent limitations of ultrasound imaging, B-mode ultrasound typically captures only partial bone surfaces. The inter- and intra-operator variability in ultrasound scanning further increases the complexity of the data. Existing reconstruction methods struggle with such challenging data, leading to increased reconstruction errors and artifacts, such as holes and inflated structures. Effective techniques for accurately reconstructing open bone surfaces from real-world 3D ultrasound volumes remain lacking. We propose UltraBoneUDF, a self-supervised framework specifically designed for reconstructing open bone surfaces from ultrasound data. It learns unsigned distance functions (UDFs) from 3D ultrasound data. In addition, we present a novel loss function based on local tangent plane optimization that substantially improves surface reconstruction quality. UltraBoneUDF and competing models are benchmarked on three open-source datasets and further evaluated through ablation studies. Qualitative results demonstrate the limitations of the state-of-the-art methods. Quantitatively, UltraBoneUDF achieves comparable or lower bi-directional Chamfer distance across three datasets with fewer parameters: 1.60 mm on the UltraBones100k dataset (~25.5% improvement), 0.21 mm on the OpenBoneCT dataset, and 0.18 mm on the ClosedBoneCT dataset.</description>

Abstract: Fractal Image Compression (FIC) is a lossy image compression technique that leverages self-similarity within an image to achieve high compression ratios. However, the process of compressing the image is computationally expensive. This paper investigates optimization techniques to improve the efficiency of FIC, focusing on increasing compression ratio and reducing computational time. The paper explores a novel approach named the Box Counting Method for estimating fractal dimensions, which is very simple to integrate into FIC compared to other algorithms. The results show that implementing these optimization techniques enhances both the compression ratio and the compression time.</description>

Abstract: Medical image classification is a critical task in healthcare, enabling accurate and timely diagnosis. However, deploying deep learning models on resource-constrained edge devices presents significant challenges due to computational and memory limitations. This research investigates a resource-efficient approach to medical image classification by employing model quantization techniques. Quantization reduces the precision of model parameters and activations, significantly lowering computational overhead and memory requirements without sacrificing classification accuracy. The study focuses on the optimization of quantization-aware training (QAT) and post-training quantization (PTQ) methods tailored for edge devices, analyzing their impact on model performance across medical imaging datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that quantized models achieve substantial reductions in model size and inference latency, enabling real-time processing on edge hardware while maintaining clinically acceptable diagnostic accuracy. This work provides a practical pathway for deploying AI-driven medical diagnostics in remote and resource-limited settings, enhancing the accessibility and scalability of healthcare technologies.</description>

Abstract: Accurate assessment of bowel cleanliness is essential for effective colonoscopy procedures. The Boston Bowel Preparation Scale (BBPS) offers a standardized scoring system but suffers from subjectivity and inter-observer variability when performed manually. In this paper, to support robust training and evaluation, we construct a high-quality colonoscopy dataset comprising 2,240 images from 517 subjects, annotated with expert-agreed BBPS scores. We propose a novel automated BBPS scoring framework that leverages the CLIP model with adapter-based transfer learning and a dedicated fecal-feature extraction branch. Our method fuses global visual features with stool-related textual priors to improve the accuracy of bowel cleanliness evaluation without requiring explicit segmentation. Extensive experiments on both our dataset and the public NERTHU dataset demonstrate the superiority of our approach over existing baselines, highlighting its potential for clinical deployment in computer-aided colonoscopy analysis.</description>

Abstract: The rapid growth of deep neural network (DNN) workloads has significantly increased the demand for large-capacity on-chip SRAM in machine learning (ML) applications, with SRAM arrays now occupying a substantial fraction of the total die area. To address the dual challenges of storage density and computation efficiency, this paper proposes an NVM-in-Cache architecture that integrates resistive RAM (RRAM) devices into a conventional 6T-SRAM cell, forming a compact 6T-2R bit-cell. This hybrid cell enables Processing-in-Memory (PIM) mode, which performs massively parallel multiply-and-accumulate (MAC) operations directly on cache power lines while preserving stored cache data. By exploiting the intrinsic properties of the 6T-2R structure, the architecture achieves additional storage capability, high computational throughput without any bit-cell area overhead. Circuit- and array-level simulations in GlobalFoundries 22nm FDSOI technology demonstrate that the proposed design achieves a throughput of 0.4 TOPS and 452.34 TOPS/W. For 128 row-parallel operations, the CIFAR-10 classification is demonstrated by mapping a Resnet-18 neural network, achieving an accuracy of 91.76%. These results highlight the potential of the NVM-in-Cache approach to serve as a scalable, energy-efficient computing method by re-purposing existing 6T SRAM cache architecture for next-generation AI accelerators and general purpose processors.</description>

      <title>Multi Modal Attention Networks with Uncertainty Quantification for Automated Concrete Bridge Deck Delamination Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20113</link>

Abstract: Deteriorating civil infrastructure requires automated inspection techniques overcoming limitations of visual assessment. While Ground Penetrating Radar and Infrared Thermography enable subsurface defect detection, single modal approaches face complementary constraints radar struggles with moisture and shallow defects, while thermography exhibits weather dependency and limited depth. This paper presents a multi modal attention network fusing radar temporal patterns with thermal spatial signatures for bridge deck delamination detection. Our architecture introduces temporal attention for radar processing, spatial attention for thermal features, and cross modal fusion with learnable embeddings discovering complementary defect patterns invisible to individual sensors. We incorporate uncertainty quantification through Monte Carlo dropout and learned variance estimation, decomposing uncertainty into epistemic and aleatoric components for safety critical decisions. Experiments on five bridge datasets reveal that on balanced to moderately imbalanced data, our approach substantially outperforms baselines in accuracy and AUC representing meaningful improvements over single modal and concatenation based fusion. Ablation studies demonstrate cross modal attention provides critical gains beyond within modality attention, while multi head mechanisms achieve improved calibration. Uncertainty quantification reduces calibration error, enabling selective prediction by rejecting uncertain cases. However, under extreme class imbalance, attention mechanisms show vulnerability to majority class collapse. These findings provide actionable guidance: attention based architecture performs well across typical scenarios, while extreme imbalance requires specialized techniques. Our system maintains deployment efficiency, enabling real time inspection with characterized capabilities and limitations.</description>
