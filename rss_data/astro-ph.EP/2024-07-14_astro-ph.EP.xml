      <title>Searching for Protoplanets around MWC 758 and MWC 480 in Br-$\gamma$ using Kernel Phase and SCExAO/CHARIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discovering new actively-accreting protoplanets is crucial to answering open questions about planet formation. However, identifying such planets at orbital distances where they are expected to be abundant is extremely challenging, both due to the technical requirements and large distances to star-forming regions. Here we use the kernel phase interferometry (KPI) technique to search for companions around the $\sim$6 and $\sim$8 Myr old Herbig Ae stars MWC 758 and MWC 480. KPI is a data analysis technique which is sensitive to moderate asymmetries, arising from eg. a circumstellar disk or companions with contrasts of up to 6-8 mags, at separations down to and even below the classical Rayleigh diffraction limit ($\sim 1.2\lambda / D$). Using the high spectral resolution K-band mode of the SCExAO/CHARIS integral field spectrograph, we search for both excess Br-$\gamma$ line emission and continuum emission from companions around MWC 480 and MWC 758. We are able to set limits on the presence of rapidly accreting protoplanets and brown dwarfs between 4 and 16 au, well interior to those of previous studies. In Br-$\gamma$, we set limits on excess line emission equivalent to accretion rates ranging from $10^{-5} M_{j}^{2}.yr^{-1}$ to $10^{-6}M_{j}^{2}.yr^{-1}$. Our achievable contrasts demonstrate that KPI using SCExAO/CHARIS is a promising technique to search for giant accreting protoplanets at smaller separations compared to conventional imaging.</description>

      <title>Hot Spot Offset Variability from Magnetohydrodynamical Thermoresistive Instability in Hot Jupiters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hot Jupiter atmospheres are possibly subject to a thermoresistive instability. Such an instability may develop as the ohmic heating increases the electrical conductivity in a positive feedback loop, which ultimately leads to a runaway of the atmospheric temperature. We extend our previous axisymmetric one-dimensional radial model, by representing the temperature and magnetic diffusivity as a first order Fourier expansion in longitude. This allows us to predict the hot spot offset during the unfolding of the thermoresistive instability and following Alfv\'enic oscillations. We show a representative simulation undergoing the thermoresistive instability, in which the peak flux offset varies between approximately $\pm 60^{\circ}$ on timescales of a few days with potentially observable brightness variations. Therefore, this thermoresistive instability could be an observable feature of hot Jupiters, given the right timing of observation and transit and the right planetary parameters.</description>

      <title>Probing Cold-to-Temperate Exoplanetary Atmospheres: The Role of Water Condensation on Surface Identification with JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the surface temperature and interior structure of cold-to-temperate sub-Neptunes is critical for assessing their habitability, yet direct observations are challenging. In this study, we investigate the impact of water condensation on the atmospheric compositions of sub-Neptunes, focusing on the implications for JWST spectroscopic observations. By modeling the atmospheric photochemistry of two canonical sub-Neptunes, K2-18 b and LHS 1140 b, both with and without water condensation and with and without thick atmospheres, we demonstrate that water condensation can significantly affect the predicted atmospheric compositions. This effect is driven by oxygen depletion from the condensation of water vapor and primarily manifests as an increase in the C/O ratio within the photochemically active regions of the atmosphere. This change in composition particularly affects planets with thin H$_2$-dominated atmospheres, leading to a transition in dominant nitrogen and carbon carriers from N$_2$ and oxygen-rich species like CO/CO$_2$ towards heavier hydrocarbons and nitriles. While our models do not fully account for the loss mechanisms of these higher-order species, such molecules can go on to form more refractory molecules or hazes. Planets with thin H2-rich atmospheres undergoing significant water condensation are thus likely to exhibit very hazy atmospheres. The relatively flat JWST spectra observed for LHS 1140 b could be consistent with such a scenario, suggesting a shallow surface with extensive water condensation or a high atmospheric C/O ratio. Conversely, the JWST observations of K2-18 b are better aligned with a volatile-rich mini-Neptune with a thick atmosphere.</description>

      <title>The effect of spectroscopic binning on atmospheric retrievals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) offering higher resolution data in space-based transmission spectroscopy, understanding the capabilities of our current atmospheric retrieval pipelines is essential. These new data cover wider wavelength ranges and at much higher spectral resolution than previous instruments have been able to offer. Therefore, it is often appealing to bin spectra to fewer points, better constrained in their transit depth, before using them as inputs for atmospheric retrievals. However, little quantitative analysis of the trade-off between spectral resolution and signal-to-noise ratio has been conducted thus far. As such, we produce a simulation replicating the observations of WASP-39b by the NIRSpec PRISM instrument on board JWST and assess the accuracy and consistency of retrievals while varying resolution and the average photometric error. While this probes a specific case we also plot `binning paths' in the resulting sensitivity maps to demonstrate the best attainable atmospheric parameter estimations starting from the position of the real JWST Early Release Science observation. We repeat this analysis on three different simulation setups where each includes an opaque cloud layer at a different height in the atmosphere. We find that a much greater resolution is needed in the case of a high cloud deck since features are already heavily muted by the presence of the clouds. In the other two cases, there are large `safe zones' in the parameter space. If these maps can be generalised, binning paths could inform future observations on how to achieve the most accurate retrieval results.</description>

      <title>Convective mixing in giant planets and the connection to atmospheric measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linking atmospheric measurements to the bulk planetary composition and ultimately the planetary origin is a key objective in planetary science. In this work we identify the cases in which the atmospheric composition represents the bulk composition. We simulate the evolution of giant planets considering a wide range of planetary masses ($0.3-2~M_\mathrm{J}$), initial entropies ($8-11~k_\mathrm{B} m_\mathrm{u}^{-1}$), and primordial heavy-element profiles. We find that convective mixing is most efficient at early times (ages $\lesssim 10^7$ years) and that primordial composition gradients can be eroded. In several cases, however, the atmospheric composition can differ widely from the planetary bulk composition, with the exact outcome depending on the details. We show that the efficiency of convection is primarily controlled by the underlying entropy profile: for low primordial entropies of $8-9~k_\mathrm{B} m_\mathrm{u}^{-1}$ convective mixing can be inhibited and composition gradients can persist over billions of years. The scaling of mixing efficiency with mass is governed by the primordial entropy. For the same primordial entropy, low-mass planets mix more efficiently than high mass planets. If the primordial internal entropy would increase with mass, however, this trend could reverse. We also present a new analytical model that predicts convective mixing under the existence of composition (and entropy) gradients. Our results emphasize the complexity in the interpretation of atmospheric abundance measurements and show the great need to better understand the planetary formation process as it plays a key role in determining the planetary evolution and final structure.</description>

      <title>Seasonal variation of Saturn's Lyman-$\alpha$ brightness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine Saturn's non-auroral (dayglow) emissions at Lyman-$\alpha$ observed by the {Cassini/UVIS} instrument from 2004 until 2016, to constrain meridional and seasonal trends in the upper atmosphere. We separate viewing geometry effects from trends driven by atmospheric properties, by applying a multi-variate regression to the observed emissions. The Lyman-$\alpha$ dayglow brightnesses depend on the incident solar flux, solar incidence angle, emission angle, and observed latitude. The emissions across latitudes and seasons show a strong dependence with solar incidence angle, typical of resonantly scattered solar flux and consistent with no significant internal source. We observe a bulge in Ly-$\alpha$ brightness that shifts with the summer season from the southern to the northern hemisphere. We estimate atomic hydrogen optical depths above the methane homopause level for dayside disk observations (2004-2016) by comparing observed Lyman-$\alpha$ emissions to a radiative transfer model. We model emissions from resonantly scattered solar flux and a smaller but significant contribution by scattered photons from the interplanetary hydrogen (IPH) background. During northern summer, inferred hydrogen optical depths steeply decrease with latitude towards the winter hemisphere from a northern hemisphere bulge, as predicted by a 2D seasonal photochemical model. The southern hemisphere mirrors this trend during its summer. However, inferred optical depths show substantially more temporal variation between 2004 and 2016 than predicted by the photochemical model.</description>

      <title>A grid of self-consistent MSG (MARCS-StaticWeather-GGchem) cool stellar, sub-stellar, and exoplanetary model atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computation of a grid of self consistent 1D model atmospheres of cool stars, sub-stellar objects and exoplanets in the effective temperature range 300K to 3000K, including cloud formation, chemical non-equilibrium effects, and stellar irradiation.
  The models are called MSG, because they are based on an iterative coupling between three well tested codes, the MARCS stellar atmosphere code, the StaticWeather cloud formation code and the GGchem chemical equilibrium code. It includes up-to-date molecular and atomic opacities, cloud formation and advanced chemical equilibrium calculations, and involves new numerical methods at low temperatures to allow robust convergence.
  The coupling between the MARCS radiative transfer and GGchem chemical equilibrium computations has made it possibly effectively to reach convergence based on electron pressure for the warmer models and gas pressure for the cooler models, enabling self-consistent modelling of stellar, sub-stellar and exoplanetary objects in a very wide range of effective temperatures. Here we describe the basic details of the models, with illustrative examples of cloudy and irradiated models as well as models based on non-equilibrium chemistry.
  The qualitative changes in the relative abundances of TiO, H2O, CH4, NH3, and other molecules in our models follow the observationally defined M, L, T (and Y) sequences, but reveal more complex and depth dependent abundance changes, and therefore a spectral classification depending on more parameters. The self consistent coupling to Static-Weather cloud computations, allows detailed comparison between nucleation and observed relative dimming of different spectral bands, with advanced applications for new identification methods of potential exoplanetary biology.</description>

      <title>The JWST Weather Report from the Nearest Brown Dwarfs I: multi-period JWST NIRSpec + MIRI monitoring of the benchmark binary brown dwarf WISE 1049AB</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report results from 8 hours of JWST/MIRI LRS spectroscopic monitoring directly followed by 7 hours of JWST/NIRSpec prism spectroscopic monitoring of the benchmark binary brown dwarf WISE 1049AB, the closest, brightest brown dwarfs known. We find water, methane, and CO absorption features in both components, including the 3.3 $\mu$m methane absorption feature and a tentative detection of small grain ($&lt;$ 1$\mu$m) silicate absorption at $&gt;$8.5 $\mu$m in WISE 1049A. Both components vary significantly ($&gt;$1$\%$), with WISE 1049B displaying larger variations than WISE 1049A. Using K-means clustering, we find three main transition points in wavelength for both components of the binary: 1) change in behavior at $\sim$2.3 $\mu$m coincident with a CO absorption bandhead, 2) change in behavior at 4.2 $\mu$m, close to the CO fundamental band at $\lambda &gt;$ 4.4 $\mu$m, and 3) change in behavior at 8.3-8.5 $\mu$m, potentially corresponding to silicate absorption. We interpret the lightcurves observed with both NIRSpec and MIRI as likely stemming from 1) a deep pressure level driving the double-peaked variability seen in WISE 1049B at wavelengths $&lt;$2.3 $\mu$m and $&gt;$8.5 $\mu$m, 2) an intermediate pressure level shaping the lightcurve morphology between 2.3 and 4.2 $\mu$m, and 3) a higher-altitude pressure level producing single-peaked and plateaued lightcurve behavior between 4.2 and 8.5 $\mu$m.</description>

      <title>Free-Floating Planets, Survivor Planets, Captured Planets and Binary Planets from Stellar Flybys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07224v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In star clusters, close stellar encounters can strongly impact the architecture of a planetary system or even destroy it. We present a systematic study on the effects of stellar flybys on two-planet systems. When such a system experiences flybys, one or both planets can be ejected, forming free-floating planets (FFPs), captured planets (CPs) around the flyby star, and free-floating binary planets (BPs); the remaining single-surviving-planets (SSPs) can have their orbital radii and eccentricities greatly changed. Through numerical experiments, we calculate the formation fractions (or branching ratios) of FFPs, SSPs, CPs and BPs as a function of the pericenter distance of the flyby, and use them to derive analytical expressions for the formation rates of FFPs, SSPs, CPs and BPs in general cluster environments. We find that the production rates of FFPs and SSPs are similar (for initial planet semi-major axis ratio $a_1/a_2=0.6-0.8$), while the rate for CPs is a few times smaller. The formation fraction of BPs depends strongly on $a_1/a_2$ and on the planet masses. For Jupiter-mass planets, the formation fraction of BPs is always less than $1\%$ (for $a_1/a_2=0.8$) and typically much smaller ($\lesssim 0.2\%$ for $a_1/a_2\lesssim 0.7$). The fraction remains less than $1\%$ when considering $4M_{\rm J}$ planets. Overall, when averaging over all flybys, the production rate of BPs is less than $0.1\%$ of that for FFPs. We also derive the velocity distribution of FFPs produced by stellar flybys, and the orbital parameter distributions of SSPs, CPs and BPs. These results can be used in future studies of exotic planets (including FFPs) and planetary systems.</description>
