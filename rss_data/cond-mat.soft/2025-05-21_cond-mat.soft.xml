      <title>An adaptive, data-driven multiscale approach for dense granular flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accuracy of coarse-grained continuum models of dense granular flows is limited by the lack of high-fidelity closure models for granular rheology. One approach to addressing this issue, referred to as the hierarchical multiscale method, is to use a high-fidelity fine-grained model to compute the closure terms needed by the coarse-grained model. The difficulty with this approach is that the overall model can become computationally intractable due to the high computational cost of the high-fidelity model. In this work, we describe a multiscale modeling approach for dense granular flows that utilizes neural networks trained using high-fidelity discrete element method (DEM) simulations to approximate the constitutive granular rheology for a continuum incompressible flow model. Our approach leverages an ensemble of neural networks to estimate predictive uncertainty that allows us to determine whether the rheology at a given point is accurately represented by the neural network model. Additional DEM simulations are only performed when needed, minimizing the number of additional DEM simulations required when updating the rheology. This adaptive coupling significantly reduces the overall computational cost of the approach while controlling the error. In addition, the neural networks are customized to learn regularized rheological behavior to ensure well-posedness of the continuum solution. We first validate the approach using two-dimensional steady-state and decelerating inclined flows. We then demonstrate the efficiency of our approach by modeling three-dimensional sub-aerial granular column collapse for varying initial column aspect ratios, where our multiscale method compares well with the computationally expensive computational fluid dynamics (CFD)-DEM simulation.</description>

      <title>The evolution of invasion patterns due to surfactant adsorption in anomalous pore distribution: Role of Mass Transfer and Laplace Pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here, we develop a time-dependent pore network model (PNM) to simulate the effects of surfactant-induced IFT reduction on immiscible displacement driven by constant inlet pressure, with pressure drops across the network calculated using a random resistor network and mass conservation equations. Node-specific flux and velocity are derived using the Hagen-Poiseuille equation, and surfactant adsorption is modeled using the Langmuir isotherm, capturing its impact on fluid-fluid and solid-fluid interfaces within the invaded path. Since the evolution of the invasion pattern comprises the cooperative mechanisms of surfactant mass transfer to the interfaces and the resulting changes in capillary and Laplace pressures, we employ two strategies to quantify this complex feedback behavior: mass transfer-based, introducing a mass transfer timescale, and Laplace pressure-based, scaling with the inlet pressure. Results reveal that an anomalous or heavy-tailed pore throat distribution accelerates the onset of secondary invasions, which enhances the dominance of Laplace pressure. As the distribution becomes less anomalous or more symmetric, mass transfer becomes the dominant mechanism. This interplay highlights the intricate balance between mass transfer and capillary effects in governing the spatio-temporal evolution of immiscible fluid invasion.</description>

      <title>Drainage front width in a three-dimensional random porous medium under gravitational and capillary effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A theoretical approach to estimating stable drainage front widths in three-dimensional random porous media under gravitational and capillary effects is presented. Based on the frontier of the infinite cluster in gradient percolation, we propose an expression for the 3D front width dependent on the pore-network topology, the distribution of capillary pressure thresholds for the pore throats, the stabilizing capillary pressure gradient, the average pore size, and the correlation length critical exponent from percolation in three dimensions. Theoretical predictions are successfully compared to numerical results obtained with a bond invasion-percolation model for a wide range of drainage flow parameters.</description>

      <title>Long-term microgravity experiments reveal a new mechanism for particle aggregation in suspension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microgravity experiments on board the International Space Station, combined with particle-resolved direct numerical simulations, were conducted to investigate the long-term flocculation behavior of clay suspensions in saline water in the absence of gravity. After an initial homogenization of the suspensions, different clay compositions were continuously monitored for 99 days, allowing a detailed analysis of aggregate growth through image processing. The results indicate that the onboard oscillations (g-jitter) may have accelerated the aggregation process. Aggregate growth driven by these oscillations is found to occur at a faster rate than aggregation caused by Brownian motion. This effect is further confirmed by numerical simulations, which also demonstrated that parameters such as the oscillation amplitude and the solid volume fraction influence growth acceleration. These findings highlight that oscillations may act as a previously unrecognized mechanism that contributes to particle aggregation in fluids.</description>

      <title>Genetic Algorithm-Accelerated Computational Discovery of Liquid Crystal Polymers with Enhanced Optical Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Liquid crystal polymers with exceptional optical properties are highly promising for next-generation virtual, augmented, and mixed reality (VR/AR/MR) technologies, serving as high-performance, compact, lightweight, and cost-effective optical components. However, the growing demands for optical transparency and high refractive index in advanced optical devices present a challenge for material discovery. In this study, we develop a novel approach that integrates first-principles calculations with genetic algorithms to accelerate the discovery of liquid crystal polymers with low visible absorption and high refractive index. By iterating within a predefined space of molecular building blocks, our approach rapidly identifies reactive mesogens that meet target specifications. Additionally, it provides valuable insights into the relationships between molecular structure and properties. This strategy not only accelerates material screening but also uncovers key molecular design principles, offering a systematic and scalable alternative to traditional trial-and-error methods.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of the Influence of Structural Parameters on the Mechanical Properties of Foam Glasses via In-Situ Micro-CT Mechanical Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foam glass made from waste glass has high chemical and mechanical stability and flexible structural properties, making it suitable for a wide range of applications. To ensure its reliability, it is essential to understand its mechanical properties and fracture mechanisms. In this study, we investigated morphological features related to pore structure alongside mechanical properties, specifically Young's modulus and compressive strength, of three different monolithic foam glass samples using micro-computed tomography combined with ex-situ and in-situ uniaxial compression experiments and Digital Volume Correlation (DVC) analysis. The foam glasses exhibit an inverse relationship between mechanical strength and factors such as wall thickness, porosity, pore size and irregularity, with the compressive strength following a power-law correlation with the proportion of large pores. The multi-peak behavior of the stress-strain curves indicates micro-cracking within the porous lattice. Micro-CT data show that damage is concentrated at the upper and lower extremes of the specimens, and that the applied strain induces changes in the porosity, mean pore diameter, and pore sphericity, driven by deformation and collapse of the pore structures. DVC analysis quantitatively validated these observations.</description>

      <title>Impact of Acid Hydrolysis on Morphology, Rheology, Mechanical Properties, and Processing of Thermoplastic Starch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We modified native wheat starch using 15, 30, and 60 min of acid hydrolysis (AH). The non-modified and AH-modified starches were converted to highly-homogeneous thermo-plastic starches (TPS) using our two-step preparation protocol consisting of solution cast-ing and melt-mixing. Our main objective was to verify if the AH can decrease the pro-cessing temperature of TPS. All samples were characterized in detail by microscopic, spectroscopic, diffraction, thermomechanical, rheological, and micromechanical methods, including in situ measurements of torque and temperature during the final melt-mixing step. The experimental results showed that: (i) the AH decreased the average molecular weight preferentially in the amorphous regions, (ii) the lower-viscosity matrix in the AH-treated starches resulted in slightly higher crystallinity, and (iii) all AH-modified TPS with less viscous amorphous phase and higher content of crystalline phase exhibited similar properties. The effect of the higher crystallinity predominated at laboratory tem-perature and low deformations, resulting in slightly stiffer material. The effect of the low-er-viscosity dominated during the melt mixing, where the shorter molecules acted as a lubricant and decreased the in situ measured processing temperature. The AH-induced decrease in the processing temperature could be beneficial for energy savings and/or pos-sible temperature-sensitive admixtures to TPS systems.</description>

      <title>Polymer Data Challenges in the AI Era: Bridging Gaps for Next-Generation Energy Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pursuit of advanced polymers for energy technologies, spanning photovoltaics, solid-state batteries, and hydrogen storage, is hindered by fragmented data ecosystems that fail to capture the hierarchical complexity of these materials. Polymer science lacks interoperable databases, forcing reliance on disconnected literature and legacy records riddled with unstructured formats and irreproducible testing protocols. This fragmentation stifles machine learning (ML) applications and delays the discovery of materials critical for global decarbonization. Three systemic barriers compound the challenge. First, academic-industrial data silos restrict access to proprietary industrial datasets, while academic publications often omit critical synthesis details. Second, inconsistent testing methods undermine cross-study comparability. Third, incomplete metadata in existing databases limits their utility for training reliable ML models. Emerging solutions address these gaps through technological and collaborative innovation. Natural language processing (NLP) tools extract structured polymer data from decades of literature, while high-throughput robotic platforms generate self-consistent datasets via autonomous experimentation. Central to these advances is the adoption of FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles, adapted to polymer-specific ontologies, ensuring machine-readability and reproducibility. Future breakthroughs hinge on cultural shifts toward open science, accelerated by decentralized data markets and autonomous laboratories that merge robotic experimentation with real-time ML validation. By addressing data fragmentation through technological innovation, collaborative governance, and ethical stewardship, the polymer community can transform bottlenecks into accelerants.</description>

      <title>Simulating non-Brownian suspensions with non-homogeneous Navier slip boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluid-structure interactions are commonly modeled using no-slip boundary conditions. However, small deviations from these conditions can significantly alter the dynamics of suspensions and particles, especially at the micro and nano scales. This work presents a robust implicit numerical method for simulating non-colloidal suspensions with non-homogeneous Navier slip boundary conditions. Our approach is based on a regularized boundary integral formulation, enabling accurate and efficient computation of hydrodynamic interactions. This makes the method well-suited for large-scale simulations. We validate the method by comparing computed drag forces on homogeneous and Janus particles with analytical results. Additionally, we consider the effective viscosity of suspensions with varying slip lengths, benchmarking against available analytical no-slip and partial-slip theories.</description>

      <title>Solving Lyapunov equations for electrically driven ternary electrolytes -- application to long-range van der Waals interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic density functional theory (SDFT) has been widely used to study the out of equilibrium properties of electrolyte solutions. Examples include investigations of electrical conductivity -- both within and beyond linear response -- and modifications of thermal van der Waals interactions in driven electrolytes. Within the approximation scheme derived from linearizing SDFT for fluctuations around mean densities, the steady state correlation functions between the $N$ ionic species are governed by linear Lyapunov equations of degree $N(N+1)/2$. Consequently, the system's complexity increases significantly when transitioning from binary to ternary electrolytes, and few analytical results exist for the latter. In this paper, we demonstrate how -- for the specific case of electrolytes -- the Lyapunov equations can be reduced to a system of $N$ linear equations. We apply this reduction to compute the long-range component of the van der Waals interaction between two slabs containing a ternary electrolyte under an applied electric field parallel to the slabs. Unlike the binary electrolyte case, we show that the resulting van der Waals interaction for a ternary electrolyte depends on the ionic species' diffusion coefficients, highlighting its inherently out of equilibrium nature.</description>

      <title>Water-rich amorphous state from drying mixed-metal sulfate solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Amorphous and glassy materials are important for many advanced applications, from flexible solar cells to drug delivery systems. To this end, new glasses are in high demand, but precise chemical design of amorphous materials remains challenging. By studying the crystallization of mixed salt solutions, we have discovered an entirely new type of amorphous material: water-rich amorphous mixed sulfates. Specifically, we show that drying of sulfate salt mixtures of both mono- and higher valency cations almost exclusively yields a glassy or amorphous state, where the stability of the amorphous state depends on the cations present and ranges from seconds to months. Furthermore, we show that the glassy state is viscoelastic, behaves like a soft solid (G' 10^5 - 10^6 Pa), retains a large amount of water (30 to 40 weight percent), and is X-ray amorphous. Additionally, confocal Raman microspectroscopy reveals disordered sulfate orientations and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy highlights increased hydrogen bonding during drying, which together with strong cation hydration is hypothesized to prevent crystallization. These results provide insights for the production of a new class of amorphous materials, and help to elucidate the mystery of the high abundance of such amorphous salts found on Mars.</description>

      <title>Freezing line of polydisperse hard spheres via direct-coexistence simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In experimental systems, colloidal particles are virtually always at least somewhat polydisperse, which can have profound effects on their ability to crystallize. Unfortunately, accurately predicting the effects of polydispersity on phase behavior using computer simulations remains a challenging task. As a result, our understanding of the equilibrium phase behavior of even the simplest colloidal model system, hard spheres, remains limited. Here, we present a new approach to map out the freezing line of polydisperse systems that draws on direct-coexistence simulations in the semi-grand canonical ensemble. We use this new method to map out the conditions where a hard-sphere fluid with a Gaussian size distribution becomes metastable with respect to partial crystallization into a face-centered-cubic crystal. Consistent with past predictions, we find that as the polydispersity of the fluid increases, the coexisting crystal becomes increasingly size-selective, exhibiting a lower polydispersity and larger mean particle size than the fluid phase. Interestingly, for sufficiently high polydispersity, this leads to a crystal phase with a lower number density than that of the coexisting fluid. Finally, we exploit our direct-coexistence simulations to examine the characteristics of the fluid-crystal interface, including the surface stress and interfacial absorption.</description>

      <title>Role of Friction on the Formation of Confined Granular Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metastable systems of fluidized grains can auto-defluidize after some time, the settling particles forming either a glass- or crystal-like structure. We carried out experiments using different polymer spheres, of known friction and roughness, fluidized in water. We show that the level of velocity fluctuations is higher for the high friction material. A diagram was obtained for the settled particles when the coefficient of friction is of the order of 0.1, and their structure is characterized through an analysis of the nearest neighbors' angles. For the lower friction values, we find that the number of defects is smaller, the contact chains being longer and aligned. Our results bring new insights for understanding the formation of glass- and crystal-like structures based on the material surface properties.</description>

      <title>Influence of active breathing on rheology and jamming of amorphous solids: insights from microscopic and mesoscale analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the flow behavior and unjamming transition in dense assemblies of actively deforming particles that periodically change size, a process that we refer to as breathing. Using extensive molecular dynamics simulations and a complementary mesoscale elasto-plastic model, we explore how this internal activity influences plasticity and rheology. At low amplitudes of breathing, the system remains jammed and displays localized, reversible rearrangements. As the amplitude of the breathing increases beyond a critical threshold, the system undergoes an activity-induced fluidization marked by a surge in plastic events and a drop in yield stress. The flow curve analysis reveals a transition from yield-stress behavior to Newtonian flow at high activity. The mesoscale model captures these trends and provides insight into the role of stress redistribution due to local active deformations. Our findings highlight the potential of internal active driving to tune the mechanical state of amorphous materials without external forcing.</description>

We vary the gravitational field (g), elastic modulus of the particles (E), and silo outlet diameter (D). We present results on upwards pressure waves observed in the system. We compare our results with previous work on granular acoustics. Despite the typical particle speed being substantially less than the measured wave speed, we posit these are nonlinear shock waves, as observed in other systems near jamming. We demonstrate that the wave speeds in all systems appear to follow a power law that is distinct from linear wave expectations.</description>

      <title>Impact of Surfactant and Flow Rate on the Electrical Properties of Activated Carbon Black Suspensions</title>

Abstract: Carbon black slurries are a key component in redox flow batteries as the large surface area provided by the particles allows an increase in the battery capacity without facing limitations posed by many solid-state batteries such as safety hazard or cost. However, these conductive slurries often have complex mechanical and electrical responses because of the heterogeneous nature of the suspensions. Utilization of these slurries in a redox flow battery requires understanding of how additives impact the material responses and associated battery performance. This work focuses on the electrochemical performance of the slurry at flow rate conditions matching those of battery operation. In addition, the impact of a nonionic surfactant (Triton X-100) on the conductivity and capacitance of the slurry was measured. Experimental results show that the full capacitive contribution of the carbon black particles can only be measured at low flow rates and low scan rates, while the conductive contribution can be measured at all scan rates in flowing conditions. Upon the addition of surfactants, there is a gradual decrease in the electrochemical performance with increasing surfactant concentration until the surface of the carbon black particle is saturated. Once saturated, the conductive carbon particles no longer contribute to the electronic conductivity of the slurry. Results presented herein on the electrochemical response of the slurry to the addition of surfactant are in stark contrast to the mechanical response. While previous work has shown a smaller change in the response, followed by a step-change at a critical surfactant concentration, electrochemical data shows a gradual transition. Comparison of these behaviors suggests a difference in the mechanisms for how mechanical networks form in comparison to charge transfer networks for this particular slurry chemistry.</description>

      <title>Echo State and Band-pass Networks with aqueous memristors: leaky reservoir computing with a leaky substrate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) are extensively employed for processing sequential data such as time series. Reservoir computing (RC) has drawn attention as an RNN framework due to its fixed network that does not require training, making it an attractive for hardware based machine learning. We establish an explicit correspondence between the well-established mathematical RC implementations of Echo State Networks and Band-pass Networks with Leaky Integrator nodes on the one hand and a physical circuit containing iontronic simple volatile memristors on the other. These aqueous iontronic devices employ ion transport through water as signal carriers, and feature a voltage-dependent (memory) conductance. The activation function and the dynamics of the Leaky Integrator nodes naturally materialise as the (dynamic) conductance properties of iontronic memristors, while a simple fixed local current-to-voltage update rule at the memristor terminals facilitates the relevant matrix coupling between nodes. We process various time series, including pressure data from simulated airways during breathing that can be directly fed into the network due to the intrinsic responsiveness of iontronic devices to applied pressures. This is done while using established physical equations of motion of iontronic memristors for the internal dynamics of the circuit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fluctuation-induced forces, primarily represented by quantum and critical Casimir effects, play a pivotal role at the nanoscale. This review explores the theoretical and experimental landscapes of these forces, offering a comprehensive analysis of their similarities and distinctions. We emphasize the effects of material properties, geometry, and temperature in shaping these forces and their roles in various nanoscale systems, both colloidal and solid-state. We devote special attention to the Casimir torque, the influence of magnetism on the Casimir force, and the use of Casimir effects for the generation of optical resonators. Through this comparative study, we elucidate the underlying physics of these phenomena, fostering insights that advance applications in nanomechanics, optomechanics, and quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Active drive towards elastic spinodals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17517v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Active matter, exemplified by adaptive living materials such as the actomyosin cytoskeleton, can navigate material parameter space dynamically, leading to unconventional mechanical responses. In particular, it can self-drive toward elastic spinodal regimes, where inhomogeneous floppy modes induce elastic degeneracy and enable a controlled interplay between rigidity loss and recovery. Proximity to such marginal states leads to stress localization and the formation of force chains that can be actively assembled and disassembled. Here, we extend the classical notion of spinodal states to active solids and demonstrate how these extreme mechanical regimes can be actively accessed. Moreover, we show that in a nonlinear setting, crossing elastic spinodals generates new energy wells and makes force channeling an intrinsic feature of the emerging microstructure.</description>

      <title>A convolutional neural network technique for online tracking of the radius evolution of levitating evaporating microdroplets of pure liquids, liquid mixtures and suspensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08857v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have used convolutional neural network in a classification task to track the radius evolution of levitating evaporating microdroplets of pure diethylene glycol, diethylene glycol water polystyrene microparticles suspension, dipropylene glycol water mixture and dipropylene glycol water silica nanoparticles suspension. We discretized a wider radii range into short radii segments, labeled them with class numbers and generated theoretically light scattering patterns from Mie theory. Then the network was trained on the theoretical images and used to classify unlabeled experimentally recorded Mie scattering patterns from the evaporating microdroplets. A plot of the class average radii versus the camera s time step revealed the profile of the entire droplet radius evolution. We were able to work with approximately 1500 classes and showed that the technique has the potential to distinguish droplet size difference of 5 nm. We expect it to be applicable for online or real time tracking of droplet evaporation.</description>

      <title>Predicting Heteropolymer Phase Separation Using Two-Chain Contact Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04659v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phase separation in polymer solutions often correlates with single-chain and two-chain properties, such as the single-chain radius of gyration, Rg, and the pairwise second virial coefficient, B22. However, recent studies have shown that these metrics can fail to distinguish phase-separating from non-phase-separating heteropolymers, including intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). Here we introduce an approach to predict heteropolymer phase separation from two-chain simulations by analyzing contact maps, which capture how often specific monomers from the two chains are in physical proximity. Whereas B22 summarizes the overall attraction between two chains, contact maps preserve spatial information about their interactions. To compare these metrics, we train phase-separation classifiers for both a minimal heteropolymer model and a chemically specific, residue-level IDP model. Remarkably, simple statistical properties of two-chain contact maps predict phase separation with high accuracy, vastly outperforming classifiers based on Rg and B22 alone. Our results thus establish a transferable and computationally efficient method to uncover key driving forces of IDP phase behavior based on their physical interactions in dilute solution.</description>

      <title>Analytic solution for the nonlinear response of magnetic nanoparticles to large-amplitude oscillatory fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18402v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonlinear responses of physical systems to strong perturbations are notoriously difficult to tackle analytically. Here, we present analytic results for the nonlinear response of magnetic nanoparticles to large amplitude oscillatory magnetic fields based on a particular model for the magnetization dynamics. A number of characteristic features of the in-phase and out-of-phase higher-harmonic response are found and analyzed. In particular we find that the magnitude of higher harmonic contributions Rn depends on the field amplitude and frequency only via a single scaling variable that combines the two quantities. The decrease of |Rn|with increasing order nof harmonics is a key quantity monitored in biomedical applications such as magnetic particle spectroscopy and magnetic particle imaging. Except for the first few harmonics, we find that this decrease is exponential with a rate that depends on the scaling variable only. For not too high frequencies and not loo large amplitudes, we find that these exact results for one particular model of magnetization dynamics hold approximately also for other, more frequently used models. Our results therefore offer not only deeper insight into strongly nonlinear responses of magnetic nanoparticles, especially for higher harmonics that are very difficult to determine numerically, but also suggest analyzing data in terms of a scaling variable.</description>

      <title>Delayed Active Swimmer in a Velocity Landscape</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11042v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Self-propelled active particles exhibit delayed responses to environmental changes, modulating their propulsion speed through intrinsic sensing and feedback mechanisms. This adaptive behavior fundamentally determines their dynamics and self-organization in active matter systems, with implications for biological microswimmers and engineered microrobots. Here, we investigate active Brownian particles whose propulsion speed is governed by spatially varying activity landscapes, incorporating a temporal delay between environmental sensing and speed adaptation. Through analytical solutions derived for both short-time and long-time delay regimes, we demonstrate that steady-state density and polarization profiles exhibit maxima at characteristic delays. Significantly, we observe that the polarization profile undergoes sign reversal when the swimming distance during the delay time exceeds the characteristic diffusion length, providing a novel mechanism for controlling particle transport without external fields. Our theoretical predictions, validated through experimental observations and numerical simulations, establish time delay as a crucial control parameter for particle transport and organization in active matter systems. These findings provide insights into how biological microorganisms might use response delays to gain navigation advantages and suggest design principles for synthetic microswimmers with programmable responses to heterogeneous environments.</description>

      <title>Characterization of phospholipid-cholesterol bilayers as self-assembled amphiphile block polymers that contain headgroups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12726v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cholesterol is known to modulate the structure and function of biological membranes. In this study, we use self-consistent field theory (SCFT) to investigate phospholipid/cholesterol bilayer membranes modeled with two types of diblock copolymers. These copolymer-based bilayers serve as biomimetic platforms with applications in areas such as drug delivery. Our simulations identify a minimum free energy configuration characterized by phospholipid tails tilted relative to the membrane normal. The model quantitatively captures the well-known area condensation effect as cholesterol concentration increases, along with membrane thickening and reduced tilt angle. Thermodynamically, we observe a linear dependence between cholesterol's chemical potential and its concentration within the 37-50% range, consistent with experimental results. Additionally, we analyze the effects of block copolymer length and headgroup interactions on bilayer structure. Interactions between phospholipid headgroups and the solvent emerge as the most influential. This work provides a theoretical framework for understanding cholesterol's regulatory role in membrane structure and mechanics.</description>

Abstract: Recent results demonstrate how deviations from equilibrium fluctuation-dissipation theorem can be quantified for active field theories by deriving exact fluctuations dissipation relations that involve the entropy production [M. K. Johnsrud and R. Golestanian, arXiv:2409.14977]. Here we develop and employ diagrammatic tools to perform perturbative calculations for a paradigmatic active field theory, the Non-Reciprocal Cahn-Hilliard (NRCH) model. We obtain analytical results, which serve as an illustration of how to implement the recently developed framework to active field theories, and help to illuminate the specific non-equilibrium characteristics of the NRCH field theory.</description>

Abstract: We study the dynamics of overdamped Brownian particles interacting through soft pairwise potentials on a comb-like structure. Within the linearized Dean-Kawasaki framework, we characterize the particle density fluctuations by computing their one- and two-point correlation functions. For a tracer particle constrained to move along the comb backbone, we determine the spatial correlation profile between its position and the density of surrounding bath particles. Furthermore, we derive the correction to the diffusion coefficient of the tracer due to interactions with other particles, validating our results through numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>On the possibility of chiral symmetry breaking in liquid hydrogen peroxide</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03385v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Molecular chirality is a key concept in chemistry with implications for the origin of life and the manufacturing of pharmaceuticals. Previous simulations of a chiral molecular model with an energetic bias towards homochiral interactions show a spontaneous symmetry-breaking transition from a supercritical racemic liquid into a subcritical liquid enriched in one of the two enantiomers. Here, we employ molecular dynamics simulations in order to test the possible existence of this phenomenon in hydrogen peroxide, the smallest chiral molecule. For this purpose, we study the fluid phase of this substance between 100 K and 1500 K, and from $10^{-4}$ GPa to 1 GPa. We find a glass transition and we suggest that hydrogen bonds play a central role in such behavior. We also test the possibility of observing chiral symmetry breaking by performing both constant temperature and cooling simulations at multiple pressures, and we do not observe the phenomenon. An analysis of the structure of the liquid shows negligible differences between homochiral and heterochiral interactions, supporting the difficulty in observing chiral symmetry breaking. If hydrogen peroxide manifests spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking, it likely takes place significantly below room temperature and is hidden by other phenomena, such as the glass transition or crystallization. More broadly, our results, and recent experimental observations, suggest that greater molecular complexity is needed for spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in the liquid phase to occur.</description>
