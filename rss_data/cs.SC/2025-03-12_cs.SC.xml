      <title>On real and observable rational realizations of input-output equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.16799v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a single (differential-algebraic) input-output equation, we present a method for finding different representations of the associated system in the form of rational realizations; these are dynamical systems with rational right-hand sides. It has been shown that in the case where the input-output equation is of order one, rational realizations can be computed, if they exist. In this work, we focus first on the existence and actual computation of the so-called observable rational realizations, and secondly on rational realizations with real coefficients. The study of observable realizations allows to find every rational realization of a given first order input-output equation, and the necessary field extensions in this process. We show that for first order input-output equations the existence of a rational realization is equivalent to the existence of an observable rational realization. Moreover, we give a criterion to decide the existence of real rational realizations. The computation of observable and real realizations of first order input-output equations is fully algorithmic. We also present partial results for the case of higher order input-output equations.</description>

      <title>Simplest Mechanism Builder Algorithm (SiMBA): An Automated Microkinetic Model Discovery Tool</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21205v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Microkinetic models are key for evaluating industrial processes' efficiency and chemicals' environmental impact. Manual construction of these models is difficult and time-consuming, prompting a shift to automated methods. This study introduces SiMBA (Simplest Mechanism Builder Algorithm), a novel approach for generating microkinetic models from kinetic data. SiMBA operates through four phases: mechanism generation, mechanism translation, parameter estimation, and model comparison. Our approach systematically proposes reaction mechanisms, using matrix representations and a parallelized backtracking algorithm to manage complexity. These mechanisms are then translated into microkinetic models represented by ordinary differential equations, and optimized to fit available data. Models are compared using information criteria to balance accuracy and complexity, iterating until convergence to an optimal model is reached. Case studies on an aldol condensation reaction, and the dehydration of fructose demonstrate SiMBA's effectiveness in distilling complex kinetic behaviors into simple yet accurate models. While SiMBA predicts intermediates correctly for all case studies, it does not chemically identify intermediates, requiring expert input for complex systems. Despite this, SiMBA significantly enhances mechanistic exploration, offering a robust initial mechanism that accelerates the development and modeling of chemical processes.</description>
