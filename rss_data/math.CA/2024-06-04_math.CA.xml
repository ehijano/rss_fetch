      <title>Normed modules and The Stieltjes integrations of functions defined on finite-dimensional algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define integrals for functions on finite-dimensional algebras, adapting methods from Leinster's research. This paper discusses the relationships between the integrals of functions defined on subsets $\mathbb{I}_1 \subseteq {\mathit{\Lambda}}_1$ and $\mathbb{I}_2 \subseteq {\mathit{\Lambda}}_2$ of two finite-dimensional algebras, under the influence of a mapping $\omega$, which can be an injection or a bijection. We explore four specific cases:
  $\bullet$ $\omega$ as a monotone non-decreasing and right-continuous function;
  $\bullet$ $\omega$ as an injective, absolutely continuous function;
  $\bullet$ $\omega$ as a bijection;
  $\bullet$ and $\omega$ as the identity on $\mathbb{R}$.
  These scenarios correspond to the frameworks of Lebesgue-Stieltjes integration, Riemann-Stieltjes integration, substitution rules for Lebesgue integrals, and traditional Lebesgue or Riemann integration, respectively.</description>

      <title>Atypical bifurcation for periodic solutions of $\phi$-Laplacian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the $T$-periodic solutions of the parameter-dependent $\phi$-Laplacian equation \begin{equation*} (\phi(x'))'=F(\lambda,t,x,x'). \end{equation*} Based on the topological degree theory, we present some atypical bifurcation results in the sense of Prodi--Ambrosetti, i.e., bifurcation of $T$-periodic solutions from $\lambda=0$. Finally, we propose some applications to Li\'enard-type equations.</description>

      <title>Simple bounds for the extreme zeroes of Jacobi polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Some new bounds for the extreme zeroes of Jacobi polynomials are obtained with an elementary approach. A feature of these bounds is their simple forms, which make them easy to work with. Despite their simplicity, our lower bounds for the largest zeroes of Gegenbauer polynomials are compatible with some of the best hitherto known results.</description>

      <title>Spectral characterization of the constant sign derivatives of Green's function related to two point boundary value conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we will study the set of parameters in which certain partial derivatives of the Green's function, related to a $n$-order linear operator $T_{n}[M]$, depending on a real parameter $M$, coupled to different two-point boundary conditions, are of constant sign. We will do it without using the explicit expression of the Green's function. The constant sign interval will be characterized by the first eigenvalue related to suitable boundary conditions of the studied operator. As a consequence of the main result, we will be able to give sufficient conditions to ensure that the derivatives of Green's function cannot be nonpositive (nonnegative). These characterizations and the obtained results can be used to deduce the existence of solutions of nonlinear problems under additional conditions on the nonlinear part. To illustrate the obtained results, some examples are given.</description>

      <title>Periodic Waves for the Regularized Camassa-Holm Equation: Existence and Spectral Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the existence and spectral stability of periodic traveling wave solutions for the regularized Camassa-Holm equation. For the existence of periodic waves, we employ tools from bifurcation theory to construct waves with the zero mean property and prove that waves with the same property may not exist for the well known Camassa-Holm equation. Regarding the spectral stability, we analyze the difference between the number of negative eigenvalues of a convenient linear operator, restricted to the space constituted by zero-mean periodic functions, and the number of negative eigenvalues of the matrix formed by the tangent space associated with the low-order conserved quantities of the evolution model. We also discuss the problem of orbital stability in the energy space.</description>

      <title>Bilinear embedding for perturbed divergence-form operator with complex coefficients on irregular domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\Omega\subseteq\mathbb{R}^{d}$ be open, $A$ a complex uniformly strictly accretive $d\times d$ matrix-valued function on $\Omega$ with $L^{\infty}$ coefficients, $b$ and $c$ two $d$-dimensional vector-valued functions on $\Omega$ with $L^{\infty}$ coefficients and $V$ a locally integrable nonegative function on $\Omega$. Consider the operator ${\mathscr L}^{A,b,c,V}=-{\rm div}\,(A\nabla) + \left\langle \nabla , b \right\rangle - {\rm div}\,(c \, \cdot) + V $ with mixed boundary conditions on $\Omega$. We extend the bilinear inequality that Carbonaro and Dragi\v{c}evi\'c proved in the special cases when $b=c = 0$. As a consequence, we obtain that the solution to the parabolic problem $u^{\prime}(t)+{\mathscr L}^{A,b,c,V}u(t)=f(t)$, $u(0)=0$, has maximal regularity in $L^{p}(\Omega)$, for all $p&gt;1$ such that $A$ satisfies the $p$-ellipticity condition that Carbonaro and Dragi\v{c}evi\'c introduced in arXiv:1611.00653 and $b,c,V$ satisfy another condition that we introduce in this paper. Roughly speaking, $V$ has to be ``big'' with respect to $b$ and $c$. We do not impose any conditions on $\Omega$, in particular, we do not assume any regularity of $\partial\Omega$, nor the existence of a Sobolev embedding.</description>

      <title>Stability of phase diagram for a gradient ODE with memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem governed by the gradient ODE $x'=\nabla F(x)$ in $\R^d$ on which we assume that it has a finite number of hyperbolic equilibria whose stable and unstable manifolds intersect transversally. This problem is perturbed by the memory term $x'(t)=\nabla F(x(t))+\varepsilon\int_{-\infty}^t M(t-s)x(s)\, ds$ where $\varepsilon&gt;0$ is a small constant. The key result is that the structure of connections between the equlibria of the unperturbed problem is exactly preserved for a small $\varepsilon&gt;0$.</description>

      <title>Flag-like singular integrals and associated Hardy spaces on a kind of nilpotent Lie groups of step two</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Cauchy-Szeg\"o singular integral is a fundamental tool in the study of holomorphic $H^p$ Hardy space. But for a kind of Siegel domains, the Cauchy-Szeg\"o kernels are neither product ones nor flag ones on the Shilov boundaries, which have the structure of nilpotent Lie groups $\mathscr N $ of step two. We use the lifting method to investigate flag-like singular integrals on $\mathscr N $, which includes these Cauchy-Szeg\"o ones as a special case. The lifting group is the product $\tilde {\mathscr N }$ of three Heisenberg groups, and naturally geometric or analytical objects on $\mathscr N $ are the projection of those on $\tilde {\mathscr N } $. As in the flag case, we introduce various notions on $\mathscr N $ adapted to geometric feature of these kernels, such as tubes, nontangential regions, tube maximal functions, Littlewood-Paley functions, tents, shards and atoms etc. They have the feature of tri-parameters, although the second step of the group $\mathscr N$ is only $2$-dimensional, i.e. there exists a hidden parameter as in the flag case. We also establish the corresponding Calder\'on reproducing formula, characterization of $ L ^p (\mathscr N)$ by Littlewood-Paley functions, $ L ^p $-boundedness of tube maximal functions and flag-like singular integrals and atomic decomposition of $H^1$ Hardy space on $ {\mathscr N } $.</description>

      <title>General fractals represented by $\mathcal{F}$-limit sets of compression maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.08634</link>
      <description>arXiv:1707.08634v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we provide a simple and systematic way to represent general (inhomogeneous) fractals that may look different at different scales and places. By using set-valued compression maps, we express these general fractals as $\mathcal{F}$-limit sets, which are represented as sequences of points in a fixed parameterization space $M$. By choosing different types of sequences in $M$, we get various types of fractals: from self-simlilar to non self-similar, and from deterministic to random. The computational complexity of producing a general fractal is independent of the sequence in $M$, and as a result, is the same as that of an iterated function system obtained from a constant sequence. In the metric space setting, we also estimate the Hausdorff dimension of limit sets for collections of sets that do not necessarily satisfy the Moran structure conditions. In particular, we introduce the concept ``uniform covering condition" for the study of the lower bound of the Hausdorff dimension of the limit set, and provide sufficient conditions for this condition. Specific examples (Cantor-like sets, Sierpi\'nski-like Triangles, etc.) with the calculations of their corresponding Hausdorff dimensions are also studied.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.06053v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide new results regarding the localization of the solutions of nonlinear operator systems. We make use of a combination of Krasnosel'ski\u{\i} cone compression-expansion type methodologies and Schauder-type ones. In particular we establish a localization of the solution of the system within the product of a conical shell and of a closed convex set. By iterating this procedure we prove the existence of multiple solutions. We illustrate our theoretical results by applying them to the solvability of systems of Hammerstein integral equations. In the case of two specific boundary value problems and with given nonlinearities, we are also able to obtain a numerical solution, consistent with our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>There are no unconditional Schauder frames of translates in $L^p(\mathbb{R})$, $1 \le p \le 2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.01757v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is known that a system formed by translates of a single function cannot be an unconditional Schauder basis in the space $L^p(\mathbb{R})$ for any $1 \le p &lt; \infty$. To the contrary, there do exist unconditional Schauder frames of translates in $L^p(\mathbb{R})$ for every $p&gt;2$. The existence of such a system for $1 &lt; p \leq 2$, however, has remained an open problem. In this paper the problem is solved in the negative: we prove that none of the spaces $L^p(\mathbb{R})$, $1 \le p \le 2$, admits an unconditional Schauder frame of translates.</description>

      <title>A weak inequality in fractional homogeneous Sobolev spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14662v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the following inequality \begin{equation*} \|\big(\int_{\mathbb{R}^n}\frac{|f(\cdot+y)-f(\cdot)|^q}{|y|^{n+sq}}dy\big)^{\frac{1}{q}}\|_{L^{p,\infty}(\mathbb{R}^n)}\lesssim\|f\|_{\dot{L}^p_s(\mathbb{R}^n)}, \end{equation*} where $\|\cdot\|_{L^{p,\infty}(\mathbb{R}^n)}$ is the weak $L^p$ quasinorm and $\|\cdot\|_{\dot{L}^p_s(\mathbb{R}^n)}$ is the homogeneous Sobolev norm, and parameters satisfy the condition that $1&lt;p&lt;q$, $2\leq q&lt;\infty$, and $0&lt;s=n(\frac{1}{p}-\frac{1}{q})&lt;1$. Furthermore, we prove the estimate $\|\mathfrak{g}_{s,q}(f)\|_{L^p(\mathbb{R}^n)}\lesssim\|f\|_{\dot{F}^s_{p,q}(\mathbb{R}^n)}$ when $0&lt;p,q&lt;\infty$, $-1&lt;s&lt;1$, $\|\cdot\|_{\dot{F}^s_{p,q}(\mathbb{R}^n)}$ denotes the homogeneous Triebel-Lizorkin quasinorm and the Littlewood-Paley-Poisson function $\mathfrak{g}_{s,q}(f)(\cdot)$ is a generalization of the classical Littlewood-Paley $g$-function. Moreover, we prove the weak type $(p,p)$ boundedness of the $\mathcal{G}_{\lambda,q}$-function and the $\mathcal{R}_{s,q}$-function, where the $\mathcal{G}_{\lambda,q}$-function is a generalization of the well-known classical Littlewood-Paley $g_{\lambda}^*$-function. To the best of the author's knowledge, in the theorems of this paper, conditions are reduced to a minimum, and the applicability of the results has been expanded as much as possible.</description>

      <title>Zeros of generalized hypergeometric polynomials via finite free convolution. Applications to multiple orthogonality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11479v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the problem of the weak asymptotic behavior of zeros of families of generalized hypergeometric polynomials as their degree tends to infinity. The main tool is the representation of such polynomials as a finite free convolution of simpler elements; this representation is preserved in the asymptotic regime, so we can formally write the limit zero distribution of these polynomials as a free convolution of explicitly computable measures. We derive a simple expression for the S-transform of the limit distribution, which turns out to be a rational function, and a representation of the Kamp\'e de F\'eriet polynomials in terms of finite free convolutions. We apply these tools, as well as those from [arXiv:2309.10970], to the study of some well-known families of multiple orthogonal polynomials (Jacobi-Pi\~neiro and multiple Laguerre of the first and second kinds), obtaining results on their zeros, such as interlacing, monotonicity, and asymptotics.</description>

Abstract: We apply the direct method of the calculus of variations to show that any nonplanar Frenet curve in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ can be extended to an infinitely narrow flat ribbon having minimal bending energy. We also show that, in general, minimizers are not free of planar points, yet such points must be isolated under the mild condition that the torsion does not vanish.</description>

      <title>Zeros of random polynomials undergoing the heat flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.11685v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the evolution of the empirical distribution of the complex roots of high-degree random polynomials, when the polynomial undergoes the heat flow. In one prominent example of Weyl polynomials, the limiting zero distribution evolves from the circular law into the elliptic law until it collapses to the Wigner semicircle law, as was recently conjectured for characteristic polynomials of random matrices by Hall and Ho, 2022. Moreover, for a general family of random polynomials with independent coefficients and isotropic limiting distribution of zeros, we determine the zero distribution of the heat-evolved polynomials in terms of its logarithmic potential. Furthermore, we explicitly identify two critical time thresholds, at which singularities develop and at which the limiting distribution collapses to the semicircle law. We completely characterize the limiting root distribution of the heat-evolved polynomials before singularities develop as the push-forward of the initial distribution under a transport map. Finally, we discuss the results from the perspectives of partial differential equations (in particular Hamilton-Jacobi equation and Burgers' equation), optimal transport, and free probability. The theory is accompanied by explicit examples, simulations, and conjectures.</description>
