      <title>Topological Corner Modes by Composite Wannier States in Glide-Symmetric Photonic Crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Second-order topological insulators can be characterized by their bulk polarization, which is believed to be intrinsically connected to the center of the Wannier function. In this study, we demonstrate the existence of second-order topological insulators that feature a pair of partially degenerate photonic bands. These arise from the nonsymmorphic glide symmetry in an all-dielectric photonic crystal. The center of the maximally localized Wannier function (MLWF) is consistently located at the origin but is not equivalent with respect to the sum of constituent polarizations. As a result, topological corner modes can be identified by the distinctly hybridized MLWFs that truncate at the sample boundary. Through full-wave numerical simulations paired with microwave experiments, the second-order topology is clearly confirmed and characterized. These topological corner states exhibit notably unique modal symmetries, which are made possible by the inversion of the Wannier bands. Our results provide an alternative approach to explore higher-order topological physics with significant potential for applications in integrated and quantum photonics.</description>

      <title>Localized and extended phases in square moir\'e patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Random defects do not constitute the unique source of electron localization in two dimensions. Lattice quasidisorder generated from two inplane superimposed rotated, main and secondary, square lattices, namely monolayers where moir\'e patterns are formed, leads to a sharp localized to delocalized single-particle transition. This is demostrated here for both, discrete and continuum models of moir\'e patterns that arise as the twisting angle $\theta$ between main and secondary lattices is varied in the interval $[0, \pi/4]$. Localized to delocalized transition is recognized as the moir\'e patterns depart from being perfect square crystals to non-crystalline structures. Extended single-particle states were found for rotation angles associated with Pythagorean triples that produce perfectly periodic structures. Conversely, angles not arising from such Pythagorean triples lead to non-commensurate or quasidisordered structures, thus originating localized states. These conclusions are drawn from a stationary analysis where the standard IPR parameter measuring localization allowed us to detect the transition. While both, ground state and excited states were analyzed for the discrete model, where the secondary lattice was considered as a perturbation of the main one, the sharp transition was tracked back for the fundamental state in the continuous scenario where the secondary lattice is not a perturbation any more.</description>

      <title>Effects of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions and dipole-dipole interactions on spin waves in finite-length ferromagnetic chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A spin-wave theory that includes the antisymmetric Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya exchange interactions and long-range dipole-dipole interactions is presented for finite-length ferromagnetic spin chains. It is found that three different physical situations arise, depending on the direction chosen in this geometry for the axial vector of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions. In some cases this leads to a tilting of the equilibrium orientations near the ends of the chain due to interfacial effects and with consequential effects on the spectrum of discrete dipole-exchange spin waves. When variations are introduced for the dominant bilinear exchange interactions at the ends of the spin chain, it is shown that localized spin waves with spatial decay characteristics may occur.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium carrier dynamics and band structure of graphene on 2D tin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intercalation of epitaxial graphene on SiC(0001) with Sn results in a well-ordered 2D metallic Sn phase with a $(1\times1)$ structure at the interface between SiC substrate and quasi-freestanding graphene. The 2D\,Sn phase exhibits exotic electronic properties with Dirac-like and flat bands coexisting close to the Fermi level that exhibit both Zeeman- and Rashba-type spin splittings. Possible inter-layer interactions between the 2D\,Sn layer and graphene that may result in emerging electronic properties remain unexplored. We use time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to reveal a surprisingly short-lived non-equilibrium carrier distribution inside the Dirac cone of graphene. Further, we find that the graphene $\pi$-band exhibits a transient down-shift that we attribute to charging of the graphene layer with holes. We interpret our results with support from density functional theory calculations of the graphene - 2D\,Sn heterostructure that reveal a substantial hybridization between graphene $\pi$-band and Sn $p_z$-states that opens up a $\sim230$\,meV band gap inside the Dirac cone and delocalizes the charge carriers over both the graphene and 2D\,Sn layers. Our results have important implications for the design of future ultrafast optoelectronic devices that may find applications in the fields of light harvesting and detection, as supercapacitors, or in novel quantum computing technologies.</description>

      <title>Machine-learned tuning of artificial Kitaev chains from tunneling-spectroscopy measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate reliable machine-learned tuning of quantum-dot-based artificial Kitaev chains to Majorana sweet spots, using the covariance matrix adaptation algorithm. We show that a loss function based on local tunnelling-spectroscopy features of a chain with two additional sensor dots added at its ends provides a reliable metric to navigate parameter space and find points where crossed Andreev reflection and elastic cotunneling between neighbouring sites balance in such a way to yield near-zero-energy modes with very high Majorana quality. We simulate tuning of two- and three-site Kitaev chains, where the loss function is found from calculating the low-energy spectrum of a model Hamiltonian that includes Coulomb interactions and finite Zeeman splitting. In both cases, the algorithm consistently converges towards high-quality sweet spots. Since tunnelling spectroscopy provides one global metric for tuning all on-site potentials simultaneously, this presents a promising way towards tuning longer Kitaev chains, which are required for achieving topological protection of the Majorana modes.</description>

      <title>Nutation: separating the spin from its magnetic moment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For nearly 90 years, precession and relaxation processes have been thought to dominate magnetization dynamics. Only recently has it been considered that, on short time scales, an inertia-driven magnetization dynamics should become relevant, leading to additional nutation of the magnetization vector. Here, we trigger magnetic nutation via a sudden excitation of a thin Ni80Fe20 (Permalloy) film with an ultrashort optical pulse, that leads to an abrupt tilting of the effective field acting on the magnetic moments, separating the dynamics of the magnetization from that of its angular momentum. We investigate the resulting magnetization dynamics in the inertial regime experimentally by the time-resolved magneto optical Kerr effect. We find a characteristic oscillation in the Kerr signal in the range of about 0.1 THz superimposed on the precessional oscillations with GHz frequencies. By comparison with atomistic spin dynamics simulations, we demonstrate that this observation cannot be explained by the well-known Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation of motion but can be attributed to inertial contributions leading to nutation of the magnetization vector around its angular momentum. Hence, an optical and non-resonant excitation of inertial magnetization dynamics can trigger and control different magnetic processes, ranging from demagnetization via nutation to precession in a single device. These findings will have profound implications for the understanding of ultrafast spin dynamics and magnetization switching.</description>

      <title>High harmonic generation from electrons moving on topological spin textures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High harmonic generation (HHG) is a striking phenomenon, which reflects the ultrafast dynamics of electrons. Recently, it has been demonstrated that HHG can be used to reconstruct not only the energy band structure but also the geometric structure characterized by the Berry curvature. Here, we numerically investigate HHG arising from electrons coupled with a topological spin texture in a spin scalar chiral state where time reversal symmetry is broken. In this system, a sign change in scalar chirality alters the sign of the Berry curvature while keeping the energy band structure unchanged, allowing us to discuss purely geometrical effects on HHG. Notably, we found that, when the optical frequency is significantly lower than the energy gap, the sign of scalar chirality largely affects the longitudinal response parallel to the optical field rather than the transverse response. Our analysis suggests that this can be attributed to interband currents induced by the recombination of electron-hole pairs whose real-space trajectories are modulated by the anomalous velocity term.</description>

      <title>Microscopic origin of twist-dependent electron transfer rate in bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using molecular simulation and continuum dielectric theory, we consider how electrochemical kinetics are modulated as a function of twist angle in bilayer graphene electrodes. By establishing an effective connection between twist angle and the screening length of charge carriers within the electrode, we investigate how tunable metallicity can result in modified statistics of the electron transfer energy gap. Constant potential molecular simulations show that the activation free energy for electron transfer is an increasing function of the screening length, or decreasing function the density of states at the Fermi energy in the electrode, and subsequently a non-monotonic function of twist angle. We find the twist angle alters the density of states, which tunes the number of thermally-accessible channels for electron transfer, as well as the reorganization energy by altering the stability of the vertically excited state through attenuated image charge interactions. Understanding these effects allows us to cast the Marcus rate of interfacial electron transfer as a function of twist angle, in a manner consistent with a growing body of experimental observations.</description>

      <title>Implementing a synthetic magnetic vector potential in a 2D superconducting qubit array</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconducting quantum processors are a compelling platform for analog quantum simulation due to the precision control, fast operation, and site-resolved readout inherent to the hardware. Arrays of coupled superconducting qubits natively emulate the dynamics of interacting particles according to the Bose-Hubbard model. However, many interesting condensed-matter phenomena emerge only in the presence of electromagnetic fields. Here, we emulate the dynamics of charged particles in an electromagnetic field using a superconducting quantum simulator. We realize a broadly adjustable synthetic magnetic vector potential by applying continuous modulation tones to all qubits. We verify that the synthetic vector potential obeys requisite properties of electromagnetism: a spatially-varying vector potential breaks time-reversal symmetry and generates a gauge-invariant synthetic magnetic field, and a temporally-varying vector potential produces a synthetic electric field. We demonstrate that the Hall effect--the transverse deflection of a charged particle propagating in an electromagnetic field--exists in the presence of the synthetic electromagnetic field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum dynamics of a dense and dipole-dipole coupled ensemble of two-level emitters interacting via their environmental thermostat is investigated. The static dipole-dipole interaction strengths are being considered strong enough but smaller than the transition frequency. Therefore, the established thermal equilibrium of ensemble's quantum dynamics is described with respect to the dipole-dipole coupling strengths. We have demonstrated the quantum nature of the spontaneously scattered light field in this process for weaker thermal baths as well as non-negligible dipole-dipole couplings compared to the emitter's transition frequency. Furthermore, the collectively emitted photon intensity suppresses or enhances depending on the environmental thermal baths intensities.</description>

      <title>On Nanowire Morphological Instability and Pinch-Off by Surface Electromigration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surface diffusion and surface electromigration may lead to a morphological instability of thin solid films and nanowires. In this paper two nonlinear analyzes of a morphological instability are developed for a single-crystal cylindrical nanowire that is subjected to the axial current. These treatments extend the conventional linear stability analyzes without surface electromigration, that manifest a Rayleigh-Plateau instability. A weakly nonlinear analysis is done slightly above the Rayleigh-Plateau (longwave) instability threshold. It results in a one-dimensional Sivashinsky amplitude equation that describes a blow-up of a surface perturbation amplitude in a finite time. This is a signature of a formation of an axisymmetric spike singularity of a cylinder radius, which leads to a wire pinch-off and separation into a disjoint segments. The scaling analysis of the amplitude spike singularity is performed, and the time-and-electric field-dependent dimensions of the spike are characterized. A weakly nonlinear multi-scale analysis is done at the arbitrary distance above a longwave or a shortwave instability threshold. The time-and-electric field-dependent Fourier amplitudes of the major instability modes are derived and characterized.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the classical dynamics of a system of a pair of Kerr-Duffing nonlinear oscillators coupled by a nonlinear interaction and subject to a parametric drive. Within a rotating wave approximation (RWA), we analyze the steady-state solutions for the oscillation amplitude of the two oscillators. In the most relevant case of identical oscillators, we separately investigate configurations in which only one oscillator is parametrically driven, or both of them are simultaneously driven. In the latter regime, special attention is paid to the symmetric case where the parametric drives acting on the two oscillators are equal: for an increasing value of the detuning of the parametric drive, a transition to a multi-stable, symmetry-breaking regime is found, where the two oscillators display different oscillation amplitudes and phases.</description>

      <title>Universality and the thermoelectric transport properties of a double quantum dot system: Seeking for conditions that improve the thermoelectric efficiency</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.09099v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Employing universal relations for the Onsager coefficients in the linear regime at the symmetric point of the single impurity Anderson model, we calculate the conditions under which the quantum scattering phase shift should satisfy to produce the asymptotic Carnot's limit for the thermoelectric efficiency. We show that a single quantum dot connected by metallic leads at the Kondo regime cannot achieve the conditions that cause the best thermoelectric efficiency. We study a system of serial double quantum dots without inter-dot correlations. We show that maintaining one dot in the electron-hole symmetric point makes it possible to obtain conditions for the quantum phase shift linked to charge fluctuations in the other quantum dot that satisfy the conditions associated with enhancing the thermoelectric efficiency. We also discuss the presence of bound states in the continuum (BICs) and quasi-BICs associated with the quantum scattering interference process that improves thermoelectric efficiency. We identify two types of quasi-BICs that occur at low and high temperatures: The first is associated with single Fano resonances, and the last is with several Fano processes. We also discussed possible temperature values and conditions that could be linked with the experimental realization of our results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.13442v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fast measurements of quantum devices is important in areas such as quantum sensing, quantum computing and nanodevice quality analysis. Here, we develop a superconductor-semiconductor multi-module microwave assembly to demonstrate charge state readout at the state-of-the-art. The assembly consist of a superconducting readout resonator interfaced to a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) chiplet containing quantum dots (QDs) in a high-$\kappa$ nanowire transistor. The superconducting chiplet contains resonant and coupling elements as well as $LC$ filters that, when interfaced with the silicon chip, result in a resonant frequency $f=2.12$ GHz, a loaded quality factor $Q=850$, and a resonator impedance $Z=470$ $\Omega$. Combined with the large gate lever arms of SOI technology, we achieve a minimum integration time for single and double QD transitions of 2.77 ns and 13.5 ns, respectively. We utilize the assembly to measure charge noise over 9 decades of frequency up to 500 kHz and find a 1/$f$ dependence across the whole frequency spectrum as well as a charge noise level of 4 $\mu$eV/$\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ at 1 Hz. The modular microwave circuitry presented here can be directly utilized in conjunction with other quantum device to improve the readout performance as well as enable large bandwidth noise spectroscopy, all without the complexity of superconductor-semiconductor monolithic fabrication.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Andreev Spectrum and Transport in Non-Hermitian Josephson Junctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.04789v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a phase-biased non-Hermitian Josephson junction (NHJJ) composed of two superconductors mediated by a short non-Hermitian link. Such a NHJJ is described by an effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian derived based on the Lindblad formalism in the weak coupling regime. By solving the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equation, we find that its Andreev spectrum as a function of phase difference exhibits Josephson gaps, i.e. finite phase windows with no Andreev (quasi-)bound states. The complex Andreev spectrum and the presence of Josephson gaps constitute particular spectral features of the NHJJ. Moreover, we propose complex supercurrents arising from inelastic Cooper pair tunneling to characterize the anomalous transport in the NHJJ. Additional numerical simulations complement our analytical predictions. We demonstrate that the Josephson effect is strongly affected by non-Hermitian physics.</description>

Abstract: Nontrivial bulk topological invariants of quantum materials can leave their signatures on charge, thermal and spin transports. In two dimensions, their imprints can be experimentally measured from well-developed multiterminal Hall bar arrangements. Here, we numerically compute the low temperature ($T$) thermal ($\kappa_{xy}$) and zero temperature spin ($\sigma^{sp}_{xy}$) Hall conductivities, and longitudinal thermal conductance ($G^{th}_{xx}$) of various prominent two-dimensional fully gapped topological superconductors, belonging to distinct Altland-Zirnbauer symmetry classes, namely $p+ip$ (class D), $d+id$ (class C) and $p \pm ip$ (class DIII) paired states, in mesoscopic six-terminal Hall bar setups from the scattering matrix formalism using Kwant. In both clean and weak disorder limits, the time-reversal symmetry breaking $p+ip$ and $d+id$ pairings show half-quantized and quantized $\kappa_{xy}$ [in units of $\kappa_0=\pi^2 k^2_B T/(3h)$], respectively, while the latter one in addition accommodates a quantized $\sigma^{sp}_{xy}$ [in units of $\sigma^{sp}_0=\hbar/(8 \pi)$]. By contrast, the time-reversal invariant $p \pm ip$ pairing only displays a quantized $G^{th}_{xx}$ at low $T$ up to a moderate strength of disorder. In the strong disorder regime, all these topological responses ($\kappa_{xy}$, $\sigma^{sp}_{xy}$, and $G^{th}_{xx}$) vanish. Possible material platforms hosting such paired states and manifesting these robust topological thermal and spin responses are discussed.</description>

      <title>Long-lived Topological Flatband Excitons in Semiconductor Moir\'e Heterostructures: a Bosonic Kane-Mele Model Platform</title>

Abstract: Moir\'e superlattices based on two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have emerged as a highly versatile and fruitful platform for exploring correlated topological electronic phases. One of the most remarkable examples is the recently discovered fractional quantum anomalous Hall effect (FQAHE) under zero magnetic field. Here we propose a minimal structure that hosts long-lived excitons -- a ubiquitous bosonic excitation in TMD semiconductors -- with narrow topological bosonic bands. The nontrivial exciton topology originates from hybridization of moir\'e interlayer excitons, and is tunable by controlling twist angle and electric field. At small twist angle, the lowest exciton bands are isolated from higher energy bands, and provides a solid-state realization of bosonic Kane-Mele model with topological flatbands, which could potentially support the bosonic version of FQAHE.</description>

      <title>Unconventional quantum oscillations and evidence of non-trivial electronic states in quasi-two-dimensional electron system at complex oxide interfaces</title>

Abstract: The simultaneous occurrence of electric-field controlled superconductivity and spin-orbit interaction makes two-dimensional electron systems (2DES) constructed from perovskite transition metal oxides promising candidates for the next generation of spintronics and quantum computing. It is, however, essential to understand the electronic bands thoroughly and verify the predicted electronic states experimentally in these 2DES to advance technological applications. Here, we present novel insights into the electronic states of the 2DES at oxide interfaces through comprehensive investigations of Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations in two different systems: EuO/KTaO$_3$ (EuO/KTO) and LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ (LAO/STO). To accurately resolve these oscillations, we conducted transport measurements in high magnetic fields up to 60 T and low temperatures down to 100 mK. For 2D confined electrons at both interfaces, we observed a progressive increase of oscillations frequency and cyclotron mass with the magnetic field. We interpret these intriguing findings by considering the existence of non-trivial electronic bands, for which the $E-k$ dispersion incorporates both linear and parabolic dispersion relations. In addition to providing experimental evidence for topological-like electronic states in KTO-2DES and STO-2DES, the unconventional oscillations presented in this study establish a new paradigm for quantum oscillations in 2DES based on perovskite transition metal oxides, where the oscillations frequency exhibits quadratic dependence on the magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Single-photon induced instabilities in a cavity electromechanical device</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.06765v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cavity-electromechanical systems are extensively used for sensing and controlling the vibrations of mechanical resonators down to their quantum limit. The nonlinear radiation-pressure interaction in these systems could result in an unstable response of the mechanical resonator showing features such as frequency-combs, period-doubling bifurcations and chaos. However, due to weak light-matter interaction, typically these effects appear at very high driving strengths. By using polariton modes formed by a strongly coupled flux-tunable transmon and a microwave cavity, here we demonstrate an electromechanical device and achieve a single-photon coupling rate $g_0/2\pi$ of $160~$kHz, which is nearly 4\% of the mechanical frequency $\omega_m$. Due to large $g_0/\omega_m$ ratio, the device shows an unstable mechanical response resulting in frequency combs in sub-single photon limit. We systematically investigate the boundary of the unstable response and identify two important regimes governed by the optomechanical backaction and the nonlinearity of the electromagnetic mode. Such an improvement in the single-photon coupling rate and the observations of microwave frequency combs at single-photon levels may have applications in the quantum control of the motional states and critical parametric sensing. Our experiments strongly suggest the requirement of newer approaches to understand instabilities.</description>

      <title>Electronic structure in a rare-earth based nodal-line semimetal candidate PrSbTe</title>

Abstract: Nodal line semimetals feature topologically protected band crossings between the bulk valence and conduction bands that extend along a finite dimension in the form of a line or a loop. While ZrSiS and similar materials have attracted extensive research as hosts for the nodal line semimetallic phase, an alternative avenue has emerged in the form of isostructural rare-earth (RE) based RESbTe materials. Such systems possess intriguing potentialities for harboring elements of magnetic ordering and electronic correlations owing to the presence of 4f electrons intrinsic to the RE elements. In this study, we have carried out angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and thermodynamic measurements in conjunction with first principles computations on PrSbTe to elucidate its electronic structure and topological characteristics. Magnetic and thermal characterizations indicate the presence of well-localized 4f states with the absence of any discernible phase transition down to 2 K. The ARPES results reveal the presence of gapless Dirac crossings that correspond to a nodal-line along the XR direction in the three-dimensional Brillouin zone. Furthermore, Dirac crossing that makes up nodal line, which forms a diamond-shaped nodal plane centered at the center of the Brillouin zone is also identified within the experimental resolution. This study on the electronic structure of PrSbTe contributes to the understanding of the pivotal role played by spin-orbit coupling in the context of the RESbTe family of materials</description>

Abstract: We study Anderson localization in disordered tight-binding models on hyperbolic lattices. Such lattices are geometries intermediate between ordinary two-dimensional crystalline lattices, which localize at infinitesimal disorder, and Bethe lattices, which localize at strong disorder. Using state-of-the-art computational group theory methods to create large systems, we approximate the thermodynamic limit through appropriate periodic boundary conditions and numerically demonstrate the existence of an Anderson localization transition on the $\{8,3\}$ and $\{8,8\}$ lattices. We find unusually large critical disorder strengths, determine critical exponents, and observe a strong finite-size effect in the level statistics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03028v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate disordered-driven transitions between trivial and topological insulator (TI) phases in two-dimensional (2D) systems. Our study primarily focuses on the BHZ model with Anderson disorder, while other standard 2DTI models exhibit equivalent features. The analysis is based on the local Chern marker (LCM), a local quantity that allows for the characterization of topological transitions in finite and disordered systems. Our simulations indicate that disorder-driven trivial to topological insulator transitions are nicely characterized by $\mathcal{C}_0$, the disorder averaged LCM near the central cell of the system. We show that $\mathcal{C}_0$ is characterized by a single-parameter scaling, namely, $\mathcal{C}_0(M, W, L) \equiv \mathcal{C}_0(z)$ with $z = [W^\mu-W_c^\mu(M)]L$, where $M$ is the Dirac mass, $W$ is the disorder strength and $L$ is the system size, while $W_c(M) \propto \sqrt{M}$ and $\mu \approx 2$ stand for the critical disorder strength and critical exponent, respectively. Our numerical results are in agreement with a theoretical prediction based on a first-order Born approximation (1BA) analysis. These observations lead us to speculate that the universal scaling function we have found is rather general for amorphous and disorder-driven topological phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Higher Hall conductivity from a single wave function: Obstructions to symmetry-preserving gapped edge of (2+1)D topological order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10814v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A (2+1)D topological ordered phase with U(1) symmetry may or may not have a symmetric gapped edge state, even if both thermal and electric Hall conductivity are vanishing. It is recently discovered that there are "higher" versions of Hall conductivity valid for fermionic fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states, which obstructs symmetry-preserving gapped edge state beyond thermal and electric Hall conductivity. In this paper, we show that one can extract higher Hall conductivity from a single wave function of an FQH state, by evaluating the expectation value of the "partial rotation" unitary which is a combination of partial spatial rotation and a U(1) phase rotation. This result is verified numerically with the fermionic Laughlin state with $\nu=1/3$, $1/5$, as well as the non-Abelian Moore-Read state. Together with topological entanglement entropy, we prove that the expectation values of the partial rotation completely determines if a bosonic/fermionic Abelian topological order with U(1) symmetry has a symmetry-preserving gappable edge state or not. We also show that thermal and electric Hall conductivity of Abelian topological order can be extracted by partial rotations. Even in non-Abelian FQH states, partial rotation provides the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis type theorem constraining the low-energy spectrum of the bulk-boundary system. The generalization of higher Hall conductivity to the case with Lie group symmetry is also presented.</description>

      <title>Room temperature realization of artificial chiral magnets with reprogrammable magnon nonreciprocity at zero field</title>

Abstract: Chiral magnets are materials which possess unique helical arrangements of magnetic moments, which give rise to nonreciprocal transport and fascinating physics phenomena. On the one hand, their exploration is guided by the prospects of unconventional signal processing, computation schemes and magnetic memory. On the other hand, progress in applications is hindered by the challenging materials synthesis, limited scalability and typically low critical temperature. Here, we report the creation and exploration of artificial chiral magnets (ACMs) at room temperature. By employing a mass production compatible deposition technology, we synthesize ACMs, which consist of helical Ni surfaces on central cylinders. Using optical microscopy, we reveal nonreciprocal magnon transport at GHz frequencies. It is controlled by programmable toroidal moments which result from the ACM's geometrical handedness and field-dependent spin chirality. We present materials-by-design rules which optimize the helically curved ferromagnets for 3D nonreciprocal transport at room temperature and zero magnetic field.</description>
