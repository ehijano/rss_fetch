      <title>Enhancing non-destructive mass identification via Fourier-transform fluorescence analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-ion mass identification is important for atomic and nuclear physics experiments on ions produced with low yields. Cooling the ion to ultra-low temperatures by interacting with a laser-cooled ion will enhance the precision of the measurements. In this paper we present axial-common-mode frequency measurements of balanced and unbalanced Coulomb crystals from the Fourier transform of the fluorescence photons from a Doppler-cooling transition in calcium ions, after probing the ion/crystal with a 5-radiofrequency comb. A single ion non-destructively detected can be used for identification yielding a mass resolving power $m/\Delta m_\mathrm{FWHM}\approx 310$ from the axial common mode. This identification can be performed from a single measurement within times below one second.</description>

      <title>Vacuum polarization corrections to hyperfine structure in many-electron atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a theoretical study of vacuum polarization corrections to the hyperfine structure in many-electron atoms. Calculations are performed for systems of interest for precision atomic tests of fundamental physics belonging to the alkali-metal atoms and singly-ionized alkaline earths. The vacuum polarization is considered in the Uehling approximation, and we study the many-body effects core relaxation, core polarization, and valence-core correlations in the relativistic framework. We find that for s states, the relative vacuum polarization correction may be well-approximated by that for hydrogen-like ions, though for all other states account of many-body effects -- in particular, the polarization of the core -- is needed to obtain the correct sign and magnitude of the effect.</description>

      <title>Conveyor-belt magneto-optical trapping of molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laser cooling is used to produce ultracold atoms and molecules for quantum science and precision measurement applications. Molecules are more challenging to cool than atoms due to their vibrational and rotational internal degrees of freedom. Molecular rotations lead to the use of type-II transitions ($F \geq F'$) for magneto-optical trapping (MOT). When typical red detuned light frequencies are applied to these transitions, sub-Doppler heating is induced, resulting in higher temperatures and larger molecular cloud sizes than realized with the type-I MOTs most often used with atoms. To improve type-II MOTs, Jarvis et al. PRL 120, 083201 (2018) proposed a blue-detuned MOT to be applied after initial cooling and capture with a red-detuned MOT. This was successfully implemented (Burau et al. PRL 130, 193401 (2023), Jorapur et al. PRL 132, 163403 (2024), Li et al. PRL 132, 233402 (2024)), realizing colder and denser molecular samples. Very recently, Hallas et al. arXiv:2404.03636 (2024) demonstrated a blue-detuned MOT with a "1+2" configuration that resulted in even stronger compression of the molecular cloud. Here, we describe and characterize theoretically the conveyor-belt mechanism that underlies this observed enhanced compression. We perform numerical simulations of the conveyor-belt mechanism using both stochastic Schr\"odinger equation (SSE) and optical Bloch equation (OBE) approaches. We investigate the conveyor-belt MOT characteristics in relation to laser parameters, g-factors, and the structure of the molecular system.</description>

      <title>Observation of spin squeezing with contact interactions in one- and three-dimensional easy-plane magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entanglement in a many-particle system can enable measurement sensitivities beyond that achievable by only classical correlations. For an ensemble of spins, all-to-all interactions are known to reshape the quantum projection noise, leading to a form of entanglement known as spin squeezing. Here, we demonstrate spin squeezing with strictly short-range contact interactions. In particular, working with ultracold lithium atoms in optical lattices, we utilize superexchange interactions to realize a nearest-neighbor anisotropic Heisenberg model. We investigate the resulting quench dynamics from an initial product state in both one and three dimensions. In 1D, we observe $1.9^{+0.7}_{-0.5}$ dB of spin squeezing in quantitative agreement with theory. However, in 3D, we observe a maximum of $2.0^{+0.7}_{-0.7}$ dB of squeezing, over an order of magnitude smaller than that expected. We demonstrate that this discrepancy arises from the presence of a finite density of holes; both the motion of the holes as well as direct coupling between spin and density qualitatively alter the spin dynamics. Our observations point to the importance of understanding the complex interplay between motional and spin degrees of freedom in quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Interionic distance distributions between $Er^{3+}$ and $Yb^{3+}$ as dopants in some crystal matrix hosts used for upconversion luminescence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The upconversion process for the $Er^{3+}$ ion, when irradiated with IR photons at 980 nm, strongly depends upon the presence of the sensitizer $Yb^{3+}$ ions. There is a good correlation between the relative and absolute concentrations of the activator and sensitizer species and the intensities of the emission lines of the resulted visible spectrum. The ratios between emission intensities in the green band (510-580 nm) and red band (640-700 nm) (i.e., the spectral content) show similarities between different host crystals in which $Er^{3+}$ and $Yb^{3+}$ are embedded, which is an indication that, regardless of the crystalline medium of embedding, the dopant ions interact in some specific and similar ways. In order to reveal the mechanisms for the energy transfer between activator and sensitizer ions, one needs a model for the spatial distribution of these relative to one another, from which some statistical data, like crystal matrix average surrounding radii, could be inferred. Some models of cubic neighboring are presented for the relative concentration ratios of $Er^{3+}:Yb^{3+}$, respectively of 1:2, 1:4, and 1:8.</description>

      <title>Performance of a radio-frequency two-photon atomic magnetometer in different magnetic induction measurement geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measurements monitoring the inductive coupling between oscillating radio-frequency magnetic fields and objects of interest create versatile platforms for non-destructive testing. The benefits of ultra low frequency measurements, i.e., below 3~kHz, are sometimes outweighed by the fundamental and technical difficulties related to operating pick-up coils or other field sensors in this frequency range. Inductive measurements with the detection based on a two-photon interaction in rf atomic magnetometers address some of these issues, as the sensor gains an uplift in its operational frequency. The developments reported here integrate the fundamental and applied aspects of the two-photon process in magnetic induction measurements. In this paper, all spectral components of the two-photon process are identified, which result from the non-linear interactions between the rf fields and atoms. A method for the retrieval of the two-photon phase information, which is critical for inductive measurements, is also demonstrated. Furthermore, a self-compensation configuration is introduced, whereby high contrast measurements of defects can be obtained due to the sensor's insensitivity to the primary field, including using simplified instrumentation for this configuration by producing two rf fields with a single rf coil.</description>

      <title>Fast multicomponent cat-state generation under resonant or strong-dressing Rydberg-Kerr interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11432v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cat states are maximally entangled states with applications in metrology and fault-tolerant quantum computation. The experiments have revealed that Rydberg collective avalanche decoherence acts as the bottleneck for cat creation with Rydberg atoms. This process initiates after the black body radiation (BBR-)induced decay of Rydberg atoms and sets a strong limit on the cat creation time. These findings necessitate the exploration of new ideas to accelerate current Rydberg cat schemes. To enhance the interaction-to-loss ratio, this paper delves into cat state formation in the strong Rydberg dressing regime, uncovering the emergence of cat states despite the presence of complex orders of nonlinearities. This unexplored regime demonstrates the potential for rapid cat state formation, particularly beneficial for operation in typical 2D lattices in Rydberg Labs. In an extreme case, this article demonstrates that second-order nonlinearity could be isolated under resonant Rydberg driving if a large number of atoms are accommodated inside the blockade volume. The resonant model significantly enhances the interaction-to-loss ratio while circumventing the adiabaticity condition, allowing fast switching of lasers. In addition, the paper presents a method for generating multi-component cat states, which are superpositions of $m$ coherent spin states ($|m-\text{CSS}\rangle$). The maximum value of $m$ is determined by the number of atoms within the blockade radius, where $m=\sqrt{N}$. The states with larger $m$ are more robust against the presence of multiple orders of nonlinearity in the strong dressing Hamiltonian and are accessible in a much shorter time compared to traditional 2-component cat states.</description>

      <title>Laser Site-Selective Spectroscopy and Magnetic Hyperfine Splittings of Ho$^{3+}$ doped Y$_{2}$SiO$_{5}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15625v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Laser site-selective spectroscopy and high-resolution absorption measurements have been used to determine 51 crystal-field energy levels for one of the Ho$^{3+}$ centres in Y$_{2}$SiO$_{5}$. This centre is denoted as Site 2 and has been tentatively assigned as the seven-fold coordinated centre. High resolution absorption measurements reveal complex hyperfine patterns that obey and approximate selection rule. The application of a magnetic field along the three optical axes reveals the presence of avoided crossings below 0.5 Tesla, in both the ground and excited states.</description>
