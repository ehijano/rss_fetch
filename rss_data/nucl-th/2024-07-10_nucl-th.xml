      <title>Viscous damping of r-modes and emission of gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Rossby mode (r-mode) perturbation in pulsars as a steady gravitational wave (GW) source has been explored. The effect of a rigid crust on viscous damping and dissipation rate in the boundary layer between fluid core and crust has been studied. The time evolution and intensity of the emitted GWs in terms of the strain tensor amplitude have been estimated with the approximation of slow rotation using equation of state derived from the APR and Skyrme effective interactions with Brussels-Montreal parameter sets. The core of the neutron star has been considered to be $\beta$-equilibrated nuclear matter containing neutrons, protons, electrons and muons, surrounded by a solid crust. Calculations have been made for critical frequencies, their time evolution and rate of change of frequencies across a broad spectrum of pulsar masses.</description>

      <title>Angular anisotropy in prefission neutron spectra and PFNS of 240Pu(n,F)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Angular anisotropy of secondary neutrons was evidenced in neutron emission spectra (NES) of 239Pu+n in 1972, and prompt fission neutron spectra (PFNS) of 239Pu(n,F) in 2019, it might be predicted for 240Pu(n,F) PFNS now. In case of NES angular anisotropy is due to direct excitation of collective levels and pre-equilibrium/semi-direct (states in the continuum are excited) mechanism of neutron emission of first neutron in (n,nX) reaction, while in case of PFNS it is due to exclusive spectra of pre-fission neutrons of (n, xnf) reactions. In 239Pu(n,xnf) and 240Pu(n,xnf) reactions observed PFNS envision different response to the emission of first pre-fission neutron in forward or backward semi-spheres with respect to the momentum of incident neutrons. Since energies of (n,nf) neutrons and their average values depend on angle of emission theta with respect to the incident neutron momentum, the observed PFNS, average prompt fission neutron multiplicity, fission cross section, average total kinetic energy TKE, etc. also would be quite dependent on angle theta. Exclusive spectra of (n, xnf) neutrons at theta of 90 degrees are consistent with 240Pu(n, F)(239Pu(n,F), 239Pu(n,2n)) observed cross sections and neutron emission spectra of 239Pu+n interaction at En up to 20 MeV. The correlations of the angular anisotropy of PFNS with the relative contribution of the (n,nf) fission chance to the observed fission cross section and angular anisotropy of pre-fission neutron emission are ascertained.</description>

      <title>Electron scattering cross sections for 6,7Li and 7Be nuclei within the unified electroweak theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present study employs the multipole expansion within the unified electroweak theory to investigate the electron scattering cross sections for 6,7Li and 7Be nuclei. The multipole form factors presented in the expressions of the cross sections are directly calculated based on the many-particle shell model and fractional parentage coefficients without using any approximations. The results obtained indicate that the conventional impulse approximation can be applied to the electron-nucleus scattering only when the energy of incident electrons does not exceed twice the nucleon mass. In addition, the quasi-elastic scattering cross section of 7Li in the excitation from its ground state to the nearest excited state and that of elastic scattering in the ground state are independently treated, whereas they have not been separately measured in experiments. The calculated scattering cross sections using the V-A structure agree reasonably well with the available experimental data at low (MeV) energies and provide predictive information at high (GeV) energies. The scattering cross sections are found to rapidly decrease in all cases with increasing the incident electron energy and scattering angle. In particular, at the energies of hundreds of GeV and higher, there are only the forward scattering processes. Furthermore, by comparing the elastic cross sections of three investigated nuclei at a certain energy and scattering angle, the rule that the nuclear size is proportional to the number of nucleons is clearly shown.</description>

      <title>Investigation of sources affecting longitudinal particle distribution in heavy-ion collisions using spectators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the sources controlling the longitudinal distribution of produced particles in heavy-ion collisions is crucial to characterize the shape of the Quark-Gluon Plasma. This study proposes a novel correlator between the forward-backward asymmetry of spectator numbers and final-state multiplicities to quantify the contribution from preferential emission to the longitudinal distribution of produced particles. Using the AMPT model, we demonstrate that the correlator peaks at large $\eta$, indicating an increased contribution of preferential emission to particle production towards forward pseudorapidities. Thus, this correlator provides a direct constraint on the initial state sources governing rapidity-odd directed flow and flow decorrelation. The correlator exhibits sensitivity to string fragmentation parameters and spectator matter dynamics such as fragmentation and evaporation. Our findings motivate an experimental measurement of this correlator to constrain initial-state sources determining the longitudinal evolution of the Quark-Gluon Plasma, including complex dynamics of spectators in heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Quantum Monte Carlo calculations of electron scattering from $^{12}\text{C}$ in the Short-Time Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Short-Time approximation is a method introduced to evaluate electroweak nuclear response for systems with $A\geq12$, extending the reach of first-principle many-body Quantum Monte Carlo calculations. Using realistic two- and three-body nuclear interactions and consistent one- and two-body electromagnetic currents, we calculate longitudinal and transverse response densities and response functions of $^{12}\text{C}$. We compare the resulting cross sections with experimental data for electron-nucleus scattering, finding good agreement.</description>

      <title>Enhanced $\psi^{\prime}$ yield and $\psi^{\prime}/(J/\psi)$ yield ratio as a possible signature of QGP formation in high multiplicity $p+p$ collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Suppression in the yield of quarkonia (heavy quark-antiquark bound states) has been considered one of the important signatures of the formation of the thermalized deconfined partonic matter, also known as the Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP), in Relativistic Heavy Ion Collision Experiments (RHICE). Traditionally, the in-medium dissociation of quarkonium states has been presented by implicitly assuming an adiabatic approximation, which considers that the heavy quark Hamiltonian changes slowly over time owing to change in the medium. However, in high multiplicity smaller systems, such as in $p+p$ collisions, the early development of transverse flow resulting from the finite transverse size of the locally thermalized medium may cause the quarkonium states to undergo a non-adiabatic evolution. It has been argued that in the presence of such a non-adiabatic evolution, the suppression of heavy quark-antiquark bound state yields may not reliably indicate QGP formation~\cite{Bagchi:2023vfv}. We propose that, rather than concentrating on the suppression of $J/\psi$ yields, the enhancement in the yield ratio of $\psi^{\prime}$ to $J/\psi$ (i.e., $\psi^{\prime} / (J/\psi)$), along with an increase in $\psi^{\prime}$ yield, should be considered as a probe of QGP formation for small systems. Our findings, based on realistic modeling of the time evolution of small systems, suggest that the yield ratio $\psi^{\prime} / (J/\psi)$ and the yield of $\psi^{\prime}$ increase as a function of hydrodynamization temperature incorporating the non-adiabatic transitions in high multiplicity $p+p$ collisions.</description>

      <title>Explanation of the excesses in associated di-photon production at 152 GeV in 2HDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Statistically significant excesses exist at around 152 GeV in associated di-photon production ($\gamma\gamma+X$) in the sidebands of SM Higgs analyses of ATLAS (using the full run-2 dataset). They are most pronounced in the single-$\tau$, missing-transverse-energy, four-jet and $\geqslant1\ell+\!\geqslant1b$-jet channels ($\approx3\sigma$) and can be explained by the Drell-Yan production of new Higgs bosons, i.e. $pp\to W^*\to H^\pm H^0$. We first examine the excesses in a simplified model approach, considering that $H^\pm$ decays to $\tau\nu$, $WZ$ or $tb$. Both the $\tau\nu$ and $tb$ decay modes individually lead to a significance of $\lessapprox4\sigma$ while for $WZ$ one can obtain at most $3.5\sigma$. This is because the decays of $WZ$ lead to multiple leptons contributing to the two-lepton channel which does not show an excess at 152 GeV. Next, we consider two-Higgs-doublet models where the charged Higgs does not decay to $WZ$ at tree-level, finding a significance of $\gtrapprox4\sigma$ for a branching ratio of the new neutral Higgs to photons of $\approx$2%. Even though this branching fraction is quite sizable, it can be obtained in composite models or via the Lagrangian term $\lambda_6 H_1^\dagger H_1 H_2^\dagger H_1+{\rm h.c.}$ breaking the commonly imposed $Z_2$ symmetry.</description>

      <title>Distilling circularly polarized photon emission from magnetized chiral plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the emission of circularly polarized photons from a magnetized quark-gluon plasma with nonzero quark-number and chiral charge chemical potentials. These chemical potentials qualitatively influence the differential emission rates of circularly polarized photons. A nonzero net electric charge density, induced by quark-number chemical potentials, enhances the overall emission of one circular polarization over the other, while a nonzero chiral charge density introduces a spatial asymmetry in the emission with respect to reflection in the transverse plane. The signs of the electrical and chiral charge densities determine which circular polarization dominates overall and whether the emission preferentially aligns with or opposes the magnetic field. Based on these findings, we propose that polarized photon emission is a promising observable for characterizing the quark-gluon plasma produced in heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Net-Proton Number Cumulants in Strongly and Weakly Coupled QGP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a unified description of the QCD phase diagram across different energy regimes. Without any adjustable free parameters fitted to lattice or experimental data, we demonstrate that the net-proton number cumulant ratios from the Beam Energy Scan-I (BES-I) central ($0-5\%$) Au+Au collision experiments at RHIC, for center-of-mass energies $\sqrt{s} \geq 39\,\text{GeV}$, are well described by the \textit{dynamical soft-wall} AdS black hole model, indicating the formation of a strongly coupled quark-gluon plasma (sQGP). We identify a critical point at \(\mu_B = 247\,\text{MeV}\) or \(\sqrt{s}=16\,\text{GeV}\) in this model, where net-proton cumulant ratios show non-monotonic variation. However, for $\sqrt{s} &lt; 39\,\text{GeV}$, the recent BES-II data does not exhibit the expected variation due to the critical point, suggesting instead a transition to a nearly-cold ($\mu_B \gg T$) weakly coupled QGP (wQGP) for $\sqrt{s} &lt; 7.7\,\text{GeV}$. This prediction can be tested by the upcoming STAR Fixed-Target experimental data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this short letter, I present a powerful application in dimensionality reduction of the lesser-used Jacobi-Davidson algorithm for the generalized eigenvalue decomposition. When combined with matrix-free implementations of relevant operators, this technique allows for the computation of the dynamics of an arbitrary quantum state to be done in $\mathcal{O}(n)$ time, where $n$ is the size of the original Hilbert space.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic and two-photon transition form factors of the pseudoscalar mesons: An algebraic model computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute electromagnetic and two-photon transition form factors of ground-state pseudoscalar mesons: $\pi,\,K,\,\eta_c,\,\eta_b$. To this end, we employ an algebraic model based upon the coupled formalism of Schwinger-Dyson and Bethe-Salpeter equations. Within this approach, the dressed quark propagator and the relevant Bethe-Salpeter amplitude encode the internal structure of the corresponding meson. Electromagnetic properties of the meson are probed via the quark-photon interaction. The algebraic model employed by us unifies the treatment of all ground-state pseudoscalar mesons. Its parameters are carefully fitted performing a global analysis of existing experimental data including the knowledge of the charge radii of the mesons studied. We then compute and predict electromagnetic and two-photon transition form factors for a wide range of probing photon momentum-squared which is of direct relevance to the experimental observations carried out thus far or planned at different hadron physics facilities such as the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (JLab) and the forthcoming Electron-Ion Collider. We also present comparisons with other theoretical models and approaches and lattice quantum chromodynamics.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Secrets of Vortex Neutron Decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Investigation of decay and scattering processes of particles in a vortex state offers a novel and promising approach for probing particle structure. Our study reveals distinct properties of vortex neutron decay, which deviate from those of classical plane-wave neutron decay. We present the energy-angle distributions of the final-state electron and antineutrino in unpolarized vortex neutrons, as well as angle distributions integrated over their energies. Notably, we provide theoretical calculations of the decay behavior of neutrons with varying vortex cone angles and initial energies. We propose that identifying the vortex state of the initial neutron can be achieved by analyzing the angular and energy distributions of the final-state particles, introducing new degrees of freedom for studying weak interactions and neutron decay kinematics that have been previously overlooked in particle physics. This timely investigation takes advantage of recent advancements in vortex neutron preparation and analysis, opening up new avenues for exploring the fundamental properties of matter.</description>

      <title>A NICER View of the Nearest and Brightest Millisecond Pulsar: PSR J0437$\unicode{x2013}$4715</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report Bayesian inference of the mass, radius and hot X-ray emitting region properties - using data from the Neutron Star Interior Composition ExploreR (NICER) - for the brightest rotation-powered millisecond X-ray pulsar PSR J0437$\unicode{x2013}$4715. Our modeling is conditional on informative tight priors on mass, distance and binary inclination obtained from radio pulsar timing using the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array (PPTA) (Reardon et al. 2024), and we use NICER background models to constrain the non-source background, cross-checking with data from XMM-Newton. We assume two distinct hot emitting regions, and various parameterized hot region geometries that are defined in terms of overlapping circles; while simplified, these capture many of the possibilities suggested by detailed modeling of return current heating. For the preferred model identified by our analysis we infer a mass of $M = 1.418 \pm 0.037$ M$_\odot$ (largely informed by the PPTA mass prior) and an equatorial radius of $R = 11.36^{+0.95}_{-0.63}$ km, each reported as the posterior credible interval bounded by the 16% and 84% quantiles. This radius favors softer dense matter equations of state and is highly consistent with constraints derived from gravitational wave measurements of neutron star binary mergers. The hot regions are inferred to be non-antipodal, and hence inconsistent with a pure centered dipole magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Constraining the dense matter equation of state with new NICER mass-radius measurements and new chiral effective field theory inputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pulse profile modeling of X-ray data from NICER is now enabling precision inference of neutron star mass and radius. Combined with nuclear physics constraints from chiral effective field theory ($\chi$EFT), and masses and tidal deformabilities inferred from gravitational wave detections of binary neutron star mergers, this has lead to a steady improvement in our understanding of the dense matter equation of state (EOS). Here we consider the impact of several new results: the radius measurement for the 1.42$\,M_\odot$ pulsar PSR J0437$-$4715 presented by Choudhury et al. (2024), updates to the masses and radii of PSR J0740$+$6620 and PSR J0030$+$0451, and new $\chi$EFT results for neutron star matter up to 1.5 times nuclear saturation density. Using two different high-density EOS extensions -- a piecewise-polytropic (PP) model and a model based on the speed of sound in a neutron star (CS) -- we find the radius of a 1.4$\,M_\odot$ (2.0$\,M_\odot$) neutron star to be constrained to the 95\% credible ranges $12.28^{+0.50}_{-0.76}\,$km ($12.33^{+0.70}_{-1.34}\,$km) for the PP model and $12.01^{+0.56}_{-0.75}\,$km ($11.55^{+0.94}_{-1.09}\,$km) for the CS model. The maximum neutron star mass is predicted to be $2.15^{+0.14}_{-0.16}\,$$M_\odot$ and $2.08^{+0.28}_{-0.16}\,$$M_\odot$ for the PP and CS model, respectively. We explore the sensitivity of our results to different orders and different densities up to which $\chi$EFT is used, and show how the astrophysical observations provide constraints for the pressure at intermediate densities. Moreover, we investigate the difference $R_{2.0} - R_{1.4}$ of the radius of 2$\,M_\odot$ and 1.4$\,M_\odot$ neutron stars within our EOS inference.</description>

Abstract: The charged current weak production of $\Delta (1232)$ from the free proton target induced by the electron/positron in the intermediate energy range corresponding to the beam energy available at JLab and Mainz, has been studied. The results for the differential scattering cross section $\frac{d\sigma}{dQ^2}$, the angular distribution $\frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega_{\Delta}}$, and the total scattering cross section $\sigma(E_e)$ for both the electron and positron induced processes are presented, for the various energies in the range of 0.5--4~GeV. The cross section $\sigma(E_e)$ is found to be of the order of $10^{-39}$~cm$^{2}$ for the electron/positron energies in the few GeV range. The availability of electron/positron beams having well defined energy and direction with very high luminosity of the order of $10^{38}-10^{39}$~cm$^{-2}$~sec$^{-1}$, makes it possible to observe the weak charged current production of $\Delta(1232)$ and determine the axial vector form factors $C_{i}^{A} (Q^2);~(i=3-5)$. The sensitivity of the differential cross section $\frac{d\sigma}{dQ^2}$ to the subdominant form factors $C_{3}^{A}(Q^2)$ and $C_{4}^{A} (Q^2)$ is found to be strong enough, especially in the low $Q^2$ region, which can be used to determine them phenomenologically and to test the various theoretical models proposed to calculate them.</description>

      <title>Use of the Meta-analysis and Kolmogorov Criteria in the Finding of Singularities of a Nuclear Matter Created in Ultra Relativistic Nuclear Collisions</title>

Abstract: Published theoretical data from several models: PHSD and HSD both with and without chiral symmetry restoration (CSR), applied to experimental data on nuclear collisions from BEVALAC and SIS to LHC energies were analyzed using meta-analysis and Kolmogorov criteria. This made it possible to localize possible features of nuclear matter created in central nucleus-nucleus collisions. Ignition of a drop of quark-gluon plasma (QGP) begins already at an energy of about $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 2 GeV. We estimate that this QGP droplet occupies a small fraction, 15 $\%$ (average radius of about 5.3 fermi if the fireball radius is 10 fermi) of the total volume of the fireball created at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 2.7 GeV. A drop of exotic matter undergoes a split phase transition: separated boundaries of sharp (1st order) crossover and CSR in chiral limit, between QGP and Quarkyonic matter at an energy about $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 3.5 GeV. The critical endpoint of 2nd order probably cannot be reached in nuclear collisions. The triple phase area occupies interval from $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 12 GeV to 15 GeV, the critical endpoint of 1st order at around $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 20 GeV. The boundary of smooth (2nd order) crossover transition with CSR in chiral limit between Quarkyonic matter and QGP was localized between $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 9.3 GeV and 12 GeV, and between Hadronic and QGP in the interval from $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 15 GeV to 20 GeV, the boundary of sharp (1st order) crossover transition with CSR in chiral limit between Hadronic matter and QGP was localized after $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 20 GeV. The phase trajectory of the hadronic corona, enveloping the exotic droplet, always remains in the hadronic phase.</description>

      <title>Prevailing Triaxial Shapes in Atomic Nuclei and a Quantum Theory of Rotation of Composite Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.11299v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the traditional view, heavy deformed nuclei are like axially-symmetric prolate ellipsoids, rotating about one of the short axes. In the present picture, their shapes may be triaxial. The triaxial shape yields complex rotations, which actually well reproduce experimental data, as confirmed by state-of-the-art Configuration Interaction calculations. Two origins are suggested for the triaxiality: (i) binding-energy gain by the symmetry restoration for triaxial shapes, and (ii) another gain by specific components of the nuclear force, like tensor force and high-multipole (e.g. hexadecupole) central force. While the origin (i) produces basic modest triaxiality for virtually all deformed nuclei, the origin (ii) produces more prominent triaxiality for a certain class of nuclei. An example of the former is 154Sm, a typical showcase of axial symmetry but is now suggested to depict a modest yet finite triaxiality. The latter, prominent triaxiality, is discussed from various viewpoints for some exemplified nuclei including 166Er, and experimental findings. Many-body structures of the gamma band and the double-gamma band are clarified. Regarding the general features of rotational states of deformed many-body systems including triaxial ones, the well-known J(J+1) rule of rotational excitation energies is derived, within the quantum mechanical many-body theory, without resorting to the quantization of a rotating classical rigid body. This derivation is extended to finite K. The present picture of the rotation is robust and can be applied to various shapes or configurations, including clusters and molecules. Thus, two long-standing open problems, (i) occurrence and origins of triaxiality and (ii) quantum many-body derivation of rotational energy, are resolved. Their possible relations to Davydov's rigid-triaxial-rotor model are mentioned.</description>

      <title>Tensor factorization in ab initio many-body calculations: Triaxially-deformed (B) MBPT calculations in large bases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08532v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Whether for fundamental studies or nuclear data evaluations, first-principle calculations of atomic nuclei constitute the path forward. Today, performing \textit{ab initio} calculations (a) of heavy nuclei, (b) of doubly open-shell nuclei or (c) with a sub-percent accuracy is at the forefront of nuclear structure theory. While combining any two of these features constitutes a major challenge, addressing the three at the same time is currently impossible. From a numerical standpoint, these challenges relate to the necessity to handle (i) very large single bases and (ii) mode-6, \textit{i.e.} three-body, tensors (iii) that must be stored repeatedly. Performing second-order many-body perturbation theory(ies) calculations based on triaxially deformed and superfluid reference states of doubly open-shell nuclei up to mass $A=72$, the present work achieves a significant step forward by addressing challenge (i). To do so, the memory and computational cost associated with the handling of large tensors is scaled down via the use of tensor factorization techniques. The presently used factorization format is based on a randomized singular value decomposition that does not require the computation and storage of the very large initial tensor. The procedure delivers an inexpensive and controllable approximation to the original problem, as presently illustrated for calculations that could not be performed without tensor factorization. With the presently developed technology at hand, one can envision to perform calculations of yet heavier doubly open-shell nuclei at sub-percent accuracy in a foreseeable future.</description>

      <title>Parametric Matrix Models</title>

Abstract: We present a general class of machine learning algorithms called parametric matrix models. In contrast with most existing machine learning models that imitate the biology of neurons, parametric matrix models use matrix equations that emulate the physics of quantum systems. Similar to how physics problems are usually solved, parametric matrix models learn the governing equations that lead to the desired outputs. Parametric matrix models can be efficiently trained from empirical data, and the equations may use algebraic, differential, or integral relations. While originally designed for scientific computing, we prove that parametric matrix models are universal function approximators that can be applied to general machine learning problems. After introducing the underlying theory, we apply parametric matrix models to a series of different challenges that show their performance for a wide range of problems. For all the challenges tested here, parametric matrix models produce accurate results within an efficient and interpretable computational framework that allows for input feature extrapolation.</description>

      <title>On the nature of yrast states in neutron-rich polonium isotopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03839v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Polonium isotopes having two protons above the shell closure at $Z=82$ show a wide variety of low-lying high-spin isomeric states across the whole chain. The structure of neutron-deficient isotopes up to $^{210}$Po ($N=126$) is well established as they are easily produced through various methods. However, there is not much information available for the neutron-rich counterparts for which only selective techniques can be used for their production. We report on the first fast-timing measurements of yrast states up to the 8$^+$ level in $^{214,216,218}$Po isotopes produced in the $\beta^-$ decay of $^{214,216,218}$Bi at ISOLDE, CERN. In particular, our new half-life value of 607(14) ps for the 8$_1^+$ state in $^{214}$Po is nearly 20 times shorter than the one available in literature and comparable with the newly measured half-lives of 409(16) and 628(25) ps for the corresponding 8$_1^+$ states in $^{216,218}$Po, respectively. The measured $B(E2;8_1^+ \to 6_1^+)$ transition probability values follow an increasing trend relative to isotope mass, reaching a maximum for $^{216}$Po. The increase contradicts the previous claims of isomerism for the $8^+$ yrast states in neutron-rich $^{214}$Po and beyond. Together with the other measured yrast transitions, the $B(E2)$ values provide a crucial test of the different theoretical approaches describing the underlying configurations of the yrast band. The new experimental results are compared to shell-model calculations using the KHPE and H208 effective interactions and their pairing modified versions, showing an increase in configuration mixing when moving towards the heavier isotopes.</description>
