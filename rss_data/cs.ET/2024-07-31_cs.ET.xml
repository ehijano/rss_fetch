      <title>Exploring Liquid Neural Networks on Loihi-2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the realm of liquid neural networks (LNNs) and their deployment on neuromorphic hardware platforms. It provides an in-depth analysis of Liquid State Machines (LSMs) and explores the adaptation of LNN architectures to neuromorphic systems, highlighting the theoretical foundations and practical applications. We introduce a pioneering approach to image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset by implementing Liquid Neural Networks (LNNs) on state-of-the-art neuromorphic hardware platforms. Our Loihi-2 ASIC-based architecture demonstrates exceptional performance, achieving a remarkable accuracy of 91.3% while consuming only 213 microJoules per frame. These results underscore the substantial potential of LNNs for advancing neuromorphic computing and establish a new benchmark for the field in terms of both efficiency and accuracy.</description>

      <title>CultureVo: The Serious Game of Utilizing Gen AI for Enhancing Cultural Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CultureVo, Inc. has developed the Integrated Culture Learning Suite (ICLS) to deliver foundational knowledge of world cultures through a combination of interactive lessons and gamified experiences. This paper explores how Generative AI powered by open source Large Langauge Models are utilized within the ICLS to enhance cultural intelligence. The suite employs Generative AI techniques to automate the assessment of learner knowledge, analyze behavioral patterns, and manage interactions with non-player characters using real time learner assessment. Additionally, ICLS provides contextual hint and recommend course content by assessing learner proficiency, while Generative AI facilitates the automated creation and validation of educational content.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This introductory chapter briefly outlines the main theme of this volume, namely, to review the new opportunities and risks of digital healthcare from various disciplinary perspectives. These perspectives include law, public policy, organisational studies, and applied ethics. Based on this interdisciplinary approach, we hope that effective strategies may arise to ensure that benefits of this on-going revolution are deployed in a responsible and sustainable manner. The second part of the chapter comprises a brief review of the four parts and fourteen substantive chapters that comprise this volume.</description>

      <title>Neuromorphic on-chip reservoir computing with spiking neural network architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reservoir computing is a promising approach for harnessing the computational power of recurrent neural networks while dramatically simplifying training. This paper investigates the application of integrate-and-fire neurons within reservoir computing frameworks for two distinct tasks: capturing chaotic dynamics of the H\'enon map and forecasting the Mackey-Glass time series. Integrate-and-fire neurons can be implemented in low-power neuromorphic architectures such as Intel Loihi. We explore the impact of network topologies created through random interactions on the reservoir's performance. Our study reveals task-specific variations in network effectiveness, highlighting the importance of tailored architectures for distinct computational tasks. To identify optimal network configurations, we employ a meta-learning approach combined with simulated annealing. This method efficiently explores the space of possible network structures, identifying architectures that excel in different scenarios. The resulting networks demonstrate a range of behaviors, showcasing how inherent architectural features influence task-specific capabilities. We study the reservoir computing performance using a custom integrate-and-fire code, Intel's Lava neuromorphic computing software framework, and via an on-chip implementation in Loihi. We conclude with an analysis of the energy performance of the Loihi architecture.</description>

      <title>On the Limitations of Compute Thresholds as a Governance Strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05694v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: At face value, this essay is about understanding a fairly esoteric governance tool called compute thresholds. However, in order to grapple with whether these thresholds will achieve anything, we must first understand how they came to be. To do so, we need to engage with a decades-old debate at the heart of computer science progress, namely, is bigger always better? Does a certain inflection point of compute result in changes to the risk profile of a model? Hence, this essay may be of interest not only to policymakers and the wider public but also to computer scientists interested in understanding the role of compute in unlocking breakthroughs. This discussion is timely given the wide adoption of compute thresholds in both the White House Executive Orders on AI Safety (EO) and the EU AI Act to identify more risky systems. A key conclusion of this essay is that compute thresholds, as currently implemented, are shortsighted and likely to fail to mitigate risk. The relationship between compute and risk is highly uncertain and rapidly changing. Relying upon compute thresholds overestimates our ability to predict what abilities emerge at different scales. This essay ends with recommendations for a better way forward.</description>

      <title>An Adaptive Indoor Localization Approach Using WiFi RSSI Fingerprinting with SLAM-Enabled Robotic Platform and Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09242v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Indoor localization plays a vital role in the era of the IoT and robotics, with WiFi technology being a prominent choice due to its ubiquity. We present a method for creating WiFi fingerprinting datasets to enhance indoor localization systems and address the gap in WiFi fingerprinting dataset creation. We used the Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) algorithm and employed a robotic platform to construct precise maps and localize robots in indoor environments. We developed software applications to facilitate data acquisition, fingerprinting dataset collection, and accurate ground truth map building. Subsequently, we aligned the spatial information generated via the SLAM with the WiFi scans to create a comprehensive WiFi fingerprinting dataset. The created dataset was used to train a deep neural network (DNN) for indoor localization, which can prove the usefulness of grid density. We conducted experimental validation within our office environment to demonstrate the proposed method's effectiveness, including a heatmap from the dataset showcasing the spatial distribution of WiFi signal strengths for the testing access points placed within the environment. Notably, our method offers distinct advantages over existing approaches as it eliminates the need for a predefined map of the environment, requires no preparatory steps, lessens human intervention, creates a denser fingerprinting dataset, and reduces the WiFi fingerprinting dataset creation time. Our method achieves 26% more accurate localization than the other methods and can create a six times denser fingerprinting dataset in one-third of the time compared to the traditional method. In summary, using WiFi RSSI Fingerprinting data surveyed by the SLAM-Enabled Robotic Platform, we can adapt our trained DNN model to indoor localization in any dynamic environment and enhance its scalability and applicability in real-world scenarios.</description>
