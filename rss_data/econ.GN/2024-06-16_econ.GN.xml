      <title>California Community Colleges: Designing mentoring networks for access to social capital</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Successful careers are built on Skills (what you know), Occupational Identity (what you believe you can be) and Social Capital (who you know). Higher-ed spends significant resources in addressing the first, sometimes to the exclusion of the other two - which are difficult and expensive to teach and administer. This research specifically explores how near-peer mentoring programs, rather than a stand-alone opt-in guidance, can be integrated into the instruction/pedagogy by faculty at California community colleges. The research was conducted at 5 California community colleges (Reedley, Porterville, Coalinga, Solano and Glendale). A mixed-methods approach was used to gather social cognitive measures of student self-efficacy, occupational identity and social capital access. Measures were collected using survey instruments at the beginning of the mentoring program, and at its culmination. One of the most consistent measures observed across all the pilots was the increase in student self-efficacy of skills and competencies (3% - 7%) across colleges, geographies, and course formats after the mentoring program. Additionally, the research offers insights in implementing peer and near-peer mentoring programs that improve course completion, with significant instructional (and non-instructional) cost advantages.</description>

      <title>Rationalizability, Cost-Rationalizability, and Afriat's Efficiency Index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This note explains the equivalence between approximate rationalizability and approximate cost-rationalizability within the context of consumer demand. In connection with these results, we interpret Afriat's (1973) critical cost-efficiency index (CCEI) as a measure of approximate rationalizability through cost inefficiency, in the sense that an agent is spending more money than is required to achieve her utility targets.</description>

      <title>Newswire: A Large-Scale Structured Database of a Century of Historical News</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the U.S. historically, local newspapers drew their content largely from newswires like the Associated Press. Historians argue that newswires played a pivotal role in creating a national identity and shared understanding of the world, but there is no comprehensive archive of the content sent over newswires. We reconstruct such an archive by applying a customized deep learning pipeline to hundreds of terabytes of raw image scans from thousands of local newspapers. The resulting dataset contains 2.7 million unique public domain U.S. newswire articles, written between 1878 and 1977. Locations in these articles are georeferenced, topics are tagged using customized neural topic classification, named entities are recognized, and individuals are disambiguated to Wikipedia using a novel entity disambiguation model. To construct the Newswire dataset, we first recognize newspaper layouts and transcribe around 138 millions structured article texts from raw image scans. We then use a customized neural bi-encoder model to de-duplicate reproduced articles, in the presence of considerable abridgement and noise, quantifying how widely each article was reproduced. A text classifier is used to ensure that we only include newswire articles, which historically are in the public domain. The structured data that accompany the texts provide rich information about the who (disambiguated individuals), what (topics), and where (georeferencing) of the news that millions of Americans read over the course of a century. We also include Library of Congress metadata information about the newspapers that ran the articles on their front pages. The Newswire dataset is useful both for large language modeling - expanding training data beyond what is available from modern web texts - and for studying a diversity of questions in computational linguistics, social science, and the digital humanities.</description>

      <title>The Cost of Coming Out</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03649v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The fear of social stigma leads many individuals worldwide to hesitate in disclosing their sexual orientation. Since concealing identity is costly, it is crucial to understand the extent of anti-LGB sentiments and reactions to coming out. This paper uses an innovative data source from a popular online game together with a natural experiment to overcome existing data and endogeneity issues. We exploit exogenous variation in the identity of a character to identify the effects of coming out on players' revealed preferences for that character across diverse regions globally. Our findings reveal a substantial and persistent negative impact of coming out.</description>

      <title>Fight like a Woman: Domestic Violence and Female Judges in Brazil</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07240v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of judges' gender on the outcome of domestic violence cases. Using data from S\~ao Paulo, Brazil, between 2010 and 2019, we compare conviction rates by judge's gender and find that a domestic violence case assigned to a female judge is 31% (10 p.p) more likely to result in conviction than a case assigned to a male judge with similar career characteristics. To show that this decision gap rises due to different gender perspectives about domestic violence instead of rising due to female judges being tougher than male judges, we compare it against gender conviction rate gaps in similar types of crimes. We find that the gender conviction rate gap for domestic violence cases is significantly larger than the same gap for other misdemeanor cases (3 p.p. larger) and for other physical assault cases (8 p.p. larger). Lastly, we find evidence that at least two channels explain this gender conviction rate gap for domestic violence cases: gender-based differences in evidence interpretation and gender-based sentencing criteria.</description>
