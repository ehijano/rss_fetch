      <title>Electromagnetic Response for Modulation at Optical Time Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rapid modulation of the electromagnetic response in both time and space creates temporal boundaries in the medium and leads to time-reflection and time-refraction of light and to the eventual formation of the photonic time crystal within the modulated optical material,, offering a new regime of light-matter interactions and a potential for practical applications, from non-resonant light amplification to tunable lasing. However, the conventional approach commonly used for the photonic time crystals and related phenomena that relies on the concept of effective time-dependent refractive index, is fundamentally unsuitable to this domain of ultra-fast modulation at optical time scales. We develop the appropriate theoretical description of the electromagnetic response and the resulting phenomena in this regime, and demonstrate not only quantitative but also qualitative differences from the conclusions obtained using the conventional approach.</description>

      <title>Spin-polarized transport in quadruple quantum dots attached to ferromagnetic leads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the experimental evidence of the Nagaoka ferromagnetism in quantum dot systems by Dehollain et al [1], we search for possible confirmation of such kind of ferromagnetism by analyzing the spin-resolved transport properties of a quadruple quantum dot system focusing on the linear response regime. In particular, we consider four quantum dots arranged in a two-by-two square lattice, coupled to external ferromagnetic source and drain electrodes. Turning on and off the specific conditions for the Nagaoka ferromagnetism to occur by changing the value of the intra-dot Coulomb interactions, we determine the transport coefficients, including the linear conductance, tunnel magnetoresistance and current spin polarization. We show that a sign change of the current spin polarization may be an indication of a ferromagnetic order of Nagaoka type which develops in the system.</description>

      <title>Instant ZeV-ion-acceleration in Upset Magnetar Origin Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the energetics of bursting activity in a magnetar under the `Dzhanibekov effect,' described by the classical mechanics of rigid bodies. The magnetar's rotation axis suddenly flips due to this effect, resulting in a sudden rise of the Euler force. The outer layer of magnetar, called the crust, can plastically flow and eventually break due to the Euler force. Then, the degenerate electrons burst open from the braking region like a balloon burst. We find that the pair plasma formation can be ignited inside the crust, and its radiation can be similar to the observed bursts from soft gamma-ray repeaters. At the beginning of this bursting phenomenon, the self-discharge effect of the electron streaming may induce a strong resistive electric field, accelerating the ions. We also find that the maximum energy of the accelerated ions possibly reaches $\sim$ZeV within a timescale of $\sim1$~ps. If $\gtrsim2$~\% of magnetars in nearby galaxies are undergoing this scenario, the observed cosmic-ray flux at $&gt;100$~EeV can be explained.</description>

      <title>Symmetry constraints on topological invariants and irreducible band representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16658v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: EBR is considered the building block in TQC and fundamental concept in SI methods. One of the hypophysis is that a fully occupied EBR has zero Berry-Wilczek-Zee phase and those occupied corresponds to trivial topology. Associated with it are the concepts of atomic limit and equivalence between BRs. In this manuscript, an explicit link between the BWZ phase of connected bands and that of its EBR or irreducible band representation (IBR) basis is established. When gapped system occurs under the TB model, the relation between the BWZ phase of a set of connected bands and its BR basis only persist if the later are IBRs. Thus the BWZ phase can be evaluated in terms of the IBRs. Equivalent segments of path integral of BWZ connection with respect to IBRs are established as representation of the space group and selection rule for corresponding BWZ phase established where possible. The occurrence of IBRs is rooted in real space symmetry but dependent on dynamic interaction and band topology. Three gapped systems in honeycomb lattices are discussed. Two spin-less cases are shown to be topologically trivial, whereas the selection rule cannot be developed for the spin-full pz orbital as in graphene. Two necessary conditions for topologically trivial phase are established, namely 1.Connected bands having the same closed set of IBR basis for all k and, 2.The reduced tensor element for the path integral of BWZ connection for such basis is symmetry forbidden due to contractable close loop having zero BWZ phase. Thus the IBRs are the building block of topologically trivial phase and symmetry constraint on BWZ phase are obtained through IBRs and selection rules via Wigner-Eckart theorem. Some examples demonstrate that the basic hypothesis of SI method is false. The analysis here advocate a paradigm shift from EBR to IBR as building block of topologically trivial phase.</description>
