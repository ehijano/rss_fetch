      <title>Large-scale spin-orbit photonic circuits in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic circuits, optical platforms that connect input and output modes according to a specific map, serve as effective optical processors for both classical and quantum states of light. The number of optical elements typically scales with that of processed modes, leading to a direct correlation between system size, circuit complexity, and optical losses. Here we present a photonic circuit technology implementing large-scale unitary maps, linking a single input to hundreds of output modes in a two-dimensional compact layout. The map corresponds to the outcome of a quantum walk of structured photons, realized experimentally through light propagation in three liquid-crystal metasurfaces, having the local orientation of optic axes artificially engineered in a complex pattern. Theoretically, the walk length and the number of connected modes can be arbitrary, keeping optical losses constant. The patterns can be designed to accurately replicate multiple unitary maps. We also discuss limited reconfigurability by adjusting the overall birefringence and the relative displacement of the three optical elements. These results lay the basis for the design of low-loss photonic circuits that target a broader range of unitary maps, primarily for manipulating multi-photon states in genuinely quantum regimes.</description>

      <title>Compact low-half-wave-voltage thin film lithium niobate electro-optic phase modulator fabricated by photolithography assisted chemo-mechanical etching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a compact dual-arm thin film lithium niobate (TFLN) electro-optic phase modulator fabricated using the photolithography-assisted chemo-mechanical etching (PLACE) technique. The design of the device allows for complete utilization of the microwave electric field, doubling the modulation efficiency compared to single-arm modulators in theory. With a half-wave voltage of approximately 3 V and a modulation length of 1 cm, the device outperforms conventional phase modulators. Furthermore, the phase modulator exhibits low sensitivity to optical wavelengths in the range of 1510-1600 nm and offers a low insertion loss of 2.8 dB. The capability to generate multiple sideband signals for optical frequency comb applications is also demonstrated, producing 29 sideband signals at an input microwave power of 2 W.</description>

      <title>Numerical Insights into noise amplification of high-energy mid-infrared supercontinuum generation in normal dispersion multimode fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the noise properties of high-energy mid-infrared supercontinuum (MIR-SC) generation in normal dispersion multimode fibers from the numerical perspective. Noise amplification in multi-modes is primarily due to the stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) effect. This leads to the emergence of "incoherent cloud formation" and "incoherent optical wave breaking", similar to those observed in single-mode fibers. Increasing the pump technical noise from 0.1 % to 1 % significantly shortens the lumped coherence length L_C and exacerbates the influence of incoherent broadening dynamics competing with coherent dynamics, resulting in MIR-SC being a strong consistency in the collapse evolution of amplitude noise and phase coherence. To minimize this noise amplification and achieve high-energy low-noise MIR-SC in practical applications, it is essential to use short-pulse pumping with low amplitude noise, ensuring that L_C&gt;&gt;L_OWB (where L_OWB denotes the optical wave breaking length).</description>

      <title>Photonic topological phase transition induced by material phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic topological insulators (PTIs) have been proposed as an analogy to topological insulators in electronic systems. In particular, two-dimensional PTIs have gained attention for the integrated circuit applications. However, controlling the topological phase after fabrication is difficult because the photonic topology requires the built-in specific structures. This study experimentally demonstrates the band inversion in two-dimensional PTI induced by the phase transition of deliberately-designed nanopatterns of a phase-change material, Ge2Sb2Te5 (GST), which indicates the first observation of the photonic topological phase transition with changes in the Chern number. This approach allows us to directly alter the topological invariants, which is achieved by symmetry-breaking perturbation through GST nanopatterns with different symmetry from original PTI. The success of our scheme is attributed to the ultrafine lithographic alignment technologies of GST nanopatterns. These results demonstrate to control photonic topological properties in a reconfigurable manner, providing an insight into new possibilities for reconfigurable photonic processing circuits.</description>

      <title>Laser-target symmetry-breaking in high harmonic generation: from frequency shift to odd-even intensity modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although the frequency shift and odd-even intensity modulation in high-order harmonic generation (HHG) have both been observed for asymmetric laser-target systems, they are typically studied as two separate phenomena. In this Letter, we provide a comprehensive picture of these two nonlinear optical phenomena, unifying them through a common origin - asymmetry of the laser-target system. By tuning asymmetric laser-target systems, we discover a transition from the harmonic frequency shift to the odd-even intensity modulation upon increasing the duration of the driving laser pulse. Specifically, these phenomena are observed simultaneously for laser pulses with intermediate pulse duration. For numerical evidence, we solve the time-dependent Schr\"{o}dinger equation, while insight into the underlying physics is obtained from a simplified analytically tractable model. Understanding the asymmetric characteristics reflected in the HHG as provided is crucial for retrieving laser-target information, sampling external fields, and probing molecular dynamics.</description>

      <title>Vector Angular Spectrum Model for light travelling in scattering media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strongly scattering media disrupt both the wavefront distribution and the polarization state of the incident light field. Controlling and effectively utilizing depolarization effects are crucial for optical applications in highly scattering environments, such as imaging through dense fog. However, current simulation models have difficulty simulating the evolution of vector light fields within scattering media, posing challenges for studying vector light fields in strongly scattering environments. Here, we propose the Vector Angular Spectrum (VAS) model for simulating the propagation of vector light fields within scattering media. By introducing the angular spectrum distribution of vector light scattering and polarization conversion mechanisms, this model can simulate the depolarization effects of vector light propagating through strongly scattering media. The VAS model has also been used to investigate the focusing of vector scattered light through scattering media. Furthermore, the simulation results of the model have been validated through experiments. The proposed VAS model is expected to play a role in the theoretical research of vector scattered light and optical applications in strongly scattering environments.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present two distinct ultra-low frequency noise lasers at 729 nm with a fast frequency noise of 30 Hz^2/Hz, corresponding to a Lorentzian linewidth of 0.1 kHz. The characteristics of both lasers, which are based on different types of laser diodes, are investigated using experimental and theoretical analysis with a focus on identifying the advantages and disadvantages of each type of system. Specifically, we study the differences and similarities in mode behaviour while tuning frequency noise and linewidth reduction. Furthermore, we demonstrate the locking capability of these systems on medium-finesse cavities. The results provide insights into the unique operational characteristics of these ultra-low noise lasers and their potential applications in quantum technology that require high levels of control fidelity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The approach that makes it possible to explain the phenomenon of super resolution in a virtual image using dielectric microparticles is presented. A resolution of 100 nm in the visible range is demonstrated, resolutions of the order of 50 nm are being discussed. The presented two-dimensional model uses the FTDT code to analyze the generation of radiation and propagation through a system of slits in a metal screen and a dielectric microparticle located above it. The image is constructed using the back propagation method.</description>

      <title>Wavelength tuning of VCSELs via controlled strain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Besides major advantages for telecommunication applications, VCSELs have attracted interest for their potential for neuro-inspired computing, frequency comb generation or high-frequency spin oscillations. In the meantime, strain applied to the laser structure has been shown to have a significant impact on the laser emission properties such as the polarization dynamics or birefringence. In this work, we further explore the influence of strain on VCSELs and how this effect could be used to fine tune the laser wavelength. Through a comprehensive investigation, we demonstrate consistent wavelength shift up to 1 nm and report a sensitivity between 0.12 to 0.18 nm / millistrain. We also record birefringence values up to 292 GHz. Our results show that controlled strain level could be considered for fine wavelength tuning and possibly alleviate the selection of VCSEL for precise wavelength requirements.</description>

      <title>Cascaded injection locking of optomechanical crystal oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optomechanical oscillators stand out as high-performance and versatile candidates for serving as reference clocks in sequential photonic integrated circuits. Indeed, they have the unique capability of simultaneously generating mechanical tones and optical signal modulations at frequencies determined by their geometrical design. In this context, the concept of synchronization introduces a powerful means to precisely coordinate the dynamics of multiple oscillators in a controlled manner, thus increasing efficiency and preventing errors in signal processing photonic systems or communication interfaces. In this work, we demonstrate the cascaded injection locking of a pair of silicon-based optomechanical crystal cavities to an external reference signal that subtly modulates the laser driving one of the oscillators. Both cavities interact solely through a weak mechanical link, making the extension of this synchronization mechanism to an increased number of optomechanical oscillators within a common chip more feasible than relying solely on optical interactions. Thus, the combination of the obtained results, supported by a numerical model, with remote optical injection locking schemes discussed in the literature, lays the groundwork for the distribution of reference signals within large networks of processing elements in future phonon-photon hybrid circuits.</description>

      <title>All-optically tunable enantio-selectivity and chirality transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting and controlling the chirality of materials play an essential role in exploring nature, providing new avenues for material creation, discrimination, and manipulation. In such tasks, chiral reagents are essential in defining or enhancing the chiral dichroism response. However, ignoring their influences on the symmetry of the medium hamper the ability to control and induce asymmetric synthesis. Here, we propose a simple but versatile chirality transfer method for synthesizing and manipulating the chirality of medium. The proposed method induces the dispersion of light in a neutral atomic system, allowing to deterministically and tunably control the chirality transfer using a helical field. First, we theoretically analyze the mechanism for this optically induced chirality transfer. Afterwards, we experimentally study the enantio-sensitive feature of the medium exposed to the auxiliary chiral field. This result can be suppressed or enhanced in a deterministic enantio-selection, opening up an efficient way to manipulate asymmetric synthesis.</description>

      <title>Wavefront shaping simulations with augmented partial factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wavefront shaping can tailor multipath interference to control multiple scattering of waves in complex optical systems. However, full-wave simulations that capture multiple scattering are computationally demanding given the large system size and the large number of input channels. Recently, an "augmented partial factorization" (APF) method was proposed to significantly speed-up such full-wave simulations. In this tutorial, we illustrate how to perform wavefront shaping simulations with the APF method using the open-source frequency-domain electromagnetic scattering solver MESTI. We present the foundational concepts and then walk through four examples: computing the scattering matrix of a slab with random permittivities, open high-transmission channels through disorder, focusing inside disorder with phase conjugation, and reflection matrix computation in a spatial focused-beam basis. The goal is to lower the barrier for researchers to use simulations to explore the rich phenomena enabled by wavefront shaping.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Plasmonic Interference for Nanoscale Ultrafast Electron Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we demonstrate the use of plasmonic focusing in conjunction with non-linear photoemisison to develop geometrically flat nanoscale electron sources with less than 40 pm-rad root mean squared (rms) normalized transverse emittance. Circularly polarized light is incident on a gold Archimedean spiral structure to generate surface-plasmon-polaritons which interfere coherently at the center resulting in a 50 nm rms emisison area. Such a nanostructured flat surface enables simultaneous spatio-temporal confinement of emitted electrons at the nanometer and femtosecond level and can be used as an advanced electron source for high-repetition-rate ultrafast electron diffraction and microscopy experiments as well as next-generation of miniaturized particle accelerators.</description>

Abstract: Emerging technologies that employ quantum physics offer fundamental enhancements in information processing tasks, including sensing, communications, and computing. Here, we introduce the quantum phased array, which generalizes the operating principles of phased arrays and wavefront engineering to quantum fields, and report the first quantum phased array technology demonstration. An integrated photonic-electronic system is used to manipulate free-space quantum information to establish reconfigurable wireless quantum links in a standalone, compact form factor. Such a robust, scalable, and integrated quantum platform can enable broad deployment of quantum technologies with high connectivity, potentially expanding their use cases to real-world applications. We report the first, to our knowledge, free-space-to-chip interface for quantum links, enabled by 32 metamaterial antennas with more than 500,000 sub-wavelength engineered nanophotonic elements over a 550 x 550 $\mathrm{\mu m}^2$ physical aperture. We implement a 32-channel array of quantum coherent receivers with 30.3 dB shot noise clearance and 90.2 dB common-mode rejection ratio that downconverts the quantum optical information via homodyne detection and processes it coherently in the radio-frequency domain. With our platform, we demonstrate 32-pixel imaging of squeezed light for quantum sensing, reconfigurable free-space links for quantum communications, and proof-of-concept entanglement generation for measurement-based quantum computing. This approach offers targeted, real-time, dynamically-adjustable free-space capabilities to integrated quantum systems that can enable wireless quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Polarization-entangled photon pair generation from an epsilon-near-zero metasurface</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03493v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Polarization-entangled photon pair sources are essential for diverse quantum technologies, such as quantum communication, computation, and imaging. However, the generation of complex polarization-entangled quantum states has long been constrained by the available nonlinear susceptibility tensor of natural nonlinear crystals, necessitating a cumbersome and intricate setup for additional coherent superposition or post-selection. In this study, we introduce and experimentally demonstrate a nanoscale polarization-entangled photon pair source utilizing an artificially-engineered metamaterial platform. This platform is based on a plasmonic metasurface that is strongly coupled to an epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) material. By precisely engineering resonances at both pump and signal/idler wavelengths, and leveraging the field enhancement provided by the ENZ effect, the photon pair generation efficiency of the 68-nm-thick metasurface is significantly boosted. More notably, the ENZ metasurface platform facilitates versatile manipulation of the system's anisotropic second-order nonlinear susceptibility tensor, enabling direct control over the polarization states of the photon pairs, which leads to the generation of a polarization-entangled Bell state without the need for additional components. Our approach opens a new avenue for the simultaneous photon pair generation and quantum state engineering in a compact platform.</description>

      <title>Canonical scattering problem in topological metamaterials: Valley-Hall modes through a bend</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.04396v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the amount of backscattering of Valley Hall modes in a classical topological insulator. In reciprocal systems, the conservation of the valley index has been argued to be at the root of the high-transmission of Valley Hall modes, observed in many experimental realisations. Here, we reconsider this hypothesis by quantitatively analysing the canonical scattering problem of interface Valley Hall modes impinging on sharp bends which may or may not conserve the valley index. We consider a tight binding model of graphene ribbons with an interface and compute the reflection and transmission coefficients using a transfer matrix formalism. We find that, in all configurations considered, the transmission of Valley Hall modes is close to being maximal, even in cases where the valley index is not conserved. Hence there appears to be no correlation between valley conservation and good transmission. Our results serve as a reference case for the design of Valley Hall type metamaterial.</description>

Abstract: Ptychography, as a powerful lensless imaging method, has become a popular member of the coherent diffractive imaging family over decades of development. The ability to utilize low-dose X-rays and/or fast scans offers a big advantage in a ptychographic measurement (for example, when measuring radiation-sensitive samples), but results in low-photon statistics, making the subsequent phase retrieval challenging. Here, we demonstrate a dose-efficient automatic differentiation framework for ptychographic reconstruction (DAP) at low-photon statistics and low overlap ratio. As no reciprocal space constraint is required in this DAP framework, the framework, based on various forward models, shows superior performance under these conditions. It effectively suppresses potential artifacts in the reconstructed images, especially for the inherent periodic artifact in a raster scan. We validate the effectiveness and robustness of this method using both simulated and measured datasets.</description>

      <title>Weak-measurement-based pseudospin pointer: A cost-effective scheme for precision measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02100v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As an essential component of state-of-the-art quantum technologies, fast and efficient quantum measurements are in persistent demand over time. We present a proof-of-principle experiment on a new dimensionless pseudo-spin pointer based on weak measurement. In the context of optical parameter estimation, we demonstrate that the parametric distribution's moment is obtained experimentally by employing the dimensionless pointer without measuring the distribution literally. In addition to the sheer liberation of experimental expense, the photon-countering-based pointer is well-calibrated for the detection of weak signals. We show that for signals $3$-$4$ orders of weaker in strength than the area-array camera method, an order of improvement in precision is achieved experimentally.</description>

      <title>Photon Number-Resolving Quantum Reservoir Computing</title>

Abstract: Neuromorphic processors improve the efficiency of machine learning algorithms through the implementation of physical artificial neurons to perform computations. However, whilst efficient classical neuromorphic processors have been demonstrated in various forms, practical quantum neuromorphic platforms are still in the early stages of development. Here we propose a fixed optical network for photonic quantum reservoir computing that is enabled by photon number-resolved detection of the output states. This significantly reduces the required complexity of the input quantum states while still accessing a high-dimensional Hilbert space. The approach is implementable with currently available technology and lowers the barrier to entry to quantum machine learning.</description>

      <title>Quantum-fluctuation asymmetry in multiphoton Jaynes-Cummings resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13597v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the statistical behavior of the light emanating from a coherently driven Jaynes-Cummings (JC) oscillator operating in the regime of multiphoton blockade with two monitored output channels causing the loss of coherence at equal rates. We do so by adopting an operational approach which draws the particle and wave aspects of the forwards scattered radiation together, building upon the relationship between quantum optical correlation functions and conditional measurements. We first derive an analytical expression of the intensity cross-correlation function at the peak of the two-photon JC resonance to demonstrate the breakdown of detailed balance. The application of quantum trajectory theory in parallel with the quantum regression formula subsequently uncovers various aspects of temporal asymmetry in the quantum fluctuations characterizing the cascaded process through which a multiphoton resonance is established and read out. We find that monitoring different quadratures of the cavity field in conditional homodyne detection affects the times waited between successive photon counter ``clicks'', which in turn trigger the sampling of the homodyne current. Despite the fact that the steady-state cavity occupation is of the order of a photon, monitoring of the developing bimodality also impacts on the ratio between the emissions directed along the two decoherence channels.</description>

      <title>Propagation in rough waveguides: Forward and inverse problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06336v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss here the direct and inverse problems for wave propagation in a waveguide with rough internal surface and arbitrary mean shape. The high degree of multiple scattering inside the waveguide poses significant challenges both for the forward computation and for the recovery of the surface profile, and raises important questions about scattering cross-sections. This paper falls into two parts corresponding to these issues.
  We first apply Left-Right (L-R) operator splitting to calculate the scattered fields in 2- and 3-dimensional waveguides. Using this we illustrate the scattered fields and the effect of surface roughness. In the second part we formulate an algorithm for surface recovery from field measurements along the waveguide axis, which generalises recent work on surfaces in 2 dimensions. This method utilizes forward scattering assumptions in effect by formulating an integral equation in the unknown surface field, treated as a function of the surface. Although discussed in the context of waveguides, the formulae are given in a form applicable to a variety of geometries, with coefficients which will depend on and be determined by each specific application.</description>
