      <title>Computability of $\mathcal{G}$-Beroulli Measures and Measures of Maximal Entropy on Coded Shift Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the computability of $\mathcal{G}$-Bernoulli measures, with a particular focus on measures of maximal entropy (MMEs) on coded shift spaces. Coded shifts are natural generalizations of sofic shifts and are defined as the closure of all bi-infinite concatenations of words (generators) drawn from a countable generating set $\mathcal{G}$. We begin by establishing a computability criterion for $\mathcal{G}$-Bernoulli measures which are invariant measures given by assigning probability weights to the generators. We then apply this criterion to the setting in which the concatenation entropy exceeds the residual entropy, showing that in this case the unique measure of maximal entropy $\mu_{\rm max}$ on $X$ is computable, provided the Vere--Jones parameter $\kappa$ of $\mathcal{G}$ is computable, based on having oracle access to the generators and the language of $X$. As a consequence, the unique MME is computable for several well-known classes of shift spaces, including $S$-gap shifts, multiple-gap shifts, and $\beta$-shifts. Moreover, the two ergodic MMEs of the Dyck shift are also computable. Finally, we examine the opposite situation, where the residual entropy exceeds the concatenation entropy and the MME is known to be non-unique in general. We show that even when $\mu_{\rm max}$ is unique and the parameter $\kappa$ is computable, the measure $\mu_{\rm max}$ may still fail to be computable.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using continuation methods and bifurcation theory, we study the exact multiplicity of periodic solutions, and the global solution structure, for periodic problems of first order. The results are applied to a population model with fishing, and to the existence and stability of limit cycles. We also describe in detail our numerical computations of curves of periodic solutions, and of limit cycles.</description>

      <title>An index theory for transverse trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present an alternative definition of the Le Roux index, which generalizes the Poincar\'e-Hopf index for non-singular planar flows to the broader setting of Brouwer homeomorphisms. This new approach answers a question raised by Le Roux by establishing a connection between the index of a Brouwer homeomorphism and the structure of its transverse foliations, in the sense of Le Calvez.</description>

      <title>Construction and Box-counting Dimension of the Edelstein Hidden Variable Fractal Interpolation Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the construction of a hidden variable fractal interpolation function using Edelstein contractions in an iterated function system based on a finite collection of data points. The approach incorporates an iterated function system where variable functions act as vertical scaling factors leading to a generalised vector-valued fractal interpolation function. Furthermore, the paper rigorously examines the smoothness of the constructed function and establishes an upper bound for the box-counting dimension of its graph.</description>

      <title>Reversibility and symmetry of affine toral automorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study reversibility and strong reversibility of affine automorphisms of the two-torus, written as $f_{A,\bar{a}}(\bar{x})=A\bar{x}+\bar{a} \ (\mathrm{mod}\ \mathbb{Z}^2)$. We derive explicit criteria for the reversibility of such maps in terms of the matrix $A$ and the translation $\bar{a}$. If $1$ is not an eigenvalue of $A$, reversibility of the affine map coincides with reversibility of $A$. When $1$ is an eigenvalue, additional arithmetic obstructions appear. We also provide a simple geometric condition, based on Pick's Theorem, that guarantees the existence of fixed points, along with a description of the dynamics of affine toral automorphisms. We also compute the entropy and characterize when conjugacy classes in the affine group are finite or uncountable.</description>

      <title>On the escape rate for intermittent maps with holes shrinking around the indifferent fixed point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study non-uniformly expanding maps of the unit interval with a parabolic fixed point at the origin that admit an ergodic absolutely continuous invariant measure, which may be finite or infinite. By introducing a hole defined by an interval containing the parabolic fixed point, we analyze the escape rate of the resulting open system and its asymptotic behavior as the hole shrinks. Our approach relies on the transfer operator associated with the dynamical system and on the relationship between the transfer operators of the original system and its induced version. The results extend to this general framework previous investigations which considered special cases.</description>

      <title>Counting Saddle Connections on Hyperelliptic Translation Surfaces with a Slit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider saddle connections on a translation surface in a hyperelliptic connected component of a stratum that do not intersect the interior of a distinguished saddle connection. For this restricted set of saddle connections, we show that it satisfies an $L (\log L)^{d-2}$ growth rate, where $d$ is the complex dimension of the hyperelliptic stratum. The upper bound holds for all translation surfaces in the hyperelliptic stratum while the lower bound holds for almost every surface in the hyperelliptic stratum. The proof of the lower bound uses horocycle renormalization.</description>

      <title>Pointwise Ergodic Averages Along the Omega Function in Number Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show the failure of the pointwise convergence of averages along the Omega function in a number field. As a consequence, we show, for instance, that the averages \[ \frac{1}{N^2}\sum_{1\leq m,n \leq N} f(T^{\Omega(m^2+n^2)}x)\] do not converge pointwise in ergodic systems, addressing a question posed by Le, Moreira, Sun, and the second author. On the other hand, using number-theoretic methods, we establish the pointwise convergence of averages along the $\Omega$ function defined on the ideals of a number field in uniquely ergodic systems. Using this dynamical framework, we also derive several natural number-theoretic consequences of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Ergodic averages for commutative transformations along return times</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.16188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend recent results on the convergence of ergodic averages along sequences generated by return times to shrinking targets in rapidly mixing systems, partially answering questions posed by the first author, Maass and the third author in [6]. In particular, for a fixed parameter $a\in (0,1)$ and for generic $y\in [0,1]$, we establish both $L^2$ and pointwise convergence for single averages and multiple averages for commuting transformations along the sequences $(a_n(y))_{n\in \mathbb{N}}$, obtained by arranging the set $$\Big\{n\in\mathbb{N}: 0&lt;2^ny \mod{1}&lt;n^{-a} \Big\}$$ in an increasing order. We also obtain new results for semi-random ergodic averages along sequences of similar type.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic behaviour of coupled random dynamical systems with multiscale aspects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine a class of stochastic differential inclusions involving multiscale effects designed to solve a class of generalized variational inequalities. This class of problems contains constrained convex non-smooth optimization problems, constrained saddle-point problems and various equilibrium problems in economics and engineering. In order to respect constraints we adopt a penalty approach, introducing an explicit time-dependency into the evolution system. The resulting dynamics are described in terms of a non-autonomous stochastic evolution equation governed by maximally monotone operators in the drift and perturbed by a Brownian motion. We study the asymptotic behavior, as well as finite time convergence rates in terms of gap functions. The condition we use to prove convergence involves a Legendre transform of the function describing the set C, a condition first used by Attouch and Czarnecki (J. Differ. Equations, Vol. 248, Issue 6, 2010) in the context of deterministic evolution equations. We also establish a large deviations principle showing that individual trajectories exhibit exponential concentration around the solution set. Finally we show how our continuous-time approach relates to penalty-regulated algorithms of forward-backward type after performing a suitable Euler-Maruyama discretisation.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Mean Field Theories for Nonlinear Noise in Recurrent Neuronal Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strong, correlated noise in recurrent neural circuits often passes through nonlinear transfer functions, complicating dynamical mean-field analyses of complex phenomena such as transients and bifurcations. We introduce a method that replaces nonlinear functions of Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) noise with a Gaussian-equivalent process matched in mean and covariance, and combine this with a lognormal moment closure for expansive nonlinearities to derive a closed dynamical mean-field theory for recurrent neuronal networks. The resulting theory captures order-one transients, fixed points, and noise-induced shifts of bifurcation structure, and outperforms standard linearization-based approximations in the strong-fluctuation regime. More broadly, the approach applies whenever dynamics depend smoothly on OU processes via nonlinear transformations, offering a tractable route to noise-dependent phase diagrams in computational neuroscience models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.16119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For closed manifolds with compact Lie group actions, we study Austin-Braam's Morse-theoretic construction of Borel equivariant cohomology using the technique of stabilization. We show that a $C^1$-small equivariant perturbation produces stable invariant Morse-Bott functions. This allows us to realize the equivariant transversality and orientability assumptions in Austin-Braam's framework by choosing generic invariant Riemannian metrics.</description>

Abstract: We prove that the Ginzburg-Landau equation correctly predicts the dynamics of quasilinear pattern-forming reaction-diffusion-advection systems, close to the first instability. We present a simple theorem which is easily applicable for such systems and relies on key maximal regularity results. The theorem is applied to the Gray-Scott-Klausmeier vegetation-water interaction model and its application to general reaction-diffusion-advection systems is discussed.</description>

      <title>Fixed-point proportion of geometric iterated Galois groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1980, Odoni initiated the study of the fixed-point proportion of iterated Galois groups of polynomials motivated by prime density problems in arithmetic dynamics.
  The main goal of the present paper is to completely settle the longstanding open problem of computing the fixed-point proportion of geometric iterated Galois groups of polynomials. Indeed, we confirm the well-known conjecture that Chebyshev polynomials are the only complex polynomials whose geometric iterated Galois groups have positive fixed-point proportion. Our proof relies on methods from group theory, ergodic theory, martingale theory and complex dynamics. This result has direct applications to the proportion of periodic points of polynomials over finite fields.
  The general framework developed in this paper applies more generally to rational functions over arbitrary fields and generalizes, via a unified approach, previous partial results, which have all been proved with very different methods.</description>

      <title>The convergence and uniqueness of a discrete-time nonlinear Markov chain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00314v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the convergence and uniqueness of a general discrete-time nonlinear Markov chain with specific conditions. The results have important applications in discrete differential geometry. First, we prove the discrete-time Ollivier Ricci curvature flow $d_{n+1}:=(1-\alpha\kappa_{d_{n}})d_{n}$ converges to a constant curvature metric on a finite weighted graph. As shown in \cite[Theorem 5.1]{M23}, a Laplacian separation principle holds on a locally finite graph with nonnegative Ollivier curvature. We further prove that the Laplacian separation flow converges to the constant Laplacian solution and generalize the result to nonlinear $p$-Laplace operators. Moreover, our results can also be applied to study the long-time behavior in the nonlinear Dirichlet forms theory and nonlinear Perron-Frobenius theory. Finally, we define the Ollivier Ricci curvature of the nonlinear Markov chain which is consistent with the classical Ollivier Ricci curvature, sectional curvature \cite{CMS24}, coarse Ricci curvature on hypergraphs \cite{IKTU21} and the modified Ollivier Ricci curvature for $p$-Laplace. We also establish the convergence results for the nonlinear Markov chain with nonnegative Ollivier Ricci curvature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.00697v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a general regularization procedure for piecewise smooth vector fields whose discontinuity locus is a variety of normal crossings type. We show that such regularization can be smoothed through a finite sequence of blowings-up, thereby reducing the problem to study of the dynamics of a smooth vector field in a manifold with corners. The procedure will be illustrated in the cases of piecewise smooth vector fields on $\mathbb{R}^2$ with discontinuity locus $x=0$ or $xy=0$, and on $\mathbb{R}^3$ with discontinuity locus $xyz=0$. We will see that some unexpected dynamical phenomena may arise even in the case of piecewise constant vector fields.</description>

      <title>Crossed product splitting of intermediate operator algebras via 2-cocycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00304v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the C*-algebra inclusions $B \subset A \rtimes_{\rm r} \Gamma$ arising from inclusions $B \subset A$ of $\Gamma$-C*-algebras. The main result shows that, when $B \subset A$ is C*-irreducible in the sense of R{\o}rdam, and is centrally $\Gamma$-free in the sense of the author, then after tensoring with the Cuntz algebra $\mathcal{O}_2$, all intermediate C*-algebras $B \subset C\subset A \rtimes_{\rm r} \Gamma$ enjoy a natural crossed product splitting \[\mathcal{O}_2\otimes C=(\mathcal{O}_2 \otimes D) \rtimes_{{\rm r}, \gamma, \mathfrak{w}} \Lambda\] for $D:= C \cap A$, some $\Lambda&lt;\Gamma$, and a subsystem $(\gamma, \mathfrak{w})$ of a unitary perturbed cocycle action $\Lambda \curvearrowright \mathcal{O}_2\otimes A$. As an application, we give a new Galois's type theorem for the Bisch--Haagerup type inclusions \[A^K \subset A\rtimes_{\rm r} \Gamma\] for actions of compact-by-discrete groups $K \rtimes \Gamma$ on simple C*-algebras.
  Due to a K-theoretical obstruction, the operation $\mathcal{O}_2\otimes -$ is necessary to obtain the clean splitting. Also, in general 2-cocycles $\mathfrak{w}$ appearing in the splitting cannot be removed even further tensoring with any unital (cocycle) action. We show them by examples, which further show that $\mathcal{O}_2$ is a minimal possible choice.
  We also establish a von Neumann algebra analogue, where $\mathcal{O}_2$ is replaced by the type I factor $\mathbb{B}(\ell^2(\mathbb{N}))$.</description>

      <title>New Insights into Population Dynamics from the Continuous McKendrick Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21103v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article presents a comprehensive study of the continuous McKendrick model, which serves as a foundational framework in population dynamics and epidemiology. The model is formulated through partial differential equations that describe the temporal evolution of the age distribution of a population using continuously defined birth and death rates. In this work, we provide rigorous derivations of the renewal equation, establish the appropriate boundary conditions, and perform a detailed analysis of the survival functions. The central result demonstrates that the population approaches extinction if and only if the net reproduction number $R_{n}$ is strictly less than unity. We present two independent proofs: one based on Laplace transform techniques and Tauberian theorems, and another employing a reformulation as a system of ordinary differential equations with eigenvalue analysis. Additionally, we establish the connection between the deterministic framework and stochastic process formulations, showing that the McKendrick equation emerges as the fluid limit of an individual-based stochastic model.</description>

      <title>Chaotic Kramers' Law: Hasselmann's Program and AMOC Tipping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18904v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In bistable dynamical systems driven by Wiener processes, the widely used Kramers' law relates the strength of the noise forcing to the average time it takes to see a noise-induced transition from one attractor to the other. We extend this law to bistable systems forced by fast chaotic dynamics, which we argue is in some cases a more realistic modeling approach than unbounded noise forcing. Transitions similar to the noise-driven case can only occur if the amplitude of the chaotic forcing is large enough. If this is the case, in our numerical example - a reduced-order model of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) - we observe the chaotic Kramers' law to hold even when the chaotic forcing is far from the stochastic limit. We discuss the limitations of the chaotic Kramers' law, how to address the numerical issues associated with the timescale separation, and give a possible explanation for the dynamics of recently found AMOC collapses and recoveries in complex climate models.</description>

      <title>On the Markoff spectrum on the Hecke group of index six</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08358v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The discrete part of the Markoff spectrum on the Hecke group of index 6 was determined by A.~Schmidt. In this paper, we study its Markoff and Lagrange spectra after the smallest accumulation point $4/\sqrt3$. We show that both the Markoff and Lagrange spectra below $4/\sqrt{3} + \epsilon$ have positive Hausdorff dimension for any positive $\epsilon$. We also find maximal gaps and an isolated point in the spectra.</description>
