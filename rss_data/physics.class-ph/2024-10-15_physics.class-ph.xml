      <title>Launching mass from the Moon helped by lunar gravity anomalies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Normally a passive object launched from the Moon at less than the escape velocity orbits the Moon once and then crashes back to the launch site. We show that thanks to lunar gravity anomalies, for specific launch sites and directions, a passive projectile can remain in lunar orbit for up to 9 Earth days. We find that such sites exist at least on the lunar equator for prograde equatorial orbit launches. Three of the sites are located on the lunar nearside. We envision that this can be used to lift material from the Moon at low cost because it gives prolonged opportunities for an active spacecraft to catch the projectile. Passive projectiles can be made entirely from lunar material so that a stream of Earth-imported parts is not needed. To reduce the mass and cost of the launcher, the projectile mass can be scaled down with a corresponding increase in the launch frequency. The projectile launcher itself can be a coilgun, railgun, superconducting quenchgun, sling or any other device that can give a projectile an orbital speed of about 1.7 km/s.</description>

      <title>Barcelos-Wotzasek symplectic algorithm for constrained systems revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A minor change in the Barcelos-Wotzasek (BW) symplectic algorithm for constrained systems is proposed. The change addresses some criticism that formalism has received, placing it on the same footing as Dirac's algorithm.</description>

      <title>The illusion of acceleration in the retarded Lienard-Wiechert electromagnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05338v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is generally assumed that the retarded Lienard-Wiechert electromagnetic field produced by a point particle depends on the acceleration of that source particle. This dependence is not real, it is an illusion. The true electromagnetic interaction is time symmetric (half retarded and half advanced) and depends only on the positions and velocities of the electrically charged particles. A different acceleration of the retarded source particle will result in a different position and velocity of the advanced source particle, changing in this way the Lorentz force felt by the test particle.</description>

      <title>Acceleration deforms exponential decays into power laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18151v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An exponentially decaying accelerated system looks as if its decay was of a generalized power-law type, provided relativistic time dilation in the detector and retardation of the emitted signal are taken into account. The same mathematical formula is found in generalizations of the Zipf-Mandelbrot law in quantitative linguistics, and in dynamics of re-association of folded proteins.</description>

      <title>The Bouc-Wen Model for Binary Direct Collinear Collisions of Convex Viscoplastic Bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08147v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study mathematical models of binary direct collinear collisions of convex viscoplastic bodies based on two incremental collision laws that employ the Bouc-Wen differential model of hysteresis to represent the elastoplastic behavior of the materials of the colliding bodies. These collision laws are the Bouc-Wen-Simon-Hunt-Crossley collision law (BWSHCCL) and the Bouc-Wen-Maxwell collision law (BWMCL). The BWSHCCL comprises of the Bouc-Wen model amended with the nonlinear Hertzian elastic spring element and connected in parallel to a nonlinear displacement-dependent and rate-dependent energy dissipation element. The BWMCL comprises of the Bouc-Wen model amended with the nonlinear Hertzian elastic spring element and connected in series to a linear rate-dependent energy dissipation element. The mathematical models of the collision process are presented in the form of finite-dimensional initial value problems. We show that the models possess favorable analytical properties (e.g., global existence, uniqueness and boundedness of the solutions) under suitable restrictions on the ranges of their parameters. Furthermore, we show that excellent agreement can be achieved between the experimental data and the data from the numerical simulation of the mathematical models across a wide range of initial relative velocities and material properties of the colliding bodies while using parameterizations that are independent of the initial relative velocity.</description>
