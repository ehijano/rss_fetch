      <title>The Suicide Region: Option Games and the Race to Artificial General Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Standard real options theory predicts delay in exercising the option to invest or deploy when extreme asset volatility or technological uncertainty are present. However, in the current race to develop artificial general intelligence (AGI), sovereign actors are exhibiting behaviors contrary to theoretical predictions: the US and China are accelerating AI investment despite acknowledging the potential for catastrophic failure from AGI misalignment. We resolve this puzzle by formalizing the AGI race as a continuous-time preemption game with endogenous existential risk. In our model, the cost of failure is no longer bounded only by the sunk cost of investment (I), but rather a systemic ruin parameter (D) that is correlated with development velocity and shared globally. As the disutility of catastrophe is embedded in both players' payoffs, the risk term mathematically cancels out of the equilibrium indifference condition. This creates a "suicide region" in the investment space where competitive pressures force rational agents to deploy AGI systems early, despite a negative risk-adjusted net present value. Furthermore, we show that "warning shots" (sub-existential disasters) will fail to deter AGI acceleration, as the winner-takes-all nature of the race remains intact. The race can only be halted if the cost of ruin is internalized, making safety research a prerequisite for economic viability. We derive the critical private liability threshold required to restore the option value of waiting and propose mechanism design interventions that can better ensure safe AGI research and socially responsible deployment.</description>

      <title>Order-Flow Filtration and Directional Association with Short-Horizon Returns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22712v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electronic markets generate dense order flow with many transient orders, which degrade directional signals derived from the limit order book (LOB). We study whether simple structural filters on order lifetime, modification count, and modification timing sharpen the association between order book imbalance (OBI) and short-horizon returns in BankNifty index futures, where unfiltered OBI is already known to be a strong short-horizon directional indicator. The efficacy of each filter is evaluated using a three-step diagnostic ladder: contemporaneous correlations, linear association between discretised regimes, and Hawkes event-time excitation between OBI and return regimes. Our results indicate that filtration of the aggregate order flow produces only modest changes relative to the unfiltered benchmark. By contrast, when filters are applied on the parent orders of executed trades, the resulting OBI series exhibits systematically stronger directional association. Motivated by recent regulatory initiatives to curb noisy order flow, we treat the association between OBI and short-horizon returns as a policy-relevant diagnostic of market quality. We then compare unfiltered and filtered OBI series, using tick-by-tick data from the National Stock Exchange of India, to infer how structural filters on the order flow affect OBI-return dynamics in an emerging market setting.</description>
