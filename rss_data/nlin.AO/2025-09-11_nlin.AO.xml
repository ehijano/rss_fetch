      <title>Vortex triplets, symmetry breaking, and emergent nonequilibrium plastic crystals in an active-spinner fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The formation of patterns and exotic nonequilibrium steady states in active-fluid systems continues to pose challenging problems -- theoretical, numerical, and experimental -- for statistical physicists and fluid dynamicists. We combine theoretical ideas from statistical mechanics and fluid mechanics to uncover a new type of self-assembled crystal of vortex triplets in an active-spinner fluid. We begin with the two-dimensional Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes (CHNS) model for a binary-fluid system of active rotors that has two important ingredients: a scalar order parameter field phi that distinguishes regions with clockwise (CW) and counter-clockwise (CCW) spinners; and an incompressible velocity field u. In addition to the conventional CHNS coupling between phi and u, this model has a torque-induced activity term, with coefficient tau, whose consequences we explore. We demonstrate that, if we increase the activity tau, it overcomes dissipation and this system displays a hitherto unanticipated emergent triangular crystal, with spinning vortex triplets at its vertices. We show that this is a nonequilibrium counterpart of an equilibrium plastic crystal. We characterise the statistical properties of this novel crystal and suggest possible experimental realisations of this new state of active matter.</description>

      <title>Inferring entropy production in many-body systems using nonequilibrium MaxEnt</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10444v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a method for inferring entropy production (EP) in high-dimensional stochastic systems, including many-body systems and non-Markovian systems with long memory. Standard techniques for estimating EP become intractable in such systems due to computational and statistical limitations. We infer trajectory-level EP and lower bounds on average EP by exploiting a nonequilibrium analogue of the Maximum Entropy principle, along with convex duality. Our approach uses only samples of trajectory observables, such as spatiotemporal correlations. It does not require reconstruction of high-dimensional probability distributions or rate matrices, nor impose any special assumptions such as discrete states or multipartite dynamics. In addition, it may be used to compute a hierarchical decomposition of EP, reflecting contributions from different interaction orders, and it has an intuitive physical interpretation as a "thermodynamic uncertainty relation." We demonstrate its numerical performance on a disordered nonequilibrium spin model with 1000 spins and a large neural spike-train dataset.</description>

      <title>Historical Contingencies Steer the Topology of Randomly Assembled Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00335v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graphs are used to represent and analyze data in domains as diverse as physics, biology, chemistry, planetary science, and the social sciences. Across domains, random graph models relate generative processes to expected graph properties, and allow for sampling from distinct ensembles. Here we introduce a new random graph model, inspired by assembly theory, and characterize the graphs it generates. We show that graphs generated using our method represent a diverse ensemble, characterized by a broad range of summary statistics, unexpected even in graphs with identical degree sequences. Finally we demonstrate that the distinct properties of these graphs are enabled by historical contingencies during the generative process. These results lay the foundation for further development of novel sampling methods based on assembly theory with applications to drug discovery and materials science.</description>
