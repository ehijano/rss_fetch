      <title>Accurate humidity and pH synchronized measurement with temperature compensation based on polarization maintaining fiber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-time and accurate monitoring of humidity and pH is of great significance in daily life and industrial production. Existing humidity and pH measurement suffer from limitations such as low sensitivity, signal crosstalk, complex system structures, and inability to achieve real-time monitoring. In this work, the surface of a polarization maintaining fiber (PMF) was functionalized with a composite humidity-sensitive polymer composed of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and carbon nanosheets (CNs). A humidity-sensitive film with a microporous structure was prepared on the PMF cladding through high-temperature rapid film formation and laser processing, enhancing humidity sensitivity and stability. To enable pH sensing, poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH) and poly (acrylic acid) (PAA) were successively adsorbed onto the PMF surface via electrostatic self-assembly, forming a pH-sensitive nanofilm structure. By connecting a temperature-compensated PMF within the same Sagnac loop and combining it with a multi-wavelength matrix, simultaneous real-time monitoring of humidity, pH, and temperature was achieved, effectively solving the issue of temperature crosstalk and extending toward a universal optical fiber multi-parameter measurement platform.</description>

      <title>Matching frequency response measurements and reduced order models for the inverse identification of viscoelastic properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D-printed materials are used in many different industries (automotive, aviation, medicine, etc.). Most of these 3D-printed materials are based on ceramics or polymers whose mechanical properties vary with frequency. For numerical modeling, it is crucial to characterize this frequency dependency accurately to enable realistic finite-element simulations. At the same time, the damping behavior plays a key role in product development, since it governs a component's response at resonance and thus impacts both performance and longevity. In current research, inverse material characterization methods are getting more and more popular. However, their practical validation and applicability on real measurement data have not yet been discussed widely. In this work, we show the identification of two different materials, POM and additively manufactured sintered ceramics, and validate it with experimental data of a well-established measurement technique (dynamic mechanical analysis). The material identification process considers state-of-the-art reduced-order modeling and constrained particle swarm optimization, which are used to fit the frequency response functions of point measurements obtained by a laser Doppler vibrometer. This work shows the quality of the method in identifying the parameters defining the viscoelastic fractional derivative model, including their uncertainty. It also illustrates the applicability of this identification method in the presence of practical difficulties that come along with experimental data such as boundary conditions and noise.</description>

      <title>Self-mixing-based photoacoustic sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Versatile, ultracompact, easy-to-handle, high-sensitivity sensors are compelling tools for in situ pivotal applications, such as medical diagnostics, security and safety assessments, and environmental control. In this work, we combine photoacoustic spectroscopy and feedback interferometry, proposing a novel trace-gas sensor equipped with a self-mixing readout. This scheme demonstrates a readout sensitivity comparable to that of bulkier state-of-the-art balanced Michelson-interferometric schemes, achieving the same spectroscopic performance in terms of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and minimum detection limit (MDL). At the same time, the self-mixing readout benefits from a reduced size and a lower baseline, paving the way for future system downsizing and integration while offering a higher detectability for lower gas concentrations. Moreover, the intrinsic wavelength independence of both self-mixing and photoacoustic techniques allows the applicability and tailorability of the sensor to any desired spectral range.</description>

      <title>The Normal, the Natural, and the Harmonic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Use is made of rigorous definitions for the terms normal, natural, and harmonic to reveal a number of unfamiliar aspects about them. The Gaussian distribution is not sufficient to determine who is normal, and fluctuations above or below a natural-growth curve may or may not be natural. A recipe for harmonically sustained natural growth requires that the overlap during the substitution process must be limited. As a consequence the overall growth process must experience good as well as bad 'seasons'.</description>

      <title>Single-shot near-field reconstruction of metamaterial dispersion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a single-shot near-field technique to reconstruct the isofrequency surfaces of metamaterials in the microwave regime. In our approach, we excite resonant modes using a fixed source in a resonator composed of the material under test and map the in-plane field distribution with a movable probe. Applying a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to the measured field reveals the sample's in-plane dispersion. By extending this analysis over multiple frequencies and comparing the results with Fabry-P\'erot resonances, we retrieve the full three-dimensional dispersion relation. When we apply the method to a double non-connected wire metamaterial, it accurately captures the low-frequency hyperbolic isofrequency surface, providing both a precise experimental tool and conceptual insight into spatially dispersive metamaterials.</description>

      <title>Implementation of transformer-based LLMs with large-scale optoelectronic neurons on a CMOS image sensor platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent rapid deployment of datacenter infrastructures for performing large language models (LLMs) and related artificial intelligence (AI) applications in the clouds is predicted to incur an exponentially growing energy consumption in the near-term future. In this paper, we propose and analyze the implementation of the transformer model, which is the cornerstone of the modern LLMs, with novel large-scale optoelectronic neurons (OENs) constructed over the commercially available complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) image sensor (CIS) platform. With all of the required optoelectronic devices and electronic circuits integrated in a chiplet only about 2 cm by 3 cm in size, 175 billon parameters in the case of GPT-3 are shown to perform inference at an unprecedented speed of 12.6 POPS using only a 40 nm CMOS process node, along with a high power efficiency of 74 TOPS/W and a high area efficiency of 19 TOPS/mm2, both surpassing the related digital electronics by roughly two orders of magnitude. The influence of the quantization formats and the hardware induced errors are numerically investigated, and are shown to have a minimal impact. Our study presents a new yet practical path toward analog neural processing units (NPUs) to complement existing digital processing units.</description>

      <title>Experimental Observation of Hidden Multistability in Nonlinear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multistability, the coexistence of multiple stable states, is a cornerstone of nonlinear dynamical systems, governing their equilibrium, tunability, and emergent complexity. Recently, the concept of hidden multistability, where certain stable states evade detection via conventional continuous parameter sweeping, has garnered increasing attention due to its elusive nature and promising applications. In this Letter, we present the first experimental observation of hidden multistability using a programmable acoustic coupled-cavity platform that integrates competing self-focusing and self-defocusing Kerr nonlinearities. Beyond established bistability, we demonstrate semi- and fully-hidden tristabilities by precisely programming system parameters. Crucially, the hidden stable states, typically inaccessible via the traditional protocol, are unambiguously revealed and dynamically controlled through pulsed excitation, enabling flexible transitions between distinct types of stable states. These experimental findings not only offer new insights into the fundamental physics of emerging hidden multistability, but also unlock new avenues for applications in information storage, information encryption, and safety precaution, where multi-state dynamics could enable advanced control techniques.</description>

      <title>Fundamentals of Vacuum Breakdown in High-Field Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03967v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This review consolidates experimental, theoretical, and simulation work examining the behavior of high-field devices and the fundamental process of vacuum arc initiation, commonly referred to as breakdown. Detailed experimental observations and results relating to a wide range of aspects of high-field devices, including conditioning, field and temperature dependence of breakdown rate, and the ability to sustain high electric fields as a function of device geometry and materials, are presented. The different observations are then addressed theoretically, and with simulation, capturing the sequence of processes that lead to vacuum breakdown and explaining the major observed experimental dependencies. The core of the work described in this review was carried out by a broad multi-disciplinary collaboration in an over a decade-long program to develop high-gradient, 100 MV/m-range, accelerating structures for the CLIC project, a possible future linear-collider high-energy physics facility. Connections are made to the broader linear collider, high-field, and breakdown communities.</description>

      <title>Above room temperature multiferroic tunnel junction with the altermagnetic metal CrSb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13850v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Altermagnets with nonrelativistic momentum-dependent spin splitting and compensated net magnetic moments have recently garnered significant interest in spintronics, particularly as pinning layers in magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs). However, room temperature (RT) altermagnet-based MTJs with tunable tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) or electroresistance (TER) modulated by multiferroicity remain largely unexplored. Here, we propose an experimentally fabricable above-RT multiferroic MTJ, comprising an altermagnetic metal, ferroelectric barrier, and ferromagnetic metal-epitomized by a CrSb/In2Se3/Fe3GaTe2 heterostructure. Our calculations with first-principles and nonequilibrium Green function method indicate that the architecture enables magnetically switchable TER, electrically tunable TMR, and dual-mode controllable spin filtering. To disentangle the roles of ferroelectricity and the tunnel barrier, nonferroelectric Sb2Se3 and a vacuum gap are exploited as control cases. Remarkably, the system achieves TMR up to 2308%, TER of 707%, and near-perfect spin filtering efficiency. Both TMR and TER are considerable for CrSb/In2Se3/Fe3GaTe2 with either Cr or Sb interface. The transport performance is robust under bias voltage. These findings demonstrate the above-RT multiferroic altermagnet-based MTJs and highlight their exciting potential as a versatile platform for next-generation spin dynamics, magnetic sensing, and quantum logic nanodevices.</description>

      <title>Lithium and Vanadium Intercalation into Bilayer V2Se2O: Ferrimagnetic-Ferroelastic Multiferroics and Anomalous and Spin Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18531v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spin splitting in emerging altermagnets is non-relativistic and momentum-dependent, yet energy-independent, and localized in momentum space, posing challenges for practical applications. Here, we propose an intercalation-driven paradigm for altermagnets to attain ameliorative electronic structures, multiferroic characteristics, and anomalous and spin transport functionalities. As a representative system, we investigate electrochemistry- and self-intercalated V2Se2O bilayers, building on the recently reported room-temperature K- and Rb-intercalated V2Se2O family [Nat. Phys. 2025, 21, 754; Nat. Phys. 2025, 21, 760], utilizing density functional theory, Wannier function analyses, Monte Carlo simulations, and non-equilibrium Green function methods. Intercalation induces room-temperature intralayer ferrimagnetic and interlayer ferromagnetic order (358 K for Li-intercalation and 773 K for V-intercalation), ferroelasticity (~1 % signal intensity), in-plane uniaxial magnetic anisotropy, and metallization, while also modifying the anomalous Hall effect. Notably, Li- and V-intercalated V2Se2O bilayers exhibit enhanced spin splitting and half-metallic behavior, respectively, yielding near-perfect spin filtering efficiency. Intercalation substantially enhances spin transport in V2Se2O-based devices, enabling giant magnetoresistance (877 %), ultra-high thermal tunneling magnetoresistance (~12000 %), and observable spin Seebeck and temperature negative differential resistance effects. This intercalation-driven paradigm expands altermagnetic functionalities through multifunctional integration, offering promising avenues for advanced, miniaturized, room-temperature exploitation of anomalous, electron, and spin transport properties.</description>
