      <title>Learning to Optimize meets Neural-ODE: Real-Time, Stability-Constrained AC OPF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent developments in applying machine learning to address Alternating Current Optimal Power Flow (AC OPF) problems have demonstrated significant potential in providing close to optimal solutions for generator dispatch in near real-time. While these learning to optimize methods have demonstrated remarkable performance on steady-state operations, practical applications often demand compliance with dynamic constraints when used for fast-timescale optimization. This paper addresses this gap and develops a real-time stability-constrained OPF model (DynOPF-Net) that simultaneously addresses both optimality and dynamical stability within learning-assisted grid operations. The model is a unique integration of learning to optimize that learns a mapping from load conditions to OPF solutions, capturing the OPF's physical and engineering constraints, with Neural Ordinary Differential Equations, capturing generator dynamics, enabling the inclusion of a subset of stability constraints. Numerical results on the WSCC 9-bus and IEEE 57-bus benchmark systems demonstrate that DynOPF-Net can produce highly accurate AC-OPF solutions while also ensuring system stability, contrasting the unstable results obtained by state-of-the-art LtO methods.</description>

      <title>Collision Avoidance for Convex Primitives via Differentiable Optimization Based High-Order Control Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring the safety of dynamical systems is crucial, where collision avoidance is a primary concern. Recently, control barrier functions (CBFs) have emerged as an effective method to integrate safety constraints into control synthesis through optimization techniques. However, challenges persist when dealing with convex primitives and tasks requiring torque control, as well as the occurrence of unintended equilibria. This work addresses these challenges by introducing a high-order CBF (HOCBF) framework for collision avoidance among convex primitives. We transform nonconvex safety constraints into linear constraints by differentiable optimization and prove the high-order continuous differentiability. Then, we employ HOCBFs to accommodate torque control, enabling tasks involving forces or high dynamics. Additionally, we analyze the issue of spurious equilibria in high-order cases and propose a circulation mechanism to prevent the undesired equilibria on the boundary of the safe set. Finally, we validate our framework with three experiments on the Franka Research 3 robotic manipulator, demonstrating successful collision avoidance and the efficacy of the circulation mechanism.</description>

      <title>Cascading Failure Prediction via Causal Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Causal inference provides an analytical framework to identify and quantify cause-and-effect relationships among a network of interacting agents. This paper offers a novel framework for analyzing cascading failures in power transmission networks. This framework generates a directed latent graph in which the nodes represent the transmission lines and the directed edges encode the cause-effect relationships. This graph has a structure distinct from the system's topology, signifying the intricate fact that both local and non-local interdependencies exist among transmission lines, which are more general than only the local interdependencies that topological graphs can present. This paper formalizes a causal inference framework for predicting how an emerging anomaly propagates throughout the system. Using this framework, two algorithms are designed, providing an analytical framework to identify the most likely and most costly cascading scenarios. The framework's effectiveness is evaluated compared to the pertinent literature on the IEEE 14-bus, 39-bus, and 118-bus systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum optimization for Nonlinear Model Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) is a general and flexible control approach, used in many industrial contexts, and is based on the online solution of a nonlinear optimization problem. This operation requires in general a high computational cost, which may compromise the NMPC implementation in ``fast'' applications, especially if a large number variables is involved. To overcome this issue, we propose a quantum computing approach for the solution of the NMPC optimization problem. Assuming the availability of an efficient quantum computer, the approach has the potential to considerably decrease the computational time and/or enhance the solution quality compared to classical algorithms.</description>

      <title>Flexibility Options: A Proposed Product for Managing Imbalance Risk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The presence of variable renewable energy resources with uncertain outputs in day-ahead electricity markets results in additional balancing needs in real-time. Addressing those needs cost-effectively and reliably within a competitive market with unbundled products is challenging as both the demand for and the availability of flexibility depends on day-ahead energy schedules. Existing approaches for reserve procurement usually rely either on oversimplified demand curves that do not consider how system conditions that particular day affect the value of flexibility, or on bilateral trading of hedging instruments that are not co-optimized with day-ahead schedules. This article proposes a new product, `Flexibility Options', to address these two limitations. The demand for this product is endogenously determined in the day-ahead market and it is met cost-effectively by considering real-time supply curves for product providers, which are co-optimized with the energy supply. As we illustrate with numerical examples and mathematical analysis, the product addresses the hedging needs of participants with imbalances, provides a less intermittent revenue stream for participants with flexible outputs, promotes convergence between day-ahead and real-time energy prices, and ensures that the system operator is revenue-neutral. This article provides a comprehensive design that can be further tested and applied in large-scale systems.</description>

      <title>Sampling in Parametric and Nonparametric System Identification: Aliasing, Input Conditions, and Consistency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sampling rate of input and output signals is known to play a critical role in the identification and control of dynamical systems. For slow-sampled continuous-time systems that do not satisfy the Nyquist-Shannon sampling condition for perfect signal reconstructability, careful consideration is required when identifying parametric and nonparametric models. In this letter, a comprehensive statistical analysis of estimators under slow sampling is performed. Necessary and sufficient conditions are obtained for unbiased estimates of the frequency response function beyond the Nyquist frequency, and it is shown that consistency of parametric estimators can be achieved even if input frequencies overlap after aliasing. Monte Carlo simulations confirm the theoretical properties.</description>

      <title>Experimental implementation of an economic model predictive control for froth flotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the implementation of a novel economic model predictive control (E-MPC) strategy for froth flotation, the largest tonnage mineral separation process. A previously calibrated and validated dynamic model incorporating froth physics was used, which overcomes the limitations of previous simplified models reported in the literature. The E-MPC's optimal control problem was solved using full discretization with orthogonal collocation over finite elements, employing automatic differentiation via CasADi. This approach was applied in a 30-litre laboratory-scale flotation cell, significantly improving mineral recovery from 9% to 29% under feed flowrate disturbances while maintaining a minimum concentrate grade of 20%.</description>

      <title>Image-Based Visual Servoing for Enhanced Cooperation of Dual-Arm Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The cooperation of a pair of robot manipulators is required to manipulate a target object without any fixtures. The conventional control methods coordinate the end-effector pose of each manipulator with that of the other using their kinematics and joint coordinate measurements. Yet, the manipulators' inaccurate kinematics and joint coordinate measurements can cause significant pose synchronization errors in practice. This paper thus proposes an image-based visual servoing approach for enhancing the cooperation of a dual-arm manipulation system. On top of the classical control, the visual servoing controller lets each manipulator use its carried camera to measure the image features of the other's marker and adapt its end-effector pose with the counterpart on the move. Because visual measurements are robust to kinematic errors, the proposed control can reduce the end-effector pose synchronization errors and the fluctuations of the interaction forces of the pair of manipulators on the move. Theoretical analyses have rigorously proven the stability of the closed-loop system. Comparative experiments on real robots have substantiated the effectiveness of the proposed control.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Cascade: Juggling Vanilla Siteswap Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Being widespread in human motor behavior, dynamic movements demonstrate higher efficiency and greater capacity to address a broader range of skill domains compared to their quasi-static counterparts. Among the frequently studied dynamic manipulation problems, robotic juggling tasks stand out due to their inherent ability to scale their difficulty levels to arbitrary extents, making them an excellent subject for investigation. In this study, we explore juggling patterns with mixed throw heights, following the vanilla siteswap juggling notation, which jugglers widely adopted to describe toss juggling patterns. This requires extending our previous analysis of the simpler cascade juggling task by a throw-height sequence planner and further constraints on the end effector trajectory. These are not necessary for cascade patterns but are vital to achieving patterns with mixed throw heights. Using a simulated environment, we demonstrate successful juggling of most common 3-9 ball siteswap patterns up to 9 ball height, transitions between these patterns, and random sequences covering all possible vanilla siteswap patterns with throws between 2 and 9 ball height. https://kai-ploeger.com/beyond-cascades</description>

      <title>Equilibrium Adaptation-Based Control for Track Stand of Single-Track Two-Wheeled Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stationary balance control is challenging for single-track two-wheeled (STTW) robots due to the lack of elegant balancing mechanisms and the conflict between the limited attraction domain and external disturbances. To address the absence of balancing mechanisms, we draw inspiration from cyclists and leverage the track stand maneuver, which relies solely on steering and rear-wheel actuation. To achieve accurate tracking in the presence of matched and mismatched disturbances, we propose an equilibrium adaptation-based control (EABC) scheme that can be seamlessly integrated with standard disturbance observers and controllers. This scheme enables adaptation to slow-varying disturbances by utilizing a disturbed equilibrium estimator, effectively handling both matched and mismatched disturbances in a unified manner while ensuring accurate tracking with zero steady-state error. We integrate the EABC scheme with nonlinear model predictive control (MPC) for the track stand of STTW robots and validate its effectiveness through two experimental scenarios. Our method demonstrates significant improvements in tracking accuracy, reducing errors by several orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Perception, Control and Hardware for In-Hand Slip-Aware Object Manipulation with Parallel Grippers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dexterous in-hand manipulation offers significant potential to enhance robotic manipulator capabilities. This paper presents a comprehensive study on custom sensors and parallel gripper hardware specifically designed for in-hand slippage control. The gripper features rapid closed-loop, low-level force control, and is equipped with sensors capable of independently measuring contact forces and sliding velocities. Our system can quickly estimate essential object properties during pick-up using only in-hand sensing, without relying on prior object information. We introduce four distinct slippage controllers: gravity-assisted trajectory following for both rotational and linear slippage, a hinge controller that maintains the object's orientation while the gripper rotates, and a slip-avoidance controller. The system is mounted on a robot arm and validated through extensive experiments involving a diverse range of objects, demonstrating its novel capabilities.</description>

      <title>Age of Coded Updates In Gossip Networks Under Memory and Memoryless Schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider an information update system on a gossip network, where a source node encodes information into $n$ total keys such that any subset of at least $k+1$ keys can fully reconstruct the original information. This encoding process follows the principles of a $k$-out-of-$n$ threshold system. The encoded updates are then disseminated across the network through peer-to-peer communication. We have two different types of nodes in a network: subscriber nodes, which receive a unique key from the source node for every status update instantaneously, and nonsubscriber nodes, which receive a unique key for an update only if the node is selected by the source, and this selection is renewed for each update. For the message structure between nodes, we consider two different schemes: a memory scheme (in which the nodes keep the source's current and previous encrypted messages) and a memoryless scheme (in which the nodes are allowed to only keep the source's current message). We measure the timeliness of information updates by using a recent performance metric, the version age of information. We present explicit formulas for the time average AoI in a scalable homogeneous network as functions of the network parameters under a memoryless scheme. Additionally, we provide strict lower and upper bounds for the time average AoI under a memory scheme.</description>

      <title>Encrypted Dynamic Control exploiting Limited Number of Multiplications and a Method using RLWE-based Cryptosystem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.03451v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a method to encrypt dynamic controllers that can be implemented through most homomorphic encryption schemes, including somewhat, leveled fully, and fully homomorphic encryption. To this end, we represent the output of the given controller as a linear combination of a fixed number of previous inputs and outputs. As a result, the encrypted controller involves only a limited number of homomorphic multiplications on every encrypted data, assuming that the output is re-encrypted and transmitted back from the actuator. A guidance for parameter choice is also provided, ensuring that the encrypted controller achieves predefined performance for an infinite time horizon. Furthermore, we propose a customization of the method for Ring Learning With Errors (RLWE)-based cryptosystems, where a vector of messages can be encrypted into a single ciphertext and operated simultaneously, thus reducing computation and communication loads. Unlike previous results, the proposed customization does not require extra algorithms such as rotation, other than basic addition and multiplication. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Neural-Rendezvous: Provably Robust Guidance and Control to Encounter Interstellar Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.04883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.04883v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interstellar objects (ISOs) are likely representatives of primitive materials invaluable in understanding exoplanetary star systems. Due to their poorly constrained orbits with generally high inclinations and relative velocities, however, exploring ISOs with conventional human-in-the-loop approaches is significantly challenging. This paper presents Neural-Rendezvous -- a deep learning-based guidance and control framework for encountering fast-moving objects, including ISOs, robustly, accurately, and autonomously in real time. It uses pointwise minimum norm tracking control on top of a guidance policy modeled by a spectrally-normalized deep neural network, where its hyperparameters are tuned with a loss function directly penalizing the MPC state trajectory tracking error. We show that Neural-Rendezvous provides a high probability exponential bound on the expected spacecraft delivery error, the proof of which leverages stochastic incremental stability analysis. In particular, it is used to construct a non-negative function with a supermartingale property, explicitly accounting for the ISO state uncertainty and the local nature of nonlinear state estimation guarantees. In numerical simulations, Neural-Rendezvous is demonstrated to satisfy the expected error bound for 100 ISO candidates. This performance is also empirically validated using our spacecraft simulator and in high-conflict and distributed UAV swarm reconfiguration with up to 20 UAVs.</description>

Abstract: This paper studies a system security problem in the context of observability based on a two-person non-cooperative infinitely repeated game. Both the attacker and the defender have means to modify the dimension of the unobservable subspace, which is set as the value function. Utilizing tools from geometric control, we construct the best response sets considering one-step and two-step optimality respectively to maximize or minimize the value function. We find that the best response sets are not single-valued maps, resulting in a variety of game outcomes. In addition, we establish a necessary and sufficient condition for Nash equilibrium. The game analysis reveals that the defender plays a pivotal role in steering the game towards equilibrium, while the attacker can disrupt the equilibrium by sacrificing immediate gains.</description>

      <title>Safe Legged Locomotion using Collision Cone Control Barrier Functions (C3BFs)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01898</link>

Abstract: Legged robots exhibit significant potential across diverse applications, including but not limited to hazardous environment search and rescue missions and the exploration of unexplored regions both on Earth and in outer space. However, the successful navigation of these robots in dynamic environments heavily hinges on the implementation of efficient collision avoidance techniques. In this research paper, we employ Collision Cone Control Barrier Functions (C3BF) to ensure the secure movement of legged robots within environments featuring a wide array of static and dynamic obstacles. We introduce the Quadratic Program (QP) formulation of C3BF, referred to as C3BF-QP, which serves as a protective filter layer atop a reference controller to ensure the robots' safety during operation. The effectiveness of this approach is illustrated through simulations conducted on PyBullet.</description>

      <title>Decision-Making Frameworks for Network Resilience -- Managing and Mitigating Systemic (Cyber) Risk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13884v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a decision-making framework tailored for the management of systemic risk in networks. This framework is constructed upon three fundamental components: (1) a set of acceptable network configurations, (2) a set of interventions aimed at risk mitigation, and (3) a cost function quantifying the expenses associated with these interventions. While our discussion primarily revolves around the management of systemic cyber risks in digital networks, we concurrently draw parallels to risk management of other complex systems where analogous approaches may be adequate.</description>

      <title>Smooth Information Gathering in Two-Player Noncooperative Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00733v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a mathematical framework for modeling two-player noncooperative games in which one player is uncertain of the other player's costs but can preemptively allocate information-gathering resources to reduce this uncertainty. We refer to the players as the uncertain player (UP) and the certain player (CP), respectively. We obtain UP's decisions by solving a two-stage problem where, in Stage 1, UP allocates information-gathering resources that smoothly transform the information structure in the second stage. Then, in Stage 2, a signal (that is, a function of the Stage 1 allocation) informs UP about CP's costs, and both players execute strategies which depend upon the signal's value. This framework allows for a smooth resource allocation, in contrast to existing literature on the topic. We also identify conditions under which the gradient of UP's overall cost with respect to the information-gathering resources is well-defined. Then we provide a gradient-based algorithm to solve the two-stage game. Finally, we apply our framework to a tower-defense game which can be interpreted as a variant of a Colonel Blotto game with smooth payoff functions and uncertainty over battlefield valuations. We include an analysis of how optimal decisions shift with changes in information-gathering allocations and perturbations in the cost functions.</description>

      <title>Design Space Exploration of Embedded SoC Architectures for Real-Time Optimal Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12142v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Empowering resource-limited robots to execute computationally intensive tasks such as locomotion and manipulation is challenging. This project provides a comprehensive design space exploration to determine optimal hardware computation architectures suitable for model-based control algorithms. We profile and optimize representative architectural designs across general-purpose scalar, vector processors, and specialized accelerators. Specifically, we compare CPUs, vector machines, and domain-specialized accelerators with kernel-level benchmarks and end-to-end representative robotic workloads. Our exploration provides a quantitative performance, area, and utilization comparison and analyzes the trade-offs between these representative distinct architectural designs. We demonstrate that architectural modifications, software, and system optimization can alleviate bottlenecks and enhance utilization. Finally, we propose a code generation flow to simplify the engineering work for mapping robotic workloads to specialized architectures.</description>

      <title>DistRL: An Asynchronous Distributed Reinforcement Learning Framework for On-Device Control Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14803v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: On-device control agents, especially on mobile devices, are responsible for operating mobile devices to fulfill users' requests, enabling seamless and intuitive interactions. Integrating Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) into these agents enhances their ability to understand and execute complex commands, thereby improving user experience. However, fine-tuning MLLMs for on-device control presents significant challenges due to limited data availability and inefficient online training processes. This paper introduces DistRL, a novel framework designed to enhance the efficiency of online RL fine-tuning for mobile device control agents. DistRL employs centralized training and decentralized data acquisition to ensure efficient fine-tuning in the context of dynamic online interactions. Additionally, the framework is backed by our tailor-made RL algorithm, which effectively balances exploration with the prioritized utilization of collected data to ensure stable and robust training. Our experiments show that, on average, DistRL delivers a 3X improvement in training efficiency and enables training data collection 2.4X faster than the leading synchronous multi-machine methods. Notably, after training, DistRL achieves a 20% relative improvement in success rate compared to state-of-the-art methods on general Android tasks from an open benchmark, significantly outperforming existing approaches while maintaining the same training time. These results validate DistRL as a scalable and efficient solution, offering substantial improvements in both training efficiency and agent performance for real-world, in-the-wild device control tasks.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Upper Confidence Bounds for Constrained Online Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17216v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem is a foundational framework in sequential decision-making under uncertainty, extensively studied for its applications in areas such as clinical trials, online advertising, and resource allocation. Traditional MAB formulations, however, do not adequately capture scenarios where decisions are structured hierarchically, involve multi-level constraints, or feature context-dependent action spaces. In this paper, we introduce the hierarchical constrained bandits (HCB) framework, which extends the contextual bandit problem to incorporate hierarchical decision structures and multi-level constraints. We propose the hierarchical constrained upper confidence bound (HC-UCB) algorithm, designed to address the complexities of the HCB problem by leveraging confidence bounds within a hierarchical setting. Our theoretical analysis establishes sublinear regret bounds for HC-UCB and provides high-probability guarantees for constraint satisfaction at all hierarchical levels. Furthermore, we derive a minimax lower bound on the regret for the HCB problem, demonstrating the near-optimality of our algorithm. The results are significant for real-world applications where decision-making processes are inherently hierarchical and constrained, offering a robust and efficient solution that balances exploration and exploitation across multiple levels of decision-making.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning Controllers for Soft Robots using Learned Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18519v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Soft robotic manipulators offer operational advantage due to their compliant and deformable structures. However, their inherently nonlinear dynamics presents substantial challenges. Traditional analytical methods often depend on simplifying assumptions, while learning-based techniques can be computationally demanding and limit the control policies to existing data. This paper introduces a novel approach to soft robotic control, leveraging state-of-the-art policy gradient methods within parallelizable synthetic environments learned from data. We also propose a safety oriented actuation space exploration protocol via cascaded updates and weighted randomness. Specifically, our recurrent forward dynamics model is learned by generating a training dataset from a physically safe \textit{mean reverting} random walk in actuation space to explore the partially-observed state-space. We demonstrate a reinforcement learning approach towards closed-loop control through state-of-the-art actor-critic methods, which efficiently learn high-performance behaviour over long horizons. This approach removes the need for any knowledge regarding the robot's operation or capabilities and sets the stage for a comprehensive benchmarking tool in soft robotics control.</description>
