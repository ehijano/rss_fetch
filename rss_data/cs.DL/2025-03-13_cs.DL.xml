      <title>Domination in Graph Theory: A Bibliometric Analysis of Research Trends, Collaboration and Citation Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study conducts a comprehensive bibliometric analysis of research on domination in graph theory from 1961 to 2024, based on Scopus-indexed publications retrieved using the query (dominating OR domination) AND graph. The analysis examines publication trends, key contributors, collaboration patterns, citation impact, and emerging research themes. Results indicate a significant and sustained increase in research output, particularly in recent decades. Henning, M.A., Hedetniemi, S.T., and Haynes, T.W. are identified as the most highly cited researchers, underscoring their foundational contributions to the field. Co-authorship network analysis reveals strong international collaborations, with Sheikhholeslami, S.M. exhibiting the highest total link strength, while the United States emerges as the leading hub for global research partnerships. Keyword co-occurrence analysis identifies four major research clusters: graph algorithms, graph-theoretic foundations, domination variants, and binary graph operations. Notably, recent studies increasingly focus on how domination properties evolve under different graph operations. Citation network analysis confirms the enduring influence of foundational studies while highlighting a shift towards computational and applied methodologies. These findings highlight the transition from theoretical to applied research, emphasizing the role of advanced algorithms, interdisciplinary approaches, and large-scale computational techniques. Future research directions should explore machine learning-based optimization, domination in evolving networks, and applications in cybersecurity, bioinformatics, and large-scale social networks.</description>

      <title>DeepInnovation AI: A Global Dataset Mapping the AI innovation from Academic Research to Industrial Patents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09257v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of artificial intelligence (AI), mapping innovation patterns and understanding effective technology transfer from research to applications are essential for economic growth. However, existing data infrastructures suffer from fragmentation, incomplete coverage, and insufficient evaluative capacity. Here, we present DeepInnovationAI, a comprehensive global dataset containing three structured files. DeepPatentAI.csv: Contains 2,356,204 patent records with 8 field-specific attributes. DeepDiveAI.csv: Encompasses 3,511,929 academic publications with 13 metadata fields. These two datasets leverage large language models, multilingual text analysis and dual-layer BERT classifiers to accurately identify AI-related content, while utilizing hypergraph analysis to create robust innovation metrics. Additionally, DeepCosineAI.csv: By applying semantic vector proximity analysis, this file presents approximately one hundred million calculated paper-patent similarity pairs to enhance understanding of how theoretical advancements translate into commercial technologies. DeepInnovationAI enables researchers, policymakers, and industry leaders to anticipate trends and identify collaboration opportunities. With extensive temporal and geographical scope, it supports detailed analysis of technological development patterns and international competition dynamics, establishing a foundation for modeling AI innovation and technology transfer processes.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Spoken Italian Datasets and Corpora</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06557v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spoken language datasets are vital for advancing linguistic research, Natural Language Processing, and speech technology. However, resources dedicated to Italian, a linguistically rich and diverse Romance language, remain underexplored compared to major languages like English or Mandarin. This survey provides a comprehensive analysis of 66 spoken Italian datasets, highlighting their characteristics, methodologies, and applications. The datasets are categorized by speech type, source and context, and demographic and linguistic features, with a focus on their utility in fields such as Automatic Speech Recognition, emotion detection, and education. Challenges related to dataset scarcity, representativeness, and accessibility are discussed alongside recommendations for enhancing dataset creation and utilization. The full dataset inventory is publicly accessible via GitHub and archived on Zenodo, serving as a valuable resource for researchers and developers. By addressing current gaps and proposing future directions, this work aims to support the advancement of Italian speech technologies and linguistic research.</description>
