      <title>Coassociative structures on self-injective algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For general finite-dimensional self-injective algebra $A$ we construct a family of injective coassociative coproducts $A\to A\otimes A$, all $A$-bimodule morphisms. In particular such structures always exist, confirming a conjecture of Hernandez, Walton and Yadav. The coproducts are indexed by subsets of $\{1,\cdots,m(i)\}\times \{1,\cdots,m(\nu^{-1}i)\}$, where $A\cong \mathrm{End}_{\Lambda}(M)$ is the general form of a self-injective algebra in terms of a basic Frobenius $\Lambda$, the $m(i)$, $1\le i\le n$ are the multiplicities of the indecomposable projective $\Lambda$-modules in $M$, and $\nu$ is the Nakayama permutation of $\Lambda$. We also characterize those among the coproducts introduced in this fashion, in terms this combinatorial data, which are counital.</description>

      <title>Braided dynamical groups, the dynamical Yang-Baxter equation and related structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of a braided dynamical group which is a matched pair of dynamical groups satisfying extra conditions. It is shown to give a solution of the dynamical Yang-Baxter equation and at the same time a braided groupoid, thereby integrating the approaches of Andruskiewitsch and Matsumoto-Shimizu respectively that use these two notions to produce quiver-theoretical solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation. We pursue this connection further by relative Rota-Baxter operators on dynamical groups, which give rise to matched pairs of dynamical groups. As the derived structures of relative Rota-Baxter operators on dynamical groups, dynamical post-groups are introduced and are shown to be equivalent to braided dynamical groups. Finally, skew-braces are generalized to dynamical skew-braces as another equivalent notion of braided dynamical groups.</description>

      <title>The Deligne-Simpson Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11998v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given k similarity classes of invertible matrices, the Deligne-Simpson problem asks to determine whether or not one can find matrices in these classes whose product is the identity and with no common invariant subspace. The first author conjectured an answer in terms of an associated root system, and proved one implication in joint work with Shaw. In this paper we prove the other implication, thus confirming the conjecture.</description>

      <title>Existence of integral Hopf orders in twists of group algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.00097v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We find a group-theoretical condition under which a twist of a group algebra, in Movshev's way, admits an integral Hopf order. Let $K$ be a (large enough) number field with ring of integers $R$. Let $G$ be a finite group and $M$ an abelian subgroup of $G$ of central type. Consider the twist $J$ for $K\hspace{-0.8pt}G$ afforded by a non-degenerate $2$-cocycle on the character group $\widehat{M}$. We show that if there is a Lagrangian decomposition $\widehat{M} \simeq L \times \widehat{L}$ such that $L$ is contained in a normal abelian subgroup $N$ of $G$, then the twisted group algebra $(K\hspace{-0.8pt}G)_J$ admits a Hopf order $X$ over $R$. The Hopf order $X$ is constructed as the $R$-submodule generated by the primitive idempotents of $K\hspace{-1.1pt}N$ and the elements of $G$. It is indeed a Hopf order of $K\hspace{-0.8pt}G$ such that $J^{\pm 1} \in X \otimes_R X$. Furthermore, we give some criteria for this Hopf order to be unique. We illustrate this construction with several families of examples. As an application, we provide a further example of simple and semisimple complex Hopf algebra that does not admit integral Hopf orders.</description>

      <title>Pentagram maps over rings, Grassmannians, and skewers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06122v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The pentagram map is a discrete dynamical system on planar polygons. By definition, the image of a polygon $P$ under the pentagram map is the polygon $P'$ whose vertices are the intersection points of consecutive shortest diagonals of $P$. The pentagram map was introduced by R. Schwartz in 1992, and is now one of the most renowned discrete integrable systems. Several authors proposed generalizations of the pentagram map to other geometries, in particular to Grassmannians, where the role of points and lines is played by higher-dimensional subspaces, as well to skewer geometry, where both points and lines are affine lines in the three-dimensional Euclidean space. In the present paper, we develop a common framework for these kinds of generalizations. Specifically, we show that those maps can be viewed as pentagram maps in the projective plane over an appropriate ring. In general, those rings need not be division rings or commutative. We show that the Grassmannian pentagram map corresponds to the ring of matrices, while the skewer map is the pentagram map over the ring of dual numbers. Furthermore, we prove that the pentagram map remains integrable for any stably finite ground ring $R$.</description>

      <title>Formalizing Mason-Stothers Theorem and its Corollaries in Lean 4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15180v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ABC conjecture implies many conjectures and theorems in number theory, including the celebrated Fermat's Last Theorem. Mason-Stothers Theorem is a function field analogue of the ABC conjecture that admits a much more elementary proof with many interesting consequences, including a polynomial version of Fermat's Last Theorem. While years of dedicated effort are expected for a full formalization of Fermat's Last Theorem, the simple proof of Mason-Stothers Theorem and its corollaries calls for an immediate formalization.
  We formalize an elementary proof by Snyder in Lean 4, and also formalize many consequences of Mason-Stothers, including nonsolvability of Fermat-Cartan equations in polynomials, nonparametrizability of a certain elliptic curve, and Davenport's Theorem. We compare our work to existing formalizations of the Mason-Stothers by Eberl in Isabelle and Wagemaker in Lean 3 respectively. Our formalization has been integrated into the mathlib library of Lean 4.</description>

      <title>Friezes from surfaces and Farey triangulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13511v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a classification of positive integral friezes on marked bordered surfaces in the style of Conway and Coxeter. More precisely, we prove that positive integral friezes are in one-to-one correspondence with ideal triangulations supplied with a collection of rescaling constants assigned to punctures. For every triangulation the set of the collections of constants is finite and is completely determined by the valencies of vertices in the triangulation. In particular, it follows that the number of non-equivalent friezes on bordered surfaces is finite, and all friezes on unpunctured surfaces are unitary.</description>

      <title>When algebra twinks system biology: a conjecture on the structure of Gr\"obner bases in complex chemical reaction networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12233v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the challenge of identifying all real positive steady states in chemical reaction networks (CRNs) governed by mass-action kinetics. Traditional numerical methods often require specific initial guesses and may fail to find all the solutions in systems exhibiting multistability. Gr\"obner bases offer an algebraic framework that systematically transforms polynomial equations into simpler forms, facilitating comprehensive solution enumeration. In this work, we propose a conjecture that CRNs with at most pairwise interactions yield Gr\"obner bases possessing a near-"triangular" structure, under appropriate assumptions. We illustrate this phenomenon using examples from a gene regulatory network and the Wnt signaling pathway, where the Gr\"obner basis approach reliably captures all real positive solutions. Our computational experiments reveal the potential of Gr\"obner bases to overcome limitations of local numerical methods for finding the steady states of complex biological systems, making them a powerful tool for understanding dynamical processes across diverse biochemical models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02691v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the behavior of the Gorenstein weak global dimension under a cleft extension of rings; we prove that under some mild conditons the finiteness of the Gorenstein weak global dimension is invariant. Moreover, we compare the relative singularity categories with respect to flat-cotorsion modules under a cleft extension of rings. Some applications to {\theta}-extensions and Morita context rings are given.</description>
