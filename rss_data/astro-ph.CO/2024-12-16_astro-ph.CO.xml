      <title>Revisiting the Intergalactic Medium Around GRB 130606A and Constraints on the Epoch of Reionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are excellent probes of the high-redshift Universe due to their high luminosities and the relatively simple intrinsic spectra of their afterglows. They can be used to estimate the fraction of neutral hydrogen (i.e., neutral fraction) in the intergalactic medium at different redshifts through the examination of their Lyman-alpha damping wing with high quality optical-to-near-infrared spectra. Neutral fraction estimates can help trace the evolution of the Epoch of Reionization, a key era of cosmological history in which the intergalactic medium underwent a phase change from neutral to ionized. We revisit GRB 130606A, a z ~ 5.9 GRB for which multiple analyses, using the same damping wing model and data from different telescopes, found conflicting neutral fraction results. We identify the source of the discrepant results to be differences in assumptions for key damping wing model parameters and data range selections. We perform a new analysis implementing multiple GRB damping wing models and find a 3-sigma neutral fraction upper limit ranging from xHI &lt; 0.20 to xHI &lt; 0.23. We present this result in the context of other neutral fraction estimates and Epoch of Reionization models, discuss the impact of relying on individual GRB lines of sight, and highlight the need for more high-redshift GRBs to effectively constrain the progression of the Epoch of Reionization.</description>

      <title>The Three Hundred Project: The relationship between the shock and splashback radii of simulated galaxy clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations of the intracluster medium (ICM) in the outskirts of galaxy clusters reveal shocks associated with gas accretion from the cosmic web. Previous work based on non-radiative cosmological hydrodynamical simulations have defined the shock radius, $r_\text{shock}$, using the ICM entropy, $K \propto T/{n_\mathrm{e}}^{2/3}$, where $T$ and $n_\text{e}$ are the ICM temperature and electron density respectively; the $r_\text{shock}$ is identified with either the radius at which $K$ is a maximum or at which its logarithmic slope is a minimum. We investigate the relationship between $r_\text{shock}$, which is driven by gravitational hydrodynamics and shocks, and the splashback radius, $r_\text{splash}$, which is driven by the gravitational dynamics of cluster stars and dark matter and is measured from their mass profile. Using 324 clusters from {\small The Three Hundred} project of cosmological galaxy formation simulations, we quantify statistically how $r_\text{shock}$ relates to $r_\text{splash}$. Depending on our definition, we find that the median $r_\text{shock} \simeq 1.38 r_\text{splash} (2.58 R_{200})$ when $K$ reaches its maximum and $r_\text{shock} \simeq 1.91 r_\text{splash} (3.54 R_{200})$ when its logarithmic slope is a minimum; the best-fit linear relation increases as $r_\text{shock} \propto 0.65 r_\text{splash}$. We find that $r_\text{shock}/R_{200}$ and $r_\text{splash}/R_{200}$ anti-correlate with virial mass, $M_{200}$, and recent mass accretion history, and $r_\text{shock}/r_\text{splash}$ tends to be larger for clusters with higher recent accretion rates. We discuss prospects for measuring $r_\text{shock}$ observationally and how the relationship between $r_\text{shock}$ and $r_\text{splash}$ can be used to improve constraints from radio, X-ray, and thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich surveys that target the interface between the cosmic web and clusters.</description>

      <title>Deciphering the Soliton-Halo Relation in Fuzzy Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soliton cores at the center of fuzzy dark matter (FDM) halos provide a promising way to distinguish FDM from other dark matter models. However, the relation between solitons and their host halos remains contentious. Here, we rigorously examine this soliton-halo relation (SHR) using a rich set of cosmological simulations across various FDM particle masses, halo masses, and redshifts. We explicitly demonstrate thermal equilibrium between solitons and surrounding halo granules, energy equipartition within halos, and an FDM concentration-mass-nonisothermality relation. For each FDM halo, we confirm that its density profile outside the central soliton matches a collisionless N-body simulation from the same initial condition, serving as stringent numerical convergence tests. Our refined SHR agrees well with virialized halos in simulations, with a $1\sigma$ deviation of less than $30\%$. These findings not only reaffirm the SHR proposed by Schive et al. (2014) but also offer a more comprehensive understanding that extends its applicability. The simulation code GAMER is accessible at https://github.com/gamer-project/gamer. A Python script for computing the theoretical SHR is available at https://github.com/calab-ntu/fdm-soliton-halo-relation.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing the Thermal Sunyaev Zeldovich Power Spectrum from Planck using the ABS Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study employs a novel approach for reconstructing the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich (tSZ) effect power spectrum from Planck data using the Analytical Blind Separation (ABS) method. The ABS method improves the recovery of weak signals, by applying eigenmode exclusion for low signal-to-noise ratio regimes and introducing a shift parameter to stabilize calculations. Validation through simulated Planck data demonstrates the robustness of ABS in reconstructing the tSZ power spectrum, even under challenging conditions. In the analysis of the Planck PR3 full-mission data, ABS shows lower amplitudes at $\ell \gtrsim 300$ compared to the Planck 2015 band powers using the MILCA and NILC foreground cleaning methods. After marginalizing over residual foreground components, the ABS analysis finds the overall tSZ power spectrum amplitude to be 20\% lower than the Planck best-fit one, suggesting a smaller $S_8$. At $\ell \simeq 200$, the tSZ band power is $10^{12} \ell(\ell+1)C^{yy}_\ell/(2\pi) = 0.126\pm 0.018$, largely independent of the tSZ model choice. These findings highlight the potential of the ABS method as a promising alternative for tSZ power spectrum analysis, offering a robust and independent means of extracting cosmological parameters.</description>

      <title>Constraints on primordial non-Gaussianity from the cross-correlation of DESI Luminous Red Galaxies and $Planck$ CMB lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the angular cross-correlation between a Luminous Red Galaxy (LRG) sample from the DR9 DESI Legacy Survey and the $Planck$ PR4 CMB lensing maps to constrain the local primordial non-Gaussianity parameter $f_{\rm NL}$ using the scale-dependent galaxy bias effect. The galaxy sample covers $\sim$ 40% of the sky and contains galaxies up to $z \sim 1.4$, and is calibrated with the LRG spectra that have been observed for the DESI Survey Validation. We apply a nonlinear imaging systematics treatment based on neural networks to remove observational effects that could potentially bias the $f_{\rm NL}$ measurement. Our measurement is performed without blinding, but the full analysis pipeline is tested with simulations including systematics. Using the two-point angular cross-correlation between LRG and CMB lensing only ($C_\ell^{\kappa G}$) we find $f_{\rm NL} = 39_{-38}^{+40}$ at 68% confidence level, and our result is robust in terms of systematics and cosmology assumptions. If we combine this information with the autocorrelation of LRG ($C_\ell^{GG}$) applying a $\ell_{\rm min}$ scale cut to limit the impact of systematics, we find $f_{\rm NL} = 24_{-21}^{+20}$ at 68% confidence level. Our results motivate the use of CMB lensing cross-correlations for measuring $f_{\rm NL}$ with future datasets given its stability in terms of observational systematics compared to the angular auto-correlation.</description>

      <title>Simulation-based inference on warm dark matter from HERA forecasts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The redshifted 21cm signal from Cosmic Dawn promises to open a new window into the early history of our universe and enable the probing of an unprecedented comoving survey volume. In this work, we revisit the imprint of Warm Dark Matter (WDM) on the 21cm signal power spectrum using an updated implementation of the WDM effect in the public code $\texttt{21cmFast}$ and considering a single population of cosmic dawn galaxies. By focusing on inferring the WDM mass, we analyze the degeneracies between the latter and the astrophysics parameters characterizing star formation and X-ray heating and we emphasize the role of the threshold mass for star-forming galaxies, $M_{\rm turn}$. We study the capability of the recently built HERA telescope to reconstruct the WDM mass by adopting the statistical approach of simulation-based inference. We include a comparison of the per-parameter reconstruction quality for different number of simulations used in the training of the algorithm. Our results indicate that HERA could surpass current Lyman-$\alpha$ forest constraints if Cosmic Dawn galaxies exhibit a threshold mass $M_{\rm turn}\lesssim 10^{8}\, M_\odot$. The X-ray source properties considered in this study may also influence the strength of the WDM constraint for lower threshold masses.</description>

      <title>Black holes and gravitational waves from phase transitions in realistic models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study realistic models predicting primordial black hole (PBH) formation from density fluctuations generated in a first-order phase transition. We show that the second-order correction in the expansion of the bubble nucleation rate is necessary for accurate predictions and quantify its impact on the abundance of PBHs and gravitational waves (GWs). We find that the distribution of the fluctuations becomes more Gaussian as the second-order term increases. Consequently, models that predict the same PBH abundances can produce different GW spectra.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Considering inflationary magnetogenesis induced by time-dependent kinetic and axial couplings of a massless Abelian vector boson field breaking the conformal invariance we show in this Letter that, surprisingly, the spectral shape of the primordial magnetic field power spectrum is insensitive to the post-inflationary history, namely the barotropic parameter ($w$) and the gauge coupling functions of the post-inflationary era.</description>

      <title>Constraining inflation with nonminimal derivative coupling with the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array third data release</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study an inflation model with nonminimal derivative coupling that features a coupling between the derivative of the inflaton field and the Einstein tensor. This model naturally amplifies curvature perturbations at small scales via gravitationally enhanced friction, a mechanism critical for the formation of primordial black holes and the associated production of potentially detectable scalar-induced gravitational waves. We derive analytical expressions for the primordial power spectrum, enabling efficient exploration of the model parameter space without requiring computationally intensive numerical solutions of the Mukhanov-Sasaki equation. Using the third data release of the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array (PPTA DR3), we constrain the model parameters characterizing the coupling function: $\phi_c = 3.7^{+0.3}_{-0.5} M_\mathrm{P}$, $\log_{10} \omega_L = 7.1^{+0.6}_{-0.3}$, and $\log_{10} \sigma = -8.3^{+0.3}_{-0.6}$ at 90\% confidence level. Our results demonstrate the growing capability of pulsar timing arrays to probe early Universe physics, complementing traditional cosmic microwave background observations by providing unique constraints on inflationary dynamics at small scales.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the detection of boosted dark matter in a two component dark matter model with the hidden gauge $U(1)_D$ symmetry. The model introduces heavy and light fermionic dark matter components, where the heavy dark matter annihilation in the Galactic center boosts the light dark matter. Directional direct detection experiments, such as NEWSdm, are suitable for testing the boosted scenario by focusing on signals from the Galactic center. We found that the expected event rate could reach up to O(10) events per year per 5 kg of the detector material.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Dark Matter Disc Model in Dwarf Galaxies: Insights from the LITTLE THINGS Sample</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We conducted an analysis of the velocity field of dwarf galaxies in the LITTLE THINGS sample, focusing on deriving 2D velocity maps that encompass both the transverse and radial velocity fields. Within the range of radial distances where velocity anisotropies are sufficiently small for the disc to be considered rotationally supported, and where the warped geometry of the disc can be neglected, we reconstructed the rotation curve while taking into account the effect of the asymmetric drift. To fit the rotation curves, we employed the standard halo model and the dark matter disc (DMD) model, which assumes that dark matter is primarily confined to the galactic discs and can be traced by the distribution of \HI{}. Interestingly, our analysis revealed that the fits from the DMD model are statistically comparable to those obtained using the standard halo model, but the inferred masses of the galaxies in the DMD model are approximately 10 to 100 times smaller than the masses inferred in the standard halo model. In the DMD model, the inner slope of the rotation curve is directly related to a linear combination of the surface density profiles of the stellar and gas components, which generally exhibit a flat core. Consequently, the observation of a linear relationship between the rotation curve and the radius in the disc central regions is consistent with the framework of the DMD model.</description>

      <title>Direct Images of the Cosmic Web of Intergalactic and Circumgalactic Gas in the Distant Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most of the baryonic matter of the Universe resides in a highly-ionized gaseous intergalactic medium. This gas flows along dark-matter filaments toward galaxy superclusters, clusters, and groups until it pools around the galaxies into a circumgalactic medium. Eventually, the gas settles into the interstellar medium of the galaxies, where it fuels the successive generations of star formation that ultimately produce the stars and heavy elements that make up galaxies today. The gas has been studied for decades using absorption lines produced by Hydrogen and various ions of heavy elements in the spectra of background quasi-stellar objects (QSOs). But directly imaging the extremely faint glow of this "cosmic web" of intergalactic and circumgalactic gas has remained an elusive goal of observational cosmology. Some recent progress has been made by using imaging spectrographs to record high-redshift Ly$\alpha$ emission, although over only very narrow fields of view. Here we report direct images of intergalactic and circumgalactic gas in the distant Universe obtained using the Condor Array Telescope that we purposely built to reach extremely low-surface-brightness sensitivities over very wide fields of view. We show that these images directly detect and characterize the imprint of Ly$\alpha$ emission from the cosmic web at an overwhelming statistical significance. By stacking portions of the images centered on tens of thousands of galaxies of known redshift, we show that they also reveal extremely faint emission from H$^0$, C$^{3+}$, and Mg$^+$ and absorption from cosmic dust in the tenuous outskirts of the galaxies. Our results demonstrate that sensitive imaging observations can now detect and characterize emission (and absorption) from the cosmic web of intergalactic and circumgalactic gas (and dust).</description>

      <title>QCD Axion Dark Matter from level crossing with refined adiabatic condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the level-crossing phenomenon in two-axion systems, where the mass eigenvalues intersect as the mass of one axion increases with the cooling of the universe. This phenomenon can significantly alter the abundance of axions in the early universe. Our study focuses on its impact on the QCD axion and an axion-like particle, identifying viable regions of axion mass and decay constant that explain the observed dark matter. We demonstrate the equivalence of two different bases for describing the axion system in the existing literature. Furthermore, we derive an improved expression for the adiabatic condition that overcomes limitations in earlier formulations. This new formulation is basis-independent, and we numerically validate its effectiveness. Our analysis reveals specific relations between axion masses and axion-photon couplings within the viable region. These relations could potentially serve as a smoking gun signal for this scenario if confirmed experimentally. We also find that, using the chiral perturbation model, the thermal friction on the QCD axion might be significantly larger than previously estimated. Additionally, we show that a simple model with axion mixing can naturally realize either a heavier or lighter QCD axion.</description>

      <title>The distribution of Bayes' ratio</title>

Abstract: The ratio of Bayesian evidences is a popular tool in cosmology to compare different models. There are however several issues with this method: Bayes' ratio depends on the prior even in the limit of non-informative priors, and Jeffrey's scale, used to assess the test, is arbitrary. Moreover, the standard use of Bayes' ratio is often criticized for being unable to reject models. In this paper, we address these shortcoming by promoting evidences and evidence ratios to frequentist statistics and deriving their sampling distributions. By comparing the evidence ratios to their sampling distributions, poor fitting models can now be rejected. Our method additionally does not depend on the prior in the limit of very weak priors, thereby safeguarding the experimenter against premature rejection of a theory with a uninformative prior, and replaces the arbitrary Jeffrey's scale by probability thresholds for rejection. We provide analytical solutions for some simplified cases (Gaussian data, linear parameters, and nested models), and we apply the method to cosmological supernovae Ia data. We dub our method the FB method, for Frequentist-Bayesian.</description>

      <title>Updating neutrino mass constraints with Background measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03368v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low-redshift probes, such as Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) and Supernovae Ia luminosity distances, have been shown to be crucial for improving the bounds on the total neutrino mass from cosmological observations, due to their ability to break degeneracies among the different parameters. Here, we expand background observations to include $H(z)$ measurements from cosmic chronometers, distance moduli from Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs), and angular diameter distances from galaxy clusters. For the very first time, we find neutrino mass limits below the minimal expectations from neutrino oscillation probes, suggesting non-standard neutrino and/or cosmological scenarios. The tightening of the neutrino mass bound is due to the slightly higher value of the Hubble constant $H_0$ preferred by the former three background probes, and also due to the improved errors on $H_0$ and the matter mass-energy density $\Omega_{\rm m}$. All values of $H_0$ are however in agreement at the $1-2\sigma$ level. Interestingly, it is not only the combination of the three background probes that is responsible for the $\sum m_\nu &lt;0.06$~eV limits, but also each of them independently. The tightest bound we find here is $\sum m_\nu&lt;0.043$~eV at $2\sigma$ after combining Cosmic Microwave Background Planck data with DESI BAO, Supernovae Ia, GRBs, cosmic chronometers, and galaxy clusters, showing a clear tension between neutrino oscillation results and cosmological analyses. In general, removing either one of the two background probes still provides a limit $\sum m_\nu \lesssim 0.06$~eV, reassuring the enormous potential of these low-redshift observations in constraining the neutrino mass.</description>

      <title>First Constraints on a Pixelated Universe in Light of DESI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04408v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pixelated dark energy is a string theory scenario with a quantum mechanically stable cosmological constant. The number of pixels that make up the universe slowly increases, manifesting as a time-dependent source of dark energy. DESI has recently reported evidence for dynamical dark energy that fits within this framework. In light of this, we perform the first cosmological analysis of the pixelated model. We find that the simplest model where the pixel growth rate is constant is able to accommodate the data, providing a marginally better fit than $\Lambda$CDM; and we show that models where the pixel growth rate is increasing and of order the Hubble constant today could provide better fits. Our analysis helps to clarify the features of UV constructions of dark energy necessary to accommodate the data.</description>

      <title>Eccentricity effects on the supermassive black hole gravitational wave background</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05125v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We studied how eccentricity affects the gravitational wave (GW) spectrum from supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries. We developed a fast and accurate semi-analytic method for computing the GW spectra, the distribution for the spectral fluctuations and the correlations between different frequencies. As GW emission circularizes binaries, the suppression of the signal strength due to eccentricity is relevant for signals from wider binaries emitting at lower frequencies. Such a feature is present in the signal observed at pulsar timing arrays. We found that when orbital decay of the SMBH binaries is driven by GWs only, the shape of the observed signal preferred highly eccentric binaries $\langle e \rangle_{2\,{\rm nHz}} = 0.83^{+0.04}_{-0.05}$. However, when environmental effects were included, the initial eccentricity could be significantly lowered, yet the scenario with purely circular binaries was still mildly disfavored.</description>

      <title>The effect of quantum decoherence on inflationary gravitational waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02563v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The theory of inflation provides a mechanism to explain the structures we observe today in the Universe, starting from quantum-mechanically generated fluctuations. However, this leaves the question of: how did the quantum-to-classical transition, occur? During inflation, tensor perturbations interact (at least gravitationally) with other fields, meaning that we need to view these perturbations as an open system that interacts with an environment. In this paper, the evolution of the system is described using a Lindblad equation, which describes the quantum decoherence of the system. This is a possible mechanism for explaining the quantum-to-classical transition. We show that this quantum decoherence leads to a scale-dependent increase of the gravitational wave power spectrum, depending on the strength and time dependence of the interaction between the system and the environment. By using current upper bounds on the gravitational wave power spectrum from inflation, obtained from CMB and the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA constraints, we find an upper bound on the interaction strength. Furthermore, we compute the decoherence criterion, which indicates the minimal interaction strength needed for a specific scale to have successfully decohered by the end of inflation. Assuming that the CMB modes have completely decohered, we indicate a lower bound on the interaction strength. In addition, this decoherence criterion allows us to look at which scales might not have fully decohered and could still show some relic quantum signatures. Lastly, we use sensitivity forecasts to study how future gravitational-wave detectors, such as LISA and ET, could constrain the decoherence parameter space. Due to the scale-dependence of the power spectrum, LISA could only have a very small impact. However, ET will be able to significantly improve our current constraints for specific decoherence scenarios.</description>

      <title>Interacting dark sector from Horndeski theories and beyond: Mapping fields and fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12341v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In Cosmology, when dissipative effects are minimal, the energy content of the Universe can be effectively described as a sum of perfect fluids. Perfect fluid descriptions ensure thermal equilibrium since they equilibrate immediately. However, interactions among different energy content of the Universe might prevent such rapid equilibration. This limitation calls for a more fundamental framework that incorporates these interactions directly at the level of the action. In earlier work, two of the authors demonstrated that an interacting dark energy (DE)-dark matter (DM) field theory action could be derived from a modified gravity action via a conformal transformation, establishing a one-to-one correspondence between the field theory action and fluid for a unique interaction term [arXiv:2006.04618]. In this work, we extend that analysis by considering quadratic order Horndeski gravity, identifying two classes of models: field coupling and field-kinetic coupling. Our approach generalizes the coupling function for DE-DM interactions by incorporating an additional dependence on kinetic terms. We establish a field-to-fluid mapping for dark matter and find that this mapping only holds for a specific form of the interaction strength. Interestingly, we show that this interaction strength excludes non-gravitational interactions between dark energy and dark radiation. Numerical analysis reveals that purely kinetic interactions within the dark sector can significantly alter cosmological evolution compared to non-interacting scenarios, highlighting the strong dependence of cosmological dynamics on coupling strength. A preliminary examination of linear scalar perturbations indicates that the field-kinetic coupling results in a non-zero gravitational slip parameter and momentum exchange.</description>

      <title>Do Observations Prefer Thawing Quintessence?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13637v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In light of recent observations by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), we study evidence for thawing quintessence over a cosmological constant as dark energy, with emphasis on the effect of the choice of priors. Working with a parametrization for the equation of state parameter motivated by the theory, we analyse the DESI BAO data jointly with Planck 2018 and Pantheon+ supernovae data, and find a preference for thawing quintessence compared to a bare cosmological constant only if we use priors which are heavily informed by the data itself. If we extend the priors to physically better motivated ranges, the evidence for thawing quintessence disappears.</description>

      <title>GalSBI: Phenomenological galaxy population model for cosmology using simulation-based inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08701v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present GalSBI, a phenomenological model of the galaxy population for cosmological applications using simulation-based inference. The model is based on analytical parametrizations of galaxy luminosity functions, morphologies and spectral energy distributions. Model constraints are derived through iterative Approximate Bayesian Computation, by comparing Hyper Suprime-Cam deep field images with simulations which include a forward model of instrumental, observational and source extraction effects. We developed an emulator trained on image simulations using a normalizing flow. We use it to accelerate the inference by predicting detection probabilities, including blending effects and photometric properties of each object, while accounting for background and PSF variations. This enables robustness tests for all elements of the forward model and the inference. The model demonstrates excellent performance when comparing photometric properties from simulations with observed imaging data for key parameters such as magnitudes, colors and sizes. The redshift distribution of simulated galaxies agrees well with high-precision photometric redshifts in the COSMOS field within $1.5\sigma$ for all magnitude cuts. Additionally, we demonstrate how GalSBI's redshifts can be utilized for splitting galaxy catalogs into tomographic bins, highlighting its potential for current and upcoming surveys. GalSBI is fully open-source, with the accompanying Python package, $\texttt{galsbi}$, offering an easy interface to quickly generate realistic, survey-independent galaxy catalogs.</description>

Abstract: Large-scale structure surveys measure the shape and position of millions of galaxies in order to constrain the cosmological model with high precision. The resulting large data volume poses a challenge for the analysis of the data, from the estimation of photometric redshifts to the calibration of shape measurements. We present GalSBI, a model for the galaxy population, to address these challenges. This phenomenological model is constrained by observational data using simulation-based inference (SBI). The $\texttt{galsbi}$ Python package provides an easy interface to generate catalogs of galaxies based on the GalSBI model, including their photometric properties, and to simulate realistic images of these galaxies using the $\texttt{UFig}$ package.</description>

Abstract: We report the detection of a 282 $^{+34}_{-31}$ pc-sized core in the center of Milky Way dark matter halo at $68\%$ confidence level by using the micro-lensing event rate sky map data from the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) survey. We apply the spacial information of the microlensing sky map and model it with the detailed Milky Way dark matter halo Core/Cusp profile, and the fraction of dark matter in the form of Mini Dark Matter Structure (MDMS, $f_{\rm MDMS}=\Omega_{\rm MDMS}/\Omega_{\rm DM}$), e.g. primordial black hole, earth-mass subhalos, floating planets and so on. We find that this sky map can constrain both $f_{\rm MDMS}$ and the core size simultaneously without strong degeneracy while fully considering mass function of Milky Way stellar components from both the bulge and disk.</description>

Abstract: Neutron star binaries and their associated gravitational wave signal facilitate precision tests of General Relativity. Any deviation of the detected gravitational waveform from General Relativity would therefore be a smoking gun signature of new physics, in the form of additional forces, dark matter particles, or extra gravitational degrees of freedom. To be able to probe new theories, precise knowledge of the expected waveform is required. In our work, we consider a generic setup by augmenting General Relativity with an additional, massive scalar field. We then compute the inspiral dynamics of a binary system, for circular orbits, by employing an effective field theoretical approach, while giving a detailed introduction to the computational framework. Finally, we derive the modified TaylorF2 phase of the gravitational wave signal at next-to-leading order in the post-Newtonian expansion, and leading order in the parameters of the scalar sector, such as the scalar charge. As a consequence of our model-agnostic approach, our results are readily adaptable to a plethora of new physics scenarios, including modified gravity theories and scalar dark matter models.</description>

Abstract: Quadratic quasi-normal modes, generated at second order in black hole perturbation theory, are a promising target for testing gravity in the nonlinear regime with next-generation gravitational wave detectors. While their frequencies have long been known, their amplitudes remain poorly studied. We introduce regular variables and compute amplitudes for Schwarzschild black holes with the Leaver algorithm. We find a nonlinear ratio $\mathcal{R}\simeq0.154e^{-0.068i}$ for the most excited $\ell=4$ mode, matching results from Numerical Relativity. We also predict new low-frequency $\ell=2$ quadratic modes.</description>

      <title>Quantumness of relic gravitons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10169v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since the relic gravitons are produced in entangled states of opposite (comoving) three-momenta, their distributions and their averaged multiplicities must determine the maximal frequency of the spectrum above which the created pairs are exponentially suppressed. The absolute upper bound on the maximal frequency derived in this manner coincides with the THz domain and does not rely on the details of the cosmological scenario. The THz limit also translates into a constraint of the order of $10^{-33}$ on the minimal chirp amplitudes that should be effectively reached by all classes of hypothetical detectors aiming at the direct scrutiny of a signal in the frequency domain that encompasses the MHz and the GHz bands. The obtained high-frequency limit is deeply rooted in the quantumness of the produced gravitons whose multiparticle final sates are macroscopic but always non-classical. Since the unitary evolution preserves their coherence, the quantumness of the gravitons can be associated with an entanglement entropy that is associated with the loss of the complete information on the underlying quantum field. It turns out that the reduction of the density matrix in different bases leads to the same Von Neumann entropy whose integral over all the modes of the spectrum is dominated by the maximal frequency. Thanks to the THz bound the total integrated entropy of the gravitons can be comparable with the cosmic microwave background entropy but not larger. Besides the well known cosmological implications, we then suggest that a potential detection of gravitons between the MHz and the THz may therefore represent a direct evidence of macroscopic quantum states associated with the gravitational field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20658v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Light scalar fields play a variety of roles in modern physics, especially in cosmology and modified theories of gravity. For this reason, there is a zoo of experiments actively trying to find evidence for many scalar field models that have been proposed in theoretical considerations. Among those are setups in which the pressures expected to be induced by light scalar fields between two parallel plates are studied, for example, Casimir force experiments. While it is known that classical and quantum pressures caused by light scalar fields could have significant impacts on such experiments, in this article, we show that this can also be the case for thermal pressure. More specifically, we derive expressions for the quantum and thermal pressures induced by exchanges of light scalar field fluctuations between two thin parallel plates. As particular examples, we then look at screened scalar fields. For chameleon, symmetron and environment-dependent dilaton models, we find large regions in their parameter spaces that allow for thermal pressures to equal or exceed the quantum pressures. By comparing with earlier constraints from quantum pressure calculations, we conclude that thermal pressures induced by chameleons are actually of experimental significance.</description>

      <title>Two-loop corrections in power spectrum in models of inflation with PBHs formation</title>

Abstract: We calculate the two-loop corrections in primordial power spectrum in models of single field inflation incorporating an intermediate USR phase employed for PBHs formation. Among the total eleven one-particle irreducible Feynman diagrams, we calculate the corrections from the "double scoop" two-loop diagram involving two vertices of quartic Hamiltonians. We demonstrate that the fractional two-loop correction in power spectrum scales like the square of the fractional one-loop correction. We confirm our previous findings that the loop corrections become arbitrarily large in the setup where the transition from the intermediate USR to the final slow-roll phase is very sharp. This suggests that in order for the analysis to be under perturbative control against loop corrections, one requires a mild transition with a long enough relaxation period towards the final attractor phase.</description>

      <title>$\texttt{UFig v1}$: The ultra-fast image generator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08716v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the rise of simulation-based inference (SBI) methods, simulations need to be fast as well as realistic. $\texttt{UFig v1}$ is a public Python package that generates simulated astronomical images with exceptional speed - taking approximately the same time as source extraction. This makes it particularly well-suited for simulation-based inference (SBI) methods where computational efficiency is crucial. To render an image, $\texttt{UFig}$ requires a galaxy catalog and a description of the point spread function (PSF). It can also add background noise, sample stars using the Besan\c{c}on model of the Milky Way, and run $\texttt{SExtractor}$ to extract sources from the rendered image. The extracted sources can be matched to the intrinsic catalog, flagged based on $\texttt{SExtractor}$ output and survey masks, and emulators can be used to bypass the image simulation and extraction steps. A first version of $\texttt{UFig}$ was presented in Berg\'e et al. (2013) and the software has since been used and further developed in a variety of forward modelling applications.</description>
