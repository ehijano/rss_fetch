      <title>PICS: Planetary Nebulae in Cosmological Simulations -- Revelations of the Planetary Nebula Luminosity Function from Realistic Stellar Populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Even after decades of usage as an extragalactic standard candle, the universal bright end of the planetary nebula luminosity function (PNLF) still lacks a solid theoretical explanation. Until now, models have modeled planetary nebulae (PNe) from artificial stellar populations, without an underlying cosmological star formation history. We present PICS (PNe In Cosmological Simulations), a novel method of modeling PNe in cosmological simulations, through which PN populations for the first time naturally occur within galaxies of diverse evolutionary pathways. We find that only by using realistic stellar populations and their metallicities is it possible to reproduce the bright end of the PNLF for all galaxy types. In particular, the dependence of stellar lifetimes on metallicity has to be accounted for to produce bright PNe in metal-rich populations. Finally, PICS reproduces the statistically complete part of the PNLF observed around the Sun, down to six orders of magnitude below the bright end.</description>

      <title>A grand-design spiral galaxy with an ordered magnetic field at redshift 2.6 as resolved with ALMA and gravitational lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic fields play an important role in the evolution of galaxies and in shaping the dynamics of their inter-stellar medium. However, the formation history of magnetic fields from initial seed-fields to well-ordered systems is not clear. Favoured scenarios include a turbulent dynamo that amplifies the field, and a mean-field dynamo that organizes it. Such a model can be tested through observing the magnetic-field structure of galaxies in the early Universe given the relative formation time-scales involved. Here, we combine the high angular resolution of the Atacama Large Milli-metre Array (ALMA) and gravitational lensing to resolve the magnetic field structure of a 4-kpc in extent grand-design spiral when the Universe was just 2.6 Gyr old. We find that the spiral arm structure, as traced by the heated dust emission, is coincident with the linearly polarized emission, which is consistent with a highly ordered magnetic field. The time-scale needed to produce such an ordered field is likely within at least several rotations of the disk. Our study highlights the importance of combining the long baselines of ALMA and gravitational lensing to resolve the structure of galaxies at cosmologically interesting epochs.</description>

      <title>The 3D morphology of open clusters in the solar neighborhood III: Fractal dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the fractal dimension of open clusters using 3D spatial data from Gaia DR3 for 93 open clusters from Pang et al. (2024) and 127 open clusters from Hunt &amp; Reffert (2024) within 500 pc. The box-counting method is adopted to calculate the fractal dimension of each cluster in three regions: the all-member region, $r \leq r_t$ (inside the tidal radius), and $r &gt; r_t$ (outside the tidal radius). In both the Pang and Hunt catalogs, the fractal dimensions are smaller for the regions $r &gt; r_t$ than those for $r \leq r_t$, indicating that the stellar distribution is more clumpy in the cluster outskirts. We classify cluster morphology based on the fractal dimension via the Gaussian Mixture Model. Our study shows that the fractal dimension can efficiently classify clusters in the Pang catalog into two groups. The fractal dimension of the clusters in the Pang catalog declines with age, which is attributed to the development of tidal tails. This is consistent with the expectations from the dynamical evolution of open clusters. We find strong evidence that the fractal dimension increases with cluster mass, which implies that higher-mass clusters are formed hierarchically from the mergers of lower-mass filamentary-type stellar groups. The transition of the fractal dimension for the spatial distribution of open clusters provides a useful tool to trace the Galactic star forming structures, from the location of the Local Bubble within the solar neighborhood to the spiral arms across the Galaxy.</description>

      <title>Probing the major driver of stellar population properties over sub-galaxy scales with SDSS MaNGA IFU spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thanks to Integral Field Unit survey data it is possible to explore in detail the link between the formation of the stellar content in galaxies and the drivers of evolution. Traditionally, scaling relations have connected galaxy-wide parameters such as stellar mass (M$_s$), morphology or average velocity dispersion ($\sigma$) to the star formation histories (SFHs). We study a high quality sample of SDSS-MaNGA spectra to test the possibility that sub-galaxy ($\sim$2\,kpc) scales are dominant, instead of galaxy-wide parameters. We find a strong correlation between local velocity dispersion and key line strengths that depend on the SFHs, allowing us to make the ansatz that this indicator - that maps the local gravitational potential - is the major driver of star formation in galaxies, whereas larger scales play a role of a secondary nature. Galactocentric distance has a weaker correlation, suggesting that the observed radial gradients effectively reflect local variations of velocity dispersion. In our quest for a cause, instead of a correlation, we contrast $\sigma$ with local stellar mass, that appears less correlated with population properties. We conclude that the inherently higher uncertainty in M$_s$ may explain its lower correlation with respect to $\sigma$, but the extra uncertainty needed for $\sigma$ to have similar correlations as M$_s$ is rather high. Therefore we posit local velocity dispersion as the major driver of evolution, a result that should be reproduced by hydrodynamical models at the proper resolution.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Fields in Massive Star-forming Regions (MagMaR). V. The Magnetic Field at the Onset of High-mass Star Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A complete understanding of the initial conditions of high-mass star formation and what processes determine multiplicity require the study of the magnetic field (B-field) in young, massive cores. Using ALMA 250 GHz polarization (0.3" = 1000 au) and ALMA 220 GHz high-angular resolution observations (0.05" = 160 au), we have performed a full energy analysis including the B-field at core scales and have assessed what influences the multiplicity inside a massive core previously believed to be in the prestellar phase. With 31 Msun, the G11.92 MM2 core has a young CS outflow with a dynamical time scale of a few thousand years. At high-resolution, the MM2 core fragments into a binary system with a projected separation of 505 au and a binary mass ratio of 1.14. Using the DCF method with an ADF analysis, we estimate in this core a B-field strength of 6.2 mG and a mass-to-flux ratio of 18. The MM2 core is strongly subvirialized with a virial parameter of 0.064, including the B-field. The high mass-to-flux ratio and low virial parameter indicate that this massive core is very likely undergoing runaway collapse, which is in direct contradiction with the core-accretion model. The MM2 core is embedded in a filament that has a velocity gradient consistent with infall. In line with clump-fed scenarios, the core can grow in mass at a rate of 1.9--5.6 x 10^-4 Msun/yr. In spite of the B-field having only a minor contribution to the total energy budget at core scales, it likely plays a more important role at smaller scales by setting the binary properties. Considering energy ratios and a fragmentation criterion at the core scale, the binary could have been formed by core fragmentation. The binary properties (separation and mass ratio), however, are also consistent with radiation-magnetohydrodynamic simulations with super-Alfvenic, supersonic (or sonic) turbulence that form binaries by disk fragmentation.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Goldilocks Zone: Identifying Critical Features in Massive Black Hole Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most galaxies, including the Milky Way, host a supermassive black hole (SMBH) at the center. These SMBHs can be observed out to high redshifts (z&gt;=6). However, we do not fully understand the mechanism through which these black holes form and grow at early times. The heavy (or direct collapse) seeding mechanism has emerged as a probable contender in which the core of an atomic cooling halo directly collapses into a dense stellar cluster that could host supermassive stars that proceed to form a BH seed of mass ~10^5 Msun. We use the Renaissance simulations to investigate the properties of 35 DCBH candidate host halos at $z = 15-24$ and compare them to non-candidate halos. We aim to understand what features differentiate halos capable of hosting a DCBH from the general halo population with the use of statistical analysis and machine learning methods. We examine 18 halo, central, and environmental properties. We find that DCBH candidacy is more dependent on a halo's core internal properties than on exterior factors and effects; our analysis selects density and radial mass influx as the most important features (outside of those used to establish candidacy). Our results concur with the recent suggestion that DCBH host halos neither need to lie within a "Goldilocks zone" nor have a significant amount of Lyman-Werner flux to suppress cooling. This paper presents insight to the dynamics possibly occurring in potential DCBH host halos and seeks to provide guidance to DCBH subgrid formation models.</description>

      <title>Modeling Mg II resonance doublet spectra from galaxy haloes at z $\sim$ 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the properties of cold gas at $10^4~\rm K$ around star-forming galaxies at $z~\sim~1$ using Mg II spectra through radiative transfer modeling. We utilize a comprehensive dataset of 624 galaxies from the MAGG and MUDF programs. We focus on Mg II emission from galaxies and their outskirts to explore the cold gas within galaxies and the circumgalactic medium (CGM). We model Mg II spectra for 167 individual galaxies and stacked data for different stellar mass bins. The Mg II spectrum and surface brightness vary significantly with stellar mass. In low-mass galaxies ($M_*/M_\odot&lt;10^9$), Mg II emission is observed in both core ($R_{\rm p}&lt;$ 10 kpc) and halo regions (10 kpc $&lt;R_{\rm p}&lt;$ 30 kpc), while in higher mass galaxies ($M_*/M_\odot&gt;10^{10}$), strong core absorption and more extended halo emission are prominent. This indicates that more massive galaxies have more cold gas. Radiative transfer modeling allows us to investigate key parameters such as the Mg II column density $N_{\rm MgII}$ and the outflow velocity $v_{\rm exp}$. We identify a negative correlation between $N_{\rm MgII}$ and $v_{\rm exp}$. Since higher stellar mass galaxies exhibit a higher $N_{\rm MgII}$ and lower $v_{\rm exp}$, this suggests an abundance of slowly moving cold gas in massive galaxies. In addition, the fitting results of halo spectra indicate the presence of intrinsic Mg II absorption and strong anisotropy of the cold gas distribution around massive galaxies. This study is not only a proof-of-concept of modeling spatially varying Mg II spectra but also enhances our understanding of the CGM and provides insights into the mass-dependent properties of cold gas in and around galaxies.</description>

      <title>An empirical model of the extragalactic radio background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio observations provide a powerful tool to constrain the assembly of galaxies over cosmic time. Recent deep and wide radio continuum surveys have improved significantly our understanding on radio emission properties of AGNs and SFGs across $0 &lt; z &lt; 4$. This allows us to derive an empirical model of the radio continuum emission of galaxies based on their SFR and the probability of hosting an radio AGN. We make use of the Empirical Galaxy Generator (EGG) to generate a near-infrared-selected, flux-limited multi-wavelength catalog to mimic real observations. Then we assign radio continuum flux densities to galaxies based on their SFRs and the probability of hosting a radio-AGN of specific 1.4 GHz luminosity. We also apply special treatments to reproduce the clustering signal of radio AGNs.Our empirical model successfully recovers the observed 1.4 GHz radio luminosity functions (RLFs) of both AGN and SFG populations, as well as the differential number counts at various radio bands. The uniqueness of this approach also allows us to directly link radio flux densities of galaxies to other properties, including redshifts, stellar masses, and magnitudes at various photometric bands. We find that roughly half of the radio continuum sources to be detected by SKA at $z \sim 4-6$ will be too faint to be detected in the optical survey ($r \sim 27.5$) carried out by Rubin observatory. Unlike previous studies which utilized RLFs to reproduce ERB, our work starts from a simulated galaxy catalog with realistic physical properties. It has the potential to simultaneously, and self-consistently reproduce physical properties of galaxies across a wide range of wavelengths, from optical, NIR, FIR to radio wavelengths. Our empirical model can shed light on the contribution of different galaxies to the extragalactic background light, and greatly facilitates designing future multiwavelength galaxy surveys.</description>

      <title>Towards Galactic Archaeology with Inferred Ages of Giant Stars From Gaia Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the era of Gaia, the accurate determination of stellar ages is transforming Galactic archaeology. We demonstrate the feasibility of inferring stellar ages from Gaia's RVS spectra and the BP/RP (XP) spectrophotometric data, specifically for red giant branch and high-mass red clump stars. We successfully train two machine learning models, dubbed SIDRA: Stellar age Inference Derived from Gaia spectRA to predict the age. The SIDRA-RVS model uses the RVS spectra and SIDRA-XP the stellar parameters obtained from the XP spectra by Fallows and Sanders 2024. Both models use BINGO, an APOGEE-derived stellar age from Ciuca et al. 2021 as the training data. SIDRA-RVS estimates ages of stars whose age is around $\tau_\mathrm{BINGO}=10$ Gyr with a standard deviation of residuals of $\sim$ 0.12 dex in the unseen test dataset, while SIDRA-XP achieves higher precision with residuals $\sim$ 0.064 dex for stars around $\tau_\mathrm{BINGO}=10$ Gyr. Since SIDRA-XP outperforms SIDRA-RVS, we apply SIDRA-XP to analyse the ages for 2,218,154 stars. This allowed us to map the chronological and chemical properties of Galactic disc stars, revealing distinct features such as the Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus merger and a potential gas-rich interaction event linked to the first infall of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy. This study demonstrates that machine learning techniques applied to Gaia's spectra can provide valuable age information, particularly for giant stars, thereby enhancing our understanding of the Milky Way's formation and evolution.</description>

      <title>Molecular chemistry induced by J-shock toward supernova remnant W51C</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shock waves from supernova remnants (SNRs) have strong influence on the physical and chemical properties of molecular clouds (MCs). Shocks propagating into magnetized MCs can be classified into "jump" J-shock and "continuous" C-shock. The molecular chemistry in the re-formed molecular gas behind J-shock is still not well understood, which will provide a comprehensive view of the chemical feedback of SNRs and the chemical effects of J-shock. We conducted a W-band (71.4-89.7 GHz) observation toward a re-formed molecular clump behind a J-shock induced by SNR W51C with the Yebes 40 m radio telescope to study the molecular chemistry in the re-formed molecular gas. Based on the local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) assumption, we estimate the column densities of HCO+, HCN, C2H and o-c-C3H2, and derive the maps of their abundance ratios with CO. The gas density is constrained by non-LTE analysis of the HCO+ J=1-0 line. We obtain the following abundance ratios: $N({\rm HCO^+})/N({\rm CO})\sim (1.0\text{--}4.0)\times 10^{-4}$, $N({\rm HCN})/N({\rm CO})\sim (1.8\text{--}5.3)\times 10^{-4}$, $N({\rm C_2H})/N({\rm CO})\sim (1.6\text{--}5.0)\times 10^{-3}$, and $N({o\text{-}c\text{-}{\rm C_3H_2}})/N({\rm CO})\sim (1.2\text{--}7.9)\times 10^{-4}$. The non-LTE analysis suggests that the gas density is $n_{\rm H_2}\gtrsim 10^4\rm \ cm^{-3}$. We find that the N(C2H)/N(CO) and N(o-c-C3H2)/N(CO) are higher than typical values in quiescent MCs and shocked MCs by 1-2 orders of magnitude, which can be qualitatively attributed to the abundant C+ and C at the earliest phase of molecular gas re-formation. The Paris-Durham shock code can reproduce, although not perfectly, the observed abundance ratios, especially the enhanced N(C2H)/N(CO) and N(o-c-C3H2)/N(CO), with J-shocks propagating in to both non-irradiated and irradiated molecular gas with a preshock density of $n_{\rm H}=2\times 10^3\rm \ cm^{-3}$.</description>

      <title>Chemical Evolution of R-process Elements in Stars (CERES). III. Chemical abundances of neutron capture elements from Ba to Eu</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The chemical abundances of elements such as barium and the lanthanides are essential to understand the nucleosynthesis of heavy elements in the early Universe as well as the contribution of different neutron capture processes (for example slow versus rapid) at different epochs. The Chemical Evolution of R-process Elements in Stars (CERES) project aims to provide a homogeneous analysis of a sample of metal-poor stars ( [Fe/H]\&lt;-1.5) to improve our understanding of the nucleosynthesis of neutron capture elements, in particular the r-process elements, in the early Galaxy. Our data consist of a sample of high resolution and high signal-to-noise ratio UVES spectra. The chemical abundances were derived through spectrum synthesis, using the same model atmospheres and stellar parameters as derived in the first paper of the CERES series. We measured chemical abundances or upper limits of seven heavy neutron capture elements (Ba, La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, and Eu) for a sample of 52 metal-poor giant stars. We estimated through the mean shift clustering algorithm that at Ba/H =-2.4 and Fe/H =-2.4 a variation in the trend of X/Ba with X=La,Nd,Sm,Eu, versus Ba/H occurs. This result suggests that, for Ba/H $\&lt;$$-2.4$, Ba nucleosynthesis in the Milky Way halo is primarily due to the $r$-process, while for Ba/H \&lt;-2.4 the effect of the s-process contribution begins to be visible. In our sample, stars with Ba/Eu compatible with a Solar System pure r-process value (hereafter, r-pure) do not show any particular trend compared to other stars, suggesting r-pure stars may form in similar environments to stars with less pure r-process enrichments. Homogeneous investigations of high resolution and signal-to-noise ratio spectra are crucial for studying the heavy elements formation, as they provide abundances that can be used to test nucleosynthesis models as well as Galactic chemical evolution models.</description>

      <title>Constraining Schwarzschild Models with Orbit Classifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A simple orbit classification constraint extension to stellar dynamical modeling using Schwarzschild's method is demonstrated. The classification scheme used is the existing `orbit circularity' scheme (lambda_z) where orbits are split into four groups - hot, warm, cold and counter rotating orbits. Other schemes which can be related to the orbit weights are expected to be viable as well. The results show that the classification constraint works well in modeling. However, given that orbits in external galaxies are not observable, it is not clear how the orbit classification for any particular galaxy may be determined. Perhaps range constraints for different types of galaxies determined from cosmological simulations may offer a way forward.</description>

      <title>A first glimpse at the MeerKAT DEEP2 field at S-band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first widefield extragalactic continuum catalogue with the MeerKAT S-band (2.5 GHz), of the radio-selected DEEP2 field. The combined image over the S1 (1.96 - 2.84 GHz) and S4 (2.62 - 3.50 GHz) sub-bands has an angular resolution of 6.8''$\times$3.6'' (4.0''$\times$2.4'') at a robust weighting of $R = 0.3$ ($R=-0.5$) and a sensitivity of 4.7 (7.5) $\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$ with an on-source integration time of 70 minutes and a minimum of 52 of the 64 antennas, for respective observations. We present the differential source counts for this field, as well as a morphological comparison of resolved sources between S-band and archival MeerKAT L-band images. We find consistent source counts with the literature and provide spectral indices fitted over a combined frequency range of 1.8 GHz. These observations provide an important first demonstration of the capabilities of MeerKAT S-band imaging with relatively short integration times, as well as a comparison with existing S-band surveys, highlighting the rich scientific potential with future MeerKAT S-band surveys.</description>

      <title>Galaxy Morphological Classification with Manifold Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper describes applying manifold learning, the novel technique of dimensionality reduction, to the images of the Galaxy Zoo DECaLs database with the purpose of building an unsupervised learning model for galaxy morphological classification. The manifold learning method assumes that data points can be projected from a manifold in high-dimensional space to a lower-dimensional Euclidean one while maintaining proximity between the points. In our case, data points are photos of galaxies from the Galaxy Zoo DECaLs database, which consists of more than 300,000 human-labeled galaxies of different morphological types. The dimensionality of such data points is equal to the number of pixels in a photo, so dimensionality reduction becomes a handy idea to help one with the successive clusterization of the data. We perform it using Locally Linear Embedding, a manifold learning algorithm, designed to deal with complex high-dimensional manifolds where the data points are originally located. After the dimensionality reduction, we perform the classification procedure on the dataset. In particular, we train our model to distinguish between round and cigar-shaped elliptical galaxies, smooth and featured spiral galaxies, and galaxies with and without disks viewed edge-on. In each of these cases, the number of classes is pre-determined. The last step in our pipeline is k-means clustering by silhouette or elbow method in lower-dimensional space. In the final case of unsupervised classification of the whole dataset, we determine that the optimal number of morphological classes of galaxies coincides with the number of classes defined by human astronomers, further confirming the feasibility and efficiency of manifold learning for this task.</description>

      <title>Behind the dust veil: A panchromatic view of an optically dark galaxy at z=4.82</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optically dark dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) play an essential role in massive galaxy formation at early cosmic time, however their nature remains elusive. Here we present a detailed case study of all the baryonic components of a $z=4.821$ DSFG, XS55. Selected from the ultra-deep COSMOS-XS 3GHz map with a red SCUBA-2 450$\mu$m/850$\mu$m colour, XS55 was followed up with ALMA 3mm line scans and spectroscopically confirmed to be at $z=4.821$ via detections of the CO(5-4) and [CI](1-0) lines. JWST/NIRCam imaging reveals that XS55 is a F150W-dropout with red F277W/F444W colour, and a complex morphology: a compact central component embedded in an extended structure with a likely companion. XS55 is tentatively detected in X-rays with both Chandra and XMM-Newton, suggesting an active galactic nucleus (AGN) nature. By fitting a panchromatic SED spanning NIR to radio wavelengths, we revealed that XS55 is a massive main-sequence galaxy with a stellar mass of $M_\ast=(5\pm1)\times10^{10}\,{\rm M_\odot}$ and a star formation rate of ${\rm SFR}=540\pm177~{\rm M_\odot\,yr^{-1}}$. The dust of XS55 is optically thick in the far infrared (FIR) with a surprisingly cold dust temperature of $T_{\rm dust}=33\pm2\,{\rm K}$, making XS55 one of the coldest DSFGs at $z&gt;4$ known to date. This work unveils the nature of a radio-selected F150W-dropout, suggesting the existence of a population of DSFGs hosting active black holes embedded in optically thick dust.</description>

      <title>FBQ 0951+2635: time delay and structure of the main lensing galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As there is a long-standing controversy over the time delay between the two images of the gravitationally lensed quasar FBQ 0951+2635, we combined early and new optical light curves to robustly measure a delay of 13.5 +/- 1.6 d (1sigma interval). The new optical records covering the last 17 yr were also used to trace the long-timescale evolution of the microlensing variability. Additionally, the new time delay interval and a relatively rich set of further observational constraints allowed us to discuss the mass structure of the main lensing galaxy at redshift 0.26. This lens system is of particular interest because the external shear from secondary gravitational deflectors is relatively low, but the external convergence is one of the highest known. When modelling the galaxy as a singular power-law ellipsoid without hypotheses/priors on the power-law index, ellipticity and position angle, we demonstrated that its mass profile is close to isothermal, and there is good alignment between mass and near-IR light. We also recovered the true mass scale of the galaxy. Finally, it is worth mentioning that a constant mass-to-light ratio model also worked acceptably well.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Galactic Winds in M82 I: the recent starburt and launch of outflow in simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the launch of the galactic outflow in M82 through high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations. Employing a sink-particle module, we self-consistently resolve the star formation and feedback processes, avoiding the reliance on various assumed models as in previous works. We probe the effects of different stellar feedback mechanisms, the gas return from star-forming clouds and initial gas disc mass on the starburst and launch of outflow. Our simulations can generate a starburst that lasts 20-30 Myr, peaking at 20-50 $\rm{M_{\odot} yr^{-1}}$. However, the total stellar mass formed in the starburst in our simulations often exceeds M82's estimated value. The outflow's launch occurs in two stages. Initially, continuous SNe explosions form numerous small bubbles, merging into a super bubble foam composed of low-density warm/hot gas and high-density cool filaments. After approximately 10 Myr of SN energy injection, the super bubble breakout the disc, marking the second stage, which takes 10-15 Myr to develop a multiphase, kpc-scale outflow. Our simulations reveal that cool filaments within the turbulent ISM can survive from the feedback associated to the starburst, then were entrained into the outflow and stretched to hundreds pc in length due to interaction with the hot wind. While the mass loading factor of the well-developed outflow is comparable to M82, the cool gas mass outflow rate is often lower, and its velocity is slower than the estimated value in M82 by $50\%-60\%$. Warm and hot gas are $20\%-30\%$ slower. SN feedback acts as the primary driver of the outflow, while gas return significantly influences the starburst and outflow properties. The initial mass of gas disc has a moderate effect, while stellar wind and radiation feedback have minor effect. To address the shortcomings in our results, enhanced SN feedback effect, due to clustered SNe, is likely necessary.</description>

      <title>How Many Bursts Does it Take to Form a Core at the Center of a Galaxy?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel method for systematically assessing the impact of central potential fluctuations associated with bursty outflows on the structure of dark matter halos for dwarf and ultra-faint galaxies. Specifically, we use dark-matter-only simulations augmented with a manually-added massive particle that modifies the central potential and approximately accounts for a centrally-concentrated baryon component. This approach enables precise control over the magnitude, frequency, and timing of when rapid outflow events occur. We demonstrate that this method can reproduce the established result of core formation for systems that undergo multiple episodes of bursty outflows. In contrast, we also find that equivalent models that undergo only a single (or small number of) burst episodes do not form cores with the same efficacy. This is important because many ultra-faint dwarf (UFD) galaxies in the local universe are observed to have tightly constrained star formation histories that are best described by a single, early burst of star formation. Using a suite of cosmological, zoom-in simulations, we identify the regimes in which single bursts can and cannot form a cored density profile, and therefore, can or cannot resolve the core-cusp problem.</description>

      <title>JWST PRIMER: strong evidence for the environmental quenching of low-mass galaxies out to $\mathbf{\textit{z} \simeq 2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results of a study investigating the galaxy stellar-mass function (GSMF), size-mass relations and morphological properties of star-forming and quiescent galaxies over the redshift range $0.25&lt;z&lt;2.25$, using the JWST PRIMER survey. The depth of the PRIMER near-IR imaging allows us to confirm the double Schechter function shape of the quiescent GSMF out to $z\simeq2.0$, via a clear detection of the upturn at $\mathrm{log}_{10}(M_{\star}/ M_{\odot}) \leq 10$ thought to be induced by environmental quenching. In addition to the GSMF, we confirm that quiescent galaxies can be split into separate populations at $\mathrm{log}_{10}(M_{\star}/M_{\odot}) \simeq 10$, based on their size-mass relations and morphologies. We find that low-mass quiescent galaxies have more disk-like morphologies (based on S\'ersic index, Gini coefficient and $M_{20}$ metrics) and follow a shallower size-mass relation than their high-mass counterparts. Indeed, the slope of the size-mass relation followed by low-mass quiescent galaxies is indistinguishable from that followed by star-forming galaxies, albeit with a lower normalization. Moreover, within the errors, the evolution in the median size of low-mass quiescent galaxies is indistinguishable from that followed by star-forming galaxies ($R_{e}\propto(1+z)^{-0.25\pm0.03})$, and significantly less rapid than that displayed by high-mass quiescent galaxies ($R_{e}\propto (1+z)^{-1.14\pm 0.03})$. Overall, our results are consistent with low and high-mass quiescent galaxies following different quenching pathways. The evolution of low-mass quiescent galaxies is qualitatively consistent with the expectations of external/environmental quenching (e.g. ram-pressure stripping). In contrast, the evolution of high-mass quiescent galaxies is consistent with internal/mass quenching (e.g. AGN feedback) followed by size growth driven by minor mergers.</description>

      <title>On the construction of fuzzy dark matter halos with arbitrary initial velocities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmological simulations of fuzzy dark matter (FDM) are computationally expensive, and the resulting halos lack flexibility in parameter adjustments, such as virial mass, density profile, and global velocity. Previous studies have introduced a method for constructing FDM halos with predefined density profiles. In this study, we investigate the initial global velocity of these constructed halos and find that it is non-zero. We provide the theoretical formula for this velocity and illustrate that it arises from the interference between states of odd and even parity. Our calculated results closely match simulation outcomes. Additionally, we showcase how to counteract this velocity and create a halo with a customizable initial global velocity. Our study presents a practical method for adjusting the initial global velocity of halos in controlled FDM simulations, facilitating investigations into tidal effects, galaxy collisions, and other scenarios.</description>

      <title>SLOW IV: Not all that is Close will Merge in the End. Superclusters and their Lagrangian collapse regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superclusters are the most massive structures in the universe. To what degree they are actually bound against an accelerating expansion of the background is of significant cosmological and astrophysical interest. In this study, we introduce a cross matched set of superclusters from the SLOW constrained simulations of the local (z&lt;0.05) universe. Identifying the superclusters provides estimates on the efficacy of the constraints in reproducing the local large-scale structure accurately. The simulated counterparts can help identifying possible future observational targets containing interesting features such as bridges between pre-merging and merging galaxy clusters and collapsing filaments and provide comparisons for current observations. By determining the collapse volumes for the superclusters we further elucidate the dynamics of cluster-cluster interactions in those regions. Using catalogs of local superclusters and the most massive simulated clusters, we search for counterparts of supercluster members of six regions. We evaluate the significance of these detections by comparing their geometries to supercluster regions in random simulations. We then run an N-body version of the simulation into the far future and determine which of the member clusters are gravitationally bound to the host superclusters. Furthermore we compute masses and density contrasts for the collapse regions. We demonstrate the SLOW simulation of the local universe to accurately reproduce local supercluster regions in mass of their members and three-dimensional geometrical arrangement. We furthermore find the bound regions of the local superclusters consistent in size and density contrast with previous theoretical studies. This will allow to connect future numerical zoom-in studies of the clusters to the large scale environments and specifically the supercluster environments these local galaxy clusters evolve in.</description>

      <title>Dynamical evolution of massless particles in star clusters with NBODY6++GPU-MASSLESS: I. Free-floating MLPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. Low-mass bodies, such as comets, asteroids, planetesimals, and free-floating planets, are continuously injected into the intra-cluster environment after expulsion from their host planetary systems. These can be modeled as massless particles (MLPs, hereafter). The dynamics of large populations of MLPs, however, has yet received little attention in literature. Aims. We investigate the dynamical evolution of MLP populations in star clusters, and characterize their kinematics and ejection rates. Methods. We present NBODY6++GPU-MASSLESS, a modified version of the N-body simulation code NBODY6++GPU, that allows fast integration of star clusters that contain large numbers of massless particles (MLPs). NBODY6++GPU-MASSLESS contains routines specifically directed at the dynamical evolution of low-mass bodies, such as planets. Results. Unlike stars, MLPs do not participate in the mass segregation process. Instead, MLPs mostly follow the gravitational potential of the star cluster, which gradually decreases over time due to stellar ejections and stellar evolution. The dynamical evolution of MLPs is primarily affected by the evolution of the core of the star cluster. This is most apparent in the outer regions for clusters with higher initial densities. High escape rates of MLPs are observed before the core-collapse, after which escape rates remain stable. Denser star clusters undergo a more intense core collapse, but this does not impact the dynamical evolution of MLPs. The speeds of escaping stars are similar to those of escaping MLPs, when disregarding the high-velocity ejections of neutron stars during the first 50 Myr.</description>

      <title>ESpRESSO -- Forward modeling Roman Space Telescope spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe the software package $\texttt{ESpRESSO}$ - [E]xtragalactic [Sp]ectroscopic [R]oman [E]mulator and [S]imulator of [S]ynthetic [O]bjects, created to emulate the slitless spectroscopic observing modes of the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (Roman) Wide Field Instrument (WFI). We combine archival Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging data of comparable spatial resolution with model spectral energy distributions to create a data-cube of flux density as a function of position and wavelength. This data-cube is used for simulating a nine detector grism observation, producing a crowded background scene which model field angle dependent optical distortions expected for the grism. We also demonstrate the ability to inject custom sources using the described tools and pipelines. In addition, we show that spectral features such as emission line pairs are unlikely to be mistaken as off order contaminating features and vice versa. Our result is a simulation suite of half of the eighteen detector array, with a realistic background scene and injected Ly$\alpha$ emitter (LAE) galaxies, realized at 25 position angles (PAs), 12 with analogous positive and negative dithers, Using an exposure time of 10ks per PA, the full PA set can be used as a mock deep Roman grism survey with high (synthetic) LAE completeness for developing future spectral data analysis tools.</description>

This paper demonstrates a purely geometric approach for determining the distance to extragalactic binaries through a joint analysis of spectroastrometry (SA), radial velocity (RV), and light curve (LC) observations. A parameterized model for the binary system is outlined, and simulated SA, RV, and LC data are computed to infer the probability distribution of model parameters based on the mock data. The impact of data quality and binary parameters on distance uncertainties is comprehensively analyzed, showcasing the method's potential for high-precision distance measurements. For a typical eclipsing binary in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), the distance uncertainty is approximately 6% under reasonable observational conditions. Within a specific range of data quality and input parameters, the distance measurement precision of individual binary star systems is generally better than 10%. As a geometric method based on the simplest dynamics, it is independent of empirical calibration and the systematics caused by model selections can be tested using nearby binaries with known distances. By measuring multiple binary star systems or monitoring one binary system repeatedly, geometric distance measurements of nearby galaxies can be achieved, providing valuable insights into the Hubble tension and advancing our understanding of the universe's structure and evolution.</description>

      <title>Insights into the Properties of Type Ibn/Icn Supernovae and Their Progenitor Channels through X-ray Emission</title>

Abstract: Type Ibn/Icn supernovae (SNe Ibn/Icn), which are characterized by narrow helium or carbon lines originated in hydrogen-poor dense circumstellar medium (CSM), provide new insights into the final evolution of massive stars. While SNe Ibn/Icn are expected to emit strong X-rays through the strong SN-CSM interaction, the X-ray emission modeling effort has been limited so far. In the present study, we provide broad-band X-ray light curve (LC) predictions for SNe Ibn/Icn. We find that the soft X-ray LC provides information about the CSM compositions, while the hard X-ray LC is a robust measure of the CSM density, the explosion energy, and the ejecta mass. In addition, considering the evolution of the ionization state in the unshocked CSM, a bright soft X-ray is expected in the first few days since the explosion, which encourages rapid X-ray follow-up observations as a tool to study the nature of SNe Ibn/Icn. Applying our model to the soft X-ray LCs of SNe Ibn 2006jc and 2022ablq, we derive that the CSM potentially contains a larger fraction of carbon and oxygen for SN 2006jc than 2022ablq, highlighting the power of the soft X-ray modeling to address the nature of the CSM. We also discuss detectability and observational strategy, with which the currently operating telescopes such as NuSTAR and Swift can offer an irreplaceable opportunity to explore the nature of these enigmatic rapid transients and their still-unclarified progenitor channel(s).</description>

Abstract: Brown dwarfs are the bridge between low-mass stars and giant planets. One way of shedding light on their dominant formation mechanism is to study them at the earliest stages of their evolution, when they are deeply embedded in their parental clouds. Several works have identified pre- and proto-brown dwarfs candidates using different observational approaches. The aim of this work is to create a database with all the objects classified as very young substellar candidates in the litearature in order to study them in an homogeneous way. We have gathered all the information about very young substellar candidates available in the literature until 2020. We have retrieved their published photometry from the optical to the centimeter regime, and we have written our own codes to derive their bolometric temperatures and luminosities, and their internal luminosities. We have also populated the database with other parameters extracted from the literature, like e.g. the envelope masses, their detection in some molecular species, and presence of outflows. The result of our search is the SUCANES database, containing 174 objects classified as potential very young substellar candidates in the literature. We present an analysis of the main properties of the retrieved objects. Since we have updated the distances to several star forming regions, this has allowed us to reject some candidates based on their internal luminosities. We have also discussed the derived physical parameters and envelope masses for the best substellar candidates isolated in SUCANES. As an example of a scientific exploitation of this database, we present a feasibility study for the detection of radiojets with upcoming facilities: the ngVLA and the SKA interferometers. The SUCANES database is accessible through a Graphical User Interface and it is open to any potential user.</description>

      <title>Chemodynamic evolution of Sun-like stars in nearby moving groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sun-like stars are well represented in the solar neighbourhood but are currently under-utilised, with many studies of chemical and kinematic evolution focusing on red giants (which can be observed further away) or turn-off stars (which have well measured ages). Recent surveys (e.g. GALAH) provide spectra for large numbers of nearby Sun-like stars, which provides an opportunity to apply our newly developed method for measuring metallicities, temperatures, and surface gravities - the EPIC algorithm - which yields improved ages via isochrone fitting. We test this on moving groups, by applying it to the large GALAH DR3 sample. This defines a sample of 72,288 solar analogue targets for which the stellar parameter measurements are most precise and reliable. These stars are used to estimate, and test the accuracy and precision of, age measurements derived with the SAMD isochrone fitting algorithm. Using these ages, we recover the age-metallicity relationships for nearby (&lt;= 1 kpc) moving groups, traced by solar analogues, and analyse them with respect to the stellar kinematics. In particular, we found that the age-metallicity relationships of all moving groups follows a particular trend of young (age &lt; 6 Gyr) stars having constant metallicity and older (age &gt;= 6 Gyr) stars decreasing in metallicity with increasing age. The Hercules stream carries the highest fraction of metal-rich young stars (~ 0.1 dex) in our sample, which is consistent with a migrating population of stars from the inner Galaxy, and we discuss the possible causes of this migration in the context of our results.</description>

      <title>Fast-rotating A- and F-type stars with H{\alpha} emissions in NGC 3532, candidate UV-dim stars?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extended main-sequence stars that are dim in the ultraviolet passbands of Hubble Space Telescope (UV-dim stars) are found in several young and intermediate-age Magellanic Cloud star clusters. The obscuring of the dust in the discs of stars expelled due to fast rotation have been suggested to be responsible for the appearance of UV-dim stars, and play an important role in the formation of extended main-sequences. In this paper, we report a population of A- and F-type stars who show H{\alpha} emission features in their spectra in a young (~ 340 Myr-old) Galactic neighboring star cluster NGC 3532. By fitting the observed absorption profiles, we found that most H{\alpha} emitters are fast rotating stars, indicating that they form decretion discs by fast rotation like Be stars. As A- and F-type stars dominate the extended main-sequence turn-off regions of intermediate-age clusters, their appearance provides observational evidence to support the dust extinction scenario for these clusters, and might be the counterparts of UV-dim stars that are detected in remote Magellanic Cloud star clusters like NGC 1783.</description>

      <title>A theoretical framework for BL Her stars III. A case study: Robust light curve optimisation in the LMC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We carry out an extensive light curve comparison of BL Her stars using observations from Gaia DR3 and stellar pulsation models computed using MESA-RSP with the goal to obtain the best-matched modeled-observed pairs for BL Her stars in the LMC. We use the Fourier decomposition technique to analyse the light curves in the G band obtained from Gaia DR3 and from MESA-RSP and use a robust light curve fitting approach to score the modeled-observed pairs with respect to their pulsation periods and over their Fourier parameter space. We obtain the best-fit models for 48 BL Her stars in the LMC and thereby provide the stellar parameter estimates of these stars, 30 of which are labelled as the gold sample with superior light curve fits. We find a relatively flat distribution of stellar masses between 0.5-0.65 Msolar for the gold sample of modeled-observed pairs. An interesting result is that the majority of the best-matched models in the gold sample are computed using the convection parameter sets without radiative cooling. The period-Wesenheit relation for the best-matched gold sample of 30 BL Her models exhibits a slope of $-2.805 \pm 0.164$ while the corresponding period-radius relation exhibits a slope of $0.565 \pm 0.035$, both in good agreement with the empirical PW and PR slopes from BL Her stars in the LMC, respectively. We also used the Wesenheit magnitudes of the 30 best-matched modeled-observed pairs to estimate a distance modulus of $\mu_{\rm LMC} = 18.582 \pm 0.067$ to the LMC, which lies within the bounds of previous literature values. We also discuss the degeneracy in the stellar parameters of the BL Her models that result in similar pulsation periods and light curve structure, and highlight that caution must be exercised while using the stellar parameter estimates.</description>

      <title>On the evolutionary nature of massive B-type supergiants: a modern empirical reappraisal using data from IACOB, Gaia and TESS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Massive stars are key contributors to the chemodynamical evolution of galaxies and the Universe. Despite their significance, discrepancies between observational data and theoretical models of massive stars challenge our understanding of these objects. A major uncertainty is the overdensity of B-type supergiants (BSGs) in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, where models predict the end of the main sequence phase (or TAMS). Is uncertain whether the TAMS needs to be redefined or if the overdensity results from overlapping populations following different evolutionary paths. Conceived as direct descendants of O-type stars, BSGs may include stars not only evolving in the main sequence but also returning from a post-red supergiant phase. A representative fraction of massive stars are predicted to be products of binary interaction, creating additional evolutionary channels. In addition, some fundamental properties of BSGs such as the spin- and mass-loss rates are not as well constrained as in O-type stars, having a significant impact on massive star evolution. To overcome this situation, statistically significant spectroscopic samples offer a unique opportunity to study the physical and chemical properties of BSGs. Moreover, the advent of space astrometry and photometry missions such as Gaia and TESS has brought a new era for studying additional properties in detail. This thesis comprises the study of 1000 Galactic blue supergiants (O- and B-type) combining multi-epoch high-resolution spectroscopic data from the IACOB project and the ESO archive with Gaia distances and TESS photometry, becoming the largest holistic empirical study of the physical, chemical, and pulsational properties of these objects performed to date. All these properties gathered into a unique volume-limited sample allowed to provide an empirical reassessment of the main properties of BSGs and investigate their intricate nature.</description>

      <title>FLAMINGO: Galaxy formation and feedback effects on the gas density and velocity fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most of the visible matter in the Universe is in a gaseous state, subject to hydrodynamic forces and galaxy formation processes that are much more complex to model than gravity. These baryonic effects can potentially bias the analyses of several cosmological probes, such as weak gravitational lensing. In this work, we study the gas density and velocity fields of the FLAMINGO simulations and compare them with their gravity-only predictions. We find that, while the gas velocities do not differ from those of dark matter on large scales, the gas mass power spectrum is suppressed by up to $\approx 8\%$ relative to matter, even on gigaparsec scales. This is a consequence of star formation depleting gas in the densest and most clustered regions of the universe. On smaller scales, $k&gt;0.1 \, h / \rm Mpc$, the power suppression for both gas densities and velocities is more significant and correlates with the strength of the active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback. The impact of feedback can be understood in terms of outflows, identified as gas bubbles with positive radial velocities ejected from the central galaxy. With increasing feedback strength, the outflowing gas has higher velocities, and it reaches scales as large as $10$ times the virial radius of the halo, redistributing the gas and slowing its average infall velocity. Interestingly, different implementations of AGN feedback leave distinct features in these outflows in terms of their radial and angular profiles and their dependence on halo mass. In the future, such differences could be measured in observations using, for example, the kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect.</description>

      <title>JWST meets Chandra: a large population of Compton thick, feedback-free, and intrinsically X-ray weak AGN, with a sprinkle of SNe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00504v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the X-ray properties of a sample of 71 broad line and narrow line AGN at 2$&lt;$z$&lt;$11 discovered by JWST in the GOODS fields, which have the deepest Chandra observations ever obtained. Despite the widespread presence of AGN signatures in their rest-optical and -UV spectra, the vast majority of them is X-ray undetected. The stacked X-ray data of the non-detected sources also results in a non-detection. The upper limit on the X-ray emission for many of these AGN is one or even two orders of magnitude lower than expected from a standard AGN SED. X-ray absorption by clouds with large (Compton-thick) column density and low dust content, such as the Broad Line Region (BLR) clouds, can explain the X-ray weakness. In this scenario the BLR covering factor should be much larger than in low-z AGN or luminous quasars; this is supported by the larger equivalent width of the broad component of H$\alpha$ in JWST-selected AGN. We also find that the JWST-discovered AGN lack prominent, fast outflows, suggesting that, in JWST-selected AGN, dense gas lingers in the nuclear region, resulting in large covering factors. We also note that a large fraction of JWST-selected AGN matches the definition of NLSy1, typically accreting at high rates and characterized by a steep X-ray spectrum -- this can further contribute to their observed weakness at high-z. Finally, we discuss that the broad Balmer lines used to identify type 1 AGN cannot be ascribed to Very Massive Stars or Supernovae, although we show that some of the faintest broad lines could potentially be associated with superluminous SNe.</description>

      <title>Impact of star formation models on the growth of simulated galaxies at high redshifts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12090v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Star formation is a key process that governs the baryon cycle within galaxies, however, the question of how it controls their growth remains elusive due to modeling uncertainties. To understand the impact of star formation models on galaxy evolution, we performed cosmological zoom-in radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of a dwarf dark matter halo, with a virial mass of $M_{\rm vir} \sim 10^9\, M_\odot$ at $z=6$. We compared two different star formation models: a multi-freefall model combined with a local gravo-thermo-turbulent condition and a more self-consistent model based on a sink particle algorithm, where gas accretion and star formation are directly controlled by the gas kinematics. As the first study in this series, we used cosmological zoom-in simulations with different spatial resolutions and found that star formation is more bursty in the runs with the sink algorithm, generating stronger outflows than in the runs with the gravo-thermo-turbulent model. The main reason for the increased burstiness is that the gas accretion rates on the sinks are high enough to form stars on very short timescales, leading to more clustered star formation. As a result, the star-forming clumps are disrupted more quickly in the sink run due to more coherent radiation and supernova feedback. The difference in burstiness between the two star formation models becomes even more pronounced when the supernova explosion energy is artificially increased. Our results suggest that improving the modeling of star formation on small, sub-molecular cloud scales can significantly impact the global properties of simulated galaxies.</description>

      <title>EDGE: Dark matter core creation depends on the timing of star formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14579v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study feedback-driven cold dark matter core creation in the EDGE suite of radiation-hydrodynamical dwarf galaxy simulations. Understanding this process is crucial when using observed dwarf galaxies to constrain the particle nature of dark matter. While previous studies have shown the stellar-mass to halo-mass ratio $(M_{\star} / M_{200})$ determines the extent of core creation, we find that in low-mass dwarfs there is a crucial additional effect, namely the timing of star formation relative to reionisation. Sustained post-reionisation star formation decreases central dark matter density through potential fluctuations; conversely, pre-reionisation star formation is too short-lived to have such an effect. In fact, large stellar masses accrued prior to reionisation are a strong indicator of early collapse, and therefore indicative of an increased central dark matter density. We parameterise this differentiated effect by considering $M_{\star,\mathrm{post}}/M_{\star,\mathrm{pre}}$, where the numerator and denominator represent the amount of star formation after and before $z\sim6.5$, respectively. Our study covers the halo mass range $10^9 &lt; M_{200} &lt; 10^{10} M_\odot$ (stellar masses between $10^4 &lt; M_{\star} &lt; 10^8 M_\odot$), spanning both ultra-faint and classical dwarfs. In this regime, $M_{\star,\mathrm{post}}/M_{\star,\mathrm{pre}}$ correlates almost perfectly with the central dark matter density at $z=0$, even when including simulations with a substantially different variant of feedback and cooling. We provide fitting formulae to describe the newfound dependence.</description>

      <title>The protostars in Orion: Characterizing the properties of their magnetized envelopes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19635v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a study connecting the physical properties of protostellar envelopes to the morphology of the envelope-scale magnetic field. We used the ALMA polarization observations of 61 young prtostars at 0.87 mm on $\sim400-3000$ au scales from the {\em B}-field Orion Protostellar Survey to infer the envelope-scale magnetic field, and used the dust emission to measure the envelope properties on comparable scales. We find that protostars showing standard-hourglass-field morphology tend to have larger masses and lower velocity dispersions in their envelopes, whereas systems with spiral-field morphologies have higher velocity dispersion. Combining with the disk properties taken from the Orion VLA/ALMA Nascent Disk and Multiplicity survey, we connect envelope properties to fragmentation. Our results show that the fragmentation level is positively correlated with the angle dispersion of the magnetic field, suggesting that the envelope fragmentation tends to be suppressed by the magnetic field. We also find that protostars exhibiting standard hourglass magnetic field structure tend to have a smaller disk and smaller angle dispersion of the magnetic field than other field configurations, specially the rotated hourglass, but also the spiral and others, suggesting a more effective magnetic braking in the standard hourglass morphology of magnetic fields. Nevertheless, significant misalignment between the magnetic field and outflow axes tends to reduce magnetic braking, leading to the formation of larger disks.</description>

Abstract: The number of observed giant radio sources (GRSs) has increased significantly in recent years, yet their formation mechanisms remain elusive. The discovery of giant radio galaxies within galaxy clusters has further intensified the ongoing debates. We utilize magnetohydrodynamic simulations to investigate the formation of GRSs in cluster environments. To avoid confounding the effects of power and total energy injection, we hold the energy of jet outbursts fixed and study the effect of power by varying the active duration of the jets. Furthermore, we examine the roles of magnetic, thermal, and kinetic energy components by adjusting their fractions in the jets. Additionally, we calculate radio emission for comparison with observations in the radio power-linear size diagram (P-D diagram). Finally, we also study the energy transport processes of different jets. We find the 'lower power-larger bubble' effect: lower-power jets tend to produce larger radio sources with fixed total jet energy. Regarding different energy components, jets dominated by toroidal magnetic field energy generate larger radio sources than kinetic and thermal energy-dominated jets. Conversely, strong poloidal magnetic fields hinder radio lobe growth. When injecting $2.06 \times 10^{59}$ erg into a $10^{14}$ solar mass halo, only jets with powers of approximately $10^{-4}$ to $10^{-3}$ Eddington luminosity efficiently traverse the observational region in the P-D diagram. Our findings suggest that energetic, long-lasting (low-power), continuous jets endowed with significant toroidal magnetic fields facilitate the formation of GRSs in cluster environments. However, although the jets with significantly lower power can generate substantially larger radio sources, their faintness may render them unobservable.</description>

      <title>The nature of low-luminosity AGNs discovered by JWST based on clustering analysis: progenitors of low-$z$ quasars?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08707v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has discovered many faint AGNs at high-$z$ by detecting their broad Balmer lines. However, their high number density, lack of X-ray emission, and overly high black hole masses with respect to their host stellar masses suggest that they are a distinct population from general type-1 quasars. Here, we present clustering analysis of 27 low-luminosity broad-line AGNs found by JWST (JWST AGNs) at $5&lt;z&lt;6$ based on cross-correlation analysis with 679 photometrically-selected galaxies to characterize their host dark matter halo (DMH) masses. From the angular and projected cross-correlation functions, we find that their typical DMH mass is $\log (M_\mathrm{halo}/h^{-1}\mathrm{M}_\odot) = 11.46_{-0.25}^{+0.19},$ and $11.53_{-0.20}^{+0.15}$, respectively. This result implies that the host DMHs of these AGNs are $\sim1$ dex smaller than those of luminous quasars. The DMHs of the JWST AGNs at $5&lt;z&lt;6$ are predicted to grow to $10^{12\unicode{x2013}13}\,h^{-1}\mathrm{M}_\odot$ at $z\lesssim3$, which is comparable to that of a more luminous quasar at the same epoch. Applying the empirical stellar-to-halo mass ratio to the measured DMH mass, we evaluate their host stellar mass as $\log(M_*/\mathrm{M}_\odot)=9.48_{-0.41}^{+0.31},$ and $9.60_{-0.33}^{+0.24}$, which are higher than some of those estimated by the SED fitting. We also evaluate their duty cycle as $f_\mathrm{duty}=0.37_{-0.15}^{+0.19}$ per cent, corresponding to $\sim4\times10^6$ yr as the lifetime of the JWST AGNs. While we cannot exclude the possibility that the JWST AGNs are simply low-mass type-1 quasars, these results suggest that the JWST AGNs are a different population from type-1 quasars and the progenitors of quasars at $z\lesssim3$.</description>

      <title>Calibrating baryonic feedback with weak lensing and fast radio bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.09766v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the key limitations of large-scale structure surveys of the current and future generation, such as Euclid, LSST-Rubin or Roman, is the influence of feedback processes on the distribution of matter in the Universe. This effect, called baryonic feedback, modifies the matter power spectrum on non-linear scales much stronger than any cosmological parameter of interest. Constraining these modifications is therefore key to unlock the full potential of the upcoming surveys, and we propose to do so with the help of Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs). FRBs are short, astrophysical radio transients of extragalactic origin. Their burst signal is dispersed by the free electrons in the large-scale-structure, leading to delayed arrival times at different frequencies characterised by the dispersion measure (DM). Since the dispersion measure is sensitive to the integrated line-of-sight electron density, it is a direct probe of the baryonic content of the Universe. We investigate how FRBs can break the degeneracies between cosmological and feedback parameters by correlating the observed Dispersion Measure with the weak gravitational lensing signal of a Euclid-like survey. In particular we use a simple one-parameter model controlling baryonic feedback, but we expect similar findings for more complex models. Within this model we find that $\sim 10^4$ FRBs are sufficient to constrain the baryonic feedback 10 times better than cosmic shear alone. Breaking this degeneracy will tighten the constraints considerably, for example we expect a factor of two improvement on the sum of neutrino masses</description>

      <title>Modeling Multiple X-Ray Reflection in Super-Eddington Winds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08596v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been recently discovered that a few super-Eddington sources undergoing black hole super-Eddington accretion exhibit X-ray reflection signatures. In such new systems, one expects that the coronal X-ray emissions are mainly reflected by optically thick super-Eddington winds instead of thin disks. In this paper, we conduct a series of general relativistic ray-tracing and Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations to model the X-ray reflection signatures, especially the characteristic Fe K$\alpha$ line, produced from super-Eddington accretion flows around non-spinning black holes. In particular, we allow the photons emitted by a lamppost corona to be reflected multiple times in a cone-like funnel surrounded by fast winds. We find that the Fe K$\alpha$ line profile most sensitively depends on the wind kinematics, while its exact shape also depends on the funnel open angle and corona height. Furthermore, very interestingly, we find that the Fe K$\alpha$ line can have a prominent double-peak profile in certain parameter spaces even with a face-on orientation. Moreover, we compare the Fe K$\alpha$ line profiles produced from super-Eddington and thin disks and show that such lines can provide important insights into the understanding of black hole systems undergoing super-Eddington accretion.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Galaxy Field Generation with Diffusion Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05131v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the era of precision cosmology, the ability to generate accurate and large-scale galaxy catalogs is crucial for advancing our understanding of the universe. With the flood of cosmological data from current and upcoming missions, generating theoretical predictions to compare with these observations is essential for constraining key cosmological parameters. While traditional methods, such as the Halo-Occupation Distribution (HOD), have provided foundational insights, they struggle to balance the need for both accuracy and computational efficiency. High-fidelity hydrodynamic simulations offer improved precision but are computationally expensive and resource-intensive. In this work, we introduce a novel machine learning approach that harnesses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Diffusion Models, trained on the CAMELS simulation suite, to bridge the gap between computationally inexpensive dark matter simulations and the galaxy distributions of more costly hydrodynamic simulations. Our method not only outperforms traditional HOD techniques in accuracy but also significantly accelerates the simulation process, offering a scalable solution for next-generation cosmological surveys. This advancement has the potential to revolutionize galaxy catalog generation, enabling more precise, data-driven cosmological analyses.</description>

      <title>The Temperature versus Orbital Period relation of AM CVns: Insights from their Donors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05442v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We studied the spectral energy distribution (SED) of 22 known AM~CVns with orbital periods ($P_{orb}$) larger than 35~min using multiwavelength public photometric data to estimate the effective temperature of the accreting white dwarf. We find an infrared (IR) excess in all systems when compared to a single blackbody, both when the disk should be extended and when it should be truncated by the accretor's magnetic field. This suggests a dominant contribution from the donor to the IR flux. When fitting two blackbodies, the temperature of the hot component decreases with $P_{orb}$, as expected by evolutionary models. Temperatures for systems with $35&lt;P_{orb}&lt;45~\text{min}$ are consistent with models. Systems with $P_{orb}\gtrsim45~\text{min}$ have higher temperatures than expected. The second blackbody temperature does not correlate with $P_{orb}$.</description>
