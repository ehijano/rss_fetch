      <title>Bayesian Estimation of Corporate Default Spreads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Risk-averse investors often wish to exclude stocks from their portfolios that bear high credit risk, which is a measure of a firm's likelihood of bankruptcy. This risk is commonly estimated by constructing signals from quarterly accounting items, such as debt and income volatility. While such information may provide a rich description of a firm's credit risk, the low-frequency with which the data is released implies that investors may be operating with outdated information. In this paper we circumvent this problem by developing a high-frequency credit risk proxy via corporate default spreads which are estimated from daily bond price data. We accomplish this by adapting classic yield curve estimation methods to a corporate bond setting, leveraging advances in Bayesian estimation to ensure higher model stability when working with small sample data which also allows us to directly model the uncertainty of our predictions.</description>

      <title>Complex discontinuities of $\surd\overline{\text{Fredholm determinants}}$ in the Volterra Stein-Stein model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study complex discontinuities arising from the miscomputation of the Fourier-Laplace transform in the Volterra Stein-Stein model, which involves the complex square root of a Fredholm determinant. Discontinuities occur when the determinant crosses the negative real axis. We characterize these crossings for the joint Fourier-Laplace transform of the integrated variance and log-price. Additionally, we derive a corrected formula for the Fourier-Laplace transform and develop efficient numerical techniques to detect and compute these crossings. Applying our algorithms to Fourier-based pricing in the rough Stein-Stein model, we achieve a significant increase in accuracy while drastically reducing computational cost compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>Using quantile time series and historical simulation to forecast financial risk multiple steps ahead</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20978v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A method for quantile-based, semi-parametric historical simulation estimation of multiple step ahead Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES) models is developed. It uses the quantile loss function, analogous to how the quasi-likelihood is employed by standard historical simulation methods. The returns data are scaled by the estimated quantile series, then resampling is employed to estimate the forecast distribution one and multiple steps ahead, allowing tail risk forecasting. The proposed method is applicable to any data or model where the relationship between VaR and ES does not change over time and can be extended to allow a measurement equation incorporating realized measures, thus including Realized GARCH and Realized CAViaR type models. Its finite sample properties, and its comparison with existing historical simulation methods, are evaluated via a simulation study. A forecasting study assesses the relative accuracy of the 1% and 2.5% VaR and ES one-day-ahead and ten-day-ahead forecasting results for the proposed class of models compared to several competitors.</description>
