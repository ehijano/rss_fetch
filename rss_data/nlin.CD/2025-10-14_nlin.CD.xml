      <title>Classical-quantum study of confinement in the chaotic $x^{2}y^{2}$ Yang-Mills Hamiltonian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze how quantum mechanics reinstates confinement in Hamiltonian systems that are classically unstable and exhibit chaotic dynamics. Specifically, we consider two paradigmatic models: the Contopoulos Hamiltonian, an isotropic oscillator perturbed by the quartic coupling $\alpha\, x^{2}y^{2}$, and the purely quartic Yang--Mills Hamiltonian $H=\tfrac{1}{2}(p_{x}^{2}+p_{y}^{2})+\alpha\, x^{2}y^{2}$. Classical dynamics, characterized through Poincar\'e sections, Lyapunov exponents, and periodic orbits, reveals distinct escape mechanisms: in the Contopoulos system, trajectories destabilize along the diagonal valleys $x=\pm y$ for $\alpha&lt;0$, whereas in the Yang--Mills case with $\alpha&gt;0$, escape occurs along the coordinate axes $x=0$ or $y=0$. In sharp contrast, the quantum Yang--Mills Hamiltonian with $\alpha&gt;0$ admits only discrete, normalizable eigenstates. Semiclassical WKB and full two--dimensional analyses further show that these quantum states are localized along the classical escape channels, illustrating how transverse zero--point motion generates an effective confining barrier. Our study combines global Lyapunov--exponent heat maps with high--precision quantum spectra obtained via variational and Lagrange--mesh methods, providing quantitatively controlled results across regimes. In addition, we corroborate the classical predictions through analog electronic simulations based on operational--amplifier circuit models, offering an experimentally inspired validation of the theoretical framework.</description>

      <title>Quantum chaos and semiclassical behavior in mushroom billiards II: Structure of quantum eigenstates and their phase space localization properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate eigenstate localization in the phase space of the Bunimovich mushroom billiard, a paradigmatic mixed-phase-space system whose piecewise-$C^{1}$ boundary yields a single clean separatrix between one regular and one chaotic region. By varying the stem half-width $w$, we continuously change the strength and extent of bouncing-ball stickiness in the stem, which for narrow stems gives rise to phase space localization of chaotic eigenstates. Using the Poincar\'e-Husimi (PH) representation of eigenstates we quantify localization via information entropies and inverse participation ratios of PH functions. For sufficiently wide stems the distribution of entropy localization measures converges to a two-parameter beta distribution, while entropy localization measures and inverse participation ratios across the chaotic ensemble exhibit an approximately linear relationship. Finally, the fraction of mixed (neither purely regular nor fully chaotic) eigenstates decays as a power-law in the effective semiclassical parameter, in precise agreement with the Principle of Uniform Semiclassical Condensation of Wigner functions (PUSC).</description>

      <title>On novel Hamiltonian descriptions of some three-dimensional non-conservative systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10729v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present novel Hamiltonian descriptions of some three-dimensional systems including two well-known systems describing the three-wave-interaction problem and some well-known chaotic systems, namely, the Chen, L\"u, and Qi systems. We show that all of these systems can be described in a Hamiltonian framework in which the Poisson matrix $\mathcal{J}$ is supplemented by a resistance matrix $\mathcal{R}$. While such resistive-Hamiltonian systems are manifestly non-conservative, we construct higher-degree Poisson matrices via the Jordan product as $\mathcal{N} = \mathcal{J} \mathcal{R} + \mathcal{R} \mathcal{J}$, thereby leading to new bi-Hamiltonian systems. Finally, we discuss conformal Hamiltonian dynamics on Poisson manifolds and demonstrate that by appropriately choosing the underlying parameters, the reduced three-wave-interaction model as well as the Chen and L\"u systems can be described in this manner where the concomitant non-conservative part of the dynamics is described with the aid of the Euler vector field.</description>

      <title>Structured Kolmogorov-Arnold Neural ODEs for Interpretable Learning and Symbolic Discovery of Nonlinear Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18339v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding and modeling nonlinear dynamical systems is a fundamental challenge across science and engineering. Deep learning has shown remarkable potential for capturing complex system behavior, yet achieving models that are both accurate and physically interpretable remains difficult. To address this, we propose Structured Kolmogorov-Arnold Neural ODEs (SKANODEs), a framework that integrates structured state-space modeling with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs). Within a Neural ODE architecture, SKANODE employs a fully trainable KAN as a universal function approximator to perform virtual sensing, recovering latent states that correspond to interpretable physical quantities such as displacements and velocities. Leveraging KAN's symbolic regression capability, SKANODE then extracts compact, interpretable expressions for the system's governing dynamics. Extensive experiments on simulated and real-world systems demonstrate that SKANODE achieves superior predictive accuracy, discovers physics-consistent dynamics, and reveals complex nonlinear behavior. Notably, it identifies hysteretic behavior in an F-16 aircraft and recovers a concise symbolic equation describing this phenomenon. SKANODE thus enables interpretable, data-driven discovery of physically grounded models for complex nonlinear dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Clean numerical simulation (CNS) of three-dimensional turbulent Kolmogorov flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11805v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Turbulence holds immense importance across various scientific and engineering disciplines. The direct numerical simulation (DNS) of turbulence proposed by Orszag in 1970 is a milestone in fluid mechanics, which began an era of numerical experiment for turbulence. Many researchers have reported that turbulence should be chaotic, since spatiotemporal trajectories are very sensitive to small disturbance. Thus, due to the famous butterfly-effect of chaos, unavoidable numerical noises of DNS might have great influence on spatiotemporal trajectories of turbulence. This is indeed true for a two-dimensional (2D) Kolmogorov turbulent flow, as currently revealed by a much more accurate algorithm than DNS, namely the ``clean numerical simulation'' (CNS). Different from DNS, CNS can greatly reduce both of truncation error and round-off error to any required small level so that numerical noise can be rigorously negligible throughout a time interval long enough for calculating statistics. However, In physics, 3D turbulent flow is more important than 2D turbulence. Thus, for the first time, we solve a 3D turbulent Kolmogorov flow by means of CNS in this paper, and compare our CNS result with that given by DNS in details. It is found that the spatial-temporal trajectories of the 3D Kolmogorov turbulent flow given by DNS are indeed badly polluted by numerical noise rather quickly, and besides the DNS result has significant deviations from the CNS benchmark solution not only in the spatial symmetry of flow field and the energy cascade but also even in statistics.</description>

      <title>Free Independence and Unitary Design from Random Matrix Product Unitaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00051v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unitary randomness underpins both fundamental tasks in quantum information and the modern theory of quantum chaos. On one side, a central concept is that of approximate unitary designs: circuits that look random according to small moments and for forward-in-time protocols. In a distinct setting, out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs), intensely studied as a measure of information scrambling, have recently been shown to probe freeness between Heisenberg operators, the noncommutative generalization of statistical independence. Bridging these two concepts, we study the emergence of freeness in a random matrix product unitary ensemble. We prove that, with only polynomial bond dimension, these unitaries reproduce Haar values of higher-order OTOCs for local, finite-trace observables, while traceless observables instead require exponential resources. Indeed, local observables are precisely those predicted to thermalize in chaotic many-body systems according to the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. Moreover, adding to previous literature, we show how random matrix product unitaries constitute approximate designs: we exactly compute the frame potential of the ensemble, showing convergence to the Haar value with polynomial deviations and so indicating that global observables are freely independent on-average. Our results highlight the need to refine previous notions of unitary design in the context of operator dynamics, guiding us towards protocols for quantum advantage and shedding light on the emergent complexity of chaotic many-body systems.</description>
