      <title>Fault-tolerant quantum input/output</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Usual scenarios of fault-tolerant computation are concerned with the fault-tolerant realization of quantum algorithms that compute classical functions, such as Shor's algorithm for factoring. In particular, this means that input and output to the quantum algorithm are classical. In contrast to stand-alone single-core quantum computers, in many distributed scenarios, quantum information might have to be passed on from one quantum information processing system to another one, possibly via noisy quantum communication channels with noise levels above fault-tolerant thresholds. In such situations, quantum information processing devices will have quantum inputs, quantum outputs or even both, which pass qubits among each other. Such a scenario has first been considered in the context of point-to-point communication by Christandl and M{\"u}ller-Hermes, IEEE Trans. Inf. Th. 2024.
  Working in the fault-tolerant framework of Kitaev we provide general tools for making quantum computation with quantum input and quantum output robust against circuit noise. The framework allows the direct composition of the statements, enabling versatile future application. As concrete applications, we show that encoders and decoders affected by general noise (including coherent errors) can be constructed for arbitrary linear distance communication codes. For the weaker, but standard, model of local stochastic noise, we obtain such encoders and decoders for practical communication codes, which include families of efficient coding circuits.</description>

      <title>Topological transitions in quantum jump dynamics: Hidden exceptional points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex spectra of dissipative quantum systems may exhibit degeneracies known as exceptional points (EPs). At these points the systems' dynamics may undergo a drastic change. Phenomena associated with EPs and their applications have been extensively studied in relation to various experimental platforms, including, i.a., the superconducting circuits. While most of the studies focus on EPs appearing due to the variation of the system's parameters, we focus on EPs emerging in the full counting statistics of the system. We consider a monitored three level system and find multiple EPs in the Lindbladian eigenvalues considered as functions of a counting field. We demonstrate that these EPs signify transitions between different topological classes which are rigorously characterized in terms of the braid theory. Furthermore, we identify dynamical observables affected by these transitions and demonstrate how the underlying topology can be recovered from experimentally measured quantum jump distributions. Additionally, we establish a duality between certain EPs in the Lindbladian with regard to the counting field. This allows for an experimental observation of the EP transitions, normally hidden by the Liouvillian dynamics of the system, at arbitrary times without applying postselection schemes.</description>

      <title>Classical shadows with symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical shadows (CS) have emerged as a powerful way to estimate many properties of quantum states based on random measurements and classical post-processing. In their original formulation, they come with optimal (or close to) sampling complexity guarantees for generic states and generic observables. Still, it is natural to expect to even further lower sampling requirements when equipped with a priori knowledge regarding either the underlying state or the observables. Here, we consider the case where such knowledge is provided in terms of symmetries of the unknown state or of the observables. Criterion and guidelines for symmetric shadows are provided. As a concrete example we focus on the case of permutation invariance (PI), and detail constructions of several families of PI-CSs. In particular, building on results obtained in the field of PI quantum tomography, we develop and study shallow PI-CS protocol. Benefits of these symmetric CS are demonstrated compared to established CS protocols showcasing vastly improved performances.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Pulse Shapes of an Echoed Conditional Displacement Gate in a Superconducting Bosonic System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Echoed conditional displacement (ECD) gates for bosonic systems have become the key element for real-time quantum error correction beyond the break-even point. These gates are characterized by a single complex parameter $\beta$, and can be constructed using Gaussian pulses and free evolutions with the help of an ancillary transmon qubit. We show that there is a lower bound for the gate time in the standard construction of an ECD gate. We present a method for optimizing the pulse shape of an ECD gate using a pulse-shaping technique subject to a set of experimental constraints. Our optimized pulse shapes remain symmetric, and can be applied to a range of target values of $\beta$ by tuning only the amplitude. We demonstrate that the total gate time of an ECD gate for a small value of $\beta$ can be reduced either by relaxing the no-overlap constraint on the primitives used in the standard construction or via our optimal-control method. We show a slight advantage of the optimal-control method by demonstrating a reduction in the preparation time of a $|+Z_\mathrm{GKP}&gt;$ logical state by $\thicksim$$10\%$.</description>

      <title>Lindbladian reverse engineering for general non-equilibrium steady states: A scalable null-space approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of open system dynamics is of paramount importance both from its fundamental aspects as well as from its potential applications in quantum technologies. In the simpler and most commonly studied case, the dynamics of the system can be described by a Lindblad master equation. However, identifying the Lindbladian that leads to general non-equilibrium steady states (NESS) is usually a non-trivial and challenging task. Here we introduce a method for reconstructing the corresponding Lindbaldian master equation given any target NESS, i.e., a Lindbladian Reverse Engineering ($\mathcal{L}$RE) approach. The method maps the reconstruction task to a simple linear problem. Specifically, to the diagonalization of a correlation matrix whose elements are NESS observables and whose size scales linearly (at most quadratically) with the number of terms in the Hamiltonian (Lindblad jump operator) ansatz. The kernel (null-space) of the correlation matrix corresponds to Lindbladian solutions. Moreover, the map defines an iff condition for $\mathcal{L}$RE, which works as both a necessary and a sufficient condition; thus, it not only defines, if possible, Lindbaldian evolutions leading to the target NESS, but also determines the feasibility of such evolutions in a proposed setup. We illustrate the method in different systems, ranging from bosonic Gaussian to dissipative-driven collective spins. We also discuss non-Markovian effects and possible forms to recover Markovianity in the reconstructed Lindbaldian.</description>

      <title>Distributed Quantum Computing for Chemical Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, interest in quantum computing has increased due to technological advances in quantum hardware and algorithms. Despite the promises of quantum advantage, the applicability of quantum devices has been limited to few qubits on hardware that experiences decoherence due to noise. One proposed method to get around this challenge is distributed quantum computing (DQC). Like classical distributed computing, DQC aims at increasing compute power by spreading the compute processes across many devices, with the goal to minimize the noise and circuit depth required by quantum devices. In this paper, we cover the fundamental concepts of DQC and provide insight into where the field of DQC stands with respect to the field of chemistry -- a field which can potentially be used to demonstrate quantum advantage on noisy-intermediate scale quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Overcoming the Thermal-Noise Limit of Room-Temperature Microwave Measurements by Cavity Pre-cooling with a Low-Noise Amplifier. Application to Time-resolved Electron Paramagnetic Resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate an inexpensive, bench-top method, which we here name cavity pre-cooling (CPC), for removing, just prior to performing a measurement, a large fraction of the deleterious thermal photons that would otherwise occupy the electromagnetic modes of a microwave cavity (or some alternative form of rf resonator) at room temperature. Our method repurposes the input of a commercial HEMT-based low-noise amplifier (LNA) to serve as a photon-absorbing cold load that is temporarily over-coupled to the cavity. No isolator is inserted between the LNA and the coupling port of the cavity. In a proof-of-concept experiment, the noise temperature of a monitored microwave mode drops from a little below room temperature to approx 108 K. Upon incorporating our pre-coolable cavity into a time-resolved (tr-) EPR spectrometer, a commensurate improvement in the signal-to-noise ratio is observed, corresponding to a factor-of-5 speed up over a conventional tr-EPR measurement at room temperature for the same precision and/or sensitivity. Simulations indicate the feasibility, for realistic Q factors and couplings, of cooling the temperatures of the modes of a cavity down to a few tens of K, and for this coldness to last several tens of microseconds whilst the cavity and its contents are optimally interrogated by a microwave tone or pulse sequence. The method thus provides a generally applicable and extremely convenient approach to improving the sensitivity and/or read-out speed in pulsed or time-resolved EPR spectroscopy, quantum detection and other radiometric measurements performed at or near room temperature. It also provides a first-stage cold reservoir (of microwave photons) for deeper cooling methods to work from.</description>

      <title>Constant-Time Quantum Search with a Many-Body Quantum System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optimal runtime of a quantum computer searching a database is typically cited as the square root of the number of items in the database, which is famously achieved by Grover's algorithm. With parallel oracles, however, it is possible to search faster than this. We consider a many-body quantum system that naturally effects parallel queries, and we show that its parameters can be tuned to search a database in constant time, assuming a sufficient number of interacting particles. In particular, we consider Bose-Einstein condensates with pairwise and three-body interactions in the mean-field limit, which effectively evolve by a nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with cubic and quintic nonlinearities. We solve the unstructured search problem formulated as a continuous-time quantum walk searching the complete graph in constant time. Depending on the number of marked vertices, however, the success probability can peak sharply, necessitating high precision time measurement to observe the system at this peak. Overcoming this, we prove that the relative coefficients of the cubic and quintic terms can be tuned to eliminate the need for high time-measurement precision by widening the peak in success probability or having it plateau. Finally, we derive a lower bound on the number of atoms needed for the many-body system to evolve by the effective nonlinearity.</description>

      <title>Two-Step QAOA: Enhancing Quantum Optimization by Decomposing One-Hot Constraints in QUBO Formulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) has shown promise in solving combinatorial optimization problems by leveraging quantum computational power. We propose a simple approach, the Two-Step QAOA, which aims to improve the effectiveness of QAOA by decomposing problems with one-hot encoding QUBO (Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization) formulations. By identifying and separating the problem into two stages, we transform soft constraints into hard constraints, simplifying the generation of initial conditions and enabling more efficient optimization. The method is particularly beneficial for tackling complex societal problems that often involve intricate constraint structures.</description>

      <title>Convergence to Bohmian mechanics in a de Broglie-like pilot-wave system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bohmian mechanics supplements the quantum wavefunction with deterministic particle trajectories, offering an alternate, dynamical language for quantum theory. However, the Bohmian particle does not affect its guiding wave, so the wave field must instead be prescribed by the system geometry. While this property is widely assumed necessary to ensure agreement with quantum mechanics, much work has recently been dedicated to understanding classical pilot-wave systems, which feature a two-way coupling between particle and wave. These systems, including the "walking droplet" system of Couder and Fort (2006) and its various abstractions, allow us to investigate the limits of classical systems and offer a touchstone between quantum and classical dynamics. In this work, we present a general result that bridges Bohmian mechanics with this classical pilot-wave theory. Namely, Darrow and Bush (2024) recently introduced a Lagrangian pilot-wave framework to study quantum-like behaviours in classical systems; with a particular choice of particle-wave coupling, they recover key dynamics hypothesised in de Broglie's early "double-solution" theory. We here show that, with a different choice of coupling, their de Broglie-like system reduces exactly to single-particle Bohmian mechanics in the non-relativistic limit. Finally, we present an application of the present work in developing an analogue for position measurement in a de Broglie-like setting.</description>

      <title>The trouble with pilot-wave theory: a critical evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objections to pilot-wave theory frequently come in three mutually-contradictory categories: that the theory is too bizarrely different from ordinary physics, that the theory is not radically different enough, and that the physics of pilot-wave theory is after all just the same as quantum physics. After a brief review of pilot-wave theory, we critically evaluate these objections. We show how the radical nature of pilot-wave theory is often misunderstood or overlooked. We highlight the novelty of its dynamics, and clarify its implications for our understanding of measurement, as well as discussing the status of Lorentz invariance, conservation laws, and the Born rule. We examine Einstein's early work on pilot-wave theory and argue that he turned away from it for reasons which are no longer compelling. We urge that the theory be understood on its own terms, as a generalised nonequilibrium theory empirically distinct from quantum mechanics, with all its potentially revolutionary implications.</description>

      <title>Efficient Quantum Gradient and Higher-order Derivative Estimation via Generalized Hadamard Test</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computing, parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) represent a promising paradigm for tackling challenges in quantum sensing, optimal control, optimization, and machine learning on near-term quantum hardware. Gradient-based methods are crucial for understanding the behavior of PQCs and have demonstrated substantial advantages in the convergence rates of Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) compared to gradient-free methods. However, existing gradient estimation methods, such as Finite Difference, Parameter Shift Rule, Hadamard Test, and Direct Hadamard Test, often yield suboptimal gradient circuits for certain PQCs. To address these limitations, we introduce the Flexible Hadamard Test, which, when applied to first-order gradient estimation methods, can invert the roles of ansatz generators and observables. This inversion facilitates the use of measurement optimization techniques to efficiently compute PQC gradients. Additionally, to overcome the exponential cost of evaluating higher-order partial derivatives, we propose the $k$-fold Hadamard Test, which computes the $k^{th}$-order partial derivative using a single circuit. Furthermore, we introduce Quantum Automatic Differentiation (QAD), a unified gradient method that adaptively selects the best gradient estimation technique for individual parameters within a PQC. This represents the first implementation, to our knowledge, that departs from the conventional practice of uniformly applying a single method to all parameters. Through rigorous numerical experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed first-order gradient methods, showing up to an $O(N)$ factor improvement in circuit execution count for real PQC applications. Our research contributes to the acceleration of VQA computations, offering practical utility in the NISQ era of quantum computing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An operator $T\in B(H)$ is said to satisfy property ($UW${\scriptsize \it{E}}) if the complement in the approximate point spectrum of the essential approximate point spectrum coincides with the isolated eigenvalues of the spectrum. Via the CI spectrum induced by consistent invertibility property of operators, we explore property ($UW${\scriptsize \it{E}}) for $T$ and $T^\ast$ simultaneously. Furthermore, the transfer of property ($UW${\scriptsize \it{E}}) from $T$ to $f(T)$ and $f(T^{\ast})$ is obtained, where $f$ is a function which is analytic in a neighborhood of the spectrum of $T$. At last, with the help of the so-called $(A,B)$ entanglement stable spectra, the entanglement stability of property ($UW${\scriptsize \it{E}}) for $2\times 2$ upper triangular operator matrices is investigated.</description>

      <title>SuperEncoder: Towards Universal Neural Approximate Quantum State Preparation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerous quantum algorithms operate under the assumption that classical data has already been converted into quantum states, a process termed Quantum State Preparation (QSP). However, achieving precise QSP requires a circuit depth that scales exponentially with the number of qubits, making it a substantial obstacle in harnessing quantum advantage. Recent research suggests using a Parameterized Quantum Circuit (PQC) to approximate a target state, offering a more scalable solution with reduced circuit depth compared to precise QSP. Despite this, the need for iterative updates of circuit parameters results in a lengthy runtime, limiting its practical application. In this work, we demonstrate that it is possible to leverage a pre-trained neural network to directly generate the QSP circuit for arbitrary quantum state, thereby eliminating the significant overhead of online iterations. Our study makes a steady step towards a universal neural designer for approximate QSP.</description>

      <title>Distributing quantum correlations through local operations and classical resources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributing quantum correlations to each node of a network is a key aspect of quantum networking. Here, we present a robust, physically-motivated protocol by which global quantum correlations, as characterised by the discord, can be distributed to quantum memories using a mixed state of information carriers which possess only classical correlations. In addition to this, said distribution is measurement-outcome independent, and the distribution is done using only bilocal unitary operations and projective measurements. We also explore the scaling of this protocol for larger networks and illustrate the structure of the quantum correlations, showing its dependence on the local operations performed.</description>

Abstract: The Hierarchical Equations of Motion (HEOM) method has become one of the cornerstones in the simulation of open quantum systems and their dynamics. It is commonly referred to as a non-perturbative method. Yet, there are certain instances, where the necessary truncation of the hierarchy of auxiliary density operators seems to introduce errors which are not fully controllable. We investigate the nature and causes of this type of critical error both in the case of pure decoherence, where exact results are available for comparison, and in the spin-boson system, a full system-reservoir model. We find that truncating the hierarchy to any finite size can be problematic for strong coupling to a dissipative reservoir, in particular when combined with an appreciable reservoir memory time.</description>

      <title>Quantum geometry and geometric entanglement entropy of one-dimensional Floquet topological matter</title>

Abstract: The geometry of quantum states could offer indispensable insights for characterizing the topological properties, phase transitions and entanglement nature of many-body systems. In this work, we reveal the quantum geometry and the associated entanglement entropy (EE) of Floquet topological states in one-dimensional periodically driven systems. The quantum metric tensors of Floquet states are found to show non-analytic signatures at topological phase transition points. Away from the transition points, the bipartite geometric EE of Floquet states exhibits an area-law scaling vs the system size, which holds for a Floquet band at any filling fractions. For a uniformly filled Floquet band, the EE further becomes purely quantum geometric. At phase transition points, the geometric EE scales logarithmically with the system size and displays cusps in the nearby parameter ranges. These discoveries are demonstrated by investigating typical Floquet models including periodically driven spin chains, Floquet topological insulators and superconductors. Our findings uncover the rich quantum geometries of Floquet states, unveiling the geometric origin of EE for gapped Floquet topological phases, and introducing information-theoretic means of depicting topological transitions in Floquet systems.</description>

      <title>Complexity of two-level systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complexity of two-level systems, e.g. spins, qubits, magnetic moments etc, are analysed based on the so-called correlational entropy in the case of pure quantum systems and the thermal entropy in case of thermal equilibrium that are suitable quantities essentially free from basis dependence. The complexity is defined as the difference between the Shannon-entropy and the second order R\'enyi-entropy, where the latter is connected to the traditional participation measure or purity. It is shown that the system attains maximal complexity for special choice of control parameters, i.e. strength of disorder either in the presence of noise of the energy states or the presence of disorder in the off diagonal coupling. It is shown that such a noise or disorder dependence provides a basis free analysis and gives meaningful insights. We also look at similar entropic complexity of spins in thermal equilibrium for a paramagnet at finite temperature, $T$ and magnetic field $B$, as well as the case of an Ising model in the mean-field approximation. As a result all examples provide important evidence that the investigation of the entropic complexity parameters help to get deeper understanding in the behavior of these systems.</description>

      <title>Pauli Check Sandwiching for Quantum Characterization and Error Mitigation during Runtime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a novel quantum system characterization and error mitigation framework that applies Pauli check sandwiching (PCS). We motivate our work with prior art in software optimizations for quantum programs like noise-adaptive mapping and multi-programming, and we introduce the concept of PCS while emphasizing design considerations for its practical use. We show that by carefully embedding Pauli checks within a target application (i.e. a quantum circuit), we can learn quantum system noise profiles. Further, PCS combined with multi-programming unlocks non-trivial fidelity improvements in quantum program outcomes.</description>

Abstract: Quantum network simulation is an essential step towards developing applications for quantum networks and determining minimal requirements for the network hardware. As it is with classical networking, a simulation ecosystem allows for application development, standardization, and overall community building. Currently, there is limited traction towards building a quantum networking community-there are limited open-source platforms, challenging frameworks with steep learning curves, and strong requirements of software engineering skills. Our Quantum Network Development Kit (QNDK) project aims to solve these issues. It includes a graphical user interface to easily develop and run quantum network simulations with very little code. It integrates various quantum network simulation engines and provides a single interface to them, allowing users to use the features from any of them. Further, it deploys simulation execution in a cloud environment, offloading strong computing requirements to a high-performance computing system. In this paper, we detail the core features of the QNDK and outline the development roadmap to enabling virtual quantum testbeds.</description>

      <title>Robustness and classical proxy of entanglement in variants of quantum walk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum walk (QW) utilizes its internal quantum states to decide the displacement, thereby introducing single-particle entanglement between the internal and positional degrees of freedom. By simulating three variants of QW with the conventional, symmetric, and split-step translation operators with or without classical randomness in the coin operator, we show the entanglement is robust against both time- and spatially- dependent randomness, which can cause localization transitions of QW. We propose a classical quantity call overlap, which literally measures the overlap between the probability distributions of the internal states, as a proxy of entanglement. The overlap captures the inverse behavior of the entanglement entropy in most cases, which can be explained by analyzing the structure of the total wave function of the walker. We test the limitation of the classical proxy by constructing a special case with high population imbalance between the internal states to blind the overlap. Possible implications and experimental measurements are also discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Secure multiparty computation enables the joint evaluation of multivariate functions across distributed users while ensuring the privacy of their local inputs. This field has become increasingly urgent due to the exploding demand for computationally intensive deep learning inference. These computations are typically offloaded to cloud computing servers, leading to vulnerabilities that can compromise the security of the clients' data. To solve this problem, we introduce a linear algebra engine that leverages the quantum nature of light for information-theoretically secure multiparty computation using only conventional telecommunication components. We apply this linear algebra engine to deep learning and derive rigorous upper bounds on the information leakage of both the deep neural network weights and the client's data via the Holevo and the Cram\'er-Rao bounds, respectively. Applied to the MNIST classification task, we obtain test accuracies exceeding $96\%$ while leaking less than $0.1$ bits per weight symbol and $0.01$ bits per data symbol. This weight leakage is an order of magnitude below the minimum bit precision required for accurate deep learning using state-of-the-art quantization techniques. Our work lays the foundation for practical quantum-secure computation and unlocks secure cloud deep learning as a field.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric EPR Steering in a Cavity-Magnon System Generated by a Squeezed Vacuum Field and an Optical Parametric Amplifier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a cavity-magnon system with two magnon modes coupled to a common cavity microwave field. The cavity is integrated with an optical parametric amplifier (OPA) and driven by a squeezed vacuum field. The introduction of the OPA and the squeezed vacuum field induce squeezing in the cavity mode, which is transferred to the magnon modes through magnetic dipole interactions. Our findings demonstrate that enhancing the OPA gain and the squeezing parameter significantly enhances the quantum entanglement and the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering. Furthermore, the photon-magnon coupling strength can be adjusted to control the directionality of EPR steering, offering a mechanism for achieving one-way EPR steering under specific conditions. This control is fine-tuned by varying system parameters, thereby providing a robust platform for steering in the presence of thermal noise. Our findings advance the understanding of macroscopic quantum correlations and hold promising implications for quantum information processing, particularly in generating, manipulating, and enhancing quantum steering phenomena. This practical aspect of our research will inspire hope for future applications in the field of quantum information.</description>

      <title>Sustainable Quantum Computing: Opportunities and Challenges of Benchmarking Carbon in the Quantum Computing Lifecycl</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While researchers in both industry and academia are racing to build Quantum Computing (QC) platforms with viable performance and functionality, the environmental impacts of this endeavor, such as its carbon footprint, e-waste generation, mineral use, and water and energy consumption, remain largely unknown. A similar oversight occurred during the semiconductor revolution and continues to have disastrous consequences for the health of our planet. As we build the quantum computing stack from the ground up, it is crucial to comprehensively assess it through an environmental sustainability lens for its entire life-cycle: production, use, and disposal. In this paper, we highlight the need and challenges in establishing a QC sustainability benchmark that enables researchers to make informed architectural design decisions and celebrate the potential quantum environmental advantage. We propose a carbon-aware quantum computing (CQC) framework that provides the foundational methodology and open research questions for calculating the total life-cycle carbon footprint of a QC platform. Our call to action to the research community is the establishment of a new research direction known as, sustainable quantum computing that promotes both quantum computing for sustainability-oriented applications and the sustainability of quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Optimal overlapping tomography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characterising large scale quantum systems is central for fundamental physics as well as for applications of quantum technologies. While a full characterisation requires exponentially increasing effort, focusing on application-relevant information can often lead to significantly simplified analysis. Overlapping tomography is such a scheme, which allows to obtain all the information contained in specific subsystems of multi-particle quantum systems in an efficient manner, but the ultimate limits of this approach remained elusive. We present protocols for optimal overlapping tomography with respect to different figures of merit. First, by providing algorithmic approaches based on graph theory we find the optimal scheme for Pauli measurements on qubits, relating it to the problem of covering arrays in combinatorics. This significantly reduces the measurement effort, showing for instance that two-body overlapping tomography of nearest neighbours in multiqubit quantum systems can always be performed with nine Pauli settings. Second, we prove that the optimal scheme using general projective measurements requires only $3^k$ settings to reconstruct all $k$-body marginals, independently of the system size. Finally, we demonstrate the practical applicability of our methods in a six-photon experiment. Our results will find applications in learning noise and interaction patterns in quantum computers as well as characterising fermionic systems in quantum chemistry.</description>

      <title>Phase Transition in the Quantum Capacity of Quantum Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: After many years of intensive study of quantum quantum channels, determining their capacities has remained an extremely challenging problem, despite its fundamental importance. Even determining lower and upper bounds for capacities of quantum channels has proved to be very difficult. It is therefore urgently needed to know at least, when the quantum capacity of a channel vanishes. In this paper, we prove that the quantum capacity of every quantum channel $\Lambda$, when contaminated by white noise, as in $\Lambda_x (\rho):=(1-x)\Lambda(\rho)+\frac{x}{d}I_d$, drops to zero when $x\geq \frac{1}{2}$. To this end, we prove that the depolarizing channel with $x\geq \frac{1}{2}$ is anti-degradable and find the exact form of the channel that connects the channel and its complement. The zero capacity region that we find for this channel is significantly larger than the previously found region of entanglement-binding which depends on dimension and is given by $x\geq \frac{d}{d+1}$.</description>

      <title>Moderate Exponential-time Quantum Dynamic Programming Across the Subsets for Scheduling Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grover Search is currently one of the main quantum algorithms leading to hybrid quantum-classical methods that reduce the worst-case time complexity for some combinatorial optimization problems. Specifically, the combination of Quantum Minimum Finding (obtained from Grover Search) with dynamic programming has proved particularly efficient in improving the complexity of NP-hard problems currently solved by classical dynamic programming. For these problems, the classical dynamic programming complexity in $\mathcal{O}^*(c^n)$, where $\mathcal{O}^*$ denotes that polynomial factors are ignored, can be reduced by a hybrid algorithm to $\mathcal{O}^*(c_{quant}^n)$, with $c_{quant} &lt; c$. In this paper, we provide a bounded-error hybrid algorithm that achieves such an improvement for a broad class of NP-hard single-machine scheduling problems for which we give a generic description. Moreover, we extend this algorithm to tackle the 3-machine flowshop problem. Our algorithm reduces the exponential-part complexity compared to the best-known classical algorithm, sometimes at the cost of an additional pseudo-polynomial factor.</description>

      <title>Observability and Predictability in Quantum and Post-Quantum Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I introduce a framework to distinguish two domains of physics - the manifest (i.e. the directly observable empirical records in terms of manifest configurations) and the non-manifest domain of physics (i.e. the things that the manifest configurations signify according to a physical theory). I show that many quantum 'paradoxes' rest on ambiguous reasoning about the two domains. More concretely, I study so-called 'surrealistic' trajectories, the 'delayed choice quantum eraser', and 'weak measurements'. Finally, I show how the alleged puzzles resolve in the framework provided. I then formally define and address the question of whether quantum uncertainty could be fundamental or whether post-quantum theories could have predictive advantage whilst conforming to the Born rule on average. This notion of what I call 'empirical completeness' refers to actual prediction-making beyond the Born probabilities, and thus delineates the operational notion of predictability from a 'hidden variable' programme in quantum theory. I study how empirical completeness connects to signal-locality, and argue that a partial proof for the impossibility of predictive advantage can be established for bi-partite quantum systems. The relevant results demonstrate signal-locality as a sufficient principle that might explain the fundamental chanciness in present and future quantum theories and, in turn, reconciles us to many quantum features as aspects of limits on Nature's predictability.</description>

Abstract: Quantum discord goes beyond entanglement and exists in a wide range of quantum states that may be separable, playing a crucial role in quantum information tasks. In this paper, we firstly proposed a zero-discord criterion for two-qubit system based on the partial transposition of density matrix, and then extended it to the qubit-qudit system. By detailed examples we demonstrate the effectiveness of these criteria in detecting discord. Moreover, we provide an analytical lower bound of geometric quantum discord(GQD) using eigenvalue vectors of density matrix. Finally, we presented a one-way work deficit lower bound based on our lower bound of GQD.</description>

Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) has recently made significant advancements in various topics. Despite the successes, the safety and interpretability of QML applications have not been thoroughly investigated. This work proposes using Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) for activation mapping to enhance model transparency, introducing the Quantum Gradient Class Activation Map (QGrad-CAM). This hybrid quantum-classical computing framework leverages both quantum and classical strengths and gives access to the derivation of an explicit formula of feature map importance. Experimental results demonstrate significant, fine-grained, class-discriminative visual explanations generated across both image and speech datasets.</description>

      <title>Closed-Loop Designed Open-Loop Control of Quantum Systems: An Error Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Lyapunov control, an important class of quantum control methods, aims at generating converging dynamics guided by Lyapunov-based theoretical tools. However, unlike the case of classical systems, disturbance caused by quantum measurement hinders direct and exact realization of the theoretical feedback dynamics designed with Lyapunov theory. Regarding this issue, the idea of closed-loop designed open-loop control has been mentioned in literature, which means to design the closed-loop dynamics theoretically, simulate the closed-loop system, generate control pulses based on simulation and apply them to the real plant in an open-loop fashion. Based on bilinear quantum control model, we analyze in this article the error, i.e., difference between the theoretical and real systems' time-evolved states, incurred by the procedures of closed-loop designed open-loop control. It is proved that the error at an arbitrary time converges to a unitary transformation of initialization error as the number of simulation grids between 0 and that time tends to infinity. Moreover, it is found that once the simulation accuracy reaches a certain level, adopting more accurate (thus possibly more expensive) numerical simulation methods does not efficiently improve convergence. We also present an upper bound on the error norm and an example to illustrate our results.</description>

      <title>Quantum Annealing-Based Algorithm for Efficient Coalition Formation Among LEO Satellites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing number of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites, driven by lower manufacturing and launch costs, is proving invaluable for Earth observation missions and low-latency internet connectivity. However, as the number of satellites increases, the number of communication links to maintain also rises, making the management of this vast network increasingly challenging and highlighting the need for clustering satellites into efficient groups as a promising solution. This paper formulates the clustering of LEO satellites as a coalition structure generation (CSG) problem and leverages quantum annealing to solve it. We represent the satellite network as a graph and obtain the optimal partitions using a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm called GCS-Q. The algorithm follows a top-down approach by iteratively splitting the graph at each step using a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) formulation. To evaluate our approach, we utilize real-world three-line element set (TLE/3LE) data for Starlink satellites from Celestrak. Our experiments, conducted using the D-Wave Advantage annealer and the state-of-the-art solver Gurobi, demonstrate that the quantum annealer significantly outperforms classical methods in terms of runtime while maintaining the solution quality. The performance achieved with quantum annealers surpasses the capabilities of classical computers, highlighting the transformative potential of quantum computing in optimizing the management of large-scale satellite networks.</description>

      <title>Pauli Flow on Open Graphs with Unknown Measurement Labels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One-way quantum computation, or measurement-based quantum computation, is a universal model of quantum computation alternative to the circuit model. The computation progresses by measurements of a pre-prepared resource state together with corrections of undesired outcomes via applications of Pauli gates to yet unmeasured qubits. The fundamental question of this model is determining whether computation can be implemented deterministically. Pauli flow is one of the most general structures guaranteeing determinism. It is also essential for polynomial time ancilla-free circuit extraction. It is known how to efficiently determine the existence of Pauli flow given an open graph together with a measurement labelling (a choice of measurements to be performed).
  In this work, we focus on the problem of deciding the existence of Pauli flow for a given open graph when the measurement labelling is unknown. We show that this problem is in RP by providing a random polynomial time algorithm. To do it, we extend previous algebraic interpretations of Pauli flow, by showing that, in the case of X and Z measurements only, flow existence corresponds to the right-invertibility of a matrix derived from the adjacency matrix. We also use this interpretation to show that the number of output qubits can always be reduced to match the number of input qubits while preserving the existence of flow.</description>

      <title>Quantum Algorithms for Compositional Text Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing and AI have found a fruitful intersection in the field of natural language processing. We focus on the recently proposed DisCoCirc framework for natural language, and propose a quantum adaptation, QDisCoCirc. This is motivated by a compositional approach to rendering AI interpretable: the behavior of the whole can be understood in terms of the behavior of parts, and the way they are put together. For the model-native primitive operation of text similarity, we derive quantum algorithms for fault-tolerant quantum computers to solve the task of question-answering within QDisCoCirc, and show that this is BQP-hard; note that we do not consider the complexity of question-answering in other natural language processing models. Assuming widely-held conjectures, implementing the proposed model classically would require super-polynomial resources. Therefore, it could provide a meaningful demonstration of the power of practical quantum processors. The model construction builds on previous work in compositional quantum natural language processing. Word embeddings are encoded as parameterized quantum circuits, and compositionality here means that the quantum circuits compose according to the linguistic structure of the text. We outline a method for evaluating the model on near-term quantum processors, and elsewhere we report on a recent implementation of this on quantum hardware. In addition, we adapt a quantum algorithm for the closest vector problem to obtain a Grover-like speedup in the fault-tolerant regime for our model. This provides an unconditional quadratic speedup over any classical algorithm in certain circumstances, which we will verify empirically in future work.</description>

Abstract: We propose a bidirectional quantum teleportation protocol in continuous variables. We use a cluster state in continuous variables as the main resource to realize this protocol. In the paper, we obtain a family of configurations of cluster states in continuous variables that can be used to realize the bidirectional quantum teleportation protocol. From the whole family of configurations, we have chosen those that realize the protocol with the smallest possible error.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum synchronization among many spins is an intriguing domain of research. In this paper, we explore the quantum synchronization of two finite chains of spin-1/2 particles, via a nonlinear interaction mediated by a a central intermediary spin chain. We introduce a novel approach using the Holstein-Primakoff transformation to treat the spin chains as pseudo-bosonic systems and thereby applying the synchronization criteria for harmonic oscillators. Our theoretical framework and numerical simulations reveal that under optimal conditions, the spin chains can achieve both classical and perfect quantum synchronization. We show that quantum synchronization is robust against variations in the number of spins and inter-spin coupling, though may be affected by thermal noise. This work advances the understanding of synchronization in multi-spin systems and introduces a generalized synchronization measure for both bosons and fermions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Broadband impedance-matched Josephson parametric amplifiers are key components for high-fidelity single-shot multi-qubit readout. Nowadays, several types of impedance matched parametric amplifiers have been proposed: the first is an impedance-matched parametric amplifier based on a Klopfenstein taper, and the second is an impedance-matched parametric amplifier based on auxiliary resonators. Here, we present the quantum-limited 3-wave-mixing lumped-element SNAIL parametric amplifier with two-units impedance matching transformer. A two-pole Chebyshev matching network with shunted resonators based on parallel-plate capacitors and superconducting planar coil. Operating in a flux-pumped mode, we experimentally demonstrate an average gain of $15dB$ across a $600MHz$ bandwidth, along with an average saturation power of $-107dBm$ and quantum-limited noise temperature.</description>

      <title>Contextual Subspace Auxiliary-Field Quantum Monte Carlo: Improved bias with reduced quantum resources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using trial wavefunctions prepared on quantum devices to reduce the bias of auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (QC-AFQMC) has established itself as a promising hybrid approach to the simulation of strongly correlated many body systems. Here, we further reduce the required quantum resources by decomposing the trial wavefunction into classical and quantum parts, respectively treated by classical and quantum devices, within the contextual subspace projection formalism. Importantly, we show that our algorithm is compatible with the recently developed matchgate shadow protocol for efficient overlap calculation in QC-AFQMC. Investigating the nitrogen dimer and the reductive decomposition of ethylene carbonate in lithium-based batteries, we observe that our method outperforms a number of established algorithm for ground state energy computations, while reaching chemical accuracy with less than half of the original number of qubits.</description>

      <title>A more generalized two-qubit symmetric quantum joint measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A standard two-qubit joint measurement is the well-known Bell state measurement (BSM), in which each reduced state (traced out one qubit) is the completely mixed state. Recently, a novel quantum joint measurement named elegant joint measurement (EJM) has been proposed, where the reduced states of the EJM basis have tetrahedral symmetry. In this work, we first suggest a five-parameter entangled state and reveal its inherent symmetry. Based on this, we define a more generalized EJM parameterized by $z$, $\varphi$ and $\theta$, and provide the quantum circuits for preparing and detecting these basis states. There are three main results: (i) the previous single-parameter EJM can be directly obtained by specifying the parameters $z$ and $\varphi$; (ii) the initial unit vectors related to the four vertices of the regular tetrahedron are not limited to the original choice and not all the unit vectors in cylindrical coordinates are suitable for forming the EJM basis; and (iii) the reduced states of the present EJM basis can always form two mirrorimage tetrahedrons, robustly preserving its elegant properties. We focus on figuring out what kind of states the EJM basis belongs to and providing a method for constructing the more generalized three-parameter EJM, which may contribute to the multi-setting measurement and the potential applications for quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Pauli Decomposition via the Fast Walsh-Hadamard Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The decomposition of a square matrix into a sum of Pauli strings is a classical pre-processing step required to realize many quantum algorithms. Such a decomposition requires significant computational resources for large matrices. We present a new exact and explicit formula for the Pauli string coefficients which inspires an efficient algorithm to compute them. More specifically, we show that up to a permutation of the matrix elements, the decomposition coefficients are related to the original matrix by a multiplication of a generalised Hadamard matrix. This allows one to use the Fast Walsh-Hadamard transform and calculate all Pauli decomposition coefficients in $\mathcal{O}(N^2\log N)$ time and using $\mathcal{O}(1)$ additional memory, for an $N\times N$ matrix. A numerical implementation of our equation outperforms currently available solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The phenomenon of Parametric Resonance (PR) is very well studied in classical systems with one of the textbook examples being the stabilization of a Kapitza's pendulum in the inverted configuration when the suspension point is oscillated vertically. One important aspect that distinguishes between classical PR and ordinary resonance is that in the former, if the initial energy of the system is at its minimum (${\dot x}={x}=0$), the system does not evolve. In a quantum system, however, even when the system is in the minimum energy (ground) state, the system has non-trivial evolution under PR due to the delocalized nature of the ground state wavefunction. Here we study the evolution of such a system which exhibits a purely quantum effect with no classical analog. In particular, we focus on the quantum mechanical analog of PR by varying with time the parabolic potential i.e. the frequency of the quantum harmonic oscillator</description>

      <title>Overcoming the Zero-Rate Hashing Bound with Holographic Quantum Error Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several recent techniques for modifying topological codes with single-qubit Clifford operators have shown high resilience against pure Pauli noise. Paramount to these findings has been the demonstration that several variants exhibit error thresholds often attaining or exceeding the zero-rate hashing bound, a known benchmark for code-capacity noise channels, for biased noise. Additionally, direct comparison with the hashing bound has shown that several topological codes outperform the hashing bound at points of finite Pauli noise biases. Motivated by these observations, we study zero-rate holographic quantum error correction codes, discovering very high threshold values under diverse and finitely-biased noise channels using a tensor-network decoding approach. Our results establish that all codes tested achieve or surpass the hashing bound at various points, ranging from pure 2-Pauli noise ($\eta = 0$) to pure 1-Pauli noise ($\eta = +\infty$), thereby demonstrating that holographic codes exhibit excellent error tolerance in the code-capacity picture. Such findings imply the existence of a structured and systematic method for constructing high-threshold codes suitable for realistically motivated noise channels. To our knowledge, this work is also the first instance of such remarkable threshold behavior in stabilizer quantum codes for the pure 2-Pauli noise regime, as well as for finitely-biased noise channels.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a protocol that maximizes unconditional entanglement generation between two masses interacting directly through $1/r^{n}$ potential. The protocol combines optimal quantum control of continuously measured masses with their non-equilibrium dynamics, driven by a time-dependent interaction strength. Applied to a pair of optically trapped sub-micron particles coupled via electrostatic interaction, our protocol enables unconditional entanglement generation at the fundamental limit of the conditional state and with an order of magnitude smaller interaction between the masses compared to the existing steady-state approaches.</description>

Abstract: We consider the following task: suppose an algorithm is given copies of an unknown $n$-qubit quantum state $|\psi\rangle$ promised $(i)$ $|\psi\rangle$ is $\varepsilon_1$-close to a stabilizer state in fidelity or $(ii)$ $|\psi\rangle$ is $\varepsilon_2$-far from all stabilizer states, decide which is the case. We give a $\textsf{poly}(1/\varepsilon_1)$-sample and $n\cdot \textsf{poly}(1/\varepsilon_1)$-time algorithm for this task for every $\varepsilon_1&gt;0$ and $\varepsilon_2\leq 2^{-\textsf{poly}(1/\varepsilon_1)}$. Our proof includes a new definition of Gowers norm for quantum states, an inverse theorem for the Gowers-$3$ norm of states and new bounds on stabilizer covering for structured subsets of Paulis using results in additive combinatorics.</description>

      <title>Stabilizer Entanglement Distillation and Efficient Fault-Tolerant Encoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement is essential for quantum information processing but is limited by noise. We address this by developing high-yield entanglement distillation protocols with several advancements. (1) We extend the 2-to-1 recurrence entanglement distillation protocol to higher-rate n-to-(n-1) protocols that can correct any single-qubit errors. These protocols are evaluated through numerical simulations focusing on fidelity and yield. We also outline a method to adapt any classical error-correcting code for entanglement distillation, where the code can correct both bit-flip and phase-flip errors by incorporating Hadamard gates. (2) We propose a constant-depth decoder for stabilizer codes that transforms logical states into physical ones using single-qubit measurements. This decoder is applied to entanglement distillation protocols, reducing circuit depth and enabling protocols derived from advanced quantum error-correcting codes. We demonstrate this by evaluating the circuit complexity for entanglement distillation protocols based on surface codes and quantum convolutional codes. (3) Our stabilizer entanglement distillation techniques advance quantum computing. We propose a fault-tolerant protocol for constant-depth encoding and decoding of arbitrary quantum states, applicable to quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes and surface codes. This protocol is feasible with state-of-the-art reconfigurable atom arrays and surpasses the limits of conventional logarithmic depth encoders. Overall, our study integrates stabilizer formalism, measurement-based quantum computing, and entanglement distillation, advancing both quantum communication and computing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Ruelle-Pollicott resonances in translationally invariant quantum many-body systems via spectra of momentum-resolved operator propagator on infinite systems. Momentum dependence gives insight into decay of correlation functions, showing that, depending on their symmetries, different correlation functions in general decay with different rates. Focusing on the kicked Ising model the spectrum seems to be typically composed of an annular random matrix like ring whose size we theoretically predict, and few isolated resonances. We identify several interesting regimes, including a mixing regime with a power-law decay of correlation functions. In that regime we also observe a huge difference in time-scales of different correlation functions. An exact expression for the singular values of the operator propagator is conjectured, showing that it becomes singular at a special point.</description>

Abstract: The uncertainty principle is one of quantum theory's most foundational features. It underpins a quantum phenomenon called measurement incompatibility -- two physical observables of a single quantum system may not always be measured simultaneously. Apart from being fundamentally important, measurement incompatibility is also a powerful resource in the broad quantum science and technologies, with wide applications to cryptography, communication, random number generation, and device-independent tasks. Since every physical system is unavoidably subject to noise, an important, yet still open, question is how to characterise the ability of noisy quantum dynamics to preserve measurement incompatibility. This work fills this gap by providing the first resource theory of this ability, termed incompatibility preservability. We quantify incompatibility preservability by a robustness measure. Then, we introduce an operational task, entanglement-assisted filter game, to completely characterise both the robustness measure and the conversion of incompatibility preservability. Our results provide a general framework to describe how noisy dynamics affect the uncertainty principle's signature.</description>

      <title>Generation of hypercubic cluster states in 1-4 dimensions in a simple optical system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entangled graph states can be used for quantum sensing and computing applications. Error correction in measurement-based quantum computing schemes will require the construction of cluster states in at least 3 dimensions. Here we generate 1-, 2-, 3-, and 4-dimensional optical frequency-mode cluster states by sending broadband 2-mode vacuum-squeezed light through an electro-optical modulator (EOM) driven with multiple frequencies. We create the squeezed light using 4-wave mixing in Rb atomic vapor and mix the sideband frequencies (qumodes) using an EOM, as proposed by Zhu et al. (1), producing a pattern of entanglement correlations that constitute continuous-variable graph states containing up to several hundred qumodes. We verify the entanglement structure by using homodyne measurements to construct the covariance matrices and evaluate the nullifiers. This technique enables scaling of optical cluster states to multiple dimensions without increasing loss.</description>

      <title>Entanglement and the density matrix renormalisation group in the generalised Landau paradigm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We leverage the interplay between gapped phases and dualities of symmetric one-dimensional quantum lattice models to demonstrate that every phase is efficiently characterised by the maximal breaking of the dual (genereralised) symmetry whose structure encodes the quasiparticle excitations. This result has strong implications for the complexity of simulating many-body systems using variational tensor network methods. For every phase in the phase diagram, the dual representation of the ground state that breaks all symmetries minimises both the entanglement entropy and the required number of variational parameters. We demonstrate the applicability of this idea by developing a generalised density matrix renormalisation group algorithm that works on (dual) constrained Hilbert spaces, and quantify the computational gains obtained over traditional DMRG methods in a perturbed Heisenberg model. Our work testifies to the usefulness of generalised non-invertible symmetries and their formal category theoretic description for the nuts and bolts simulation of strongly correlated systems.</description>

      <title>Measuring central charge on a universal quantum processor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Central charge is a fundamental quantity in conformal field theories (CFT), and plays a crucial role in determining universality classes of critical points in two-dimensional systems. Despite its significance, the measurement of central charge has remained elusive thus far. In this work, we present the first experimental determination of the central charge using a universal quantum processor. Using a classically optimized variational quantum circuit and employing advanced error mitigation techniques, we successfully prepare ground states of various $1+1D$ quantum spin chain models at their critical point. Leveraging the heavy-hex structure of IBM quantum processors, we are able to implement periodic boundary conditions and mitigate boundary effects. We then extract the central charge from the scaling behavior of the sub-leading term of R{\'{e}}nyi generalizations of classical Shannon entropy, computed for local Pauli measurements in the conformal bases ($\sigma^{z}$ and $\sigma^x$). The experimental results are consistent with the known central charge values for the transverse field Ising (TFI) chain ($c=0.5$) and the XXZ chain ($c=1$), achieving relative errors as low as 5 percent.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Embedding techniques allow the efficient description of correlations within localized fragments of large molecular systems, while accounting for their environment at a lower level of theory. We introduce FragPT2: a novel embedding framework that addresses multiple interacting active fragments. Fragments are assigned separate active spaces, constructed by localizing canonical molecular orbitals. Each fragment is then solved with a multi-reference method, self-consistently embedded in the mean field from other fragments. Finally, inter-fragment correlations are reintroduced through multi-reference perturbation theory. Our framework provides an exhaustive classification of inter-fragment interaction terms, offering a tool to analyze the relative importance of various processes such as dispersion, charge transfer, and spin exchange. We benchmark FragPT2 on challenging test systems, including \ce{N_2} dimers, multiple aromatic dimers, and butadiene. We demonstrate that our method can be succesful even for fragments defined by cutting through a covalent bond.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define a relational notion of a subsystem in theories of matrix quantum mechanics and show how the corresponding entanglement entropy can be given as a minimisation, exhibiting many similarities to the Ryu-Takayanagi formula. Our construction brings together the physics of entanglement edge modes, noncommutative geometry and quantum internal reference frames, to define a subsystem whose reduced state is (approximately) an incoherent sum of density matrices, corresponding to distinct spatial subregions. We show that in states where geometry emerges from semiclassical matrices, this sum is dominated by the subregion with minimal boundary area. As in the Ryu-Takayanagi formula, it is the computation of the entanglement that determines the subregion. We find that coarse-graining is essential in our microscopic derivation, in order to control the proliferation of highly curved and disconnected non-geometric subregions in the sum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically study the impact of light-driven structural changes via nonlinear phononics on the magnetic order of untwisted bilayer van der Waals materials. We consider an illustrative example of the AA-stacked bilayer honeycomb lattice and show that high-intensity light in resonance with selected phonons induces large amplitude phonon displacements that modify the magnetic Hamiltonian of the system. We performed a group theory analysis to identify the vibrational modes of the honeycomb bilayer and the nonlinear couplings among them in the strongly driven regime. We find that the structural changes in the strongly driven regime lower the symmetry relative to the equilibrium lattice and produce changes in the magnetic interactions between the local moments. In particular, the lattice symmetry changes permit a non-zero interlayer Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction that induces a magnetic state with canted local moments. Using a spin-wave analysis about the new magnetic configuration we study the corresponding changes in the magnon spectrum and identify a protocol for engineering topological band transitions using a combination of nonlinear phononics and an external magnetic field. Our work suggests a strategy to induce interlayer Dyzaloshinskii-Moriya interactions in a class of layered van der Waals materials, the effect of which is to modify the magnetic ground state, magnon dispersions, and related band geometric properties, including topological invariants.</description>

      <title>Superuniversal Statistics of Complex Time-Delays in Non-Hermitian Scattering Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Wigner-Smith time-delay of flux conserving systems is a real quantity that measures how long an excitation resides in an interaction region. The complex generalization of time-delay to non-Hermitian systems is still under development, in particular, its statistical properties in the short-wavelength limit of complex chaotic scattering systems has not been investigated. From the experimentally measured multi-port scattering ($S$)-matrices of one-dimensional graphs, a two-dimensional billiard, and a three-dimensional cavity, we calculate the complex Wigner-Smith ($\tau_{WS}$), as well as each individual reflection ($\tau_{xx}$) and transmission ($\tau_{xy}$) time-delays. The complex reflection time-delay differences ($\tau_{\delta R}$) between each port are calculated, and the transmission time-delay differences ($\tau_{\delta T}$) are introduced for systems exhibiting non-reciprocal scattering. Large time-delays are associated with coherent perfect absorption, reflectionless scattering, slow light, and uni-directional invisibility. We demonstrate that the large-delay tails of the distributions of the real and imaginary parts of each of these time-delay quantities are superuniversal, independent of experimental parameters: uniform attenuation $\eta$, number of scattering channels $M$, wave propagation dimension $\mathcal{D}$, and Dyson symmetry class $\beta$. This superuniversality is in direct contrast with the well-established time-delay statistics of unitary scattering systems, where the tail of the $\tau_{WS}$ distribution depends explicitly on the values of $M$ and $\beta$. Due to the direct analogy of the wave equations, the time-delay statistics described in this paper are applicable to any non-Hermitian wave-chaotic scattering system in the short-wavelength limit, such as quantum graphs, electromagnetic, optical and acoustic resonators, etc.</description>

Abstract: A muon collider represents a promising candidate for the next generation of particle physics experiments after the expected end of LHC operations in the early 2040s. Rare or hard-to-detect processes at the LHC, such as the production of multiple gauge bosons, become accessible at a TeV muon collider. We present here the prospects of detecting quantum entanglement and the violation of Bell inequalities in H to ZZ to 4l events at a potential future muon collider. We show that the spin density matrix of the Z boson pairs can be reconstructed using the kinematics of the charged leptons from the Z boson decays. Once the density matrix is determined, it is straightforward to obtain the expectation values of various Bell operators and test the quantum entanglement between the Z boson pair. Through a detailed study based on Monte-Carlo simulation, we show that the generalized CGLMP inequality can be maximally violated, and testing Bell inequalities could be established with high significance.</description>

Abstract: We generalize the generalized Arimoto-Blahut algorithm to a general function defined over Bregman-divergence system. In existing methods, when linear constraints are imposed, each iteration needs to solve a convex minimization. Exploiting our obtained algorithm, we propose a convex-optimization-free algorithm. This algorithm can be applied to classical and quantum rate-distortion theory. We numerically apply our method to the derivation of the optimal conditional distribution in the rate-distortion theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Laplacian learning method is a well-established technique in classical graph-based semi-supervised learning, but its potential in the quantum domain remains largely unexplored. This study investigates the performance of the Laplacian-based Quantum Semi-Supervised Learning (QSSL) method across four benchmark datasets -- Iris, Wine, Breast Cancer Wisconsin, and Heart Disease. Further analysis explores the impact of increasing Qubit counts, revealing that adding more Qubits to a quantum system doesn't always improve performance. The effectiveness of additional Qubits depends on the quantum algorithm and how well it matches the dataset. Additionally, we examine the effects of varying entangling layers on entanglement entropy and test accuracy. The performance of Laplacian learning is highly dependent on the number of entangling layers, with optimal configurations varying across different datasets. Typically, moderate levels of entanglement offer the best balance between model complexity and generalization capabilities. These observations highlight the crucial need for precise hyperparameter tuning tailored to each dataset to achieve optimal performance in Laplacian learning methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical chaos arises from the inherent non-linearity of dynamical systems. However, quantum maps are linear; therefore, the definition of chaos is not straightforward. To address this, we study a quantum system that exhibits chaotic behavior in its classical limit: the kicked top model, whose classical dynamics are governed by Hamilton's equations on phase space, whereas its quantum dynamics are described by the Schr\"odinger equation in Hilbert space. We explore the critical degree of non-linearity signifying the onset of chaos in the kicked top by modifying the original Hamiltonian so that the non-linearity is parametrized by a quantity $p$. We find two distinct behaviors of the modified kicked top depending on the value of $p$. Chaos intensifies as $p$ varies within the range of $1\leq p \leq 2$, whereas it diminishes for $p &gt; 2$, eventually transitioning to a purely regular oscillating system as $p$ tends to infinity. We also comment on the complicated phase space structure for non-chaotic dynamics. Our investigation sheds light on the relationship between non-linearity and chaos in classical systems, offering insights into their dynamic behavior.</description>

Abstract: Periodically poled thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) waveguides, which enable efficient quadratic nonlinear processes, serve as crucial foundation for classical and quantum signal processing with photonic integrated circuits. To expand their application scope, we provide, to our best knowledge, the first investigation of nonlinear conversion processes in periodically poled TFLN waveguides at cryogenic condition. Through systematic experimental characterization, we find that the periodically poled TFLN waveguide maintains consistent conversion efficiencies at both cryogenic and room temperatures for both classical second-harmonic generation and quantum photon-pair generation processes, demonstrating the significant potential of TFLN wavelength conversion devices for cryogenic applications. This breakthrough will foster future scalable quantum photonic systems and optical interfacing among different cryogenic platforms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: B-centres in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) are gaining significant research interest for quantum photonics applications due to precise emitter positioning and highly reproducible emission wavelengths. Here, we leverage the layered nature of hBN to directly measure the quantum efficiency (QE) of single B-centres. The defects were engineered in a 35 nm flake of hBN using electron beam irradiation, and the local dielectric environment was altered by transferring a 250 nm hBN flake on top of the one containing the emitters. By analysing the resulting change in measured lifetimes, we determined the QE of B-centres in the thin flake of hBN, as well as after the transfer. Our results indicate that B-centres located in thin flakes can exhibit QEs higher than 40%. Near-unity QEs are achievable under reasonable Purcell enhancement for emitters embedded in thick flakes of hBN, highlighting their promise for quantum photonics applications.</description>

      <title>Role of the Casimir force in micro- and nanoelectromechanical pressure sensors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Casimir force caused by the electromagnetic fluctuations is computed in the configurations of micro- and nanoelectromechanical pressuresensors using Si membranes and either Si or Au-coated Si substrates. It is shown that if, under the influence of external pressure, the membrane-substrate separation drops to below 100 nm, the Casimir force makes a profound effect onthe sensor functioning. There exists the maximum value of external pressure depending on the sensor parameters such that it finds itself in a state of unstable equilibrium. For this and larger pressures, the Casimir force leads to a collapse of the sensor, which loses its functionality. For any smaller external pressures, there exist two equilibrium positions, one of which is unstable and another one is stable, at smaller and larger membrane-substrate separations, respectively. The latter can be safely used for the pressure measurements. Possible applications of the {obtained} results in the design of micro- and nanoelectromechanical pressure sensors of next generations with further decreased dimensions are discussed.</description>

      <title>Quantum corrections at second order in derivatives to the dynamics of small non-relativistic fluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To capture the dynamics of macroscopic non-relativistic fluids consisting of very many atoms, it is typically sufficient to truncate the gradient expansion at order zero, leading to ideal fluid dynamics, or at order one, leading to the Navier-Stokes theory. For mesoscopic fluids consisting of a small number of atoms, second-order corrections can become significant. We investigate here specifically superfluids at vanishing temperature, and identify relevant second-order terms of quantum origin that contribute already in a static situation. The general form of these terms arises from an extension of the Gross-Pitaevskii theory. In the context of density functional theory, they are named after C. von Weizs\"acker. We assess the influence of these terms on numerical solutions of second-order fluid dynamic equations for the expansion of a mesoscopic ultra-cold Fermi gas released from an anisotropic harmonic trap in two spatial dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In entanglement distribution networks, communication between two nodes necessitates the generation of end-to-end entanglement by entanglement swapping at intermediate nodes. Efficiently creating end-to-end entanglements over long distances is a key objective. In our prior study on asynchronous routing, we enhanced these entanglement rates by leveraging solely the local knowledge of the entanglement links of a node. This was achieved by creating a tree structure, particularly a destination-oriented directed acyclic graph (DODAG) or a spanning tree, eliminating synchronous operations and conserving unused entanglement links. In this article, we present a multi-tree approach with multiple DODAGs designed to improve end-to-end entanglement rates in large-scale networks, specifically catering to a range of network topologies, including grids and barbells, as well as realistic topologies found in research testbeds like ESnet and Internet2. Our simulations show a marked improvement in end-to-end entanglement rates for specific topologies compared to the single-tree method. This study underscores the promise of asynchronous routing schemes in quantum networks, highlighting the effectiveness of asynchronous routing across different network topologies and proposing a superior routing tactic.</description>

Abstract: The broad band resonant spin echo interferometer, CANISIUS, is presented. CANISIUS is built in a versatile way, such that it can be operated in both a continuous broad band beam or a pulsed Time of Flight beam. This versatility also extends to the modes available to the instrument, such as Neutron Resonant Spin Echo, Spin Echo (Modulated) Small Angle Neutron Scattering and coherent averaging to produce structured wavefunctions for scattering. The instrument may also be used as an interferometer, to probe fundamental questions in quantum mechanics. In this paper we detail both the continuous and Time of Flight options of the instruments. In addition we demonstrate the applicability of our interferometer to ultra small angle scattering in a white beam. Finally we demonstrate a new spin echo interferometry tool, which uses incomplete recombination of the two path states to generate composite wavefunctions with special structure. In particular we show that this method produces neutron wavefunctions that exist in a superposition of two quantum mechanical OAM modes, l =+1 or -1 We illustrate that just as this method can be used to generate certain structured waves, it may also be used to characterize the structure of the input wavefunction.</description>

Abstract: We present a general characterization of k-positivity for a positive map in terms of the estimation of the Ky Fan norm of the matrix constructed from the Kraus operators of the associated completely positive map. Combining this with the result given by Takasaki and Tomiyama we construct a family of positive maps between matrix algebras of different dimensions depending on a parameter. The estimate bounds on the parameter to obtain the $k$-positivity are better than those derived from the spectral conditions considered by Chru\'sci\'nski and Kossakowski. We further look with special attention at the case where we give the precise bound for the regions of decomposability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.10482v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Random tensor networks are a powerful toy model for understanding the entanglement structure of holographic quantum gravity. However, unlike holographic quantum gravity, their entanglement spectra are flat. It has therefore been argued that a better model consists of random tensor networks with link states that are not maximally entangled, i.e., have nontrivial spectra. In this work, we initiate a systematic study of the entanglement properties of these networks. We employ tools from free probability, random matrix theory, and one-shot quantum information theory to study random tensor networks with bounded and unbounded variation in link spectra, and in cases where a subsystem has one or multiple minimal cuts. If the link states have bounded spectral variation, the limiting entanglement spectrum of a subsystem with two minimal cuts can be expressed as a free product of the entanglement spectra of each cut, along with a Marchenko-Pastur distribution. For a class of states with unbounded spectral variation, analogous to semiclassical states in quantum gravity, we relate the limiting entanglement spectrum of a subsystem with two minimal cuts to the distribution of the minimal entanglement across the two cuts. In doing so, we draw connections to previous work on split transfer protocols, entanglement negativity in random tensor networks, and Euclidean path integrals in quantum gravity.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we develop a new quantum algorithm to solve a combinatorial problem with significant practical relevance occurring in clutch manufacturing. It is demonstrated how quantum optimization can play a role in real industrial applications in the manufacturing sector. Using the quantum annealer provided by D-Wave Systems, we analyze the performance of the quantum and quantum-classical hybrid solvers and compare them to deterministic- and random-algorithm classical benchmark solvers. The continued evolution of the quantum technology, indicating an expectation for even greater relevance in the future is discussed and the revolutionary potential it could have in the manufacturing sector is highlighted.</description>

Abstract: Since their first introduction, Quantum Reference Frame (QRF) transformations have been extensively discussed, generalising the covariance of physical laws to the quantum domain. Despite important progress, a formulation of QRF transformations for Lorentz symmetry is still lacking. The present work aims to fill this gap. We first introduce a reformulation of relativistic quantum mechanics independent of any notion of preferred temporal slicing. Based on this, we define transformations that switch between the perspectives of different relativistic QRFs. We introduce a notion of ''quantum Lorentz transformations'' and ''superposition of Lorentz boosts'', acting on the external degrees of freedom of a quantum particle. We analyse two effects, superposition of time dilations and superposition of length contractions, that arise only if the reference frames exhibit both relativistic and quantum-mechanical features. Finally, we discuss how the effects could be observed by measuring the wave-packet extensions from relativistic QRFs.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Hamiltonian Simulation Techniques to Compile Operations on Bosonic Devices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.15542v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Circuit QED enables the combined use of qubits and oscillator modes. Despite a variety of available gate sets, many hybrid qubit-boson (i.e., oscillator) operations are realizable only through optimal control theory (OCT) which is oftentimes intractable and uninterpretable. We introduce an analytic approach with rigorously proven error bounds for realizing specific classes of operations via two matrix product formulas commonly used in Hamiltonian simulation, the Lie--Trotter and Baker--Campbell--Hausdorff product formulas. We show how this technique can be used to realize a number of operations of interest, including polynomials of annihilation and creation operators, i.e., $a^p {a^\dagger}^q$ for integer $p, q$. We show examples of this paradigm including: obtaining universal control within a subspace of the entire Fock space of an oscillator, state preparation of a fixed photon number in the cavity, simulation of the Jaynes--Cummings Hamiltonian, simulation of the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect and more. This work demonstrates how techniques from Hamiltonian simulation can be applied to better control hybrid boson-qubit devices.</description>

      <title>Exponentially improved efficient machine learning for quantum many-body states with provable guarantees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.04353v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solving the ground state and the ground-state properties of quantum many-body systems is generically a hard task for classical algorithms. For a family of Hamiltonians defined on an $m$-dimensional space of physical parameters, the ground state and its properties at an arbitrary parameter configuration can be predicted via a machine learning protocol up to a prescribed prediction error $\varepsilon$, provided that a sample set (of size $N$) of the states can be efficiently prepared and measured. In a recent work [Huang et al., Science 377, eabk3333 (2022)], a rigorous guarantee for such a generalization was proved. Unfortunately, an exponential scaling for the provable sample complexity, $N=m^{{\cal{O}}\left(\frac{1}{\varepsilon}\right)}$, was found to be universal for generic gapped Hamiltonians. This result applies to the situation where the dimension of the parameter space is large while the scaling with the accuracy is not an urgent factor. In this work, we consider an alternative scenario where $m$ is a finite, not necessarily large constant while the scaling with the prediction error becomes the central concern. By jointly preserving the fundamental properties of density matrices in the learning protocol and utilizing the continuity of quantum states in the parameter range of interest, we rigorously obtain a polynomial sample complexity for predicting quantum many-body states and their properties, with respect to the uniform prediction error $\varepsilon$ and the number of qubits $n$. Moreover, if restricted to learning local quantum-state properties, the number of samples with respect to $n$ can be further reduced exponentially. Our results provide theoretical guarantees for efficient learning of quantum many-body states and their properties, with model-independent applications not restricted to ground states of gapped Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Effects of noise on performance of Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.19745v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Bernstein-Vazirani (BV) algorithm offers exceptional accuracy in finding the hidden bit string of a function. We explore how the algorithm performs in real-world situations where noise can potentially interfere with its performance. In order to assess the impact of imperfect equipments, we introduce various forms of glassy disorders into the effect of the Hadamard gates used in the Bernstein-Vazirani circuit. We incorporated disorders of five different forms, viz., Haar-uniform with finite cutoff, spherical Gaussian, discrete circular, spherical Cauchy-Lorentz, and squeezed. We find that the effectiveness of the algorithm decreases with increasing disorder strength in all cases. Additionally, we demonstrate that as the number of bits in the secret string increases, the success probability of correctly guessing the string becomes increasingly insensitive to the type of disorder and instead depends only on the mean and spread of the disorder. We compare our results with the performance of the analogous classical algorithm in the presence of similar noise. When the length of the secret string is small or moderate, the quantum BV algorithm is found to be more efficient compared to the classical algorithm for almost all types of disorders under consideration, unless the strength of the disorder is very high and the disorder follows a discrete circular distribution. However, if we move to extremely large secret strings, the success probability of the disordered BV algorithm merges with the success probability of the disordered classical algorithm for all considered disorders having arbitrary strengths. The limit on the length of the string after which the efficiency of the quantum algorithm becomes equivalent to the classical algorithm depends on the amount of disorder and not on the type of disorder.</description>

      <title>Continuous sensing and parameter estimation with the boundary time-crystal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.13277v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A boundary time-crystal is a quantum many-body system whose dynamics is governed by the competition between coherent driving and collective dissipation. It is composed of $N$ two-level systems and features a transition between a stationary phase and an oscillatory one. The fact that the system is open allows to continuously monitor its quantum trajectories and to analyze their dependence on parameter changes. This enables the realization of a sensing device whose performance we investigate as a function of the monitoring time $T$ and of the system size $N$. We find that the best achievable sensitivity is proportional to $\sqrt{T} N$, i.e., it follows the standard quantum limit in time and Heisenberg scaling in the particle number. This theoretical scaling can be achieved in the oscillatory time-crystal phase and it is rooted in emergent quantum correlations. The main challenge is, however, to tap this capability in a measurement protocol that is experimentally feasible. We demonstrate that the standard quantum limit can be surpassed by cascading two time-crystals, where the quantum trajectories of one time-crystal are used as input for the other one.</description>

Abstract: The Page-Wootters formalism is a proposal for reconciling the background-dependent, quantum-mechanical notion of time with the background-independence of general relativity. However, the physical meaning of this framework remains debated. In this work, we compare two consistent approaches to the Page-Wootters formalism to clarify the operational meaning of evolution and measurements with respect to a quantum temporal reference frame. The so-called "twirled observable" approach implements measurements as operators that are invariant with respect to the Hamiltonian constraint. The "purified measurement" approach instead models measurements dynamically by modifying the constraint itself. While both approaches agree in the limit of ideal clocks, a natural generalization of the purified measurement approach to the case of non-ideal, finite-resource clocks yields a radically different picture. We discuss the physical origin of this discrepancy and argue that the approaches describe operationally distinct situations. Moreover, we show that, for non-ideal clocks, the purified measurement approach yields time non-local, non-unitary evolution and implies a fundamental limitation to the operational definition of the temporal order of events. Nevertheless, unitarity and definite temporal order can be restored if we assume that time is discrete.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.12080v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show a dissipative phase transition in a driven nonlinear quantum oscillator in which a discrete time-translation symmetry is spontaneously broken in two different ways. The corresponding regimes display either discrete or incommensurate time-crystal order, which we analyze numerically and analytically beyond the classical limit addressing observable dynamics, phenomenology in different (laboratory and rotating) frames, Liouvillian spectral features, and quantum fluctuations. Via an effective semiclassical description, we show that phase diffusion dominates in the incommensurate time crystal (or continuous time crystal in the rotating frame), which manifests as a band of eigenmodes with a lifetime growing linearly with the mean-field excitation number. Instead, in the discrete time crystal phase, the leading fluctuation process corresponds to quantum activation with a single mode that has an exponentially growing lifetime. Interestingly, the transition between these two regimes manifests itself already in the quantum regime as a spectral singularity, namely as an exceptional point mediating between phase diffusion and quantum activation. Finally, we discuss this transition between different time-crystal orders in the context of synchronization phenomena.</description>

Abstract: The application of machine learning models in quantum information theory has surged in recent years, driven by the recognition of entanglement and quantum states, which are the essence of this field. However, most of these studies rely on existing prefabricated models, leading to inadequate accuracy. This work aims to bridge this gap by introducing a custom deep convolutional neural network (CNN) model explicitly tailored to quantum systems. Our proposed CNN model, the so-called XpookyNet, effectively overcomes the challenge of handling complex numbers data inherent to quantum systems and achieves an accuracy of 98.5%. Developing this custom model enhances our ability to analyze and understand quantum states. However, first and foremost, quantum states should be classified more precisely to examine fully and partially entangled states, which is one of the cases we are currently studying. As machine learning and quantum information theory are integrated into quantum systems analysis, various perspectives, and approaches emerge, paving the way for innovative insights and breakthroughs in this field.</description>

Abstract: We study the combined effects of measurements and unitary evolution on the preparation of spin squeezing in an ensemble of atoms interacting with a single electromagnetic field mode inside a cavity. We derive simple criteria that determine the conditions at which measurement based entanglement generation overperforms unitary protocols. We include all relevant sources of decoherence and study both their effect on the optimal spin squeezing and the overall size of the measurement noise, which limits the dynamical range of quantum-enhanced phase measurements. Our conclusions are relevant for state-of-the-art atomic clocks that aim to operate below the standard quantum limit.</description>

      <title>Efficient Quantum Circuit Simulation by Tensor Network Methods on Modern GPUs</title>

Abstract: Efficient simulation of quantum circuits has become indispensable with the rapid development of quantum hardware. The primary simulation methods are based on state vectors and tensor networks. As the number of qubits and quantum gates grows larger in current quantum devices, traditional state-vector based quantum circuit simulation methods prove inadequate due to the overwhelming size of the Hilbert space and extensive entanglement. Consequently, brutal force tensor network simulation algorithms become the only viable solution in such scenarios. The two main challenges faced in tensor network simulation algorithms are optimal contraction path finding and efficient execution on modern computing devices, with the latter determines the actual efficiency. In this study, we investigate the optimization of such tensor network simulations on modern GPUs and propose general optimization strategies from two aspects: computational efficiency and accuracy. Firstly, we propose to transform critical Einstein summation operations into GEMM operations, leveraging the specific features of tensor network simulations to amplify the efficiency of GPUs. Secondly, by analyzing the data characteristics of quantum circuits, we employ extended precision to ensure the accuracy of simulation results and mixed precision to fully exploit the potential of GPUs, resulting in faster and more precise simulations. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that our approach can achieve a 3.96x reduction in verification time for random quantum circuit samples in the 18-cycle case of Sycamore, with sustained performance exceeding 21 TFLOPS on one A100. This method can be easily extended to the 20-cycle case, maintaining the same performance, accelerating by 12.5x compared to the state-of-the-art CPU-based results and 4.48-6.78x compared to the state-of-the-art GPU-based results reported in the literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.05958v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In order for quantum computations to be done as efficiently as possible it is important to optimise the number of gates used in the underlying quantum circuits. In this paper we find that many gate optimisation problems for approximately universal quantum circuits are NP-hard. In particular, we show that optimising the T-count or T-depth in Clifford+T circuits, which are important metrics for the computational cost of executing fault-tolerant quantum computations, is NP-hard by reducing the problem to Boolean satisfiability. With a similar argument we show that optimising the number of CNOT gates or Hadamard gates in a Clifford+T circuit is also NP-hard. Again varying the same argument we also establish the hardness of optimising the number of Toffoli gates in a reversible classical circuit. We find an upper bound to the problems of T-count and Toffoli-count of $\text{NP}^{\text{NQP}}$. Finally, we also show that for any non-Clifford gate $G$ it is NP-hard to optimise the $G$-count over the Clifford+$G$ gate set, where we only have to match the target unitary within some small distance in the operator norm.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the temperature uncertainty relation in nonequilibrium probe-based temperature estimation process. We demonstrate that it is the fluctuation of heat that fundamentally determines temperature precision through the temperature-heat uncertainty relation. Specifically, we find that heat is divided into trajectory heat and correlation heat, which are associated with the heat exchange along thermometer's evolution and the correlation between the thermometer and the sample, respectively. Based on two type of thermometers, we show that both of these heat terms are resources for enhancing temperature precision. By clearly distinguishing the resources for enhancing estimation precision, our findings not only explain why various quantum features are crucial for accurate temperature sensing but also provide valuable insights for designing ultrahigh-sensitive quantum thermometers. Additionally, we demonstrate that the temperature-heat uncertainty relation is consistent with the well-known temperature-energy uncertainty relation in thermodynamics. It establishes a connection between the information theory and the thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Quantum optimization of coherent chaotic systems: A case for buses of Kathmandu</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.13119v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel quantum computing approach to solve the real-world problem of optimizing transportation in bustling Kathmandu city. The transportation system in Kathmandu is chaotic, with no central authority controlling the transportation. We leverage this chaotic feature in our quantum optimization procedure. The quantum chaos theory's Wigner-Dyson distribution surfaced as the most effective bus spacing distribution for a bus driver to maximize their profit. We investigate the statistical properties of the buses with real-time GPS bus location data and optimize bus spacing and interval distribution around the 27 km circular ring road in Kathmandu. Using tools like quantum simulation, eigenvalue distributions, and output wave function analysis, we show that such optimal bus spacing distribution could be achieved.</description>

      <title>Precision Enhancement in Spatial Measurement by Introducing Squeezed Light into Weak Value Amplification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16622v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The precision enhancement is demonstrated in an optical spatial measurement based on weak value amplification (WVA) system and split-like detection, by injecting a TEM10 squeezed vacuum beam. It is the first time combining the WVA technique and squeezed beam injection to experimentally realize high-precision optical spatial measurement beyond the standard quantum limit. As a result, the precision enhancement of 1.3 times can be achieved at 500kHz by adding a squeezed beam in the vacuum input port of the Mach-Zehnder interferometer. The minimum measurable displacement is reduced from 1.08pm to 0.85pm and the corresponding minimum measurable tilt is reduced from 0.86prad to 0.67prad. Moreover, the spatial measurement at low-frequency band is also implemented and the SNR is improved 2dB at 4kHz. Our work provides an effective method to accomplish higher precision in optical spatial measurement, which has potential applications in gravitational wave interferometer calibration, super-resolution quantum imaging, etc.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the magnetic noise power spectrum of dark spins in diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12643v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coherence times of spin qubits in solid-state platforms are often limited by the presence of a spin bath. While some properties of these typically dark bath spins can be indirectly characterized via the central qubit, it is important to characterize their properties by direct measurement. Here we use pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance (pEPR) based Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) dynamical decoupling to measure the magnetic noise power spectra for ensembles of P1 (substitutional nitrogen) centers in diamond that typically form the bath for NV (nitrogen-vacancy) centers. The experiments on the P1 centers were performed on a low [N] CVD (chemical vapor deposition) sample and a high [N] HPHT (high-temperature, high-pressure) sample at 89 mT. We characterize the NV centers of the latter sample using the same 2.5 GHz pEPR spectrometer. All power spectra show two distinct features, a broad component that is observed to scale as approximately $1/\omega^{0.7-1.0}$, and a prominent peak at the $^{13}$C Larmor frequency. The behavior of the broad component is consistent with an inhomogeneous distribution of Lorentzian spectra due to clustering of P1 centers, which has recently been shown to be prevalent in HPHT diamond. It is unknown if such clustering occurs in CVD diamond. We develop techniques utilizing harmonics of the CPMG filter function to improve characterization of high-frequency signals, which we demonstrate on the $^{13}$C nuclear Larmor frequency. At 190 mT this is 2.04 MHz, 5.7 times higher than the CPMG modulation frequency ($&lt;357$ kHz, hardware-limited). We assess the robustness of our methods in the presence of finite pulse widths and flip angle errors. Understanding the interactions of dark spins will inform methods of diamond fabrication for quantum technology. These techniques are applicable to ac magnetometry for nanoscale nuclear magnetic resonance and chemical sensing.</description>

Abstract: Quantum computing promises to provide the next step up in computational power for diverse application areas. In this review, we examine the science behind the quantum hype, and the breakthroughs required to achieve true quantum advantage in real world applications. Areas that are likely to have the greatest impact on high performance computing (HPC) include simulation of quantum systems, optimization, and machine learning. We draw our examples from electronic structure calculations and computational fluid dynamics which account for a large fraction of current scientific and engineering use of HPC. Potential challenges include encoding and decoding classical data for quantum devices, and mismatched clock speeds between classical and quantum processors. Even a modest quantum enhancement to current classical techniques would have far-reaching impacts in areas such as weather forecasting, engineering, aerospace, drug design, and the design of "green" materials for sustainable development. This requires significant effort from the computational science, engineering and quantum computing communities working together.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16287v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically study how the peculiar properties of the vacuum state of an ultra-strongly coupled system can affect basic light-matter interaction processes. In this unconventional electromagnetic environment, an additional emitter no longer couples to the bare cavity photons, but rather to the polariton modes emerging from the ultra-strong coupling. As such, the effective light-matter interaction strength is sensitive to the properties of the distorted vacuum state. Different interpretations of our predictions in terms of modified quantum fluctuations in the vacuum state and of radiative reaction in classical electromagnetism are critically discussed. Whereas our discussion is focused on the experimentally most relevant case of intersubband polaritons in semiconductor devices, our framework is fully general and applies to generic material systems.</description>

Abstract: Quantum computing is a growing field with significant potential applications. Learning how to code quantum programs means understanding how qubits work and learning to use quantum gates. This is analogous to creating classical algorithms using logic gates and bits. Even after learning all concepts, it is difficult to create new algorithms, which hinders the acceptance of quantum programming by most developers. This article outlines the need for higher-level abstractions and proposes some of them in a developer-friendly programming language called Rhyme. The new quantum types are extensions of classical types, including bits, integers, floats, characters, arrays, and strings. We show how to use such types with code snippets.</description>

Abstract: We introduce twisted unitary $t$-groups, a generalization of unitary $t$-groups under a twisting by an irreducible representation. We then apply representation theoretic methods to the Knill-Laflamme error correction conditions to show that twisted unitary $t$-groups automatically correspond to quantum codes with distance $d=t+1$. By construction these codes have many transversal gates, which naturally do not spread errors and thus are useful for fault tolerance.</description>

Abstract: Control of topological edge modes is desirable for encoding quantum information resiliently against external noise. Their implementation on quantum hardware, however, remains a long-standing problem due to current limitations of circuit depth and noise, which grows with the number of time steps. By utilizing recently developed constant-depth quantum circuits in which the circuit depth is independent of time, we demonstrate successful long-time dynamics simulation of bulk and surface modes in topological insulators on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) processors, which exhibits robust signatures of localized topological modes. We further identify a class of one-dimensional topological Hamiltonians that can be readily simulated with NISQ hardware. Our results provide a pathway towards stable long-time implementation of topological quantum spin systems on present day quantum processors.</description>

Abstract: We present a loop-based optical processor enabling time-domain programmable beam-splitter (BS) operations for a phase-sensitive non-Gaussian state. The loop itself is of high quality, allowing for storage of a non-Gaussian state for up to seven round trips while preserving its Wigner negativity and phase coherence. We perform various BS operations on a non-Gaussian state and evaluate them as transformations of the state's waveforms. Our work integrates non-Gaussian states with time multiplexing, laying the foundation for large-scale universal quantum information processing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15556v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Giant artificial atoms are promising and flexible building blocks for the implementation of analog quantum simulators. They are realized via a multi-local pattern of couplings of two-level systems to a waveguide, or to a two-dimensional photonic bath. A hallmark of giant-atom physics is their non-Markovian character in the form of self-coherent feedback, leading, e.g., to non-exponential atomic decay. The timescale of their non-Markovianity is essentially given by the time delay proportional to the distance between the various coupling points. In parallel, with the state-of-the-art experimental setups, it is possible to engineer complex phases in the atom-light couplings. Such phases simulate an artificial magnetic field, yielding a chiral behavior of the atom-light system. Here, we report a surprising connection between these two seemingly unrelated features of giant atoms, showing that the chirality of a giant atom controls its Markovianity. In particular, by adjusting the couplings' phases, a giant atom can, counterintuitively, enter an exact Markovian regime irrespectively of any inherent time delay. We illustrate this mechanism as an interference process and via a collision model picture. Our findings significantly advance the understanding of giant atom physics, and open new avenues for the control of quantum nanophotonic networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18518v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While the accuracy of qubit operations has been greatly improved in the last decade, further development is demanded to achieve the ultimate goal: a fault-tolerant quantum computer that can solve real-world problems more efficiently than classical computers. With growing fidelities even subtle effects of environmental noise such as qubit-reservoir correlations and non-Markovian dynamics turn into the focus for both circuit design and control. To guide progress, we disclose, in a numerically rigorous manner, a comprehensive picture of the single-qubit dynamics in presence of a broad class of noise sources and for entire sequences of gate operations. Thermal reservoirs ranging from Ohmic to deep $1/f^{\varepsilon}$-like sub-Ohmic behavior are considered to imitate realistic scenarios for superconducting qubits. Apart from dynamical features, fidelities of the qubit performance over entire sequences are analyzed as a figure of merit. The relevance of retarded feedback and long-range qubit-reservoir correlations is demonstrated on a quantitative level, thus, providing a deeper understanding of the limitations of performances for current devices and guiding the design of future ones.</description>

      <title>Unifying uncertainties for rotor-like quantum systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02498v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantum rotor represents, after the harmonic oscillator, the next obvious quantum system to study the complementary pair of variables: the angular momentum and the unitary shift operator in angular momentum. Proper quantification of uncertainties and the incompatibility of these two operators are thus essential for applications of rotor-like quantum systems. While angular momentum uncertainty is characterized by variance, several uncertainty measures have been proposed for the shift operator, with dispersion the simplest example. We establish a hierarchy of those measures and corresponding uncertainty relations which are all perfectly or almost perfectly saturated by a tomographically complete set of von Mises states. Building on the interpretation of dispersion as the moment of inertia of the unit ring we then show that the other measures also possess the same mechanical interpretation. This unifying perspective allows us to express all measures as a particular instance of a single generic angular uncertainty measure. The importance of these measures is then highlighted by applying the simplest two of them to derive optimal simultaneous measurements of the angular momentum and the shift operator. Finally, we argue that the model of quantum rotor extends beyond its mechanical meaning with promising applications in the fields of singular optics, super-conductive circuits with a Josephson junction or optimal pulse shaping in the time-frequency domain. Our findings lay the groundwork for quantum-information and metrological applications of the quantum rotor and point to its interdisciplinary nature.</description>

      <title>Three statistical descriptions of classical systems and their extensions to hybrid quantum-classical systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07738v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present three statistical descriptions for systems of classical particles and consider their extension to hybrid quantum-classical systems. The classical descriptions are ensembles on configuration space, ensembles on phase space, and a Hilbert space approach using van Hove operators which provides an alternative to the Koopman-von Neumann formulation. In all cases, there is a natural way to define classical observables and a corresponding Lie algebra that is isomorphic to the usual Poisson algebra in phase space. We show that in the case of classical particles, the three descriptions are equivalent and indicate how they are related. We then modify and extend these descriptions to introduce hybrid models where a classical particle interacts with a quantum particle. The approach of ensembles on phase space and the Hilbert space approach, which are novel, lead to equivalent hybrid models, while they are not equivalent to the hybrid model of the approach of ensembles on configuration space. Thus, we end up identifying two inequivalent types of hybrid systems, making different predictions, especially when it comes to entanglement. These results are of interest regarding ``no-go'' theorems about quantum systems interacting via a classical mediator which address the issue of whether gravity must be quantized. Such theorems typically require assumptions that make them model dependent. The hybrid systems that we discuss provide concrete examples of inequivalent models that can be used to compute simple examples to test the assumptions of the ``no-go'' theorems and their applicability.</description>

      <title>Multi-controlled Phase Gate Synthesis with ZX-calculus applied to Neutral Atom Hardware</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10864v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum circuit synthesis describes the process of converting arbitrary unitary operations into a gate sequence of a fixed universal gate set, usually defined by the operations native to a given hardware platform. Most current synthesis algorithms are designed to synthesize towards a set of single qubit rotations and an additional entangling two qubit gate, such as CX, CZ, or the Molmer Sorensen gate. However, with the emergence of neutral atom based hardware and their native support for gates with more than two qubits, synthesis approaches tailored to these new gate sets become necessary. In this work, we present an approach to synthesize multi controlled phase gates using ZX calculus. By representing quantum circuits as graph like ZX diagrams, one can utilize the distinct graph structure of diagonal gates to identify multi controlled phase gates inherently present in some quantum circuits even if none were explicitly defined in the original circuit. We evaluate the approach on a wide range of benchmark circuits and compare them to the standard Qiskit synthesis regarding its circuit execution time for neutral atom based hardware with native support of multi controlled gates. Our results show possible advantages for current state of the art hardware and represent the first exact synthesis algorithm supporting arbitrary sized multi controlled phase gates.</description>

      <title>Procedurally Optimised ZX-Diagram Cutting for Efficient T-Decomposition in Classical Simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10964v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A quantum circuit may be strongly classically simulated with the aid of ZX-calculus by decomposing its $t$ T-gates into a sum of $2^{\alpha t}$ classically computable stabiliser terms. In this paper, we introduce a general procedure to find an optimal pattern of vertex cuts in a ZX-diagram to maximise its T-count reduction at the cost of the fewest cuts. Rather than reducing a Clifford+T diagram based on a fixed routine of decomposing its T-gates directly (as is the conventional approach), we focus instead on taking advantage of certain patterns and structures common to such circuits to, in effect, design by automatic procedure an arrangement of spider decompositions that is optimised for the particular circuit. In short, this works by assigning weights to vertices based on how many T-like gates they are blocking from fusing/cancelling and then appropriately propagating these weights through any neighbours which are then blocking weighted vertices from fusing, and so on. Ultimately, this then provides a set of weightings on relevant nodes, which can then each be cut, starting from the highest weighted down. While this is a heuristic approach, we show that, for circuits small enough to verify, this method achieves the most optimal set of cuts possible $71\%$ of the time. Furthermore, there is no upper bound for the efficiency achieved by this method, allowing, in principle, an effective decomposition efficiency $\alpha\rightarrow0$ for highly structured circuits. Even applied to random pseudo-structured circuits (produced from CNOTs, phase gates, and Toffolis), we record the number of stabiliser terms required to reduce all T-gates, via our method as compared to that of the more conventional T-decomposition approaches (namely \cite{kissinger21}, with $\alpha\approx0.47$), and show consistent improvements of orders of magnitude, with an effective efficiency $0.1\lesssim\alpha\lesssim0.2$.</description>

      <title>Quantum backflow current in a ring: Optimal bounds and fractality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18586v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The probability density of a quantum particle moving freely within a circular ring can exhibit local flow patterns inconsistent with its angular momentum, a phenomenon known as quantum backflow. In this study, we examine a quantum particle confined to a ring and prepared in a state composed of a fixed (yet arbitrary) number of lowest energy eigenstates with non-negative angular momentum. We investigate the time-dependent behavior of the probability current at a specified point along the ring's circumference. We establish precise lower and upper bounds for this probability current, thereby delineating the exact scope of the quantum backflow effect. We also present an analytical expression for a quantum state that yields a record-high backflow probability transfer, reaching over 95% of the theoretical bound. Furthermore, our investigation yields compelling numerical and analytical evidence supporting the conjecture that the current-versus-time function associated with states maximizing backflow probability transfer forms a fractal curve with a dimension of 7/4. The observed fractality may provide a characteristic, experimentally-relevant signature of quantum backflow near the probability-transfer bound.</description>

      <title>Improving Quantum Approximate Optimization by Noise-Directed Adaptive Remapping</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01412v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present Noise-Directed Adaptive Remapping (NDAR), a heuristic algorithm for approximately solving binary optimization problems by leveraging certain types of noise. We consider access to a noisy quantum processor with dynamics that features a global attractor state. In a standard setting, such noise can be detrimental to the quantum optimization performance. Our algorithm bootstraps the noise attractor state by iteratively gauge-transforming the cost-function Hamiltonian in a way that transforms the noise attractor into higher-quality solutions. The transformation effectively changes the attractor into a higher-quality solution of the Hamiltonian based on the results of the previous step. The end result is that noise aids variational optimization, as opposed to hindering it. We present an improved Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) runs in experiments on Rigetti's quantum device. We report approximation ratios $0.9$-$0.96$ for random, fully connected graphs on $n=82$ qubits, using only depth $p=1$ QAOA with NDAR. This compares to $0.34$-$0.51$ for standard $p=1$ QAOA with the same number of function calls.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07828v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This is the second in a series of "graphical grokking" papers in which we study how stabiliser codes can be understood using the ZX-calculus. In this paper we show that certain complex rules involving ZX-diagrams, called spider nest identities, can be captured succinctly using the scalable ZX-calculus, and all such identities can be proved inductively from a single new rule using the Clifford ZX-calculus. This can be combined with the ZX picture of CSS codes, developed in the first "grokking" paper, to give a simple characterisation of the set of all transversal diagonal gates at the third level of the Clifford hierarchy implementable in an arbitrary CSS code.</description>

      <title>Entanglement in Quantum Dots: Insights from Dynamic Susceptibility and Quantum Fisher Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15477v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the entanglement properties of quantum dots (QDs) under a universal Hamiltonian where the Coulomb interaction between particles (electrons or holes) decouples into a charging energy and an exchange coupling term. While this formalism typically decouples the charge and spin components, the confinement-induced energy splitting can induce unexpected entanglement in the system. By analyzing the dynamic susceptibility and quantum Fisher information (QFI), we uncover intriguing behaviors influenced by exchange constants, temperature variations, and confinement effects. In Ising QDs, far below the Stoner instability point where the QD is in a disordered paramagnetic phase, temperature reductions unexpectedly lead to decreased entanglement, challenging conventional expectations. Conversely, anisotropic Heisenberg models exhibit enhanced entanglement near isotropic points. Our findings highlight the intricate interplay between exchange interactions and entanglement in QDs, laying the groundwork for future studies on topological entanglement and the influence of entanglement on material properties. Overall, this work contributes to advancing our understanding of entanglement in QDs and its potential applications in quantum technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18244v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bethe equations, whose solutions determine exact eigenvalues and eigenstates of corresponding integrable Hamiltonians, are generally hard to solve. We implement a Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) approach to estimating Bethe roots of the spin-1/2 XXZ quantum spin chain, by using Bethe states as trial states, and treating Bethe roots as variational parameters. In numerical simulations of systems of size up to 6, we obtain estimates for Bethe roots corresponding to both ground states and excited states with up to 5 down-spins, for both the closed and open XXZ chains. This approach is not limited to real Bethe roots.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium Nonlinear Effects and Dynamical Boson Condensation in a Driven-Dissipative Wannier-Stark Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18647v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Driven-dissipative light-matter systems can exhibit collective nonequilibrium phenomena due to loss and gain processes on the one hand and effective photon-photon interactions on the other hand. As generic example we study a bosonic lattice system implemented via an array of driven-dissipative coupled nonlinear resonators with linearly increasing resonance frequencies across the lattice. The model also describes a driven-dissipative Bose-Hubbard model in a tilted potential without a particle-conservation constraint. We numerically predict a diverse range of stationary and non-stationary states resulting from the interplay of the tilt, tunneling, on-site interactions and loss and gain processes. Our key finding is that, under weak on-site interactions, the bosons mostly condense into a selected, single-particle Wannier-Stark state without exhibiting the expected Bloch oscillations. As the strength of the onsite interactions increase, a non-stationary regime emerges which, surprisingly, exhibits periodic Bloch-type oscillations. As a direct consequence of the driven-dissipative nature of the system we predict a highly nontrivial phase diagram including regular oscillating as well as chaotic dynamical regimes. While a straightforward photonic implementation using microwave or optical modes is possible, such dynamics might also be observable for an ultracold gas in a vertical lattice with gravity or a tilted external potential.</description>

      <title>Twist-and-turn dynamics of spin squeezing in bosonic Josephson junctions: Enhanced shortcuts-to-adiabaticity approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19685v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The twist-and-turn dynamics of spin squeezing results from the interplay of the one-axis-twisting (nonlinear in the collective-spin operators) and the transverse-field turning (linear) term in the underlying Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick-type Hamiltonian, both with constant (time-independent) prefactors. Using shortcuts to adiabaticity (STA) and the recently developed enhanced version thereof (eSTA), we demonstrate here that dynamics of this type can be utilized for a fast and robust preparation of spin-squeezed states in internal bosonic Josephson junctions, i.e., condensates of cold bosonic atoms in two different internal (hyperfine) states (single-boson modes) coupled through Rabi rotations. Assuming that the initial state of this system is its ground state for a given initial value of the (time-dependent) linear coupling strength and that the nonlinear coupling strength remains constant, we set out to determine the time dependence of the linear (Rabi) coupling strength that allows for the generation of spin-squeezed states using the STA- and eSTA-based approaches. We then characterize the modified twist-and-turn dynamics of this system by evaluating the coherent spin-squeezing and number-squeezing parameters, as well as the fidelity of the target spin-squeezed states. In this way, we show that the eSTA approach allows for a particularly robust realization of strongly spin-squeezed states in this system, consistently outperforming its adiabatic and STA-based counterparts, even for systems with several hundred particles. Our method could also be employed for the generation of metrologically-useful non-Gaussian states.</description>

      <title>Exact Synthesis of Multiqutrit Clifford-Cyclotomic Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08136v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is known that the matrices that can be exactly represented by a multiqubit circuit over the Toffoli+Hadamard, Clifford+$T$, or, more generally, Clifford-cyclotomic gate set are precisely the unitary matrices with entries in the ring $\mathbb{Z}[1/2,\zeta_k]$, where $k$ is a positive integer that depends on the gate set and $\zeta_k$ is a primitive $2^k$-th root of unity. In the present paper, we establish an analogous correspondence for qutrits. We define the multiqutrit Clifford-cyclotomic gate set of degree $3^k$ by extending the classical qutrit gates $X$, $CX$, and $CCX$ with the Hadamard gate $H$ and the $T_k$ gate $T_k=\mathrm{diag}(1,\omega_k, \omega_k^2)$, where $\omega_k$ is a primitive $3^k$-th root of unity. This gate set is equivalent to the qutrit Toffoli+Hadamard gate set when $k=1$, and to the qutrit Clifford+$T_k$ gate set when $k&gt;1$. We then prove that a $3^n\times 3^n$ unitary matrix $U$ can be represented by an $n$-qutrit circuit over the Clifford-cyclotomic gate set of degree $3^k$ if and only if the entries of $U$ lie in the ring $\mathbb{Z}[1/3,\omega_k]$.</description>

      <title>Generating quantum dissonance via local operations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08568v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Correlations may arise in quantum systems through various means, of which the most remarkable one is quantum entanglement. Additionally, there are systems that exhibit non-classical correlations even in the absence of entanglement. Quantum dissonance refers to how quantum discord (QD) -- the difference between the total correlation and the classical correlation in a given quantum state -- appears as a non-classical correlation in a system without entanglement. It could be said that QD has the potential to provide a more inclusive viewpoint for discerning the non-classical correlations. In this work, we address the problem of manipulating the QD between two subsystems through local operations. We propose two explicit procedures for obtaining separable Werner states, a type of mixed state with nonzero QD. Both approaches involve performing local operations on classically correlated states and offers a step-by-step method for obtaining separable Werner states with nonzero discord, providing an alternative (explicit and user-friendly) to existing methods.</description>

      <title>Enhancing phase sensitivity in Mach-Zehnder interferometer with various detection schemes using SU(1,1) coherent states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08007v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Improving interferometric phase sensitivity is crucial for high-precision measurements in rapidly developing quantum technologies. The Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) is a versatile tool for analyzing this phenomenon. By splitting and recombining a light beam using beam splitters, MZIs allow for precise phase sensitivity analysis using tools like the quantum Cram\'er-Rao bound (QCRB) and the quantum Fisher information (QFI). This paper analyzes the phase sensitivity of a MZI in various scenarios using different detection schemes and input states. We compare the single- and two-parameter quantum estimation and their associated QCRB for three phase-shift situations: in both arms, only in the upper arm (asymmetric), and in both arms symmetrically. We then investigate the phase sensitivity under three detection schemes: difference intensity, single-mode intensity, and balanced homodyne. Additionally, we explore the use of Perelomov and Barut-Girardello coherent states, two types of SU(1,1) coherent states, in all scenarios. Notably, we demonstrate that under optimal conditions, all detection schemes can achieve the QCRB by utilizing entangled SU(1,1) coherent states as input states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08567v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We find that the presence of strong non-Abelian conserved quantities can lead to highly entangled stationary states even for unital quantum channels. We derive exact expressions for the bipartite logarithmic negativity, R\'enyi negativities, and operator space entanglement for stationary states restricted to one symmetric subspace, with focus on the trivial subspace. We prove that these apply to open quantum evolutions whose commutants, characterizing all strongly conserved quantities, correspond to either the universal enveloping algebra of a Lie algebra or to the Read-Saleur commutants. The latter provides an example of quantum fragmentation, whose dimension is exponentially large in system size. We find a general upper bound for all these quantities given by the logarithm of the dimension of the commutant on the smaller bipartition of the chain. As Abelian examples, we show that strong U($1$) symmetries and classical fragmentation lead to separable stationary states in any symmetric subspace. In contrast, for non-Abelian SU$(N)$ symmetries, both logarithmic and R\'enyi negativities scale logarithmically with system size. Finally, we prove that while R\'enyi negativities with $n&gt;2$ scale logarithmically with system size, the logarithmic negativity (as well as generalized R\'enyi negativities with $n&lt;2$) exhibits a volume law scaling for the Read-Saleur commutants. Our derivations rely on the commutant possessing a Hopf algebra structure in the limit of infinitely large systems, and hence also apply to finite groups and quantum groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19151v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum error correction suppresses noise in quantum systems to allow for high-precision computations. In this work, we introduce Multivariate Bicycle (MB) Quantum Low-Density Parity-Check (QLDPC) codes, via an extension of the framework developed by Bravyi et al. [Nature, 627, 778-782 (2024)] and particularly focus on Trivariate Bicycle (TB) codes. Unlike the weight-6 codes proposed in their study, we offer concrete examples of weight-4 and weight-5 TB-QLDPC codes which promise to be more amenable to near-term experimental setups. We show that our TB-QLDPC codes up to weight-6 have a bi-planar structure. Further, most of our new codes can also be arranged in a two-dimensional toric layout, and have substantially better encoding rates than comparable surface codes while offering similar error suppression capabilities. For example, we can encode 4 logical qubits with distance 5 into 30 physical qubits with weight-5 check measurements, while a surface code with these parameters requires 100 physical qubits. The high encoding rate and compact layout make our codes highly suitable candidates for near-term hardware implementations, paving the way for a realizable quantum error correction protocol.</description>

      <title>A Sound and Complete Equational Theory for 3-Qubit Toffoli-Hadamard Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11152v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a sound and complete equational theory for 3-qubit quantum circuits over the Toffoli-Hadamard gate set { X, CX, CCX, H }. That is, we introduce a collection of true equations among Toffoli-Hadamard circuits on three qubits that is sufficient to derive any other true equation between such circuits. To obtain this equational theory, we first consider circuits over the Toffoli-K gate set { X, CX, CCX, K }, where  K = HxH. The Toffoli-Hadamard and Toffoli-K gate sets appear similar, but they are crucially different on exactly three qubits. Indeed, in this case, the former generates an infinite group of operators, while the latter generates the finite group of automorphisms of the well-known E8 lattice. We take advantage of this fact, and of the theory of automorphism groups of lattices, to obtain a sound and complete collection of equations for Toffoli-K circuits. We then extend this equational theory to one for Toffoli-Hadamard circuits by leveraging prior work of Li et al. on Toffoli-Hadamard operators.</description>

Abstract: Quantum coherence, rooted in the superposition nature of quantum mechanics, is one core quantum resource in quantum technologies. Until now, various measures, operational interpretations and generalizations about coherence have been proposed. However, it is still not clear about the role coherence playing in quantum dynamics. In this work, in terms of unitary evolutions, the effect of coherence is fully exhibited. Firstly, by introducing the new concept, average quantum distance, we show that for time-independent Hamiltonians, quantum coherence is the average evolution speed and vice versa. Secondly, beyond this average setting, for general cases, we show that how coherence and Hamiltonians' eigenvalues determine the instantaneous evolution speed together, where their trade-off is actually the energy uncertainty. Our results definitely clarify the role coherence playing in quantum systems' dynamics, correlating quantum resources with quantum dynamics.</description>

Abstract: The development of quantum computers needs reliable quantum hardware and tailored software for controlling electronics specific to various quantum platforms. Middleware is a type of computer software program that aims to provide standardized software tools across the entire pipeline, from high level execution of quantum computing algorithms to low level driver instructions tailored to specific experimental setups, including instruments. This paper presents updates to Qibolab, a software library that leverages Qibo capabilities to execute quantum algorithms on self hosted quantum hardware platforms.

Abstract: Compilation optimizes quantum algorithms performances on real-world quantum computers. To date, it is performed via classical optimization strategies. We introduce a class of quantum algorithms to perform compilation via quantum computers, paving the way for a quantum advantage in compilation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach via Quantum and Simulated Annealing-based compilation: we successfully compile a Trotterized Hamiltonian simulation with up to 64 qubits and 64 time-steps and a Quantum Fourier Transform with up to 40 qubits and 771 time steps. We show that, for a translationally invariant circuit, the compilation results in a fidelity gain that grows extensively in the size of the input circuit, outperforming any local or quasi-local compilation approach.</description>

      <title>The dynamical $\alpha$-R\'enyi entropies of local Hamiltonians grow at most linearly in time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00743v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a generic one dimensional spin system of length $ L $, arbitrarily large, with strictly local interactions, for example nearest neighbor, and prove that the dynamical $ \alpha $-R\'enyi entropies, $ 0 &lt; \alpha &lt; 1 $, of an initial product state grow at most linearly in time. This result arises from a general relation among dynamical $ \alpha $-R\'enyi entropies and Lieb-Robinson bounds. We extend our bound on the dynamical generation of entropy to systems with exponential decay of interactions, for values of $\alpha$ close enough to $ 1 $. We provide a non rigorous argument to extend our results to initial pure states with low entanglement of $ O(\log L) $. This class of states includes many examples of spin systems ground states, and also critical states. We establish that low entanglement states have an efficient MPS representation that persists at least up to times of order $ \log L $. The main technical tools are the Lieb-Robinson bounds, to locally approximate the dynamics of the spin chain, a strict upper bound of Audenaert on $ \alpha $-R\'enyi entropies and a bound on their concavity. Such a bound, that we provide in an appendix, can be of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01339v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose schemes capable of measuring an arbitrary set of commutative logical Pauli operators in time independent of the number of operators. The only condition is commutativity, a fundamental requirement for simultaneous measurements in quantum mechanics. Quantum low-density parity check (LDPC) codes show great promise for realising fault-tolerant quantum computing. They are particularly significant for early fault-tolerant technologies as they can encode many logical qubits using relatively few physical qubits. By achieving simultaneous measurements of logical operators, our approaches enable fully parallelised quantum computing, thus minimising computation time. Our schemes are applicable to any quantum LDPC codes and maintain the low density of parity checks while measuring multiple logical operators simultaneously. These results enhance the feasibility of applying early fault-tolerant technologies to practical problems.</description>

      <title>Quantum Simulations of Chemistry in First Quantization with any Basis Set</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03145v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum computation of the energy of molecules and materials is one of the most promising applications of fault-tolerant quantum computers. However, practical applications require algorithms with reduced resource requirements. Previous work has mainly represented the Hamiltonian of the system in second quantization. Existing methods in first quantization are limited to grid-based approaches that do not allow for active space calculations. In this work, we present a method to solve the generic ground-state chemistry problem in first quantization on a fault-tolerant quantum computer using any basis set. This allows for calculations in the active space using modern quantum chemistry basis sets. We derive a linear-combination-of-unitaries decomposition for a chemical Hamiltonian in first quantization and then construct an efficient block encoding, exploiting sparsity of the Hamiltonian. For active space calculations using a molecular orbital basis set, we achieve an asymptotic speed up in Toffoli-gate count compared to the equivalent method in second quantization [Berry, et. al. Quantum 3, 208 (2019)]. We also consider the dual plane waves for materials simulations and find that in physically interesting regimes we achieve orders of magnitude improvement in quantum resources compared to the second quantization counterpart. In some instances, our approach provides similar or even lower resources compared to the first quantization plane wave algorithm of Refs.[Babbush, et. al npj Quantum Inf 5(1) 92 (2019), Su et. al PRX Quantum 2(4), 040332 (2021)] that, unlike our approach, avoids loading the classical data from quantum memory. This work opens up possibilities to reduce quantum resources even further using factorization methods of a Hamiltonian or modern pseudopotentials. Furthermore, our approach can be adapted to other applications, such as the vibrational properties of chemical systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03831v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The emergence of quantum technologies has brought much attention to the characterization of quantum resources as well as the classical simulatability of quantum processes. Quantum resources, as quantified by non-stabilizerness, have in one theoretical approach been linked to a family of entropic, monotonic functions. In this work, we demonstrate both analytically and numerically a simple relationship between non-stabilizerness and information scrambling using the fluctuations of an entropy-based quantifier. Specifically, we find that the non-stabilizerness generated by a random quantum circuit is proportional to fluctuations of mutual information. Furthermore, we explore the role of non-stabilizerness in measurement-induced entanglement phase transitions. We find that the fluctuations of mutual information decrease with increasing non-stabilizerness yielding potentially easier identification of the transition point. Our work establishes a key connection between quantum resource theory, information scrambling and measurement-induced entanglement phase transitions.</description>

Abstract: We investigate spin and heat currents in the non-equilibrium steady state of inhomogeneous $XX$-spin chains, which act as interfaces between two bosonic heat baths. Using special functions that diagonalize the single-particle Hamiltonian, we derive closed-form expressions for these currents. For small temperature differences between the baths, we show that inhomogeneities breaking the mirror symmetry of the chain significantly reduce both heat and spin conductivities. Connections with perfect state transfer are discussed.</description>

Abstract: Noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers (NISQ computers) are now readily available, motivating many researchers to experiment with Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs). Among them, the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is one of the most popular one studied by the combinatorial optimization community. In this tutorial, we provide a mathematical description of the class of Variational Quantum Algorithms, assuming no previous knowledge of quantum physics from the readers. We introduce precisely the key aspects of these hybrid algorithms on the quantum side (parametrized quantum circuit) and the classical side (guiding function, optimizer). We devote a particular attention to QAOA, detailing the quantum circuits involved in that algorithm, as well as the properties satisfied by its possible guiding functions. Finally, we discuss the recent literature on QAOA, highlighting several research trends.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.10163v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: At the core of the success of semiconducting spin qubits is the ability to manipulate them electrically, enabled by the spin-orbit interactions. However, most implementations require external magnetic fields to define the spin qubit, which in turn activate various charge-noise mechanisms. Here we study spin qubits confined in quantum dots at zero magnetic fields that are driven periodically by electrical fields and are coupled to a microwave resonator. Using Floquet theory, we identify a well-defined Floquet spin-qubit originating from the lowest degenerate spin states in the absence of driving. We find both transverse and longitudinal couplings between the Floquet spin qubit and the resonator, which can be selectively activated by modifying the driving frequency. We show how these couplings can facilitate fast qubit readout and the implementation of a two-qubit CPHASE gate. Finally, we use adiabatic perturbation theory to demonstrate that the spin-photon couplings originate from the non-Abelian geometry of states endowed by the spin-orbit interactions, rendering these findings general and applicable to a wide range of solid-state spin qubits.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the Mystery of Quantum Measurement with A New Space-Time Approach to Relativistic Quantum Mechanics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.01026v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum measurement is a fundamental concept in the field of quantum mechanics. The action of quantum measurement, leading the superposition state of the measured quantum system into a definite output state, not only reconciles contradictions between quantum and classical mechanics but also facilitates quantum state manipulations, including reading and resetting. Despite its significance, four fundamental issues -- randomness, instantaneousness, irreversibility, and preferred-basis -- continue to pose significant challenges to the broader application of quantum measurement and our overall understanding of quantum mechanics. In this work, we employ a new space-time approach to relativistic quantum mechanics to address these issues systematically. Our approach provides a comprehensive elucidation of the intricate connections between quantum measurement and quantum unitary evolution, as well as an in-depth analysis for the interdependence of non-local correlations and relativistic theories. We thereby reveal a more fundamental dynamical theory, beyond the traditional time-evolution equation in quantum mechanics, where the axioms of quantum measurement naturally emerge as a corollary. These findings contribute to the advancement of related fields, and our work holds potential implications for future research and applications in the realm of quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>On the complexity of isomorphism problems for tensors, groups, and polynomials III: actions by classical groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.03135v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the complexity of isomorphism problems for d-way arrays, or tensors, under natural actions by classical groups such as orthogonal, unitary, and symplectic groups. Such problems arise naturally in statistical data analysis and quantum information. We study two types of complexity-theoretic questions. First, for a fixed action type (isomorphism, conjugacy, etc.), we relate the complexity of the isomorphism problem over a classical group to that over the general linear group. Second, for a fixed group type (orthogonal, unitary, or symplectic), we compare the complexity of the decision problems for different actions.
  Our main results are as follows. First, for orthogonal and symplectic groups acting on 3-way arrays, the isomorphism problems reduce to the corresponding problem over the general linear group. Second, for orthogonal and unitary groups, the isomorphism problems of five natural actions on 3-way arrays are polynomial-time equivalent, and the d-tensor isomorphism problem reduces to the 3-tensor isomorphism problem for any fixed d&gt;3. For unitary groups, the preceding result implies that LOCC classification of tripartite quantum states is at least as difficult as LOCC classification of d-partite quantum states for any d. Lastly, we also show that the graph isomorphism problem reduces to the tensor isomorphism problem over orthogonal and unitary groups.</description>

Abstract: We study conservation laws of a general class of quantum many-body systems subjected to an external time dependent quasi-periodic driving. {When the frequency of the driving is large enough or the strength of the driving is small enough, we prove a Nekhoroshev-type stability result: we show that the system exhibits a prethermal state for stretched exponentially long times in the perturbative parameter}. Moreover, we prove the quasi-conservation of the constants of motion of the unperturbed Hamiltonian and we analyze their physical meaning in examples of relevance to condensed matter and statistical physics.</description>

      <title>Entanglement phases, localization and multifractality of monitored free fermions in two dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.12391v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the entanglement structure and wave function characteristics of continuously monitored free fermions with U$(1)$-symmetry in two spatial dimensions (2D). By deriving the exact fermion replica-quantum master equation, we line out two approaches: (i) a nonlinear sigma model analogous to disordered free fermions, resulting in an SU$(R)$-symmetric field theory of symmetry class AIII in (2+1) space-time dimensions, or (ii) for bipartite lattices, third quantization leading to a non-Hermitian SU$(2R)$-symmetric Hubbard model. Using exact numerical simulations, we explore the phenomenology of the entanglement transition in 2D monitored fermions, examining entanglement entropy and wave function inverse participation ratio. At weak monitoring, we observe characteristic $L\log L$ entanglement growth and multifractal dimension $D_q=2$, resembling a metallic Fermi liquid. Under strong monitoring, wave functions localize and the entanglement saturates towards an area law. Between these regimes, we identify a high-symmetry point exhibiting both entanglement growth indicative of emergent conformal invariance and maximal multifractal behavior. While this multifractal behavior aligns with the nonlinear sigma model of the Anderson transition, the emergent conformal invariance is an unexpected feature not typically associated with Anderson localization. These discoveries add a new dimension to the study of 2D monitored fermions and underscore the need to further explore the connection between non-unitary quantum dynamics in $D$ dimensions and quantum statistical mechanics in $D+1$ dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03259v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The experimentally-observed non-trivial electronic structure of the Cr$_2$ dimer has made the calculation of its potential energy curve a theoretical challenge in the last decades. By matching the perturbation theory at small internuclear distances $R$ and the multipole expansion at large distances $R$ (supposedly both of asymptotic nature), and by adding a few Rydberg-Klein-Rees (RKR) turning points, extracted from experimental data by Casey-Leopold (1993), the analytic form of the potential energy curve for the ground state $X^1\Sigma^+$ of the Cr$_2$ dimer is found for the first time for the whole range of internuclear distances $R$. This has the form of a two-point Pad\'e approximant and provides an accuracy of 3-4 decimal digits in 29 experimental vibrational energies. The resulting ground state $X^1\Sigma^+$ potential curve supports 19694 rovibrational states with a maximal vibrational number $\nu_\text{max}=104$ at zero angular momentum and with a maximal angular momentum $L_\text{max}=312$ with energies $&gt; 10^{-4}$ { hartree}, and additionally 218 weakly-bound states (close to the dissociation limit) with energies $&lt; 10^{-4}$ { hartree}.</description>

      <title>Entanglement inside a black hole before the Page time</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04706v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the evolution of entanglement within an open, strongly coupled system interacting with a heat bath as its environment, in the frameworks of both the doubly holographic model and the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model. Generally, the entanglement within the system initially increases due to internal interactions; however, it eventually dissipates into the environment. In the doubly holographic setup, we consider an end-of-the-world brane in the bulk to represent an eternal black hole coupled with its radiation and the evolution of the global thermofield double (TFD) state. For small black holes, the reflected entropy between the bipartition exhibits a ramp-plateau-slump behavior, where the plateau arises due to the phase transition of the entanglement wedge cross-section before the Page time. Similarly, the mutual information between the bipartition displays a ramp-slop-stabilizing behavior. In quantum mechanics, we consider a double copy of the SYK-plus-bath system in a global TFD state, resembling an eternal black hole interacting with an environment. The R\'enyi mutual information within the double-copied SYK clusters exhibits a ramp-plateau-slope-stabilizing behavior. The dynamic behaviors of the entanglement quantities observed in these two models are attributable to the competition between the internal interaction of the system and the external interaction with the baths. Our study provides a fine-grained picture of the entanglement dynamics inside black holes before their Page time.</description>

      <title>Topological signatures of a p-wave superconducting wire through light</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14501v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show how the $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ topological index of a one-dimensional topological p-wave superconductor can be revealed when driving with a classical vector potential i.e. an electromagnetic wave, through the light-induced transition probabilities and the profile of the induced quasiparticles population. As a function of driving frequency $\omega$, it is possible to obtain a measure of this topological invariant from the resonance envelope classifying the two distinct topological phases of the short-range Kitaev wire. We propose to probe the topological phase transition in the model through the responses of the global capacitance in the presence of the light field and through the Josephson current between the wire and the proximity coupled bulk superconductor. The system may also be implemented on the Bloch sphere allowing alternative ways to measure the $\mathbb{Z}$ and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariants through circuit or cavity quantum electrodynamics.</description>

      <title>On the metric property of quantum Wasserstein divergences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13150v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum Wasserstein divergences are modified versions of quantum Wasserstein distances defined by channels, and they are conjectured to be genuine metrics on quantum state spaces by De Palma and Trevisan. We prove triangle inequality for quantum Wasserstein divergences for every quantum system described by a separable Hilbert space and any quadratic cost operator under the assumption that a particular state involved is pure, and all the states have finite energy. We also provide strong numerical evidence suggesting that the triangle inequality holds in general, for an arbitrary choice of states.</description>

      <title>Broad Instantaneous Bandwidth Microwave Spectrum Analyzer with a Microfabricated Atomic Vapor Cell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15155v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report on broad instantaneous bandwidth microwave spectrum analysis with hot $^{87}\mathrm{Rb}$ atoms in a microfabricated vapor cell in a large magnetic field gradient. The sensor is a MEMS atomic vapor cell filled with isotopically pure $^{87}\mathrm{Rb}$ and $\mathrm{N}_2$ buffer gas to localize the motion of the atoms. The microwave signals of interest are coupled through a coplanar waveguide to the cell, inducing spin flip transitions between optically pumped ground states of the atoms. A static magnetic field with large gradient maps the $\textit{frequency spectrum}$ of the input microwave signals to a position-dependent $\textit{spin-flip pattern}$ on absorption images of the cell recorded with a laser beam onto a camera. In our proof-of-principle experiment, we demonstrate a microwave spectrum analyzer that has $\approx$ 1 GHz instantaneous bandwidth centered around 13 GHz, 3 MHz frequency resolution, 2 kHz refresh rate, and a -23 dBm single-tone microwave power detection limit in 1 s measurement time. A theoretical model is constructed to simulate the image signals by considering the processes of optical pumping, microwave interaction, diffusion of $^{87}\mathrm{Rb}$ atoms, and laser absorption. We expect to reach more than 25 GHz instantaneous bandwidth in an optimized setup, limited by the applied magnetic field gradient. Our demonstration offers a practical alternative to conventional microwave spectrum analyzers based on electronic heterodyne detection.</description>

      <title>Quantum Computing for All: Online Courses Built Around Interactive Visual Quantum Circuit Simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10328v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing is a highly abstract scientific discipline, which, however, is expected to have great practical relevance in future information technology. This forces educators to seek new methods to teach quantum computing for students with diverse backgrounds and with no prior knowledge of quantum physics. We have developed an online course built around an interactive quantum circuit simulator designed to enable easy creation and maintenance of course material with ranging difficulty. The immediate feedback and automatically evaluated tasks lowers the entry barrier to quantum computing for all students, regardless of their background.</description>

      <title>Entanglement in flavored scalar scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13743v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate quantum entanglement in high-energy $2\to 2$ scalar scattering, where the scalars are characterized by an internal flavor quantum number acting like a qubit. Working at the 1-loop order in perturbation theory, we build the final-state density matrix as a function of the scattering amplitudes connecting the initial to the outgoing state. In this construction, the unitarity of the $S$-matrix is guaranteed at the required order by the optical theorem. We consider the post-scattering entanglement between the momentum and flavor degrees of freedom of the final-state particles, as well as the entanglement of the two-qubit flavor subsystem. In each case we identify the couplings of the scalar potential that can generate, destroy, or transfer entanglement between different bipartite subspaces of the Hilbert space.</description>

      <title>Hawking evaporation and the Landauer Principle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08777v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that Hawking black-hole evaporation saturates the Landauer Principle of information thermodynamics. Our result implies that information loss experienced by a black hole during Hawking evaporation takes place as efficiently as possible. We also extend the analysis to the case of Barrow entropy as a phenomenological realization of a fractal event horizon, where the Landauer Principle informs amongst different options for the black hole temperature. To our knowledge, this work is the first identification of the two results as expressions of the same process.</description>

      <title>Ballistic conductance with and without disorder in a boundary-driven XXZ spin chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13816v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent experiments on Google's sycamore NISQ platform on the spin transport resulting from a non-unitary periodic boundary drive of an XXZ chain, we study a classical variant thereof by a combination of analytical and numerical means. We find the classical model reproduces the quantum results in remarkable detail, and provides an analytical handle on the nature and shape of the spin transport's three distinct regimes: ballistic (easy-plane), subdiffusive (isotropic) and insulating (easy-axis). Further, we show that this phenomenology is remarkably robust to the inclusion of bond disorder -- albeit that the transient dynamics approaching the steady states differs qualitatively between the clean and disordered cases -- providing an accessible instance of ballistic transport in a disordered setting.</description>

      <title>Exchange control in a MOS double quantum dot made using a 300 mm wafer process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01241v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Leveraging the advanced manufacturing capabilities of the semiconductor industry promises to help scale up silicon-based quantum processors by increasing yield, uniformity and integration. Recent studies of quantum dots fabricated on 300 mm wafer metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) processes have shown control and readout of individual spin qubits, yet quantum processors require two-qubit interactions to operate. Here, we use a 300 mm wafer MOS process customized for spin qubits and demonstrate coherent control of two electron spins using the spin-spin exchange interaction, forming the basis of an entangling gate such as $\sqrt{\text{SWAP}}$. We observe gate dephasing times of up to $T_2^{*}\approx500$ ns and a gate quality factor of 10. We further extend the coherence by up to an order of magnitude using an echo sequence. For readout, we introduce a dispersive readout technique, the radiofrequency electron cascade, that amplifies the signal while retaining the spin-projective nature of dispersive measurements. Our results demonstrate an industrial grade platform for two-qubit operations, alongside integration with dispersive sensing techniques.</description>
