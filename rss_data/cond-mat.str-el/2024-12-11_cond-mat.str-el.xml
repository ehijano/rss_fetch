      <title>Continuous order-to-order quantum phase transitions from fixed-point annihilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A central concept in the theory of phase transitions beyond the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson paradigm is fractionalization: the formation of new quasiparticles that interact via emergent gauge fields. This concept has been extensively explored in the context of continuous quantum phase transitions between distinct orders that break different symmetries. We propose a mechanism for continuous order-to-order quantum phase transitions that operates independently of fractionalization. This mechanism is based on the collision and annihilation of two renormalization group fixed points: a quantum critical fixed point and an infrared stable fixed point. The annihilation of these fixed points rearranges the flow topology, eliminating the disordered phase associated with the infrared stable fixed point and promoting a second critical fixed point, unaffected by the collision, to a quantum critical point between distinct orders. We argue that this mechanism is relevant to a broad spectrum of physical systems. In particular, it can manifest in Luttinger fermion systems in three spatial dimensions, leading to a continuous quantum phase transition between an antiferromagnetic Weyl semimetal state, which breaks time-reversal symmetry, and a nematic topological insulator, characterized by broken lattice rotational symmetry. This continuous antiferromagnetic-Weyl-to-nematic-insulator transition might be observed in rare-earth pyrochlore iridates $R_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$. Other possible realizations include kagome quantum magnets, quantum impurity models, and quantum chromodynamics with supplemental four-fermion interactions.</description>

      <title>The long-range origin of the black hole entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, has emerged as a powerful tool for exploring the quantum nature of black holes, particularly their residual entropy at zero temperature. In this work, we investigate the role of long-range interactions in a chain of SYK dots with power-law decaying couplings and demonstrate how these interactions can lead to finite residual entropy in the strong non-local case. Indeed, as a function of the interaction range, the black-hole phase, found in the isolated SYK, melts into a long-range Fermi-liquid phase in the weak long-range regime and finally reaches the non Fermi-liquid phase in the purely local case. Our results pave the way to the understanding of the role of the interaction range in black hole thermodynamics and quantum information.</description>

      <title>Flat bands on spherical surface: from Landau levels to giant-quantum-number orbitals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flat bands result in a divergent density of states and high sensitivity to interactions in physical systems. In this work, we compare the behavior of electrons confined to a single flat band on the surface of a sphere to those in flat bands under a magnetic field.Notably, the zero-field flat band exhibits an additional $C(2)$ symmetry, which causes electrons to symmetrically cluster on opposite sides of the sphere's center when a trapping potential is introduced, resulting in a unique form of long-range "entanglement". Moreover, the rotational symmetry of the system with zero field displays different characteristics. Our findings emphasize the distinctive role of zero-field conditions, where interactions that are short-range in real space manifest as highly long-range within the flat band, and the modifications introduced by band mixing are particularly pronounced. Importantly, We propose a preliminary experimental setup to explore the unique properties of zero-field flat bands on spherical substrates.While this approach remains hypothetical, the parameters involved are within current technological reach, suggesting the potential feasibility of realizing such a system.</description>

      <title>Charge asymmetry in the Heisenberg model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supplementing the Heisenberg model with a Hubbard-commuting kinetic of electrons adds to its spectrum without interference. One consequence is the precise incorporation of canonical linear spin wave theory within the time-dependent Hartree-Fock framework, as pure localization emerges from itinerant dynamics. This embedding method generalizes to all spin-1/2 models and is expected to extend to multi-orbital systems. Away from half-filling, differential tuning of doublon and holon motion imparts asymmetry to ordering and fluctuations. This suggests that, in effective electronic theories, kinetic interaction couplings are as significant as underlying band parameters when modeling asymmetric phenomena near the Mott insulator.</description>

      <title>X-ray magnetic circular dichroism and resonant inelastic X-ray scattering explained: role of many-body correlation and mixed-valence fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) and resonant inelastic X-ray scattering with magnetic circular dichroism (RIXS-MCD) provide unparalleled insights into the electronic and magnetic dynamics of complex materials. Yet, their spectra remain challenging to interpret due to intricate many-body interactions. Here, we introduce a theoretical framework based on the Anderson impurity model, fully incorporating charge transfer (CT) and core-valence exchange correlation (CVEC) effects. Using epitaxial ferromagnetic La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 film as a model system, we capture elusive spectral features, demonstrating the necessity of CT inclusion for resolving XMCD subpeaks and revealing the profound impact of CVEC on RIXS-MCD spectra. Our approach not only successfully mirrors experimental results but also opens new avenues for exploring spin, orbital, and charge excitations in 3d transition metals and other correlated materials.</description>

      <title>Disordered quantum antiferromagnetism in doped semiconductors: Density of states approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theoretical study of the exchange interaction in a system of spatially disordered magnetic moments. A typical example of such a system is an impurity semiconductor, whose magnetic properties are associated with the exchange interaction of the impurity atoms. In this study, we consider the case of antiferromagnetic exchange interaction, which we describe by the Heisenberg Hamiltonian. To calculate the magnetic properties of the disordered system, we employ the density of states method. Our calculations demonstrate a good quantitative agreement with the dependence of the Si:P magnetic susceptibility on temperature in a wide range of impurity concentrations and temperatures.</description>

      <title>Screening and effective RPA-like charge susceptibility in the extended Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize the recently introduced single-boson exchange formalism to nonlocal interactions. In the functional renormalization group application to the extended Hubbard model in two dimensions, we show that the flow of the rest function can be neglected up to moderate interaction strengths. We explore the physics arising from the interplay between onsite and nearest-neighbor interactions in various parameter regimes by performing a fluctuation diagnostics. Differently from the magnetic and superconducting susceptibilities, the charge susceptibility appears to be described by the random phase approximation (RPA). We show that this behavior can be traced back to cancellations in the renormalization of the density fermion-boson coupling.</description>

      <title>Boundary anomaly detection in two-dimensional subsystem symmetry-protected topological phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a method to detect quantum anomalies in systems with subsystem symmetry, building on the concept of anomaly indicators. This approach allows us to distinguish different subsystem symmetry-protected topological (SSPT) phases and uncover new ones. Using numerical simulations, we demonstrate the power of this method by identifying strong and weak $Z_2^\tau\times Z_2^\sigma$ SSPT phases in a tunable tensor network state. Our analysis reveals an intrinsic $Z_2$ SSPT phase characterized by its degenerate entanglement spectrum. Furthermore, we extend the anomaly indicator to mixed-state density matrices and show that quantum anomalies of subsystem symmetry can persist under both uniform and alternating disorders. This finding establishes a connection between boundary quantum anomalies in pure and mixed states. Our work provides a comprehensive framework for detecting and constructing topological quantum phases protected by subsystem symmetries, offering new insights into these exotic quantum phases.</description>

      <title>Coexistence of insulator-like paramagnon and metallic spin-orbit exciton modes in SrIrO$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We probe the spectrum of elementary excitations in SrIrO$_3$ by using heterostructured [(SrIrO$_3$)$_m$/(SrTiO$_3$)$_l$] samples to approach the bulk limit. Our resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) measurements at the Ir $L_3$-edge reveal a robust low-lying collective magnetic mode with an antiferromagnetic (AF) dispersion similar to the insulators Sr$_2$IrO$_4$ and Sr$_3$Ir$_2$O$_7$, albeit with a large gap and much larger linewidth. At higher energies we find the spin-orbit exciton, also strongly broadened, but with an inverted dispersion and doubled periodicity that are controlled by the charge hopping. These results demonstrate that the AF paramagnon persists, somewhat counterintuitively, far into the metallic regime of the insulator-metal transition driven by the degree of confinement in the heterostructure. We conclude that these two excitations, which are contrasting but coexisting hallmarks of strong AF pseudospin and charge fluctuations in a spin-orbit-coupled Mott-Slater material, are properties intrinsic to the ground state of semimetallic perovskite SrIrO$_3$.</description>

      <title>Fortuity in SYK Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the fortuity phenomenon in supersymmetric Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) models. For generic choices of couplings, all the BPS states in the $\mathcal{N}=2$ SUSY SYK model are fortuitous. The SYK models reveal an intimate connection between fortuity and the Schwarzian description of supersymmetric black holes, reflected in a sharp feature of $R$-charge concentration - microscopically, all the fortuitous states are concentrated in particular charge sectors. We propose that both $R$-charge concentration and the random matrix behavior near the BPS states are key properties of a generic $q$-local supercharge and formulate these as a supercharge chaos conjecture. We expect supercharge chaos to hold universally for supercharges in holographic CFTs near their fortuitous states, potentially providing a microscopic interpretation for the charge constraints of supersymmetric black holes.
  We also construct SYK models that contain both fortuitous states and monotonous states and contrast their properties, providing further evidence that monotonous states are less chaotic than fortuitous states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent discovery of superconductivity in tetralayer graphene, we investigate the pairing mechanism arising from density-density interactions within the random phase approximation. This approach successfully highlights the dominance of chiral $p$-wave pairing between electrons with the same spin and valley at low electron densities, while also predicting the superconducting range in agreement with experimental findings. Furthermore, we examine the characteristics of distinct superconducting regions: SC1 and SC2 exhibit chiral finite-momentum superconductivity with pronounced phase fluctuations, whereas SC4 displays nematic zero-momentum superconductivity, with its transition temperature constrained by the pairing strength. Additionally, we delve into the exotic features of chiral finite-momentum superconductivity, underscoring its potential significance for realizing a charge-4e exotic metal with time-reversal symmetry.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Mott transition in strongly correlated artificial graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The realization of graphene has provided a bench-top laboratory for quantum electrodynamics. The low-energy excitations of graphene are two-dimensional massless Dirac fermions with opposite chiralities at the $\pm$K valleys of the graphene Brillouin zone. It has been speculated that the electron-electron interactions in graphene could spontaneously break the chiral symmetry to induce a finite mass for Dirac fermions, in analogue to dynamical mass generation in elementary particles. The phenomenon is also known as the relativistic Mott transition and has not been observed in pristine graphene because the interaction strength is insufficient. Here, we report the realization of strongly correlated artificial graphene and the observation of the relativistic Mott transition in twisted WSe2 tetralayers. Using magneto transport, we show that the first $\Gamma$-valley moir\'e valence band mimics the low-energy graphene band structure. At half-band filling, the system exhibits hallmarks of massless Dirac fermions, including an anomalous Landau fan originated from a $\pi$-Berry phase and a square-root density dependence of the cyclotron mass. We tune the interaction across the semimetal-insulator transition by reducing the twist angle below about 2.7 degrees. The emergent insulator is compatible with an antiferromagnetic Mott insulator. Our results open the possibility of studying strongly correlated Dirac fermions in a condensed matter system.</description>

      <title>Tube Category, Tensor Renormalization and Topological Holography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ocneanu's tube algebra provides a finite algorithm to compute the Drinfeld center of a fusion category. In this work we reveal the universal property underlying the tube algebra. Take a base category $\mathcal V$ which is concrete, bicomplete, and symmetric closed monoidal. For physical applications one takes $\mathcal V=\mathbf{Vec}$ the category of vector spaces. Given a $\mathcal V$-enriched monoidal category $\mathcal C$ (not necessarily finite or semisimple) we define the tube category $\mathbb X \mathcal C$ using coends valued in $\mathcal V$. Our main theorem established the relation between (the category of representations of) the tube category $\mathbb X \mathcal C$ and the Drinfeld center $Z(\mathcal C)$: When $\mathcal C$ is pivotal, we prove that $Z(\mathcal C)\hookrightarrow \mathrm{Fun}(\mathbb X \mathcal C^{\mathrm{op}},\mathcal V)\cong Z(\mathrm{Fun}(\mathcal C^{\mathrm{op}},\mathcal V))$. Physically, besides viewing the tube category as a version of TFT with domain being the tube, we emphasize the "Wick-rotated" perspective, that the morphisms in $\mathbb X \mathcal C$ are the local tensors of fixed-point matrix product operators which preserves the symmetry $\mathcal C$ in one spatial dimension. We provide a first-principle flavored construction, from microscopic quantum degrees of freedom and operators perserving the symmetry, to the macroscopic universal properties of the symmetry which form the Drinfeld center. Our work is thus a proof to the 1+1D topological holography in a very general setting.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a quantum spin Hall semimetal or Fermi liquid characterized with a Z2 topological invariant, measurable through circularly polarized light. We propose its engineering through two topological metallic band structures in crystals on the honeycomb lattice, with spin-orbit interaction, realizable through the interplay of a charge or spin density wave substrate and Zeeman effects, in between a quantum spin Hall and a quantum anomalous Hall insulator. These systems show topologically protected helical edge or photo-induced currents.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a mathematical framework that generalizes the definition of statistics for Abelian anyons, based on string operators in many-body Hilbert space, to arbitrary dimensions of invertible topological excitations on arbitrary manifolds. This theory is rigorous, systematic, and provides a general framework for understanding and proving the properties of statistics. Additionally, we propose several conjectures that may hold mathematical interest. We also present a computer program for calculating statistics, which has yielded results consistent with predictions from other physical theories.</description>

Abstract: Impurities in quantum materials have provided successful strategies for learning properties of complex states, ranging from unconventional superconductors to topological insulators. In quantum magnetism, inferring the Hamiltonian of an engineered system becomes a challenging open problem in the presence of complex interactions. Here we show how a supervised machine-learning technique can be used to infer Hamiltonian parameters from atomically engineered quantum magnets by inferring fluctuations of the ground states due to the presence of impurities. We demonstrate our methodology both with a fermionic model with spin-orbit coupling, as well as with many-body spin models with long-range exchange and anisotropic exchange interactions. We show that our approach enables performing Hamiltonian extraction in the presence of significant noise, providing a strategy to perform Hamiltonian learning with experimental observables in atomic-scale quantum magnets. Our results establish a strategy to perform Hamiltonian learning by exploiting the impact of impurities in complex quantum many-body states.</description>

Abstract: Due to the linearly vanishing density of states, emergent massless Dirac quasiparticles resulting from the free fermion motion in a family of two-dimensional half-filled bipartite hyperbolic lattices feature dynamic mass generation through quantum phase transitions only for sufficiently strong finite-range Coulomb repulsion. As such, strong nearest-neighbor Coulomb repulsion ($V$) favors the nucleation of a charge-density-wave (CDW) order with a staggered pattern of average fermionic density between two sublattices of bipartite hyperbolic lattices. Considering a collection of spinless fermions (for simplicity), here we show that application of strong external magnetic fields by virtue of producing a \emph{finite} density of states near the zero energy triggers the condensation of the CDW order even for \emph{infinitesimal} $V$. The proposed curved space magnetic catalysis mechanism is operative for uniform and inhomogeneous (bell-shaped) magnetic fields. We present scaling of the CDW order with the total flux enclosed by hyperbolic Dirac materials for a wide range of (especially subcritical) $V$.</description>

      <title>Complex orders and chirality in the classical Kitaev-$\Gamma$ model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.00037v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well-recognized that the low-energy physics of many Kitaev materials is governed by two dominant energy scales, the Ising-like Kitaev coupling $K$ and the symmetric off-diagonal $\Gamma$ coupling. An understanding of the interplay between these two scales is therefore the natural starting point toward a quantitative description that includes sub-dominant perturbations that are inevitably present in real materials. The present study focuses on the classical $K$-$\Gamma$ model on the honeycomb lattice, with a specific emphasis on the region $K&lt;0$ and $\Gamma&gt;0$, which is the most relevant for the available materials and which remains enigmatic in both quantum and classical limits, despite much effort. We employ large-scale Monte Carlo simulations on specially designed finite-size clusters and unravel the presence of a complex multi-sublattice magnetic orders in a wide region of the phase diagram, whose structure is characterized in detail. We show that this order can be quantified in terms of a coarse-grained scalar-chirality order, featuring a counter-rotating modulation on the two spin sublattices. We also provide a comparison to previous studies and discuss the impact of quantum fluctuations on the phase diagram.</description>

      <title>Quasi-two-dimensional Antiferromagnetic Spin Fluctuations in the Spin-triplet Superconductor Candidate CeRh$_2$As$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03566v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The tetragonal heavy-fermion superconductor CeRh$_2$As$_2$ ($T_{\rm c}=0.3$ K) exhibits an exceptionally high critical field of 14 T for $\textbf{B} \parallel \textbf{c}$. It undergoes a field-driven first-order phase transition between superconducting (SC) states, potentially transitioning from spin-singlet to spin-triplet superconductivity. To elucidate the underlying pairing mechanism, we probe spin fluctuations in CeRh$_2$As$_2$ using neutron scattering. We find dynamic $(\pi,\pi)$ antiferromagnetic spin correlations with an anisotropic quasi-two-dimensional correlation volume. Our data place an upper limit of 0.31 $\mu_{\rm B}$ on the staggered magnetization of corresponding N\'{e}el orders at $T=0.08$ K. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations, treating Ce $4f$ electrons as core states, show that the AFM wave vector connects significant areas of the Fermi surface. Our findings show the dominant excitations in CeRh$_2$As$_2$ for $\hbar\omega&lt; 1.2$~meV are magnetic and indicate superconductivity in CeRh$_2$As$_2$ is mediated by AFM spin fluctuations associated with a proximate quantum critical point.</description>

      <title>Vortex structure in a $d$-wave superconductor obtained by a confinement transition from the pseudogap metal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12964v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the structure of flux $h/(2e)$ vortices in a d-wave superconductor which emerges from a higher temperature pseudogap metal. Such a transition is described by a continuum theory of the Higgs condensation of 2 flavors of charge $e$ bosons which are fundamentals of an emergent SU(2) gauge field. Period-2 charge order is present near the vortex center. Upon coupling the electrons to the superconducting and charge order parameters, we find that the electronic local density of states does not have a zero-bias peak, in contrast to BCS theory. But there are sub-gap peaks at positive and negative bias, and these exhibit anti-phase periodic spatial modulations, similar to observations in scanning tunneling microscopy experiments in the underdoped cuprates (K. Matsuba et al., J. Phys. Soc. Jpn. 76, 063704 (2007)).</description>

      <title>Predicting nonequilibrium Green's function dynamics and photoemission spectra via nonlinear integral operator learning</title>

Abstract: Understanding the dynamics of nonequilibrium quantum many-body systems is an important research topic in a wide range of fields across condensed matter physics, quantum optics, and high-energy physics. However, numerical studies of large-scale nonequilibrium phenomena in realistic materials face serious challenges due to intrinsic high-dimensionality of quantum many-body problems. The nonequilibrium properties of many-body systems can be described by the dynamics of the Green's function of the system, whose time evolution is given by a high-dimensional system of integro-differential equations, known as the Kadanoff-Baym equations (KBEs). The time-convolution term in KBEs, which needs to be recalculated at each time step, makes it difficult to perform long-time simulations. In this paper, we develop an operator-learning framework based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to address this challenge. The proposed framework utilizes RNNs to learn the nonlinear mapping between Green's functions and convolution integrals in KBEs. By using the learned operators as a surrogate model in the KBE solver, we obtain a general machine-learning scheme for predicting the dynamics of nonequilibrium Green's functions. This new methodology reduces the temporal computational complexity from $O(N_t^3)$ to $O(N_t)$, where $N_t$ is the total time steps taken in a simulation, thereby making it possible to study large many-body problems which are currently infeasible with conventional KBE solvers. Through different numerical examples, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the operator-learning based approach in providing accurate predictions of physical observables such as the reduced density matrix and time-resolved photoemission spectra. Moreover, our framework exhibits clear numerical convergence and can be easily parallelized, thereby facilitating many possible further developments and applications.</description>

      <title>Fingerprints of supersymmetric spin and charge dynamics observed by inelastic neutron scattering</title>

Abstract: Supersymmetry is an algebraic property of a class of quantum Hamiltonians, a guiding principle used in the development of nuclear theory and a concept that may underpin physics beyond the Standard Model. In condensed matter, any symmetry between bosonic and fermionic entities is usually strongly broken, as for the spin and charge sectors of the $t$-$J$ model describing the dynamics of fractionalized electrons in one-dimensional materials. While the triplet excitations of a quantum spin ladder in an applied magnetic field provide a close analogue of the $t$-$J$ chain, the supersymmetric nature of this system has not been explored. Here we perform neutron spectroscopy on the spin-ladder compounds (C$_5$D$_{12}$N)$_2$CuBr$_4$ and (C$_5$D$_{12}$N)$_2$CuCl$_4$ over a range of applied fields and temperatures, and apply matrix-product-state (MPS) methods to the ladder and equivalent chain models, to analyse the full, momentum-resolved dynamics of a single charge excitation in a bath of fractionalized spins. We find a dramatic difference in the effects of thermal fluctuations, where strong and coherent shifts of spectral weight at the zone edge contrast with a strict pole at the zone centre, whose persistence at all temperatures constitutes an observable consequence of supersymmetry in a quantum spin ladder.</description>

      <title>Topological chiral superconductivity beyond paring in Fermi-liquid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18067v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a mechanism to produce superconductivity by strong purely repulsive interactions for flat dispersion $\varepsilon \sim k^4$, without using pairing instability in Fermi-liquid. The resulting superconductors break both time-reversal and reflection symmetries in the orbital motion of electrons, and exhibit non-trivial topological order. Our findings suggest that this topological chiral superconductivity is more likely to emerge near or between fully spin-valley polarized metallic phase and Wigner crystal phase. These topological chiral superconductors can be fully or partially spin-valley polarized. For partial spin-valley polarization, the ratios of electron densities associated with different spin-valley quantum numbers are quantized as simple rational numbers. Furthermore, many of these topological chiral superconductors exhibit charge-4 or higher condensation, neutral quasiparticles with fractional statistics, and/or gapless chiral edge states. Two of the topological chiral superconductors are in the same phases as the ``spin''-triplet or spinless $p+ \textrm{i} p$ BCS superconductor, while others are in different phases than any BCS superconductors. The same mechanism is also used to produce anyon superconductivity between fractional anomalous quantum Hall states in the presence of a periodic potential.</description>

      <title>Kondo Compensation in a Pseudogap Phase: a Renormalization Group Study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15422v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the critical behavior of the Kondo compensation in the presence of a power-law pseudogap in the density of states, $\varrho(\omega)\sim |\omega|^\epsilon$. For $\epsilon&lt;1$, this model exhibits a quantum phase transition from a partially screened doublet ground state to a fully screened many-body singlet ground state with increasing Kondo coupling, $j$. At the critical point, $j_c$, the Kondo compensation is found to scale as $\kappa(j&lt;j_c) = 1- g(j)$ with the local $g$-factor vanishing as $g \sim |j-j_c|^\beta$. We combine perturbative drone fermion method with non-perturbative NRG computations to determine the critical exponent $\beta (\epsilon)$, which exhibits a non-monotonous behavior as a function of $\epsilon$. Our results confirm that the Kondo cloud builds up continuously in the presence of a weak pseudogap as one approaches the phase transition.</description>

Abstract: The Fermi-edge singularity in x-ray absorption spectra of metals is a paradigmatic case of a logarithmically divergent perturbation series. Prior work has thoroughly analyzed the leading logarithmic terms. Here, we investigate the perturbation theory beyond leading logarithms and formulate self-consistent equations to incorporate all leading and next-to-leading logarithmic terms. This parquet solution of the Fermi-edge singularity goes beyond the previous first-order parquet solution and sheds new light on the parquet formalism regarding logarithmic behavior. We present numerical results in the Matsubara formalism and discuss the characteristic power laws. We also show that, within the single-boson exchange framework, multi-boson exchange diagrams are needed already at the leading logarithmic level.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the dynamic charge susceptibility near the charge density wave transition in ErTe$_3$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14746v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A charge density wave (CDW) is a phase of matter characterized by a periodic modulation of the valence electron density accompanied by a distortion of the lattice structure. The microscopic details of CDW formation are closely tied to the dynamic charge susceptibility, $\chi(q,\omega)$, which describes the behavior of electronic collective modes. Despite decades of extensive study, the behavior of $\chi(q,\omega)$ in the vicinity of a CDW transition has never been measured with high energy resolution ($\sim$meV). Here, we investigate the canonical CDW transition in ErTe$_3$ using momentum-resolved electron energy loss spectroscopy (M-EELS), a technique uniquely sensitive to valence band charge excitations. Unlike phonons in these materials, which undergo conventional softening due to the Kohn anomaly at the CDW wavevector, the electronic excitations display purely relaxational dynamics that are well described by a diffusive model. The diffusivity peaks around 250 K, just below the critical temperature. Additionally, we report, for the first time, a divergence in the real part of $\chi(q,\omega)$ in the static limit ($\omega \rightarrow 0$), a phenomenon predicted to characterize CDWs since the 1970s. These results highlight the importance of energy- and momentum-resolved measurements of electronic susceptibility and demonstrate the power of M-EELS as a versatile probe of charge dynamics in materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06350v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stable composite objects, such as hadrons, nuclei, atoms, molecules and superconducting pairs, formed by attractive forces are ubiquitous in nature. By contrast, composite objects stabilized by means of repulsive forces were long thought to be theoretical constructions owing to their fragility in naturally occurring systems. Surprisingly, the formation of bound atom pairs by strong repulsive interactions has been demonstrated experimentally in optical lattices. Despite this success, repulsively bound particle pairs were believed to have no analogue in condensed matter owing to strong decay channels. Here we present spectroscopic signatures of repulsively bound three-magnon states and bound magnon pairs in the Ising-like chain antiferromagnet BaCo$_2$V$_2$O$_8$. In large transverse fields, below the quantum critical point, we identify repulsively bound magnon states by comparing terahertz spectroscopy measurements to theoretical results for the Heisenberg-Ising chain antiferromagnet, a paradigmatic quantum many-body model. Our experimental results show that these high-energy repulsively bound magnon states are well separated from continua, exhibit significant dynamical responses and, despite dissipation, are sufficiently long-lived to be identified. As the transport properties in spin chains can be altered by magnon bound states, we envision such states could serve as resources for magnonics based quantum information processing technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03780v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fractional quantum Hall states at a half-filled Landau level are believed to carry an integer number $\mathcal{C}$ of chiral Majorana edge modes, reflected in their thermal Hall conductivity. We show that this number determines the primary series of Abelian fractional quantum Hall states that emerge above and below the half-filling point. On a particular side of half-filling, each series may originate from two consecutive values of $\mathcal{C}$, but the combination of the series above and below half-filling uniquely identifies $\mathcal{C}$. We analyze these states both by a hierarchy approach and by a composite fermion approach. In the latter, we map electrons near a half-filled Landau level to composite fermions at a weak magnetic field and show that a bosonic integer quantum Hall state is formed by pairs of composite fermions and plays a crucial role in the state's Hall conductivity.</description>

      <title>Fusion rule in conformal field theories and topological orders: A unified view of correspondence and (fractional) supersymmetry and their relation to topological holography</title>

Abstract: The algebraic or ring structure of anyons called the fusion rule, is one of the most fundamental research interests in contemporary studies on topological orders (TOs) and the corresponding conformal field theories (CFTs). Recently, the algebraic structure realized as generalized symmetry, including non-invertible and categorical symmetry, captured attention in the fields. Such non-abelian anyonic objects appear in a bulk CFT or chiral CFT (CCFT), but it has been known that the construction of a CCFT contains theoretical difficulties in general. In this work, we study the structure of the fusion rule in $Z_{N}$ symmetric chiral and bulk conformal field theories and the corresponding TOs. We propose a nontrivial expression of subalgebra structure in the fusion rule of a bulk CFT. We name this subalgebra ``bulk semion". This corresponds to the fusion rule of the CCFTs and categorical symmetry of the TOs or symmetry topological field theory (SymTFT). This gives a bulk-edge correspondence based on the symmetry analysis and corresponds to an anyon algebraic expression of topological holography in the recent literature. The topological holography is expected to apply to systems in general space-time dimensions. Moreover, we give a concise way of unifying duality (or fractional supersymmetry), generalized or categorical symmetry, and Lagrangian subalgebra. Our method is potentially useful to formulate and study general TOs, fundamentally only from the data of bulk CFTs or vice versa, and gives a clue in understanding CCFT (or ancillary CFT more generally).</description>

Abstract: We consider optical response in multi-band, multi-layer two-dimensional superconductors. Within a simple model, we show that linear response to AC gating can detect collective modes of the condensate, such as Leggett and clapping modes. We show how trigonal warping of the superconducting order parameter can help facilitate detection of clapping modes. Taking rhombohedral trilayer graphene as an example, we consider several possible pairing mechanisms and show that all-electronic mechanisms may produce in-gap clapping modes. These modes, if present, should be detectable in the absorption of microwaves applied via the gate electrodes, which are necessary to enable superconductivity in this and many other settings; their detection would constitute strong evidence for unconventional pairing. Last, we show that absorption at frequencies above the superconducting gap $2 |\Delta|$ also contains a wealth of information about the gap structure. Our results suggest that linear spectroscopy can be a powerful tool for the characterization of unconventional two-dimensional superconductors.</description>

      <title>Multiscalar Critical Models with Localised Cubic Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20326v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interface localised interactions are studied for multiscalar universality classes accessible with the perturbative $\varepsilon$ expansion in $4-\varepsilon$ dimensions. The associated beta functions at one loop and partially at two loops are derived, and a wide variety of interface conformal field theories (CFTs) is found, even in cases where the bulk universality class is free or as simple as the Wilson-Fisher description of the $O(N)$ model. For up to three scalar fields in the bulk, interface fixed points are classified for all bulk universality classes encountered in this case. Numerical results are obtained for interface CFTs that exist for larger numbers of multiscalar fields. Our analytic and numerical results indicate the existence of a vast space of interface CFTs, much larger than the space of defect CFTs found for line and surface defect deformations of multiscalar models in $4-\varepsilon$ dimensions. In this vast space, stable interfaces found for free and $O(N)$ bulks belong to the $F_4$ family, with global symmetries $SO(3), SU(3), Sp(6)$ and $F_4$, realised with $N=5,8,16,24$ scalar fields, respectively.</description>
