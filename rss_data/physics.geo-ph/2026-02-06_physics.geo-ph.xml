      <title>A General-Purpose Diversified 2D Seismic Image Dataset from NAMSS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the Unicamp-NAMSS dataset, a large, diverse, and geographically distributed collection of migrated 2D seismic sections designed to support modern machine learning research in geophysics. We constructed the dataset from the National Archive of Marine Seismic Surveys (NAMSS), which contains decades of publicly available marine seismic data acquired across multiple regions, acquisition conditions, and geological settings. After a comprehensive collection and filtering process, we obtained 2588 cleaned and standardized seismic sections from 122 survey areas, covering a wide range of vertical and horizontal sampling characteristics. To ensure reliable experimentation, we balanced the dataset so that no survey dominates the distribution, and partitioned it into non-overlapping macro-regions for training, validation, and testing. This region-disjoint split allows robust evaluation of generalization to unseen geological and acquisition conditions.
  We validated the dataset through quantitative and embedding-space analyses using both convolutional and transformer-based models. These analyses showed that Unicamp-NAMSS exhibits substantial variability within and across regions, while maintaining coherent structure across acquisition macro-region and survey types. Comparisons with widely used interpretation datasets (Parihaka and F3 Block) further demonstrated that Unicamp-NAMSS covers a broader portion of the seismic appearance space, making it a strong candidate for machine learning model pretraining. The dataset, therefore, provides a valuable resource for machine learning tasks, including self-supervised representation learning, transfer learning, benchmarking supervised tasks such as super-resolution or attribute prediction, and studying domain adaptation in seismic interpretation.</description>

      <title>On the Adversarial Robustness of Hydrological Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evaluation of hydrological models is essential for both model selection and reliability assessment. However, simply comparing predictions to observations is insufficient for understanding the global landscape of model behavior. This is especially true for many deep learning models, whose structures are complex. Further, in risk-averse operational settings, water managers require models that are trustworthy and provably safe, as non-robustness can put our critical infrastructure at risk. Motivated by the need to select reliable models for operational deployment, we introduce and explore adversarial robustness analysis in hydrological modeling, evaluating whether small, targeted perturbations to meteorological forcings induce substantial changes in simulated discharge. We compare physical-conceptual and deep learning-based hydrological models across 1,347 German catchments under perturbations of varying magnitudes, using the fast gradient sign method (FGSM). We find that, as expected, the FGSM perturbations systematically reduce KGE and increase MSE. However, catastrophic failure is rare and, surprisingly, LSTMs generally demonstrate greater robustness than HBV models. Further, changes in both the predicted hydrographs and the internal model states often respond approximately linearly (at least locally) as perturbation size increases, providing a compact summary of how errors grow under such perturbations. Similar patterns are also observed for random perturbations, suggesting that small input changes usually introduce approximately proportional changes in model output. Overall, these findings support further consideration of LSTMs for operational deployment (due both to their predictive power and robustness), and motivate future work on both characterizing model responses to input changes and improving robustness through architectural modifications and training design.</description>

      <title>Large-Ensemble Simulations Reveal Links Between Atmospheric Blocking Frequency and Sea Surface Temperature Variability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atmospheric blocking events drive persistent weather extremes in midlatitudes, but isolating the influence of sea surface temperature (SST) from chaotic internal atmospheric variability on these events remains a challenge. We address this challenge using century-long (1900-2010), large-ensemble simulations with two computationally efficient deep-learning general circulation models. We find these models skillfully reproduce the observed blocking climatology, matching or exceeding the performance of a traditional high-resolution model and representative CMIP6 models. Averaging the large ensembles filters internal atmospheric noise to isolate the SST-forced component of blocking variability, yielding substantially higher correlations with reanalysis than for individual ensemble members. We identify robust teleconnections linking Greenland blocking frequency to North Atlantic SST and El Ni\~no-like patterns. Furthermore, SST-forced trends in blocking frequency show a consistent decline in winter over Greenland, and an increase over Europe. These results demonstrate that SST variability exerts a significant and physically interpretable influence on blocking frequency and establishes large ensembles from deep learning models as a powerful tool for separating forced SST signals from internal noise.</description>

      <title>The Effects of Non-ideal Mixing in Planetary Magma Oceans and Atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sub-Neptunes with hydrogen-rich envelopes are expected to sustain long-lived magma oceans that continuously exchange volatiles with their overlying atmospheres. Capturing these interactions is key to understanding the chemical evolution and present-day diversity of sub-Neptunes, super-Earths, and terrestrial planets, particularly in light of new JWST observations and upcoming missions. Recent advances in both geochemistry and astrophysics now allow the integration of experimental constraints and thermodynamic models across melt, metal, and gas phases. Here we extend a global chemical equilibrium model to include non-ideal behavior in all three phases. Our framework combines fugacity corrections for gas species with activity coefficients for silicate and metal species, enabling a fully coupled description of volatile partitioning. We show that for planetary embryos (0.5 M$_\oplus$ at 2350 K), non-ideality introduces only modest corrections to atmosphere-magma ocean interface (AMOI) pressures, volatile inventories, and interior compositions. In contrast, for sub-Neptunes with higher temperatures ($\approx$ 3000 K) and pressures, non-ideal effects are more pronounced, though still modest in absolute terms$-$typically within 20% and at most a factor of two. Including activity and fugacity coefficients simultaneously increases the AMOI pressure, enhances water retention in the mantle and the envelope. Our results demonstrate that non-ideality must be treated globally: applying corrections to only one phase leads to incomplete or even misleading trends. These findings highlight the importance of self-consistent global thermodynamic treatments for interpreting atmospheric spectra and interior structures of sub-Neptunes and super-Earths.</description>

      <title>Granite sliding on granite: friction, wear rates, surface topography, and the scale-dependence of rate-state effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01765v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study tribological granite-granite contacts as a model for tectonic faulting, combining experiments, theory, and molecular dynamics simulations. The high friction in this system is not dominated by particulate wear or plowing, as frequently assumed, but by cold welding within plastically deformed asperity junctions. We base this conclusion on the observation that wear is repeatedly high after cleaning contacts but decreases as gouge accumulates, while friction shows the opposite trend. Moreover, adding water reduces wear by a factor of ten but barely decreases friction. Thermal and rate-dependent effects-central to most earthquake models-are negligible: friction remains unchanged between -40{\deg}C and 20{\deg}C, across abrupt velocity steps, and after hours of stationary contact. The absence of rate-state effects in our macroscopic samples is rationalized by the scale-dependence of pre-slip. The evolution of surface topography shows that quartz grains become locally smooth, with height spectra isotropic for wavelength below 10 microns but anisotropic at longer wavelengths, similar to natural faults. The resulting gouge particles have the usual characteristic sizes near 100 nm. Molecular dynamics simulations of a rigid, amorphous silica tip sliding on {\alpha}-quartz reproduce not only similar friction coefficients near unity but also other experimentally observed features, including stress-introduced transitions to phases observed in post-mortem faults, as well as theoretical estimates of local flash temperatures. Additionally, they reveal a marked decrease of interfacial shear strength above 600{\deg}C.</description>
