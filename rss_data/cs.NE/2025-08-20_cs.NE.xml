      <title>Quantization Meets Spikes: Lossless Conversion in the First Timestep via Polarity Multi-Spike Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer advantages in computational efficiency via event-driven computing, compared to traditional artificial neural networks (ANNs). While direct training methods tackle the challenge of non-differentiable activation mechanisms in SNNs, they often suffer from high computational and energy costs during training. As a result, ANN-to-SNN conversion approach still remains a valuable and practical alternative. These conversion-based methods aim to leverage the discrete output produced by the quantization layer to obtain SNNs with low latency. Although the theoretical minimum latency is one timestep, existing conversion methods have struggled to realize such ultra-low latency without accuracy loss. Moreover, current quantization approaches often discard negative-value information following batch normalization and are highly sensitive to the hyperparameter configuration, leading to degraded performance. In this work, we, for the first time, analyze the information loss introduced by quantization layers through the lens of information entropy. Building on our analysis, we introduce Polarity Multi-Spike Mapping (PMSM) and a hyperparameter adjustment strategy tailored for the quantization layer. Our method achieves nearly lossless ANN-to-SNN conversion at the extremity, i.e., the first timestep, while also leveraging the temporal dynamics of SNNs across multiple timesteps to maintain stable performance on complex tasks. Experimental results show that our PMSM achieves state-of-the-art accuracies of 98.5% on CIFAR-10, 89.3% on CIFAR-100 and 81.6% on ImageNet with only one timestep on ViT-S architecture, establishing a new benchmark for efficient conversion. In addition, our method reduces energy consumption by over 5x under VGG-16 on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, compared to the baseline method.</description>

      <title>STAS: Spatio-Temporal Adaptive Computation Time for Spiking Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer energy efficiency over artificial neural networks (ANNs) but suffer from high latency and computational overhead due to their multi-timestep operational nature. While various dynamic computation methods have been developed to mitigate this by targeting spatial, temporal, or architecture-specific redundancies, they remain fragmented. While the principles of adaptive computation time (ACT) offer a robust foundation for a unified approach, its application to SNN-based vision Transformers (ViTs) is hindered by two core issues: the violation of its temporal similarity prerequisite and a static architecture fundamentally unsuited for its principles. To address these challenges, we propose STAS (Spatio-Temporal Adaptive computation time for Spiking transformers), a framework that co-designs the static architecture and dynamic computation policy. STAS introduces an integrated spike patch splitting (I-SPS) module to establish temporal stability by creating a unified input representation, thereby solving the architectural problem of temporal dissimilarity. This stability, in turn, allows our adaptive spiking self-attention (A-SSA) module to perform two-dimensional token pruning across both spatial and temporal axes. Implemented on spiking Transformer architectures and validated on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet, STAS reduces energy consumption by up to 45.9%, 43.8%, and 30.1%, respectively, while simultaneously improving accuracy over SOTA models.</description>

      <title>Extending a Phylogeny-based Method for Detecting Signatures of Multi-level Selection for Applications in Artificial Life</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multilevel selection occurs when short-term individual-level reproductive interests conflict with longer-term group-level fitness effects. Detecting and quantifying this phenomenon is key to understanding evolution of traits ranging from multicellularity to pathogen virulence. Multilevel selection is particularly important in artificial life research due to its connection to major evolutionary transitions, a hallmark of open-ended evolution. Bonetti Franceschi &amp; Volz (2024) proposed to detect multilevel selection dynamics by screening for mutations that appear more often in a population than expected by chance (due to individual-level fitness benefits) but are ultimately associated with negative longer-term fitness outcomes (i.e., smaller, shorter-lived descendant clades). Here, we use agent-based modeling with known ground truth to assess the efficacy of this approach. To test these methods under challenging conditions broadly comparable to the original dataset explored by Bonetti Franceschi &amp; Volz (2024), we use an epidemiological framework to model multilevel selection in trade-offs between within-host growth rate and between-host transmissibility. To achieve success on our in silico data, we develop an alternate normalization procedure for identifying clade-level fitness effects. We find the method to be sensitive in detecting genome sites under multilevel selection with 30% effect sizes on fitness, but do not see sensitivity to smaller 10% mutation effect sizes. To test the robustness of this methodology, we conduct additional experiments incorporating extrinsic, time-varying environmental changes and adaptive turnover in population compositions, and find that screen performance remains generally consistent with baseline conditions. This work represents a promising step towards rigorous generalizable quantification of multilevel selection effects.</description>

      <title>MOHAF: A Multi-Objective Hierarchical Auction Framework for Scalable and Fair Resource Allocation in IoT Ecosystems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid growth of Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystems has intensified the challenge of efficiently allocating heterogeneous resources in highly dynamic, distributed environments. Conventional centralized mechanisms and single-objective auction models, focusing solely on metrics such as cost minimization or revenue maximization, struggle to deliver balanced system performance. This paper proposes the Multi-Objective Hierarchical Auction Framework (MOHAF), a distributed resource allocation mechanism that jointly optimizes cost, Quality of Service (QoS), energy efficiency, and fairness. MOHAF integrates hierarchical clustering to reduce computational complexity with a greedy, submodular optimization strategy that guarantees a (1-1/e) approximation ratio. A dynamic pricing mechanism adapts in real time to resource utilization, enhancing market stability and allocation quality. Extensive experiments on the Google Cluster Data trace, comprising 3,553 requests and 888 resources, demonstrate MOHAF's superior allocation efficiency (0.263) compared to Greedy (0.185), First-Price (0.138), and Random (0.101) auctions, while achieving perfect fairness (Jain's index = 1.000). Ablation studies reveal the critical influence of cost and QoS components in sustaining balanced multi-objective outcomes. With near-linear scalability, theoretical guarantees, and robust empirical performance, MOHAF offers a practical and adaptable solution for large-scale IoT deployments, effectively reconciling efficiency, equity, and sustainability in distributed resource coordination.</description>

      <title>Reinitializing weights vs units for maintaining plasticity in neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00212</link>

Abstract: Loss of plasticity is a phenomenon in which a neural network loses its ability to learn when trained for an extended time on non-stationary data. It is a crucial problem to overcome when designing systems that learn continually. An effective technique for preventing loss of plasticity is reinitializing parts of the network. In this paper, we compare two different reinitialization schemes: reinitializing units vs reinitializing weights. We propose a new algorithm, which we name \textit{selective weight reinitialization}, for reinitializing the least useful weights in a network. We compare our algorithm to continual backpropagation and ReDo, two previously proposed algorithms that reinitialize units in the network. Through our experiments in continual supervised learning problems, we identify two settings when reinitializing weights is more effective at maintaining plasticity than reinitializing units: (1) when the network has a small number of units and (2) when the network includes layer normalization. Conversely, reinitializing weights and units are equally effective at maintaining plasticity when the network is of sufficient size and does not include layer normalization. We found that reinitializing weights maintains plasticity in a wider variety of settings than reinitializing units.</description>

      <title>Spore in the Wild: A Case Study of Spore.fun as an Open-Environment Evolution Experiment with Sovereign AI Agents on TEE-Secured Blockchains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04236v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In Artificial Life (ALife) research, replicating Open-Ended Evolution (OEE)-the continuous emergence of novelty observed in biological life-has usually been pursued within isolated, closed system simulations, such as Tierra and Avida, which have typically plateaued after an initial burst of novelty, failing to achieve sustained OEE. Scholars suggest that OEE requires an open-environment system that continually exchanges information or energy with its environment. A recent technological innovation in Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network (DePIN), which provides permissionless computational substrates, enables the deployment of Large Language Model-based AI agents on blockchains integrated with Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). This enables on-chain agents to operate autonomously "in the wild," achieving self-sovereignty without human oversight. These agents can control their own social media accounts and cryptocurrency wallets, allowing them to interact directly with blockchain-based financial networks and broader human social media. Building on this new paradigm of on-chain agents, Spore.fun is a recent real-world AI evolution experiment that enables autonomous breeding and evolution of new on-chain agents. This paper presents a detailed case study of Spore.fun, examining agent behaviors and their evolutionary trajectories through digital ethology. We aim to spark discussion about whether open-environment ALife systems "in the wild," based on permissionless computational substrates and driven by economic incentives to interact with their environment, could finally achieve the long-sought goal of OEE.</description>
