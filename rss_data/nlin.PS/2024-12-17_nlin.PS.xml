      <title>On the proximity of Ablowitz-Ladik and discrete Nonlinear Schr\"odinger models: A theoretical and numerical study of Kuznetsov-Ma solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the formation of time-periodic solutions with a non-zero background that emulate rogue waves, known as Kuzentsov-Ma (KM) breathers, in physically relevant lattice nonlinear dynamical systems. Starting from the completely integrable Ablowitz-Ladik (AL) model, we demonstrate that the evolution of KM initial data is proximal to that of the non-integrable discrete Nonlinear Schr\"odinger (DNLS) equation for certain parameter values of the background amplitude and breather frequency. This finding prompts us to investigate the distance (in certain norms) between the evolved solutions of both models, for which we rigorously derive and numerically confirm an upper bound. Finally, our studies are complemented by a two-parameter (background amplitude and frequency) bifurcation analysis of numerically exact, KM-type breather solutions to the DNLS equation. Alongside the stability analysis of these waveforms reported herein, this work additionally showcases potential parameter regimes where such waveforms with a flat background may emerge in the DNLS setting.</description>

      <title>Solitary wave formation in the compressible Euler equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the behavior of perturbations in a compressible one-dimensional inviscid gas with an ambient state consisting of constant pressure and periodically-varying density. We show through asymptotic analysis that long-wavelength perturbations approximately obey a system of dispersive nonlinear wave equations. Computational experiments demonstrate that solutions of the 1D Euler equations agree well with this dispersive model, with solutions consisting mainly of solitary waves. Shock formation seems to be avoided for moderate-amplitude initial data, while shock formation occurs for larger initial data. We investigate the threshold for transition between these behaviors, validating a previously-proposed criterion based on further computational experiments. These results support the existence of large-time non-breaking solutions to the 1D compressible Euler equations, as hypothesized in previous works.</description>

      <title>Universality in the tape-peeling trace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatiotemporal patterns, which are of interest in statistical physics and nonlinear dynamics, form on the tape-peeling trace. Recently, we have proposed a mathematical model to describe these pattern formation in the tape-peeling trace. In this paper, we further investigate the tape-peeling model from the perspective of its universality class. We confirm that our model belongs to the 1-dimensional directed percolation universality class. Furthermore, the experimental results from a previous study are re-analyzed, and it is suggested that the tape-peeling trace can also be classified within the 1-dimensional directed percolation universality class.</description>

      <title>The focusing complex mKdV equation with nonzero background: Large $N$-order asymptotics of multi-rational solitons and related Painlev\'{e}-III hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the large-order asymptotics of multi-rational solitons of the focusing complex modified Korteweg-de Vries (c-mKdV) equation with nonzero background via the Riemann-Hilbert problems. First, based on the Lax pair, inverse scattering transform, and a series of deformations, we construct a multi-rational soliton of the c-mKdV equation via a solvable Riemann-Hilbert problem (RHP). Then, through a scale transformation, we construct a RHP corresponding to the limit function which is a new solution of the c-mKdV equation in the rescaled variables $X,\,T$, and prove the existence and uniqueness of the RHP's solution. Moreover, we also find that the limit function satisfies the ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with respect to space $X$ and time $T$, respectively. The ODEs with respect to space $X$ are identified with certain members of the Painlev\'{e}-III hierarchy. We study the large $X$ and transitional asymptotic behaviors of near-field limit solutions, and we provide some part results for the case of large $T$. These results will be useful to understand and apply the large-order rational solitons in the nonlinear wave equations.</description>

      <title>Emptiness Instanton in Quantum Polytropic Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emptiness formation problem is addressed for a one-dimensional quantum polytropic gas characterized by an arbitrary polytropic index $\gamma$, which defines the equation of state $P \sim \rho^\gamma$, where $P$ is the pressure and $\rho$ is the density. The problem involves determining the probability of the spontaneous formation of an empty interval in the ground state of the gas. In the limit of a macroscopically large interval, this probability is dominated by an instanton configuration. By solving the hydrodynamic equations in imaginary time, we derive the analytic form of the emptiness instanton. This solution is expressed as an integral representation analogous to those used for correlation functions in Conformal Field Theory. Prominent features of the spatiotemporal profile of the instanton are obtained directly from this representation.</description>

      <title>Geometrically constrained localized configurations engendering non-topological profile</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work deals with two real scalar fields in two-dimensional spacetime, with the fields coupled to allow the study of localized configurations. We consider models constructed to engender geometric constrictions, and use them to investigate solutions of the lump type, which attain no topological properties. We show how to modify the internal structure of the field configurations and the corresponding energy densities in several distinct ways, making them thinner, thicker and also, in the form of a multi-lump solution composed of two or more lumps or asymmetrically distributed around their associated centers. The results appear to be of current interest in high energy physics and may, in particular, be used to study bright solitons in optical fibers and in Bose-Einstein condensates.</description>

      <title>Multi-Species Cohesion: Humans, machinery, AI and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17410v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The global chaos caused by the 19 July 2024 technology meltdown highlights the need for a theory of what large-scale cohesive behaviors -- dangerous or desirable -- could suddenly emerge from future systems of interacting humans, machinery and software including AI; when will they emerge; and how will they evolve and be controlled. Here we offer answers by introducing an aggregation model that accounts for the interacting entities' inter- and intra-species diversities. It yields a novel multi-dimensional generalization of existing aggregation physics. We derive exact analytic solutions for the time-to-cohesion and growth-of-cohesion for two species, and some generalizations for an arbitrary number of species. These solutions reproduce -- and offer a microscopic explanation for -- an anomalous nonlinear growth feature observed in various current real-world systems. Our theory suggests good and bad 'surprises' will appear sooner and more strongly as humans-machinery-AI etc. interact more -- but it also offers a rigorous approach for understanding and controlling this.</description>

      <title>Revealing Physical Mechanisms of Pattern Formation and Switching in Ecosystems via Nonequilibrium Landscape and Flux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03978v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spatial patterns are widely observed in numerous nonequilibrium natural systems, often undergoing complex transitions and bifurcations, thereby exhibiting significant importance in many physical and biological systems such as embryonic development, ecosystem desertification, and turbulence. However, how spatial pattern formation emerges and how the spatial pattern switches are not fully understood. Here, we developed a landscape-flux field theory via the spatial mode expansion method to uncover the underlying physical mechanism of the pattern formation and switching. We identified the landscape and flux field as the driving force for spatial dynamics and applied this theory to the critical transitions between spatial vegetation patterns in semi-arid ecosystems, revealing that the nonequilibrium flux drives the switchings of spatial patterns. We uncovered how the pattern switching emerges through the optimal pathways and how fast this occurs via the speed of pattern switching. Furthermore, both the averaged flux and the entropy production rate exhibit peaks near pattern switching boundaries, revealing dynamical and thermodynamical origins for pattern transitions, and further offering early warning signals for anticipating spatial pattern switching. Our work thus reveals physical mechanisms on spatial pattern-switching in semi-arid ecosystems and, more generally, introduces a useful approach for quantifying spatial pattern switching in nonequilibrium systems, which further offers practical applications such as early warning signals for critical transitions of spatial patterns.</description>
