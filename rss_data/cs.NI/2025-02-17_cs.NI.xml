      <title>SLICES, a scientific instrument for the networking community</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A science is defined by a set of encyclopedic knowledge related to facts or phenomena following rules or evidenced by experimentally-driven observations. Computer Science and in particular computer networks is a relatively new scientific domain maturing over years and adopting the best practices inherited from more fundamental disciplines. The design of past, present and future networking components and architectures have been assisted, among other methods, by experimentally-driven research and in particular by the deployment of test platforms, usually named as testbeds. However, often experimentally-driven networking research used scattered methodologies, based on ad-hoc, small-sized testbeds, producing hardly repeatable results. We believe that computer networks needs to adopt a more structured methodology, supported by appropriate instruments, to produce credible experimental results supporting radical and incremental innovations. This paper reports lessons learned from the design and operation of test platforms for the scientific community dealing with digital infrastructures. We introduce the SLICES initiative as the outcome of several years of evolution of the concept of a networking test platform transformed into a scientific instrument. We address the challenges, requirements and opportunities that our community is facing to manage the full research-life cycle necessary to support a scientific methodology.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Robust and Secure DNS Protocols for IoT Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09726</link>

Abstract: The DNS (Domain Name System) protocol has been in use since the early days of the Internet. Although DNS as a de facto networking protocol had no security considerations in its early years, there have been many security enhancements, such as DNSSec (Domain Name System Security Extensions), DoT (DNS over Transport Layer Security), DoH (DNS over HTTPS) and DoQ (DNS over QUIC). With all these security improvements, it is not yet clear what resource-constrained Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices should be used for robustness. In this paper, we investigate different DNS security approaches using an edge DNS resolver implemented as a Virtual Network Function (VNF) to replicate the impact of the protocol from an IoT perspective and compare their performances under different conditions. We present our results for cache-based and non-cached responses and evaluate the corresponding security benefits. Our results and framework can greatly help consumers, manufacturers, and the research community decide and implement their DNS protocols depending on the given dynamic network conditions and enable robust Internet access via DNS for different devices.</description>

      <title>TrustZero - open, verifiable and scalable zero-trust</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10281v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a passport-level trust token for Europe. In an era of escalating cyber threats fueled by global competition in economic, military, and technological domains, traditional security models are proving inadequate. The rise of advanced attacks exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities, supply chain infiltration, and system interdependencies underscores the need for a paradigm shift in cybersecurity. Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) emerges as a transformative framework that replaces implicit trust with continuous verification of identity and granular access control. This thesis introduces TrustZero, a scalable layer of zero-trust security built around a universal "trust token" - a non-revocable self-sovereign identity with cryptographic signatures to enable robust, mathematically grounded trust attestations. By integrating ZTA principles with cryptography, TrustZero establishes a secure web-of-trust framework adaptable to legacy systems and inter-organisational communication.</description>

      <title>UAV Communications: Impact of Obstacles on Channel Characteristics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17934v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have been utilized as effective platforms for carrying Wi-Fi Access Points (APs) and cellular Base Stations (BSs), enabling low-cost, agile, and flexible wireless networks with high Quality of Service (QoS). The next generation of wireless communications will rely on increasingly higher frequencies, which are easily obstructed by obstacles. One of the most critical concepts yet to be fully addressed is positioning the UAV at optimal coordinates while accounting for obstacles. To ensure a line of sight (LoS) between UAVs and user equipment (UE), improve QoS, and establish reliable wireless links with maximum coverage, obstacles must be integrated into the proposed placement algorithms. This paper introduces a simulation-based measurement approach for characterizing an air-to-ground (AG) channel in a simple scenario. By considering obstacles, we present a novel perspective on channel characterization. The results, in terms of throughput, packet delivery, packet loss, and delay, are compared using the proposed positioning approach.</description>

      <title>Delay Performance Analysis with Short Packets in Intelligent Machine Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09313v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the rapid development of delay-sensitive services happened in industrial manufacturing, Internet of Vehicles, and smart logistics, more stringent delay requirements are put forward for the intelligent machine (IM) network. Short packet transmissions are widely adopted to reduce delay in IM networks. However, the delay performance of an IM network has not been sufficiently analyzed. This paper applies queuing theory and stochastic geometry to construct network model and transmission model for downlink communication, respectively, proposes and derives the following three metrics, e.g., the transmission success probability (with delay as the threshold), expected delay, and delay jitter. To accurately characterize the transmission delay with short packets, the finite blocklength capacity is used to measure the channel transmission rate. Simulation results show that the increase of packet length and IM density significantly deteriorates the three metrics. Short packets are needed to improve the three metrics, especially in high IM density scenarios. The outcomes of this paper provide an important theoretical basis for the optimization design and performance improvement of IM networks.</description>

      <title>EDM: An Ultra-Low Latency Ethernet Fabric for Memory Disaggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08300v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Achieving low remote memory access latency remains the primary challenge in realizing memory disaggregation over Ethernet within the datacenters. We present EDM that attempts to overcome this challenge using two key ideas. First, while existing network protocols for remote memory access over the Ethernet, such as TCP/IP and RDMA, are implemented on top of the MAC layer, EDM takes a radical approach by implementing the entire network protocol stack for remote memory access within the Physical layer (PHY) of the Ethernet. This overcomes fundamental latency and bandwidth overheads imposed by the MAC layer, especially for small memory messages. Second, EDM implements a centralized, fast, in-network scheduler for memory traffic within the PHY of the Ethernet switch. Inspired by the classic Parallel Iterative Matching (PIM) algorithm, the scheduler dynamically reserves bandwidth between compute and memory nodes by creating virtual circuits in the PHY, thus eliminating queuing delay and layer 2 packet processing delay at the switch for memory traffic, while maintaining high bandwidth utilization. Our FPGA testbed demonstrates that EDM's network fabric incurs a latency of only $\sim$300 ns for remote memory access in an unloaded network, which is an order of magnitude lower than state-of-the-art Ethernet-based solutions such as RoCEv2 and comparable to emerging PCIe-based solutions such as CXL. Larger-scale network simulations indicate that even at high network loads, EDM's average latency remains within 1.3$\times$ its unloaded latency.</description>
