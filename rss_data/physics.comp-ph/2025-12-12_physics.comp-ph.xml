      <title>A Model-Guided Neural Network Method for the Inverse Scattering Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inverse medium scattering is an ill-posed, nonlinear wave-based imaging problem arising in medical imaging, remote sensing, and non-destructive testing. Machine learning (ML) methods offer increased inference speed and flexibility in capturing prior knowledge of imaging targets relative to classical optimization-based approaches; however, they perform poorly in regimes where the scattering behavior is highly nonlinear. A key limitation is that ML methods struggle to incorporate the physics governing the scattering process, which are typically inferred implicitly from the training data or loosely enforced via architectural design. In this paper, we present a method that endows a machine learning framework with explicit knowledge of problem physics, in the form of a differentiable solver representing the forward model. The proposed method progressively refines reconstructions of the scattering potential using measurements at increasing wave frequencies, following a classical strategy to stabilize recovery. Empirically, we find that our method provides high-quality reconstructions at a fraction of the computational or sampling costs of competing approaches.</description>

      <title>Generative Modeling of Entangled Polymers with a Distance-Based Variational Autoencoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a variational autoencoder framework for learning and generating configurations of structured polymer globules from distance matrices. We used coarse-grained molecular dynamics to sample polyethylene structures, which we used as the training set for our deep learning model. By combining convolution and attention layers, the model encodes the structural patterns of distance matrices into an organized and roto-translationally invariant latent space of lower dimensionality. The generative capability of the variational autoencoder, coupled with a post-processing pipeline based on multidimensional scaling and short molecular dynamics, enables the recovery of physically meaningful configurations. The reconstructed and generated samples reproduce key observables, including energy, size, and entanglement, despite minor discrepancies in the raw decoder output.</description>

      <title>Flow-priority optimization of additively manufactured variable-TPMS lattice heat exchanger based on macroscopic analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heat exchangers incorporating triply periodic minimal surface (TPMS) lattice structures have attracted considerable research interest because they promote uniform flow distribution, disrupt boundary layers, and improve convective heat-transfer performance. However, from the perspective of forming a macroscopic flow pattern optimized for heat-exchange efficiency, a uniform lattice is not necessarily the optimal configuration. This study initially presents a macroscopic modeling approach for a two-fluid heat exchanger equipped with a TPMS Primitive lattice. The macroscopic flow analysis is conducted based on the Darcy--Forchheimer theory. Under the assumption that heat is transferred solely at the interface between the fluid and the TPMS walls, a macroscopic heat-transfer model is developed using a volumetric heat-transfer coefficient, which serves as an artificial property characterizing the unit-volume heat-transfer capability. To regulate the relative dominance of the hot and cold flows-effectively, the channel widths-within the heat exchanger, we adopt the isosurface threshold of the Primitive lattice as the design variable and construct an optimization scheme for the lattice distribution using the previously described macroscopic model. The optimization is subsequently carried out for a planar heat exchanger where the hot and cold fluids each follow U-shaped flow trajectories. The optimal solution was verified, and its validity was examined through detailed geometric analysis and experiments conducted using metal LPBF. The optimal solution derived from the macroscopic model also demonstrated a clear performance advantage over the uniform lattice in the experimental results. The optimal solution obtained from the macroscopic model also demonstrated a clear performance improvement over the uniform lattice, with an average enhancement of 28.7% in the experimental results.</description>

      <title>Ultra-Fast Muon Transport via Histogram Sampling on GPUs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a GPU-accelerated method for muon transport based on histogram sampling that delivers orders of magnitude faster performance than CPU-based Geant4 simulation. Our method employs precomputed histograms of momentum loss and scattering, derived from detailed Geant4 simulations, to statistically reproduce all the non-decaying physics processes during muon traversal through matter. Implemented as a CUDA kernel, the parallel algorithm enables the concurrent simulation of tens of thousands of particles on a single GPU whilst taking into account a complex geometry and a magnetic field force integrated using a fourth-order Runge-Kutta method. Validation against Geant4 in both simple and realistic detector geometries shows that the approach preserves key physical features while achieving speedups of several orders of magnitude, even compared to CPU-based simulations on a large CPU farm with over a thousand cores. This work highlights the significant potential of GPU-based implementations for particle transport, with applicability extending to neutrino propagation and future implementations including discrete processes such as particle decay.</description>

      <title>MULE - A Co-Generation Fission Power Plant Concept to Support Lunar In-Situ Resource Utilisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a sustained human presence on the Moon, robust in-situ resource utilisation supply chains to provide consumables and propellant are necessary. A promising process is molten salt electrolysis, which typically requires temperatures in excess of 900{\deg}C. Fission reactors do not depend on solar irradiance and are thus well suited for power generation on the Moon, especially during the 14-day lunar night. As of now, fission reactors have only been considered for electric power generation, but the reactor coolant could also be used directly to heat those processes to their required temperatures. In this work, a concept for a co-generation fission power plant on the Moon that can directly heat a MSE plant to the required temperatures and provide a surplus of electrical energy for the lunar base is presented. The neutron transport code Serpent 2 is used to model a ceramic core, gas-cooled very-high-temperature microreactor design and estimate its lifetime with a burnup simulation in hot conditions with an integrated step-wise criticality search. Calculations show a neutronically feasible operation time of at least 10 years at 100kW thermal power. The obtained power distributions lay a basis for further thermal-hydraulic studies on the technical feasibility of the reactor design and the power plant.</description>

Abstract: A Metropolis Monte Carlo algorithm is given for the case of a complex phase space weight, which applies generally in quantum statistical mechanics. Computer simulations using Lennard-Jones $^4$He near the $\lambda$-transition, including an expansion to third order of the Wigner-Kirkwood commutation function, give a saturation liquid density in agreement with measured values.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Finite Element and Least Squares Support Vector Regression Method for solving Partial Differential Equations with Legendre Polynomial Kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A hybrid computational approach that integrates the finite element method (FEM) with least squares support vector regression (LSSVR) is introduced to solve partial differential equations. The method combines FEM's ability to provide the nodal solutions and LSSVR with higher-order Legendre polynomial kernels to deliver a closed-form analytical solution for interpolation between the nodes. The hybrid approach implements element-wise enhancement (super-resolution) of a given numerical solution, resulting in high resolution accuracy, while maintaining consistency with FEM nodal values at element boundaries. It can adapt any low-order FEM code to obtain high-order resolution by leveraging localized kernel refinement and parallel computation without additional implementation overhead. Therefore, effective inference/post-processing of the obtained super-resolved solution is possible. Evaluation results show that the hybrid FEM-LSSVR approach can achieve significantly higher accuracy compared to the base FEM solution. Comparable accuracy is a achieved when comparing the hybrid solution with a standalone FEM result with the same polynomial basis function order. The convergence studies were conducted for four elliptic boundary value problems to demonstrate the method's ability, accuracy, and reliability. Finally, the algorithm can be directly used as a plug-and-play method for super-resolving low-order numerical solvers and for super-resolution of expensive/under-resolved experimental data.</description>

      <title>Efficient Boys function evaluation using minimax approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an algorithm for efficient evaluation of Boys functions $F_0,\dots,F_{k_\mathrm{max}}$ tailored to modern computing architectures, in particular graphical processing units (GPUs), where maximum throughput is high and data movement is costly. The method combines rational minimax approximations with upward and downward recurrence relations. The non-negative real axis is partitioned into three regions, $[0,\infty\rangle = A\cup B\cup C$, where regions $A$ and $B$ are treated using rational minimax approximations and region $C$ by an asymptotic approximation. This formulation avoids lookup tables and irregular memory access, making it well suited hardware with high maximum throughput and low latency. The rational minimax coefficients are generated using the rational Remez algorithm. For a target maximum absolute error of $\varepsilon_\mathrm{tol} = 5\cdot10^{-14}$, the corresponding approximation regions and coefficients for Boys functions $F_0,\dots,F_{32}$ are provided in the appendix.</description>

      <title>Excitation energies and UV-Vis absorption spectra from INDO/s+ML</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The semi-empirical INDO/s method is popular for studies of excitation energies and absorption of molecules due to its low computational requirement, making it possible to make predictions for large systems. However, its accuracy is generally low, particularly, when compared with the typical accuracy of other methods such as time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT). Here, we present machine learning (ML) models that correct the INDO/s results with negligible increases in the amount of computing resources needed. While INDO/s excitations energies have an average error of about 1.1 eV relative to TDDFT energies, the added ML corrections reduce the error to 0.2 eV. Furthermore, this combination of INDO/s and ML produces UV-Vis absorption spectra that are in good agreement with the TDDFT predictions.</description>

      <title>Engineering Multifunctional Response in Monolayer Fe3O4 via Zr Adsorption: From Half-Metallicity to Enhanced Piezoelectricity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) magnetic oxides are increasingly studied for their multifunctional potential in fields like spintronics, optoelectronics, and energy conversion. In this research, we conduct a detailed first-principles study of pure monolayer Fe3O4 and its modification through Zr adsorption at two sites: on top of an Fe atom and at the bridge between Fe atoms. Using spin-polarized density functional theory with the GGA plus U method, we examine how adsorption affects structure, electronic, magnetic, optical, elastic, and piezoelectric properties. The original monolayer shows half-metallicity, strong spin polarization, and a moderate in-plane piezoelectric effect. Zr adsorption causes local lattice distortions and orbital hybridization, resulting in intermediate electronic states, a reduced bandgap, and increased optical absorption in both spin channels. Notably, Zr at the bridge site greatly enhances dielectric response, optical conductivity, and piezoelectric coefficients, tripling e11 compared to the pristine layer. Elastic constants indicate mechanical softening after functionalization, and energy loss spectra display shifts in plasmon resonance. These findings suggest Zr adsorption offers a controllable, non-destructive way to tune spin, charge, and lattice interactions in Fe4O4 monolayers, connecting magnetic, optical, and piezoelectric functionalities within a single 2D material platform.</description>

      <title>Optimized matching conditions for self-guided laser wakefield accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the matching conditions for self-guided laser pulse propagation in plasma and refine their formulation to maximize the energy of electrons produced via laser wakefield acceleration. Bayesian optimization, combined with particle-in-cell simulations carried out in a quasi-three-dimensional geometry and a Lorentz-boosted frame, is employed. The optimization identifies the maximum electron energy that a self-guided laser wakefield accelerator, driven by a laser of a given energy, can produce, together with the corresponding acceleration distance. Our results further demonstrate that electrons with energies close to the maximum value can be obtained across a relatively wide range of input parameters and without the need for their precise tuning. This provides substantial flexibility for experimental implementation and significantly relaxes the operational constraints associated with self-guided laser wakefield accelerators.</description>

      <title>Phase structure of the one-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory with second nearest-neighbor interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the ground-state phase diagram of a one-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory (LGT) model with hard-core bosons at half-filling, extending previous studies by including second nearest-neighbor (2NN) interactions. Using matrix product state techniques within the density matrix renormalization group, we compute charge gap, static structure factor, and pair-pair correlation functions for various interaction strengths and field parameters. We analyze two representative neatest-neighbor interaction strengths ($V_1$) that correspond to the Luttinger liquid (LL) and Mott insulator (MI) phases in the absence of the 2NN interactions. We introduce the 2NN coupling $V_2$ and investigate its impact on the system. Our results reveal very rich behavior. As the 2NN repulsion increases, in the case of small $V_1$, we observe a direct transition from the LL phase to a charge-ordered insulator (COI) phase, whereas for large $V_1$, we observe a transition from the MI phase (previously found with only $V_1$ included), going through an intermediate LL region, and finally reaching the COI regime. Additionally, the inclusion of 2NN interactions enhances charge order and suppresses pair coherence, evidenced by sharp peaks in the structure factor and rapid decay in pair-pair correlators. Our work extends the well-studied phase structure of 1D $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGT models and demonstrates the interplay between gauge fields, confinement, and extended interactions.</description>

      <title>Application-specific machine-learned interatomic potentials: exploring the trade-off between DFT convergence, MLIP expressivity, and computational cost</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05646v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) are revolutionizing computational materials science and chemistry by offering an efficient alternative to {\em ab initio} molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. However, fitting high-quality MLIPs remains a challenging, time-consuming, and computationally intensive task where numerous trade-offs have to be considered, e.g., How much and what kind of atomic configurations should be included in the training set? Which level of {\em ab initio} convergence should be used to generate the training set? Which loss function should be used for fitting the MLIP? Which machine learning architecture should be used to train the MLIP? The answers to these questions significantly impact both the computational cost of MLIP training and the accuracy and computational cost of subsequent MLIP MD simulations. In this study, we use a configurationally diverse beryllium dataset and quadratic spectral neighbor analysis potential. We demonstrate that joint optimization of energy versus force weights, training set selection strategies, and convergence settings of the {\em ab initio} reference simulations, as well as model complexity can lead to a significant reduction in the overall computational cost associated with training and evaluating MLIPs. This opens the door to computationally efficient generation of high-quality MLIPs for a range of applications which demand different accuracy versus training and evaluation cost trade-offs.</description>

Abstract: Version 14 of XtalOpt, an evolutionary multi-objective global optimization algorithm for crystal structure prediction, is now available for download from its official website https://xtalopt.github.io, and the Computer Physics Communications Library. The new version of the code is designed to perform a ground state search for crystal structures with variable compositions by integrating a suite of ab initio methods alongside classical and machine-learning potentials for structural relaxation. The multi-objective search framework has been enhanced through the introduction of Pareto optimization, enabling efficient discovery of functional materials. Herein, we describe the newly implemented methodologies, provide detailed instructions for their use, and present an overview of additional improvements included in the latest version of the code.</description>

      <title>Kinetic Turing Instability and Emergent Spectral Scaling in Chiral Active Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21012v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spontaneous emergence of coherent structures from chaotic backgrounds is a hallmark of active biological swarms. We investigate this self-organization by simulating an ensemble of polar chiral active agents that couple locally via a Kuramoto interaction. We demonstrate that the system's transition from chaos to active turbulence is characterized by quantized loop phase currents and coherent clustering, and that this transition is strictly governed by a kinetic Turing instability. By deriving the continuum kinetic theory for the model, we identify that the competition between local phase-locking and active agent motility selects a critical structural wavenumber. The instability drives the system into a state of developed turbulence that exhibits stable, robust power-laws in spectral density, suggestive of universality and consistent with observations from a broad range of turbulent phenomena. Our results bridge the gap between discrete chimera states and continuous fluid turbulence, suggesting that the statistical laws of active matter can arise from fundamental kinetic instability criteria.</description>

      <title>New GPU developments in the Madgraph CUDACPP plugin: kernel splitting, helicity streams, cuBLAS color sums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05392v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The first production release of the CUDACPP plugin for the Madgraph5_aMC@NLO generator, which speeds up matrix element (ME) calculations for leading-order (LO) processes using a data parallel approach on vector CPUs and GPUs, was delivered in October 2024. This was described in previous publications by the team behind that effort. In this paper, I describe my work on some additional developments and optimizations of CUDACPP, mainly but not exclusively for GPUs. The new approach, which represents a major restructuring of the CUDACPP computational engine, primarily consists in splitting the ME calculation, previously performed using a single large GPU kernel, into many smaller kernels. A first batch of changes, involving the move to separate "helicity streams" and the optional offloading of QCD color sums to BLAS, was recently merged into a new CUDACPP release, in collaboration with my colleagues. Since then, I have completed a second batch of changes, involving the possibility to split the calculation into groups of Feynman diagrams in separate source code files. This new feature makes it possible to compute QCD matrix elements for physics processes with a larger number of final state gluons: in particular, I present the first performance results from CUDACPP for the $2\!\rightarrow\!6$ process $gg\!\rightarrow\!t\bar{t}gggg$ on CPUs and GPUs and the $2\!\rightarrow\!7$ process $gg\!\rightarrow\!t\bar{t}ggggg$ on CPUs, which involve over 15k and 230k Feynman diagrams, respectively. I also take this opportunity to describe in detail some previously undocumented features of the CUDACPP software, both in the GPU and vector CPU implementations.</description>

      <title>Eigenstructure Analysis of Bloch Wave and Multislice Formulations for Dynamical Scattering in Transmission Electron Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21119v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the eigenstructure of matrix formulations used for modeling scattering processes within materials in transmission electron microscopy. Dynamical scattering is crucial for describing the interaction between an electron wave and the material under investigation. Unlike the Bloch wave formulation, which defines the transmission function via the scattering matrix, the traditional multislice method is lacking a pure transmission function due to the entanglement of electron waves with the propagation function. To address this, we reformulate the multislice method into a matrix framework, which we refer to as the transmission matrix. This allows a direct comparison to the scattering matrix derived from Bloch waves in terms of their eigenstructures. Through theory, we demonstrate their equivalence with eigenvectors related by a two-dimensional Fourier matrix, given that the eigenvalue angles differ by modulo $2\pi n$ (integer $n$). We numerically verify our findings as well as demonstrate the application of the eigenstructure for the estimation of the mean inner potential.</description>

      <title>Efficient absolute interface energy calculations for heterostructures: Synergy between localized basis sets and surface passivation techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03769v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Heterostructures combining diverse physico-chemical properties are increasingly in demand for a wide range of applications in modern science and technology. However, despite their importance in materials science, accurately determining absolute interface energies remains a major challenge. Here, we present a computationally efficient framework for determining interface energies by incorporating a surface passivation technique, demonstrated using pseudo H passivation with a localized basis set method and an explicit chemical potential. This framework is applied to calculate absolute interface energies and analyze the electronic properties of quasi lattice matched and lattice mismatched III and V on Si interfaces, with results compared to conventional reconstructed surface calculations. By combining localized basis sets with surface passivation techniques, this framework allows for accurate estimation of absolute interface energies in heterogeneous material systems. This approach effectively addresses issues associated with surface reconstructions while significantly reducing computational costs within the framework of density functional theory, and moreover offers considerable potential for calculating interface energies across diverse material systems.</description>

      <title>Synchronization of Dirac-Bianconi driven oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20163v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In dynamical systems on networks, one assigns the dynamics to nodes, which are then coupled via links. This approach does not account for group interactions and dynamics on links and other higher dimensional structures. Higher-order network theory addresses this by considering variables defined on nodes, links, triangles, and higher-order simplices, called topological signals (or cochains). Moreover, topological signals of different dimensions can interact through the Dirac-Bianconi operator, which allows coupling between topological signals defined, for example, on nodes and links. Such interactions can induce various dynamical behaviors, for example, periodic oscillations. The oscillating system consists of topological signals on nodes and links whose dynamics are driven by the Dirac-Bianconi coupling, hence, which we call it Dirac-Bianconi driven oscillator. Using the phase reduction method, we obtain a phase description of this system and apply it to the study of synchronization between two such oscillators. This approach offers a way to analyze oscillatory behaviors in higher-order networks beyond the node-based paradigm, while providing a ductile modeling tool for node- and edge-signals.</description>

      <title>Addressing the Infinite Variance Problem in Fermionic Monte Carlo Simulations: Retrospective Error Remediation and the Exact Bridge Link Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08937v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the infinite variance problem in fermionic Monte Carlo simulations, which is widely encountered in areas ranging from condensed matter to nuclear and high-energy physics. The different algorithms, which we broadly refer to as determinantal quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC), are applied in many situations and differ in details, but they share a foundation in field theory, and often involve fermion determinants whose symmetry properties make the algorithm sign-problem-free. We show that the infinite variance problem arises as the observables computed in DQMC tend to form heavy-tailed distributions. To remedy this issue retrospectively, we introduce a tail-aware error estimation method to correct the otherwise unreliable estimates of confidence intervals. Furthermore, we demonstrate how to perform DQMC calculations that eliminate the infinite variance problem for a broad class of observables. Our approach is an exact bridge link method, which involves a simple and efficient modification to the standard DQMC algorithm. The method introduces no systematic bias and is straightforward to implement with minimal computational overhead. Our results establish a practical and robust solution to the infinite variance problem, with broad implications for improving the reliability of a variety of fundamental fermion simulations.</description>

      <title>Simulation of Muon-induced Backgrounds for the Colorado Underground Research Institute (CURIE)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06150v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive Monte Carlo simulation of muon-induced backgrounds for the Colorado Underground Research Institute (CURIE), a shallow-underground facility with $\approx 415$~m.w.e. overburden. Using coupled \textsc{mute} and \textsc{geant4} frameworks, we characterize the production and transport of muon-induced secondaries through site-specific rock compositions and geometries, establishing a proof-of-concept for high-precision, end-to-end simulations. Our simulations employ angular-dependent muon energy distributions, which improve secondary flux accuracy. For the Subatomic Particle Hideout and Cryolab I research spaces, we predict total muon-induced neutron fluxes of $(8.52 \pm 1.30_{\text{sys}}) \times 10^{-3}$~m$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ and $(8.86 \pm 1.62_{\text{sys}}) \times 10^{-3}$~m$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$, respectively. Additionally, we develop a Depth-Intensity Relation (DIR) to predict the muon-induced neutron flux as a function of facility depth, which is consistent with measurements across a broad range of underground depths. These results provide quantitative background predictions for experimental design and sensitivity projections at shallow- and deep-underground facilities. They further demonstrate that local geology and overburden geometry influence muon-induced secondary yields and energy spectra, emphasizing the need for site-specific simulations for accurate underground background characterization. Therefore, the simulation framework has been made publicly available at \href{https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17196581}{https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17196581}, for the broader low-background physics community to enable meaningful inter-facility comparisons.</description>

      <title>Time crystalline solitons and their stochastic dynamics in a driven-dissipative \phi^4 model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19587v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Periodically driven systems provide unique opportunities to investigate the dynamics of topological excitations far from equilibrium. In this paper, we report a time-crystalline soliton (TCS) state in a driven-dissipative $\phi^4$ model. This state exhibits spontaneous breaking of discrete time-translational symmetry while simultaneously displaying spatial soliton behavior. During time evolution, the soliton pattern periodically oscillates between kink and anti-kink configurations. We further study TCS dynamics under noise, demonstrating that soliton random walk can induce a dynamical transition between two distinct $Z_2$ symmetry-breaking time-crystalline phases in time domain. Finally, we examine the annihilation of two spatially separated TCSs under noise. Importantly, in contrast to the confined behavior of time-crystalline monopoles reported in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 131, 056502 (2023)], the dynamics of time-crystalline solitons is deconfined despite the nonequilibrium nature of our model: the statistically averaged annihilation time scales as a power law with the solitons' initial separation.</description>

      <title>Enforcing hidden physics in physics-informed neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14348v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) represent a new paradigm for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) by integrating physical laws into the learning process of neural networks. However, ensuring that such frameworks fully reflect the physical structure embedded in the governing equations remains an open challenge, particularly for maintaining robustness across diverse scientific problems. In this work, we address this issue by introducing a simple, generalized, yet robust irreversibility-regularized strategy that enforces hidden physical laws as soft constraints during training, thereby recovering the missing physics associated with irreversible processes in the conventional PINN. This approach ensures that the learned solutions consistently respect the intrinsic one-way nature of irreversible physical processes. Across a wide range of benchmarks spanning traveling wave propagation, steady combustion, ice melting, corrosion evolution, and crack growth, we observe substantial performance improvements over the conventional PINN, demonstrating that our regularization scheme reduces predictive errors by more than an order of magnitude, while requiring only minimal modification to existing PINN frameworks.</description>

Abstract: We present a fully analytical integration of the Maxwell stress tensor and derive exact relations for interparticle forces in systems of multiple dielectric spheres immersed in a polarizable ionic solvent, within the framework of the linearized Poisson--Boltzmann theory. Building upon the screening-ranged (in ascending orders of Debye screening) expansions of the potentials developed and rigorously analyzed in the accompanying works arXiv:2512.08407, arXiv:2512.08684, arXiv:2512.09421, we construct exact screening-ranged many-body expansions for electrostatic forces in explicit analytical form. These results establish a rigorous foundation for evaluating screened electrostatic interactions in complex particle systems and provide direct analytical connections to, and systematic improvements upon, various earlier approximate or limited-case formulations available in the literature, both at zero and finite ionic strength.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08684v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interaction of particles in an electrolytic medium can be calculated by solving the Poisson equation inside the solutes and the linearized Poisson--Boltzmann equation in the solvent, with suitable boundary conditions at the interfaces. Analytical approaches often expand the potentials in spherical harmonics, relating interior and exterior coefficients and eliminating some coefficients in favor of others, but a rigorous spectral analysis of the corresponding formulations is still lacking. Here, we introduce pertinent composite many-body Neumann--Poincar\'e-type operators and prove that they are compact with spectral radii strictly less than one. These results provide the foundation for systematic screening-ranged expansions, in powers of the Debye screening parameters, of electrostatic potentials, interaction energies, and forces, and establish the analytical framework for the accompanying works arXiv:2512.09421, arXiv:2512.08407, arXiv:2512.08682.</description>

      <title>GEARS - A Fully Run-Time Configurable Geant4 Application</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.09246v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Geant4 toolkit is the standard for simulating the passage of particles through matter, but its conventional architecture often requires users to modify and recompile C++ code to alter fundamental simulation parameters such as geometry, physics list, and primary particle source. This architectural constraint introduces significant friction for new users and slows down the experimental iteration cycle. This paper introduces GEARS (Geant4 Example Application with Rich features yet Small footprint), a universally applicable Geant4 application that fundamentally addresses this issue. GEARS achieves complete simulation configurability without C++ recompilation by strictly utilizing external configuration methods: Geometry is defined via simple text-based configuration, the Physics List is selected via the standard PHYSLIST environment variable, and the Primary Source is defined through the General Particle Source (GPS) macro commands. Furthermore, regarding GEARS as an application instead of a framework, key features include a flat ntuple structure with short variable names for highly efficient analysis and a solution for capturing vital initial step data. Output creation is also fully managed via run-time macro commands and volume properties. The project is distributed as a ready-to-use Docker container to eliminate compilation barriers. Through these design considerations, GEARS transforms Geant4 into a practical, ready-to-use tool, enabling users to rapidly prototype and execute simulations for diverse experiments solely through simple text configuration files, without ever needing to modify or compile the underlying C++ source code.</description>

      <title>Functional Percolation: A Perspective on Criticality of Form and Function</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.09317v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the physical constraints and minimal conditions that enable information processing in extended systems remains a central challenge across disciplines, from neuroscience and artificial intelligence to social and physical networks. Here we study how network connectivity both limits and enables information processing by analyzing random networks across the structural percolation transition. Using cascade-mediated dynamics as a minimal and universal mechanism for propagating state-dependent responses, we examine structural, functional, and information-theoretic observables as functions of mean degree in Erdos-Renyi networks. We find that the emergence of a giant connected component coincides with a sharp transition in realizable information processing: complex input-output response functions become accessible, functional diversity increases rapidly, output entropy rises, and directed information flow quantified by transfer entropy extends beyond local neighborhoods. These coincident transitions define a regime of functional percolation, referring to a sharp expansion of the space of realizable input-output functions at the structural percolation transition. Near criticality, networks exhibit a Pareto-optimal tradeoff between functional complexity and diversity, suggesting that percolation criticality provides a universal organizing principle for information processing in systems with local interactions and propagating influences.</description>

      <title>Exact Screening-Ranged Expansions for Many-Body Electrostatics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.09421v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an exact many-body framework for electrostatic interactions among $N$ arbitrarily charged spheres in an electrolyte, modeled by the linearized Poisson--Boltzmann equation. Building on a spectral analysis of nonstandard Neumann--Poincar\'e-type operators introduced in a companion mathematical work arXiv:2512.08684, we construct convergent screening-ranged series for the potential, interaction energy, and forces, where each term is associated with a well-defined Debye--H\"uckel screening order and can be obtained evaluating an analytical expression rather than numerically solving an infinitely dimensional linear system. This formulation unifies and extends classical and recent approaches, providing a rigorous basis for electrostatic interactions among heterogeneously charged particles (including Janus colloids) and yielding many-body generalizations of analytical explicit-form results previously available only for two-body systems. The framework captures and clarifies complex effects such as asymmetric dielectric screening, opposite-charge repulsion, and like-charge attraction, which remain largely analytically elusive in existing treatments. Beyond its fundamental significance, the method leads to numerically efficient schemes, offering a versatile tool for modeling colloids and soft/biological matter in electrolytic solution.</description>
