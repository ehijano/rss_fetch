      <description>arXiv:2506.05464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that two- and three-pion states produced in the decay of neutral kaons are contextual, entangled, and Bell nonlocal in isospin space. By reinterpreting the experimental values of the different isospin amplitudes, we can determine the amount of entanglement enjoyed by these states and the extent to which they violate the non-contextuality and Bell locality inequalities. Notably, the three-pion state offers a genuine multipartite test of Bell nonlocality with qutrits.</description>

      <title>Topological Freeze-out by Semi-Annihilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We point out that a QCD-like dark sector can be coupled to the Standard Model by gauging the topological Skyrme current, which measures the dark baryon number in the infrared, to give a technically natural model for dark matter. This coupling allows for a semi-annihilation process $\chi \chi \rightarrow \chi X_\mu$, where $X_\mu$ is the gauge boson mediator and $\chi$ a dark pion field, which plays the dominant role in setting the dark matter relic abundance. The topological interaction is purely $p$-wave and so free from indirect detection constraints. We show that the dark matter pion mass needs to be in the range $10$ MeV $\lesssim m_\chi \lesssim$ $1$ TeV; towards the lighter end of this range, there can moreover be significant self-interactions. We discuss prospects for probing this scenario at collider experiments, ranging from the LHC to low-energy $e^+ e^-$ colliders, future Higgs factories, and beam-dump experiments.</description>

      <title>The Intrinsic and Extrinsic Hierarchy Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hierarchy Problem of elementary particle physics can be divided into two separate problems: the Intrinsic and Extrinsic Hierarchy Problems. The Intrinsic Hierarchy Problem (IHP) arises when the Wilsonian renormalization group induces a large Lambda_UV cutoff dependence on a much lighter scalar mass, creating a large finetuning. The Extrinsic Hierarchy Problem (EHP) arises when the IR theory is augmented with generically assumed extra states and interactions in the UV, making the resulting IR effective theory appear highly finetuned. The IHP is straightforward to analyze within a theory, but has suspicious regulator dependence, and so may be a fake problem. The EHP is less straightforward to analyze, but has strength of physical intuition. We analyze EHP as a formal paradox, spelling out its premises and reasoning. From this we classify solutions to the EHP in terms of premise violations, and we articulate why some purported solutions to the Hierarchy Problem only partially solve the IHP and leave the EHP unaddressed.</description>

      <title>The $U(1)_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$ model meets the new $(g-2)_\mu$ data and muon neutrino trident scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Muon $g-2$ collaboration at Fermilab has announced their final result of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon. This result is now in agreement with the latest theoretical prediction to the $1\sigma$ level. This new result further constrains the allowed parameter space, but does not rule out all possible new physics contributions the muon $g-2$. We study the implications for one of the relevant models, the gauged $U(1)_{L_\mu - L_\tau}$. When using this model to resolve the previous $4\sigma$ tension, results from muon neutrino trident (MNT) scattering experiments would restrict the mass of the new gauge boson ($Z'$) to be less than $300$ MeV. Since the theory and experimental data difference for muon $g-2$ is lowered down to $1\sigma$, the requirement for $m_{Z'}\lesssim 300\,{\rm MeV}$ is much relaxed. Within the updated allowed range of $Z'$ boson mass, we study the models implications for electron and tauon $g-2$ as well as future muon colliders. We find that muon collider can effectively probe the $U(1)_{L_\mu - L_\tau}$.</description>

      <title>Models for differential cross section in proton-proton scattering and their implications at ISR and LHC energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Few composite exponential models for the differential cross section are proposed to analyse the proton-proton ($pp$) elastic scattering at several energies. These proposed models are fitted to the data for $pp$ elastic differential cross section reported at CERN-ISR, LHC, and extrapolated energies of other models. These models have produced important features including dip-bump structure and shrinkage of the forward peak. Position of the dip is also well produced by our models for all the data across a broad energy range of $\sqrt{s}$ = 23 GeV, 23.5 GeV, 27.23 GeV, 30.7 GeV, 44.7 GeV, 52.8 GeV, 62.5 GeV, 200 GeV, 800 GeV, 2.76 TeV, 7 TeV, 8 TeV, 13 TeV, 14 TeV, 15 TeV, and 28 TeV. Employing these proposed models, elastic cross section, inelastic cross section, and total cross section are calculated at all the energies. Calculated results are compared with experimental data and theoretical results of other models. Implications of these results (obtained by models) related to the structure and dynamics of proton are discussed. The findings of this study emphasize the significance of combining theoretical and phenomenological approaches to accurately describe $pp$ elastic scattering at high energies and provide significant information to future LHC experiments for the investigation of differential cross section.</description>

      <title>Quark-universal $U(1)$ breaking scalar at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If the quarks or leptons are charged under a new $U(1)$ gauge symmetry, then besides a $Z'$ boson there must exist at least one new boson whose decay products include Standard Model particles. In the case of a minimal symmetry breaking sector, that new boson is a scalar $\phi$ that couples to the $Z'$ boson as well as to the new fermions required to cancel the $U(1)$ gauge anomalies. The scalar may be produced at the LHC in association with a $Z'$ boson, or through $Z'$ boson fusion, while its decays are typically into four jets or two photons. We analyze in detail the case where the $Z'$ boson is leptophobic, and all the quarks have the same charge under the new $U(1)$. If $\phi$ mixes with the Standard Model Higgs boson, then the new scalar can also be produced via gluon fusion, and the discovery mode is likely to be a diphoton resonance.</description>

      <title>Vector Boson Fusion Signatures of Superheavy Majorana Neutrinos at Muon Colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the sensitivity of future high-energy muon colliders to heavy Majorana neutrinos, considering both opposite-sign ($\mu^+\mu^-$) and same-sign ($\mu^+\mu^+$) collision modes. We focus on $\mu^+\mu^-$ colliders operating at centre-of-mass energies of 1, 3 and 10~TeV, as well as the proposed $\mu$TRISTAN facility at 2~TeV, and we analyse the production of heavy neutrinos via vector boson fusion in the $t$-channel, a mechanism that becomes dominant in the multi-TeV regime. We evaluate its exclusion potential in terms of the heavy neutrino mass and the mixing of the heavy neutrino with its Standard Model counterparts, using both cut-based selections and boosted decision trees trained to exploit the distinct kinematic signatures of heavy Majorana neutrino exchanges. Our results demonstrate the complementarity between collider configurations, and show that active-sterile mixing angles as small as 0.001 could be probed for neutrino masses up to 100~TeV, an experimentally inaccessible region of the parameter space at current facilities. Altogether, this work establishes the discovery potential of muon colliders for testing super-heavy Majorana neutrinos, complementary to conventional probes, and provides compelling motivation for the next generation of high-energy lepton colliders.</description>

      <title>Accelerating multijet-merged event generation with neural network matrix element surrogates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The efficient simulation of multijet final states presents a serious computational task for analyses of LHC data and will be even more so at the HL-LHC. We here discuss means to accelerate the generation of unweighted events based on a two-stage rejection-sampling algorithm that employs neural-network surrogates for unweighting the hard-process matrix elements. To this end, we generalise the previously proposed algorithm based on factorisation-aware neural networks to the case of multijet merging at tree-level accuracy. We thereby account for several non-trivial aspects of realistic event-simulation setups, including biased phase-space sampling, partial unweighting, and the mapping of partonic subprocesses. We apply our methods to the production of Z+jets final states at the HL-LHC using the Sherpa event generator, including matrix elements with up to six final-state partons. When using neural-network surrogates for the dominant Z+5 jets and Z+6 jets partonic processes, we find a reduction in the total event-generation time by more than a factor of 10 compared to baseline Sherpa.</description>

      <title>Initial stage jet momentum broadening in tBLFQ formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the momentum broadening of a high-energy quark jet in the large density gluon medium created right after the collision of two ultrarelativistic heavy nuclei, the Glasma. Previous Glasma studies modeled the jet as a classical probe particle, for which position and momentum are simultaneously determined. In this work, we use the light-front QCD Hamiltonian formalism to treat the jet as a fully quantum state. We compute its real-time evolution while propagating through the Glasma classical background fields, which act as an interaction potential in the quantum evolution of the jet. We present results for the momentum broadening and jet quenching parameter of a jet at mid-rapidity, with special emphasis on the anisotropies between the longitudinal and transverse directions relative to the collision axis. In addition, we compare our results to classical calculations, and initiate a study of the distinction between kinetic and canonic momentum in the context of jet momentum broadening.</description>

      <title>Tidal Disruption in Topological Solitons and the Emergence of an Effective Horizon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the dynamics of particles and strings falling into smooth horizonless spacetimes that match the Schwarzschild black hole but replace its horizon with a smooth cap in supergravity. The cap consists of a regular topological structure formed by the deformations of extra compact dimensions. We show that infalling particles follow Schwarzschild-like trajectories down to the cap, but experience rapidly growing tidal forces that reach extreme values. In addition, infalling strings encounter a region of tidal instability localized at the cap, where transverse modes are excited. This stringy excitation drains their kinetic energy, resulting in tidal trapping. We demonstrate that the onset and strength of this instability depend sensitively on the Kaluza-Klein scale, the string scale, and the mass of the spacetime, ensuring that strings cannot escape the cap region. These results show that horizonless geometries can reproduce key features of black hole absorption while maintaining regularity at the horizon scale, offering compelling evidence for the emergence of effective horizon-like behavior from topological spacetime structures.</description>

      <title>Probing QCD Confinement with Spin Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Once regarded as mere emptiness, the vacuum is now understood to possess a rich and complex structure, characterized by fluctuating energy fields and a condensate of virtual quark-antiquark pairs. These pairs cause spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking, a fundamental phenomenon that is believed to generate over 99% of the mass in the visible universe. However, the precise mechanism linking the chiral symmetry breaking to the mass generation associated with quark confinement remains one of the most profound open questions in physics. Here, we investigate high energy proton-proton collisions at the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven National Laboratory, where those collisions could liberate virtual quark-antiquark pairs from the vacuum. These virtual pairs, particularly the strange quark-antiquark pairs, are initially quantum spin-entangled and later undergo quark confinement to form hadrons such as $\Lambda$ hyperons. In this Letter, we report the first evidence of spin correlation of $\Lambda\bar{\Lambda}$ hyperon pairs measured by the STAR experiment at RHIC - a relative polarization signal of $(18 \pm 4)\%$ that links the spin-entangled quark pairs of the Quantum Chromodynamic (QCD) vacuum to their final-state hadron counterparts. Crucially, this correlation vanishes when the hyperon pairs are widely separated in angle, consistent with the decoherence of the quantum system. Our findings provide a new experimental paradigm for exploring the dynamics and interplay of quark confinement and entanglement.</description>

      <title>Pathfinding Quantum Simulations of Neutrinoless Double-$\beta$ Decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present results from co-designed quantum simulations of the neutrinoless double-$\beta$ decay of a simple nucleus in 1+1D quantum chromodynamics using IonQ's Forte-generation trapped-ion quantum computers. Electrons, neutrinos, and up and down quarks are distributed across two lattice sites and mapped to 32 qubits, with an additional 4 qubits used for flag-based error mitigation. A four-fermion interaction is used to implement weak interactions, and lepton-number violation is induced by a neutrino Majorana mass. Quantum circuits that prepare the initial nucleus and time evolve with the Hamiltonian containing the strong and weak interactions are executed on IonQ Forte Enterprise. A clear signal of neutrinoless double-$\beta$ decay is measured, making this the first quantum simulation to observe lepton-number violation in real time. This was made possible by co-designing the simulation to maximally utilize the all-to-all connectivity and native gate-set available on IonQ's quantum computers. Quantum circuit compilation techniques and co-designed error-mitigation methods, informed from executing benchmarking circuits with up to 2,356 two-qubit gates, enabled observables to be extracted with high precision. We discuss the potential of future quantum simulations to provide yocto-second resolution of the reaction pathways in these, and other, nuclear processes.</description>

      <title>Detection of multiple X-ray quasi-periodic oscillations in IGR J19294+1816 with Insight-HXMT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the timing results with Insight-HXMT observations of X-ray binary IGR J19294+1816 during its 2019 Type I outburst at the decline phase shortly following its peak. We analyze the light curves and power density spectrum (PDS) of the 2019 observations and reveal a peak at approximately $\nu_{NS} \sim 80.2$ mHz, corresponding to X-ray pulsations from the neutron star. In addition, a significant quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) feature is observed at around $\nu_{QPO} \sim 30.2$ mHz from 10-50 keV, with the rms amplitude increasing with energy. Furthermore, we detect two QPOs at the frequency of $\sim 51.1$ mHz and $113.7$ mHz (corresponding to sidebands near $\nu_{NS} \pm \nu_{QPO}$) in 25-50 keV, exhibiting an rms amplitude of around 12$\%$. Wavelet analysis also shows multiple QPOs at the frequency of $\sim 30$ mHz, $50$ mHz and $ 110$ mHz and these QPO features show transient behaviors, the centroid frequencies of $\sim 30$ mHz remain nearly constant for different luminosities. Our research identifies IGR J19294+1816 as the second strong magnetic-field pulsar with significant sideband signals around the spin frequency. We explore various physical origins that could explain the presence of multiple QPOs.</description>

      <title>Smoking gun signature from axion and the constraints with radio telescopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Axions are an elegant solution to the strong CP problem for particle physics and a promising dark matter candidate. They can convert into photons under a strong magnetic field, while magnetars with extreme magnetic fields are natural labs for axion detection. Radio telescopes can detect the radio emission from axion-photon conversion near magnetars. In this study, we have refined the calculation of axion-photon conversion and developed the matched filtering integration method to largely improve the signal-to-noise ratio. We validate our method using end-to-end simulation and real observational data from TMRT. A new constraint is set with only 687 seconds of observations with TMRT. Using 10 hours of observation with the high-frequency receiver in FAST or SKA, we can reach the theoretical coupling constant prediction for the axion mass range from 1$\mu$eV to 100$\mu$eV. We validate the possibility of axion detection with radio telescopes and avoid spectrum confusion.</description>

Abstract: The geometry of center vortices is studied in the novel lattice-artefact phase that appears with staggered fermions to elucidate any insight provided by the center-vortex degrees of freedom. For various numbers of fermion flavors, the single-site shift symmetry of the staggered-fermion action is broken in a finite region of the $(\beta, m)$ phase space. Simulations are performed with six degenerate fermion flavors and a range of $\beta$ values that span the phase boundary. Center vortices are demonstrated to capture the broken shift symmetry that manifests in the unphysical phase. This persists at the level of each individual plaquette orientation, where it is revealed only the plaquettes that span the broken dimension are affected. Several bulk center-vortex quantities, including the vortex and branching point densities, are considered to highlight other aspects of vortex geometry sensitive to the unphysical phase. A slight preference for the plaquettes affected by the broken shift symmetry to be pierced by a vortex is observed. This translates also to a greater branching point density in three-dimensional slices that span the broken dimension. Combined, these findings provide a novel characterization of the unphysical phase in terms of the fundamental center degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Femtoscopic signatures of unique nuclear structures in relativistic collisions</title>

Abstract: One of the most vital topics of today's high-energy nuclear physics is the investigation of the nuclear structure of the collided nuclei. Recent studies at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) have shown that several observables, such as the collective flow and transverse-momentum correlations of the produced particles, can be sensitive to various nuclear structure and deformation parameters. Femtoscopy, another essential tool for investigating the space-time geometry of the matter created in nuclear collisions, has not yet been widely applied to such studies. Using a multiphase transport model (AMPT), in this Letter, it is demonstrated that the femtoscopic source parameters of pion pairs can also serve as a robust signal of unique nuclear structure. Through an analysis of $^{208}$Pb+$^{20}$Ne and $^{208}$Pb+$^{16}$O collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm{NN}}}$ = 68.5 GeV, two collision systems especially relevant to the SMOG2 program of the LHCb experiment, it is shown that a deformed initial shape can significantly affect femtoscopic source parameters. This study highlights the importance of expanding the nuclear structure investigations to femtoscopic observables and serves as a baseline for numerous possible future studies in this new direction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the standard lore the decay of the false vacuum of a single-field potential is described by a semi-classical Euclidean bounce configuration that can be found using overshoot/undershoot algorithms, and whose action suppresses exponentially the decay rate. While this is generically correct, we show in a few concrete examples of potentials, previously studied in the literature for other purposes, that the vacuum decay structure can be far richer. In some cases there is no bounce and decay proceeds via the so-called pseudo-bounce configurations. In the general case with bounce, there are $2n+1$ bounces, with $n$ ranging from 0 (the standard case) to $\infty$. Some of these decay configurations we call antibounces as they have the wrong behavior for overshoot/undershoot algorithms, which can miss them. Bounce and antibounce configurations form $n$ pairs connected by pseudo-bounces. Our analysis benefits from a combined use of Euclidean and tunneling potential methods.</description>

      <title>Magnetogenesis from Sawtooth Coupling: Gravitational Wave Probe of Reheating</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detection of gravitational waves (GWs) by LIGO-Virgo and pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) has opened a new window into early universe cosmology. Yet, the origin of large-scale magnetic fields and the dynamics of the reheating epoch remain poorly understood. In this work, we study the generation of secondary GWs (SGWs) sourced by primordial magnetic fields produced via a Sawtooth-type coupling during reheating with a general background evolution. We show that the reheating equation of state significantly influences the spectral shape and amplitude of the magnetic fields. While a scale-invariant spectrum is typically needed to match observational bounds, this coupling naturally produces a strongly blue-tilted spectrum that remains consistent with current constraints. Crucially, the magnetic field continues to grow during reheating, leading to a GW signal with a broken power-law spectrum and a distinctive blue tilt on super-horizon scales. This SGW signal can fall within the sensitivity of upcoming detectors such as LISA, DECIGO, and BBO. The unique spectral features make this scenario distinguishable from other sources, offering a viable mechanism for cosmic magnetogenesis and a novel probe of the reheating era through GW observations.</description>

      <title>Accurately simulating core-collapse self-interacting dark matter halos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The properties of satellite halos provide a promising probe for dark matter (DM) physics. Observations motivate current efforts to explain surprisingly compact DM halos. If DM is not collisionless but has strong self-interactions, halos can undergo gravothermal collapse, leading to higher densities in the central region of the halo. However, it is challenging to model this collapse phase from first principles. To improve on this, we seek to better understand numerical challenges and convergence properties of self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) N-body simulations in the collapse phase. Especially we aim for a better understanding of the evolution of satellite halos. To do so, we run SIDM N-body simulations of a low mass halo in isolation and within an external gravitational potential. The simulation setup is motivated by the perturber of the stellar stream GD-1. We find that the halo evolution is very sensitive to energy conservation errors, and a too large SIDM kernel size can artificially speed up the collapse. Moreover, we demonstrate that the King model can describe the density profile at small radii for the late stages that we have simulated. Furthermore, for our highest-resolved simulation (N = 5x10^7) we make the data public. It can serve as a benchmark. Overall, we find that the current numerical methods do not suffer from convergence problems in the late collapse phase and provide guidance on how to choose numerical parameters, e.g. that the energy conservation error is better kept well below 1%. This allows to run simulations of halos becoming concentrated enough to explain observations of GD-1 like stellar streams or strong gravitational lensing systems.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a new method for deriving Feynman integral symmetry relations. By solving the ansatz of momentum transformation in the field of rational functions rather than constants, this method can sometimes find more symmetry relations, compared to some state-of-the-art software. The new method may help to further decrease the number of unique sectors in an integral family. Well-chosen gauge conditions are implemented in this method for the efficient symmetry searching.</description>

      <title>Quantification of the low-$p_{\rm T}$ pion excess in heavy-ion collisions at the LHC and top RHIC energy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09207v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While the abundances of the final state hadrons in relativistic heavy-ion collisions are rather well described by the thermal particle production, the shape of the transverse momentum, $p_{\rm T}$, distribution below $p_{\rm T}\approx500$ MeV$/c$, is still poorly understood. We propose a procedure to quantify the model-to-data differences using Bayesian inference techniques, which allows for consistent treatment of the experimental uncertainties and tests the completeness of the available hydrodynamic frameworks. Using relativistic fluid framework Fluid${\it u}$M with PCE coupled to \trento initial state and FastReso decays, we analyse \pt distribution of identified charged hadrons measured in heavy-ion collisions at top RHIC and the LHC energies, and identify an excess of pions produced below $p_{\rm T}\approx500$ MeV$/c$. Our results provide new input for the interpretation of the pion excess as either missing components in the thermal particle yield description or as an evidence for a different particle production mechanism.</description>

      <title>Analysis on Neutrino Masses and Leptogenesis in the CP-Violating Standard Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10621v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article extends the CP-violating Standard Model (CPVSM) from the quark sector to the lepton sector to investigate leptogenesis and neutrino masses. Using the identity $\Delta_{hm} + \Delta_{ml} = \Delta_{hl}$, where $\Delta_{ij} = (m^2_i - m^2_j)$ denoting the mass-squared difference (MSD) between fermions $i$ and $j$, and $h$, $m$, and $l$ labeling the heaviest, middle, and lightest fermions of a given type, respectively, we predict the third neutrino MSD from two experimental inputs: $\Delta_a = 2.51 \times 10^{-3}$ eV$^2$ and $\Delta_b = 7.42 \times 10^{-5}$ eV$^2$. Of six possible assignments of these values to the three $\Delta_{hm}, \Delta_{ml}$, and $\Delta_{hl}$, four consistent cases remain and are grouped into two classes. All four predict similar heaviest and lightest neutrino masses ($m_h = 5.01 \times 10^{-2}$ eV and $m_l = 6.09098 \times 10^{-3}$ eV), but differ in the middle mass: $m_m = 4.97283 \times 10^{-2}$ eV in Class 1, and $m_m = 1.05499 \times 10^{-2}$ eV in Class 2. In a complementary analysis, treating the mass ratio $g = m_h / m_m$ as a variable, we examine how $m_h$, $m_m$, $m_l$, and $g'$ evolve with $g$. Of particular interest are the ranges of $g$ bounded by MSD-based values derived in Subsection III-A (blue points) and values derived from a previously predicted $m_l = 8.61 \times 10^{-3}$ eV (green points). Finally, using the leptonic Jarlskog measure of CPV $\Delta_{CP(l)} = J_{(l)} (\Delta_{ij} \Delta_{jk} \Delta_{ki})_{(\ell)} (\Delta_{ij} \Delta_{jk} \Delta_{ki})_{(\nu)}$, we find that leptogenesis is at least 71 orders of magnitude weaker than baryogenesis in the CPVSM. This striking discrepancy suggests that new physics beyond the Standard Model is required for leptogenesis to account for the observed BAU.</description>

      <title>Tracing the bottom electroweak dipole operators at future lepton colliders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05398v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While often omitted in the SMEFT analyses of electroweak measurements, the electroweak dipole operators of the bottom quark have been found to be important in some cases and are also related to processes involving the top quark. In this paper, we further investigate their effects, focusing on the measurements of the $e^+e^-\to b\bar{b}$ process at a future lepton collider. Their linear contributions are suppressed by the bottom mass due to the helicity flip in the interference term with the SM amplitude, leading to a nontrivial interplay between the linear and the quadratic contributions. With two runs at the Z-pole and 240 GeV, the effects of CP-even dipole coefficients can be well separated from the modifications of the SM $Zb\bar{b}$ couplings, while an additional run (e.g. at 360 GeV) is useful for lifting a nontrivial second best-fit point due to the quadratic contributions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15733v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the non-thermal production of the Higgsino dark matter (DM). Assuming that the lightest neutral Higgsino is the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) in minimal supersymmetric standard model, we calculate the relic abundance of the Higgsino LSP produced by the decay of late-decaying scalar field. In the calculation of the relic abundance, we have properly included the effects of coannihilation as well as the non-perturbative effect (known as the Sommerfeld effect). Contrary to the case of the thermal-relic scenario, in which the observed DM abundance is realized with the Higgsino mass of ~ 1.2 TeV, Higgsino DM is possible with lighter Higgsino mass as the reheating temperature becomes lower than the Higgsino mass. The reheating temperature relevant for realizing the correct DM density is presented as a funciton of the Higgsino mass.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18209v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the relic density of asymmetric dark matter with long-range interactions in non-standard cosmological scenarios where the extra cosmic energy is introduced. The Hubble expansion rate is modified in non-standard cosmological models, which affects the relic density of dark matter. If the mass of the dark exchanged gauge boson is less than the mass of dark matter particles multiplied by the dark fine-structure constant, the wave function of the incoming particles of dark matter annihilation would be distorted away from the free plane-wave approximation, yielding the significant enhancements to annihilation cross sections, known as Sommerfeld enhancement. Sommerfeld enhancement results the asymmetric dark matter relic density under abundant, while the enhanced cosmic expansion rate increases the relic density of asymmetric dark matter by letting the decoupling from the thermal equilibrium occurs earlier. However, the mixed effect of modified cosmic expansion and the Sommerfeld enhancement on asymmetric dark matter density evolution becomes quite complicated, due to their opposing affects on relic density and contrary strength developments as the temperature fell. We investigated the mixed effects on asymmetric dark matter freeze-out process and current relic abundance, which is significantly different from the standard situation. Further, we calculate the constraint relations of the asymmetric dark matter pertubative annihilation cross section and dark coupling constant with the mass of asymmetric dark matter, the asymmetry factor with the dark coupling constant, when the relic density of asymmetric dark matter falled in the observed region. The upper bounds on the mass of asymmetric dark matter for s-wave and p-wave annihilations are also derived.</description>

      <title>Wigner multiplets in QFT: dark sector and CPT-violating scenarios</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09684v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The classification of elementary particles based on unitary irreducible representations of the Poincare group has been a cornerstone of modern Quantum Field Theory (QFT). While the Standard Model (SM) does not inherently include Dark Matter (DM), any fundamental DM candidate should still conform to this classification or its extensions. Beyond the standard representations, Wigner introduced a class of nontrivial states characterized by an additional discrete degree of freedom, known as the Wigner degeneracy. We systematically investigate the QFT of such Wigner degenerate multiplets, particularly focusing on the massive spin-1/2 case. We construct a theoretical framework where the two-fold Wigner spinor fields, $\psi_{\pm\frac{1}{2}}(x)$, form a doublet representation. We analyze their transformation properties under discrete symmetries (C, P, and T), revealing novel mixing effects due to Wigner degeneracy and an emergent accidental U(2) global symmetry. Furthermore, we explore their Yukawa and gauge interactions, demonstrating that such interactions generally break the CPT symmetry. However, we derive conditions for the CPT conservation and discuss potential phenomenological consequences beyond the SM. These results provide new insights into the possible role of Wigner-degenerate states in fundamental physics, particularly in the dark sector.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Flavor Model and Leptogenesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19924v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit a supersymmetric flavor model based on the symmetries $SU(2)_L \times A_4 \times Z_3 \times U(1)_R$, which extends the original Altarelli and Feruglio construction by introducing flavon and driving superfields responsible for the spontaneous breaking of the flavor symmetry in order to obtain non-zero reactor angle. The vacuum alignments of flavon fields are achieved through the minimization of the scalar potential derived from the superpotential. This setup leads to specific mass matrices for the charged leptons and neutrinos that are consistent with current experimental data, including the measured values of the lepton mixing angles and neutrino mass squared differences. We investigate whether the model can simultaneously accommodate successful thermal leptogenesis. In particular, we analyze the CP asymmetry generated in the decay of heavy Majorana neutrinos, the resulting lepton asymmetry, and its conversion to the baryon asymmetry through the electroweak sphalerons. However the CP asymmetry is zero, since the Dirac neutrino mass matrix is simple texture in the leading order for our model. Then we consider the next-to-leading order in Yukawa interactions of the Dirac neutrinos. Therefore, we can realize the baryon asymmetry of the universe at the present universe. By numerically scanning the parameter space, we identify the regions consistent with both neutrino oscillation data and the observed baryon asymmetry. In the specific case such that one of the couplings for the right-handed Majorana neutrinos is real parameter, the predicted lightest neutrino mass is at least $5$ meV and $15$ meV for the normal and inverted neutrino mass hierarchies, respectively. In addition, the range of the Majorana phases may be tested in future experiments.</description>

      <title>Halo Formation from Yukawa Forces in the Very Early Universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.13053v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: If long-range attractive forces exist and are stronger than gravity then cosmic halo formation can begin in the radiation-dominated era. We study a simple realization of this effect in a system where dark matter fermions have Yukawa interactions mediated by scalar particles, analogous to the Higgs boson in the standard model. We develop a self-consistent description of the system including exact background dynamics of the scalar field, and precise modelling of the fermion density fluctuations. For the latter, we provide accurate approximations for the linear growth as well as quantitative modelling of the nonlinear evolution using N-body simulations. We find that halo formation occurs exponentially fast and on scales substantially larger than simple estimates predict. The final fate of these halos remains uncertain, but could be annihilation, dark stars, primordial black holes, or even the existence of galaxy-sized halos at matter-radiation equality. More generally, our results demonstrate the importance of mapping scalar-mediated interactions onto structure formation outcomes and constraints for beyond the standard model theories.</description>

      <title>Effect of interparticle fields and radiation reaction on beam dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.17832v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of relativistic particles in an intense electromagnetic field can be described by the Landau-Lifshitz (LL) equation, where the adiation reaction (RR) is accounted for via a self-force, and interparticle fields are often neglected as an approximation. However, the inclusion of interparticle fields is necessary to ensure energy-momentum conservation, particularly during coherent emission. Here we present (i) an analytical proof showing that the energy-momentum conservation law of the Hamilton-Rohrlich-Dirac action, which is divergence free and describes a generic system of interacting charges, respects causality and provides physically sensible results; (ii) a simple generalization of the LL equation for many particles evaluated as a function of the total field, i.e., the sum of the external and interparticle fields. By performing first-principles numerical simulations of a neutral, relativistic bunch of electrons and positrons ($e^-/e^+$) colliding with a laser pulse, this theory is shown to satisfy energy-momentum conservation when interparticle fields and RR are simultaneously taken into account; and (iii) the combined effect of interparticle fields and RR primarily affects the tail of the particle energy distribution. Additionally, our first-principles simulations show that the effect of interparticle fields on beam energy loss becomes smaller when most of the radiated energy is incoherent.</description>

      <title>Inconsistency with De Sitter Spacetime in a New Approach to Gravitational Particle Production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.05243v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the recent Physical Review Letter [1] which presents a new mechanism for particle production and black hole evaporation through a spatially dependent temperature. This new temperature is comparable to the Hawking result near the black hole, but is very small far away, and therefore could be a small correction. Here we apply the proposed reasoning to the case of de Sitter space, finding that it over predicts the de Sitter temperature of a minimally coupled scalar by factor of $\approx 4.3$ and over predicts the particle production rate by a factor of $\approx 52$. For non-minimally coupled scalars, it has other various problems; it predicts a negative particle production for conformal, or nearly conformal, coupled scalars; it predicts unsuppressed productions of heavy scalars. This all demonstrates an inconsistency in the proposed formalism.</description>

      <title>Notes on Quasinormal Modes of charged de Sitter Blackholes from Quiver Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18359v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give the connection formulae for ordinary differential equations with 5 and 6 (and in principle can be generalized to more) regular singularities from the data of instanton partition functions of quiver gauge theories. We check the consistency of these connection formulae by numerically computing the quasinormal modes (QNMs) of Reissner-Nordstr\"om de Sitter (RN-dS) blackhole. Analytic expressions are obtained for all the families of QNMs, including the photon-sphere modes, dS modes, and near-extremal modes. We also argue that a similar method can be applied to the dS-Kerr-Newman blackhole.</description>

      <title>QCD Equation of State with $N_f=3$ Flavors up to the Electroweak Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11603v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The equation of state of Quantum Chromodynamics with $N_f=3$ flavors is determined non-perturbatively in the range of temperatures between $3$ and $165$~GeV with a precision of about $0.5$-$1.0$\%. The calculation is carried out by numerical simulations of lattice gauge theory discretized \`a la Wilson with shifted boundary conditions in the compact direction. At each given temperature the entropy density is computed at several lattice spacings in order to extrapolate the results to the continuum limit. Taken at face value, data point straight to the Stefan-Boltzmann value by following a linear behavior in the strong coupling constant squared. They are also compatible with the known perturbative formula supplemented by higher order terms in the coupling constant, a parametrization which describes well our data together with those present in the literature down to $500$ MeV.</description>

      <title>Eye of the vortex: bound spectra in tunable horizonless rotational analogs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03451v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Analog gravity experiments are making remarkable strides in unveiling both the classical and quantum nature of black holes. By harnessing diverse states of matter, contemporary tabletop setups now replicate strong-field phenomena typically confined to the enigmatic regions surrounding black holes. Through these modern gravity simulators, physical processes once considered elusive may finally be brought into experimental reach. In this work, we investigate the bound spectrum of massless scalar excitations propagating within the effective geometry of a rotating acoustic metric. Specifically, we utilize an analog vortex endowed with a tunable parameter that emulates the spacetime of a rotating gravitational background. This model accommodates both the presence of a sonic horizon--characteristic of an acoustic black hole--for non-zero tuning parameters, and its absence when the parameter vanishes, yielding a horizonless, purely rotational vortex flow devoid of radial inflow. We focus on the latter case, where the vortex flow is purely rotational, and compute the spectral properties of the analog system. The resulting bound-state spectrum is found to be qualitatively consistent with that observed in recent experimental realizations of superfluid Helium giant quantum vortices featuring solid or hollow cores. This correspondence suggests that the analog spacetime geometry used here holds significant potential to replicate the phenomenology of cutting-edge laboratory experiments. In doing so, it offers new insight into the intricate landscape of analog black hole spectroscopy and, potentially, the physical topography of bounded, rotating astrophysical environments around black holes.</description>
