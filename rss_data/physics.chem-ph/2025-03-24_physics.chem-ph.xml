      <title>APPA : Agentic Preformulation Pathway Assistant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The design and development of effective drug formulations is a critical process in pharmaceutical research, particularly for small molecule active pharmaceutical ingredients. This paper introduces a novel agentic preformulation pathway assistant (Appa), leveraging large language models coupled to experimental databases and a suite of machine learning models to streamline the preformulation process of drug candidates. Appa successfully integrates domain expertise from scientific publications, databases holding experimental results, and machine learning predictors to reason and propose optimal preformulation strategies based on the current evidence. This results in case-specific user guidance for the developability assessment of a new drug and directs towards the most promising experimental route, significantly reducing the time and resources required for the manual collection and analysis of existing evidence. The approach aims to accelerate the transition of promising compounds from discovery to preclinical and clinical testing.</description>

      <title>Production, Characteristics and Biological effects of Protonated Small Water Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The production and characteristics of protonated small water clusters (PSWCs) were reported in this work, where in electrospray ionization (ESI) of pure water, the species obtained were singly charged molecular ions consisting of 2, 3, 4 or 5 water molecules attached to a hydrogen ion, [(H2O)n+H]+, where n = 2, 3, 4 or 5. We proposed a new type of PSWCs structure: 2, 3, 4, 5 water molecules wrapped around a hydrogen ion which is located at the electrical and geometric center, forming a very stable molecular structure. Furthermore, biological tests of the PSWCs on mitochondrial function of intestinal epithelial cells and liver cells in mice showed the better therapeutic effect on inflammatory bowel diseases compared to that of the biologic agent Infliximab.</description>

      <title>Extreme Ultraviolet Time-Resolved Photoelectron Spectrometer with an Ultrathin Liquid Flat Jet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A setup for extreme-ultraviolet time-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (XUV-TRPES) of liquids is described based on a gas-dynamic flat jet formed by a microfluidic chip device. In comparison to a cylindrical jet that has a typical diameter of 10-30 micrometers, the larger surface area of the flat jet with a width of ca. 300 micrometers allows for full overlap of the target with the pump and probe light beams. This results in an enhancement of photoelectrons emitted from the liquid, while simultaneously allowing smaller sample consumption compared with other flat jet techniques utilizing liquid collisions or converging slits. Femtosecond pulses of XUV light at a photon energy of 21.7 eV are prepared by high harmonic generation and a multilayer mirror that selects a single harmonic; the He gas used to form the gas-dynamic flat jet is transparent at this energy. Compared to a cylindrical jet, the photoelectron signal from the liquid is enhanced relative to that from the surrounding vapor jacket. Pump-probe spectra for aqueous thymine show notably higher signals for the flat vs cylindrical jet. Moreover, the time-dependent space-charge shift in UV pump/XUV probe experiments is smaller for the gas dynamic flat jet than for a cylindrical jet with the same flow rate, an effect that is accentuated at higher He backing pressures that yield a thinner jet. This reflects reduced multiphoton ionization of the solute by the UV pump pulse, the primary cause of the space charge shift, as the jet becomes thinner and reaches the thickness of a few tens of nm.</description>

      <title>Light-induced persistent electronic chirality in achiral molecules probed with transient absorption circular dichroism spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral systems exhibit unique properties traditionally linked to their asymmetric spatial arrangement. Recently, multiple laser pulses were shown to induce purely electronic chiral states without altering the nuclear configuration. Here we propose and numerically demonstrate a simpler realization of light-induced electronic chirality that is long-lived and occurs much before the onset of nuclear motion. Specifically, a single monochromatic circularly-polarized laser pulse can induce electronic chiral currents in an oriented achiral molecule. We analyze this effect with state-of-the-art ab-initio theory and connect the induced electronic chiral currents directly to induced magnetic dipole moments, which are detectable using attosecond transient absorption electronic circular dichroism spectroscopy. Our findings show that the chiral electronic wavepacket rapidly oscillates in handedness at frequencies corresponding to higher-order harmonics of the pump laser's carrier frequency, and the currents survive well after the laser pulse has turned off. Therefore, we propose a light-induced chiral molecular-current analogue to high harmonic generation, paving the way to attosecond transient chirality controlled by a single laser pulse. Such ultrafast chiral transients could enable emerging technologies such as enhanced spintronics, coherent control of chemical reactions, and more.</description>

      <title>Molecular Polarizability under Vibrational Strong Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polaritonic chemistry offers the possibility of modifying molecular properties and even influencing chemical reactivity through strong coupling between vibrational transitions and confined light modes in optical cavities. Despite considerable theoretical progress and due to the complexity of the coupled light-matter system, the fundamental mechanism how and if collective strong coupling can induce local changes of individual molecules is still unclear. We derive an analytical formulation of static polarizabilities within linear response theory for molecules under strong coupling using the cavity Born-Oppenheimer Hartree-Fock ansatz. This ab-initio method consistently describes vibrational strong coupling and electron-photon interactions even for ensembles of molecules. For different types of molecular ensemble, we observed local changes in the polarizabilities and dipole moments that are induced by collective strong coupling. Furthermore, we used the polarizabilities to calculate vibro-polaritonic Raman spectra in the harmonic approximation. This allows us to comprehensively compare the effect of vibrational strong coupling on IR and Raman spectra on an equal footing.</description>

      <title>Full Microscopic Simulations Uncover Persistent Quantum Effects in Primary Photosynthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The presence of quantum effects in photosynthetic excitation energy transfer has been intensely debated over the past decade. Nonlinear spectroscopy cannot unambiguously distinguish coherent electronic dynamics from underdamped vibrational motion, and rigorous numerical simulations of realistic microscopic models have been intractable. Experimental studies supported by approximate numerical treatments that severely coarse-grain the vibrational environment have claimed the absence of long-lived quantum effects. Here, we report the first non-perturbative, accurate microscopic model simulations of the Fenna-Matthews-Olson photosynthetic complex and demonstrate the presence of long-lived excitonic coherences at 77 K and room temperature, which persist on picosecond time scales, similar to those of excitation energy transfer. Furthermore, we show that full microscopic simulations of nonlinear optical spectra are essential for identifying experimental evidence of quantum effects in photosynthesis, as approximate theoretical methods can misinterpret experimental data and potentially overlook quantum phenomena.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Electronic and Optical Properties of $\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$ by Introducing B, Y, and Nb Dopants for Improved Photoelectrochemical Water Splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advanced theoretical investigations are crucial for understanding the structural growth mechanisms, optoelectronic properties, and photocatalytic activity of photoelectrodes for efficient photoelectrochemical water splitting. In this work, we conducted first-principles calculations aimed at designing $\alpha$-Fe2O3 photoelectrodes incorporating mono-dopants such as boron (B), yttrium (Y), and niobium (Nb), as well as co-dopants (B, Y) and (B, Nb) to enhance the performance of photoelectrochemical cells. We assessed the thermodynamic phase stability by calculating formation enthalpy ($E_f$) and examining material properties, including microstrain ($\mu_\epsilon$) and crystallite size ($D$). The mono-dopants, Y and Nb, and the co-dopants, (B, Y) and (B, Nb), exhibited negative $E_f$ values under the substitutional doping method, confirming their thermodynamic phase stability and suggesting their practical viability for experimental implementation. Notably, the values of $\mu_\epsilon$ and $D$ fell within the ranges observed experimentally for $\alpha$-Fe2O3, indicating their effectiveness in growth mechanisms. To gain a comprehensive understanding of the optoelectronic properties of doped $\alpha$-Fe2O3, we calculated the electronic band structure, density of states, atom's ionic charge, and optical absorption coefficient. This analysis allowed us to examine the improvements in the electronic charge characteristics and photon-electron interactions. B-doped $\alpha$-Fe2O3 led to the formation of impurity bands, which were mitigated by utilizing co-dopants (B, Y) and (B, Nb). The metal dopants, Y and Nb, significantly increased the charge carrier density, while the co-dopants, (B, Y) and (B, Nb), substantially enhanced light absorption in the visible spectrum.</description>

      <title>Spin-free orbital entropy, mutual information, and correlation analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04800v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Orbital entropies, pair entropies, and mutual information have become popular tools for analysis of strongly correlated wave functions. They can quantitatively measure how strongly an orbital (e.g. from the DMRG active space) participates in the strong correlation and reveal the entanglement pattern between different orbitals. However, this pattern can become rather complicated and sometimes difficult to interpret for large active spaces and is not invariant with respect to the spin projection ($M_s$) component of the spin multiplet state. We introduce a modified spin-free orbital entropy, pair entropy, and mutual information, which simplify the entanglement analysis and are invariant with respect to $M_s$. By comparison of these quantities with their ``original'' spin-including counterparts one can distinguish static correlation due to spin couplings from the ``genuine'' strong correlation due to a multiconfigurational character of the wave function. We illustrate the approach on a model consisting of a non-interacting dimer of triplet diradicals and on a more realistic example of iron-sulfur bound complexes with one and two iron atoms.</description>

      <title>First-Principles Understanding of Vibrational Energy Transfer in Molecule-Surface Scattering: Both Adiabatic and Nonadiabatic Channels Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12754v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Energy transfer during molecular collisions on metal surfaces plays a pivotal role in a host of critical interfacial processes. Despite significant efforts, our understanding of relevant energy transfer mechanisms, even in an extensively-studied benchmark like NO scattering from Au(111), remains far from complete. To fully disentangle different energy transfer channels, we develop a first-principles nonadiabatic dynamical model that incorporates explicitly all degrees of freedom and the interfacial electron transfer. Our simulations reproduce, for the first time, most experimental observations on vibrational relaxation and excitation of NO molecules under varying initial conditions and clearly elaborate the respective adiabatic and nonadiabatic contributions. This model identifies the direct adiabatic vibration-to-translation coupling as the dominant role of translation, while excluding significant translation-to-electron nonadiabatic coupling. Furthermore, the observed steric effect varying with the initial vibrational state is understood by the change of orientational dependence of the metal-to-molecule electron transfer. These new insights highlight the importance of treating both adiabatic and nonadiabatic energy transfer pathways on an equal footing, offering significant implications for modeling energy transfer processes in more complex systems, such as plasmonic photocatalysis.</description>

      <title>Reflection of Phase Anisotropy on Molecule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06409v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study explores how molecular shape changes influence the phase behavior of liquid crystals, particularly the nematic (N) phase of 5CB, through all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The results demonstrate that molecular shape anisotropy increases in the N phase, with molecules adopting more elongated conformations as aggregation occurs. We find that the shape distribution is temperature- and aggregation-dependent, and the molecular shape relaxation time is longer in the N phase compared to isolated molecules. Additionally, the study proposes a revision to Onsager and Maier-Saupe theories, considering molecular shape distribution changes, which could improve the explanation of the N-I phase transition in liquid crystals. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the molecular behavior in liquid crystalline phases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07873v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study explores the mechanisms behind the helical structures in cholesteric liquid crystalline (CLC) phases using molecular dynamics simulations. By adding chiral agents to the nematic liquid crystalline (NLC) compound, 5CB, the research examines how the shape and motion chirality of the agents influence the overall twisting behavior. The results show that chiral agents induce shape chirality in the 5CB molecules, but dynamic chirality is not detectable at this stage. The study suggests that equilibrium is required for motion chirality to become evident, highlighting the need for further investigation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14878v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Designing optimal formulations is a major challenge in developing electrolytes for the next generation of rechargeable batteries due to the vast combinatorial design space and complex interplay between multiple constituents. Machine learning (ML) offers a powerful tool to uncover underlying chemical design rules and accelerate the process of formulation discovery. In this work, we present an approach to design new formulations that can achieve target performance, using a generalizable chemical foundation model. The chemical foundation model is fine-tuned on an experimental dataset of 13,666 ionic conductivity values curated from the lithium-ion battery literature. The fine-tuned model is used to discover 7 novel high conductivity electrolyte formulations through generative screening, improving the conductivity of LiFSI and LiDFOB based electrolytes by 82% and 172%, respectively. These findings highlight a generalizable workflow that is highly adaptable to the discovery of chemical mixtures with tailored properties to address challenges in energy storage and beyond.</description>
