      <title>Modeling energy collection with shortest paths in rectangular grids: an efficient algorithm for energy harvesting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parabolic Trough solar fields are among the most prominent methods for harnessing solar energy. However, continuous sun-tracking movements leads to wear and degradation of the tracking system, raising the question of whether the rotations can be minimized without compromising energy capture. In this paper, we address this question by exploring two problems: (1) minimizing the number of SCA rotational movements while maintaining energy production within a specified range, and (2) maximizing energy capture when the number of rotations is limited. Unlike prior work, we develop a general framework that considers variable conditions. By transforming the problem into grid-based path optimization, we design polynomial-time algorithms that can operate independently of the weather throughout the day. Through realistic simulations and experiments using real-world data, our methods show that rotational movements of solar trackers can be reduced by at least 10% while maintaining over 95% energy collection efficiency. These results offer a scalable solution for improving the operational lifespan of the solar field. Furthermore, our methods can be integrated with solar irradiance forecasting, enhancing their robustness and suitability for real-world deployment.</description>

      <title>Homomorphism Indistinguishability and Game Comonads for Restricted Conjunction and Requantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The notion of homomorphism indistinguishability offers a combinatorial framework for characterizing equivalence relations of graphs, in particular equivalences in counting logics within finite model theory. That is, for certain graph classes, two structures agree on all homomorphism counts from the class if and only if they satisfy the same sentences in a corresponding logic. This perspective often reveals connections between the combinatorial properties of graph classes and the syntactic structure of logical fragments. In this work, we extend this perspective to logics with restricted requantification, refining the stratification of logical resources in finite-variable counting logics. Specifically, we generalize Lov\'asz-type theorems for these logics with either restricted conjunction or bounded quantifier-rank and present new combinatorial proofs of existing results. To this end, we introduce novel path and tree decompositions that incorporate the concept of reusability and develop characterizations based on pursuit-evasion games. Leveraging this framework, we establish that classes of bounded pathwidth and treewidth with reusability constraints are homomorphism distinguishing closed. Finally, we develop a comonadic perspective on requantification by constructing new comonads that encapsulate restricted-reusability pebble games. We show a tight correspondence between their coalgebras and path/tree decompositions, yielding categorical characterizations of reusability in graph decompositions. This unifies logical, combinatorial, and categorical perspectives on the notion of reusability.</description>

      <title>Finding the Cores of Higher Graphs Using Geometric and Topological Means: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this survey, we explore recent literature on finding the cores of higher graphs using geometric and topological means. We study graphs, hypergraphs, and simplicial complexes, all of which are models of higher graphs. We study the notion of a core, which is a minimalist representation of a higher graph that retains its geometric or topological information. We focus on geometric and topological methods based on discrete curvatures, effective resistance, and persistent homology. We aim to connect tools from graph theory, discrete geometry, and computational topology to inspire new research on the simplification of higher graphs.</description>

      <title>Maximal Counts in the Stopped Occupancy Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit a version of the classic occupancy scheme, where balls are thrown until almost all boxes receive a given number of balls. Special cases are widely known as coupon-collectors and dixie cup problems. We show that as the number of boxes tends to infinity, the distribution of the maximal occupancy count does not converge, but can be approximated by a convolution of two Gumbel distributions, with the approximating distribution having oscillations close to periodic on a logarithmic scale. We pursue two approaches: one relies on lattice point processes obtained by poissonisation of the number of balls and boxes, and the other employs interpolation of the multiset of occupancy counts to a point process on reals. This way we gain considerable insight in known asymptotics obtained previously by mostly analytic tools. Further results concern the moments of maximal occupancy counts and ties for the maximum.</description>

      <title>Local Search Improvements for Soft Happy Colouring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19284v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For $0\leq \rho\leq 1$ and a coloured graph $G$, a vertex $v$ is $\rho$-happy if at least $\rho \mathrm{deg}(v)$ of its neighbours have the same colour as $v$. Soft happy colouring of a partially coloured graph $G$ is the problem of finding a vertex colouring $\sigma$ that preserves the precolouring and has the maximum number of $\rho$-happy vertices. It is already known that this problem is NP-hard and directly relates to the community structure of the graphs; under a certain condition on the proportion of happiness $\rho$ and for graphs with community structures, the induced colouring by communities can make all the vertices $\rho$-happy. We show that when $0\leq \rho_1&lt;\rho_2\leq 1$, a complete $\rho_2$-happy colouring has a higher accuracy of community detection than a complete $\rho_1$-happy colouring. Moreover, when $\rho$ is greater than a threshold, it is unlikely for an algorithm to find a complete $\rho$-happy colouring with colour classes of almost equal sizes. Three local search algorithms for soft happy colouring are proposed, and their performances are compared with one another and other known algorithms. Among them, the linear-time local search is shown to be not only very fast, but also a reliable algorithm that can dramatically improve the number of $\rho$-happy vertices.</description>

      <title>Optimal Inapproximability of Promise Equations over Finite Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01630v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A celebrated result of Hastad established that, for any constant $\varepsilon&gt;0$, it is NP-hard to find an assignment satisfying a $(1/|G|+\varepsilon)$-fraction of the constraints of a given 3-LIN instance over an Abelian group $G$ even if one is promised that an assignment satisfying a $(1-\varepsilon)$-fraction of the constraints exists. Engebretsen, Holmerin, and Russell showed the same result for 3-LIN instances over any finite (not necessarily Abelian) group. In other words, for almost-satisfiable instances of 3-LIN the random assignment achieves an optimal approximation guarantee. We prove that the random assignment algorithm is still best possible under a stronger promise that the 3-LIN instance is almost satisfiable over an arbitrarily more restrictive group.</description>
