      <title>Statistical physics of complex systems: glasses, spin glasses, continuous constraint satisfaction problems, high-dimensional inference and neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this manuscript is to review my recent activity on three main research topics. The first concerns the nature of low temperature amorphous solids and their relation with the spin glass transition in a magnetic field. This is the subject of the first chapter where I discuss a new model, the KHGPS model, which allows to make some progress. In the second chapter I review a second research line that concerns the study of the rigidity/jamming transitions in particle system models and their relation to constraint satisfaction and optimization problems in high dimension. Finally in the last chapter I review my activity on the problem of the dynamics of learning algorithms in high-dimensional inference and supervised learning problems.</description>

      <title>Wilsonian Renormalization of Neural Network Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Separating relevant and irrelevant information is key to any modeling process or scientific inquiry. Theoretical physics offers a powerful tool for achieving this in the form of the renormalization group (RG). Here we demonstrate a practical approach to performing Wilsonian RG in the context of Gaussian Process (GP) Regression. We systematically integrate out the unlearnable modes of the GP kernel, thereby obtaining an RG flow of the Gaussian Process in which the data plays the role of the energy scale. In simple cases, this results in a universal flow of the ridge parameter, which becomes input-dependent in the richer scenario in which non-Gaussianities are included. In addition to being analytically tractable, this approach goes beyond structural analogies between RG and neural networks by providing a natural connection between RG flow and learnable vs. unlearnable modes. Studying such flows may improve our understanding of feature learning in deep neural networks, and identify potential universality classes in these models.</description>

      <title>Experimental identification of topological defects in 2D colloidal glass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological defects are singularities in the order parameter space that are mathematically described by topological invariants and cannot be removed by continuous transformations. These defects play a significant role in various fields, ranging from cosmology to solid-state physics and biological matter. The definition of these irregularities requires an ordered reference configuration, leading to decades of debate about the existence of topological defects in disordered systems, such as glasses. Recently, it has been proposed that well-defined topological defects might emerge in the dynamical properties of glasses under deformation, potentially relating to their plastic behavior. In this study, we investigate a two-dimensional colloidal glass system composed of particles interacting by an effective magnetic repulsion. We reveal the presence of topological defects in the eigenspace of the vibrational frequencies of this experimental 2D amorphous solid. The vibrational density of states of this 2D amorphous material exhibits distinct glassy properties such as the presence of a boson peak anomaly. Through extensive numerical and theoretical quantitative analysis, we establish a robust positive correlation between the vibrational characteristics and the total number of topological defects. We furthermore show that defects of opposite charge tend to pair together and prove their local statistical correlation with the "soft spots", the regions more prone to plastic flow. This work provides the experimental confirmation for the existence of topological defects in disordered systems revealing a complex interplay between topology, disorder, and vibrational behavior.</description>

      <title>Parsing skin effect in a non-Hermitian spinless BHZ-like model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.12723v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work comprehensively investigates the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) in a spinless Bernevig- Hughes-Zhang (BHZ)-like model in one dimension. It is generally believed that a system with non-reciprocal hopping amplitudes demonstrates NHSE. However, we show that there are exceptions, and more in-depth analyses are required to decode the presence of NHSE or its variants in a system. The fascinating aspects of our findings, depending on the inclusion of non-reciprocity in the inter-orbital hopping terms, concede the existence of conventional NHSE or NHSE at both edges and even a surprising absence of NHSE. The topological properties and the (bi-orthogonal) bulk-boundary correspondence, enumerated via computation of the (complex) Berry phase and spatial localization of the edge modes, highlight the topological phase transitions occurring therein. Further, to facilitate a structured discussion of the non-Hermitian model, we split the results into PT symmetric and non-PT symmetric cases with a view to comparing the two.</description>

      <title>Mechanical intelligence via fully reconfigurable elastic neuromorphic metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.04002v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ability of mechanical systems to perform basic computations has gained traction over recent years, providing an unconventional alternative to digital computing in off grid, low power, and severe environments which render the majority of electronic components inoperable. However, much of the work in mechanical computing has focused on logic operations via quasi-static prescribed displacements in origami, bistable, and soft deformable matter. In here, we present a first attempt to describe the fundamental framework of an elastic neuromorphic metasurface that performs distinct classification tasks, providing a new set of challenges given the complex nature of elastic waves with respect to scattering and manipulation. Multiple layers of reconfigurable waveguides are phase-trained via constant weights and trainable activation functions in a manner that enables the resultant wave scattering at the readout location to focus on the correct class within the detection plane. We further demonstrate the neuromorphic system's reconfigurability in performing two distinct tasks, eliminating the need for costly remanufacturing.</description>
