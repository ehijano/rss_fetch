      <title>Recurrent nonlinear modulational instability via down-conversion in quadratic media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the induced modulation instability in second-harmonic generation beyond the early stage of the linearized growth of the modulation. We find a regime of recurrence (quasi-periodic conversion and back-conversion between the pump and the modulation) which is genuine of the parametric conversion process in quadratic media. Such recurrence is mainly driven by a process of non-degenerate downconversion, showing no analogy to the cascading regime which mimics the cubic (Kerr) nonlinearities. We consider two different steady states, i.e., a pure second-harmonic and a mixed fundamental/second-harmonic state. Both exhibit this dynamics, which we show to be amenable to a description in terms of reduced frequency-truncated models. The comparison with full numerical simulations of the starting model prove the validity and robustness of the reduced models in characterizing in a simple and elegant way a wide range of modulationally-unstable steady states.</description>

      <title>The bulk modulus of three-dimensional quantum droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum droplets (QDs), formed by ultra-dilute quantum fluids under the action of Lee-Huang-Yang (LHY) effect, provide a unique platform for investigating a wide range of macroscopic quantum effects. Recent studies of QDs' breathing modes and collisional dynamics have revealed their compressibility and extensibility, which suggests that their elasticity parameters can be identified. In this work, we derive the elastic bulk modulus (BM) of QDs by means of the theoretical analysis and numerical simulations, and establish a relation between the BM and the eigenfrequency of QD's intrinsic vibrations. The analysis reveals the dependence of the QD's elasticity on the particle number and the strength of interparticle interactions. We conclude that the BM of QDs can be less than $1~\mathrm{\mu Pa}$, implying that QDs are ultra-soft quantum elastic media. These findings suggest new perspectives for realizing elastic media governed by the LHY effect.</description>

      <title>Polarization-controlled pattern formation in antiparallel dipolar binary condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate non-equilibrium pattern formation in an antiparallel two-component dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate by varying the polarization angle and the trap aspect ratio. At finite tilt, the condensate supports stripe order. Quenching the angle to zero triggers a roton-assisted, mushroom-like corrugation that destroys translational order and drives the system into labyrinthine textures, whereas a slow linear ramp produces long-lived curved stripes that ultimately converge to labyrinths. Population imbalance strongly biases the evolution: the minority component preferentially fragments into a stable droplet array while the majority remains comparatively diffuse; once formed, the droplet crystal is robust under polarization hysteresis with largely reversible shape changes and unchanged lattice topology. The trap aspect ratio controls both the initial stripe number and the instability timescale, with tighter axial confinement accelerating corrugation and yielding denser labyrinths at late times. All behaviors arise within a quasi-two-dimensional mean-field regime where beyond-mean-field corrections are negligible; accordingly, the droplets reported here are not self-bound in free space. The observed textures (such as stripes, curved stripes, and labyrinths) mirror the taxonomy and instability pathways of nuclear "pasta" morphologies (rods and slabs) known from neutron-star and supernova matter, highlighting polarization angle, trap geometry, and population imbalance as practical, experimentally accessible controls for selecting and steering patterns in dipolar mixtures.</description>

      <title>Topologically Quantized Soliton-Like Pumping using Synthetic Nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interplay between nonlinear and topological physics has led to intriguing emergent phenomena, such as quantized and fractionally quantized Thouless pumping of solitons dictated by the topological invariants of the underlying band structure. Unlike linear Thouless pumping, which requires excitation of a Wannier function of a uniformly filled band, quantized soliton pumping is observed even with localized excitations that do not represent Wannier functions. Here, we show that similar soliton-like quantized pumping can be observed in Aubry-Andre-Harper (AAH) model by introducing a synthetic nonlinearity in the form of a cutoff on the coupling strengths between lattice sites. More importantly, we reveal that the localized excitations driving quantized soliton pumping are precisely the Wannier functions of the uniformly filled bands of the effectively nonlinear lattice, thus restoring consistency with linear Thouless pumping. We extend this approach to multi-band systems and show that the nonlinearity introduces a degeneracy between bands, subsequently leading to the observation of fractionally quantized pumping. Our approach of introducing a synthetic nonlinearity is general and could be extended to reveal soliton dynamics in other nonlinear topological systems.</description>
