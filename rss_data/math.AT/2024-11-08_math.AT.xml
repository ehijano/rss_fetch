      <title>A Categorical Approach to M\"obius Inversion via Derived Functors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a cohomological approach to M\"obius inversion using derived functors in the enriched categorical setting. For a poset $P$ and a closed symmetric monoidal abelian category $\mathcal{C}$, we define M\"obius cohomology as the derived functors of an enriched hom functor on the category of $P$-modules. We prove that the Euler characteristic of our cohomology theory recovers the classical M\"obius inversion, providing a natural categorification. As a key application, we prove a categorical version of Rota's Galois Connection. Our approach unifies classical ideas from combinatorics with homological algebra.</description>

      <title>A notion of homotopy for directed graphs and their flag complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Directed graphs can be studied by their associated directed flag complex. The homology of this complex has been successful in applications as a topological invariant for digraphs. Through comparison with path homology theory, we derive a homotopy-like equivalence relation on digraph maps such that equivalent maps induce identical maps on the homology of the directed flag complex. Thus, we obtain an equivalence relation on digraphs such that equivalent digraphs have directed flag complexes with isomorphic homology. With the help of these relations, we can prove a generic stability theorem for the persistent homology of the directed flag complex of filtered digraphs. In particular, we show that the persistent homology of the directed flag complex of the shortest-path filtration of a weighted directed acyclic graph is stable to edge subdivision. In contrast, we also discuss some important instabilities that are not present in persistent path homology. We also derive similar equivalence relations for ordered simplicial complexes at large. Since such complexes can alternatively be viewed as simplicial sets, we verify that these two perspectives yield identical relations.</description>

      <title>Trace methods for stable categories I: The linear approximation of algebraic K-theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study algebraic K-theory and topological Hochschild homology in the setting of bimodules over a stable category, a datum we refer to as a laced category. We show that in this setting both K-theory and THH carry universal properties, the former defined in terms of additivity and the latter via trace invariance. We then use these universal properties in order to construct a trace map from laced K-theory to THH, and show that it exhibits THH as the first Goodwillie derivative of laced K-theory in the bimodule direction, generalizing the celebrated identification of stable K-theory by Dundas-McCarthy, a result which is the entryway to trace methods.</description>

      <title>Configuration spaces of circles in the plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the space of all configurations of finitely many (potentially nested) circles in the plane. We prove that this space is aspherical, and compute the fundamental group of each of its connected components. It turns out these fundamental groups are obtained as iterated semdirect products of braid groups, with the structure for each component dictated by a finite rooted tree. These groups can be viewed as "braided" versions of the automorphism groups of such trees. We also discuss connections to statistical mechanics, topological data analysis, and geometric group theory.</description>

      <title>Manifold Diagrams for Higher Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a graphical calculus of manifold diagrams which generalises string and surface diagrams to arbitrary dimensions. Manifold diagrams are pasting diagrams for $(\infty, n)$-categories that admit a semi-strict composition operation for which associativity and unitality is strict. The weak interchange law satisfied by composition of manifold diagrams is determined geometrically through isotopies of diagrams. By building upon framed combinatorial topology, we can classify critical points in isotopies at which the arrangement of cells changes. This allows us to represent manifold diagrams combinatorially and use them as shapes with which to probe $(\infty, n)$-categories, presented as $n$-fold Segal spaces. Moreover, for any system of labels for the singularities in a manifold diagram, we show how to generate a free $(\infty, n)$-category.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish Morse inequalities for a noncompact manifold with a cocompact and properly discontinuous action of a discrete group, where Morse functions are not necessarily invariant under the group action. The inequalities are given in terms of the $L^2$-Betti numbers and functions on the acting group which describe rough configurations of critical points of a Morse function.</description>

      <title>Crossed modules and cohomology of algebras over an operad</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a general definition of a $n$-crossed module of $P$-algebras over an algebraic operad $P$, which coincides with historical definitions in the cases of the operads As and Lie and $n = 1$. We establish a natural isomorphism between the abelian group of equivalence classes of $n$-crossed modules over a pair $(A,M)$ for an operad $P$ and the $(n+1)^\text{th}$ operadic cohomology group of $A$ with coefficients in $M$.</description>

      <title>The equifibered approach to $\infty$-properads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.02576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.02576v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define a notion of $\infty$-properads that generalises $\infty$-operads by allowing operations with multiple outputs. Specializing to the case where each operation has a single output provides a simple new perspective on $\infty$-operads, but at the same time the extra generality allows for examples such as bordism categories. We also give an interpretation of our $\infty$-properads as Segal presheaves on a category of graphs by comparing them to the Segal $\infty$-properads of Hackney-Robertson-Yau. Combining these two approaches yields a flexible tool for doing higher algebra with operations that have multiple inputs and outputs. Crucially, this allows for a definition of algebras over an $\infty$-properad such that, for example, topological field theories are algebras over the bordism $\infty$-properad. The key ingredient to this paper is the notion of an equifibered map between $E_\infty$-monoids, which is a well-behaved generalisation of free maps. We also use this to prove facts about free $E_\infty$-monoids, for example that free $E_\infty$-monoids are closed under pullbacks along arbitrary maps.</description>

      <title>Dyer-Lashof operations as extensions of Brown-Gitler Modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.14158v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: At the prime 2, let T(n) be the n dual of the nth Brown-Gitler spectrum with mod 2 homology G(n). Our previous work on computing the homology of an infinite loopspaces led us to observe that there are extensions between various of the right A-modules G(n) such that splicing with these gives an action of the Dyer-Lashof algebra on the sum over s and n of Ext_A^{s,s}(G(n),M).
  We give explicit constructions of these `Dyer-Lashof operation' extensions: one construction relates them to the cofiber sequence associated to the C_2-transfer. Another relates key `squaring' Dyer-Lashof operations to the Mahowald short exact sequences. Finally, properties of the spectra T(n) allow us to geometrically realize our extensions by cofibration sequences, with the implication that the sum over n of all the Adams spectral sequences computing [T(n),X] is a spectral sequence of modules over the Dyer-Lashof algebra.</description>

      <title>The unstable homotopy groups of 2-cell complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20416v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop the new method, initiated by B. Gray (1972), to compute the unstable homotopy groups of the mapping cone, especially for $2$-cell complex $X=S^m\cup_{\alpha} e^{n}$. By Gray's work mentioned above or the traditional method given by I.M.James (1957) which were widely used in previous related work to compute $\pi_{i}(X)$, the dimension $i\leq 2n+m-4$. By our method, we can compute $\pi_{i}(X)$ for $i&gt;2n+m-4$. We use this different technique to generalize J.Wu's work, at Mem. of AMS, on homotopy groups of mod $2$ Moore spaces to higher dimensional homotopy groups of mod $2^r$ Moore spaces $P^{n}(2^r)$ for all $r\geq 1$. This practice shows that the technique given here is a new general method to compute the unstable homotopy groups of CW complexes with higher dimension.</description>

      <title>The fundamental group and the magnitude-path spectral sequence of a directed graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02838v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The fundamental group of a directed graph admits a natural sequence of quotient groups called $r$-fundamental groups, and the $r$-fundamental groups can capture properties of a directed graph that the fundamental group cannot capture. The fundamental group of a directed graph is related to path homology through the Hurewicz theorem. The magnitude-path spectral sequence connects magnitude homology and path homology of a directed graph, and it may be thought of as a sequence of homology of a directed graph, including path homology. In this paper, we study relations of the $r$-fundamental groups and the magnitude-path spectral sequence through the Hurewicz theorem and the Seifert-van Kampen theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19481v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the $RO(G)$-graded equivariant algebraic $K$-groups of a finite field with an action by its Galois group $G$. Specifically, we show these $K$-groups split as the sum of an explicitly computable term and the well-studied $RO(G)$-graded coefficient groups of the equivariant Eilenberg--MacLane spectrum $H\underline{\mathbb Z}$. Our comparison between the equivariant $K$-theory spectrum and $H\underline{\mathbb Z}$ further shows they share the same Tate spectra and geometric fixed point spectra. In the case where $G$ has prime order, we provide an explicit presentation of the equivariant $K$-groups.</description>

      <title>Topological obstruction to the training of shallow ReLU neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14837v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Studying the interplay between the geometry of the loss landscape and the optimization trajectories of simple neural networks is a fundamental step for understanding their behavior in more complex settings. This paper reveals the presence of topological obstruction in the loss landscape of shallow ReLU neural networks trained using gradient flow. We discuss how the homogeneous nature of the ReLU activation function constrains the training trajectories to lie on a product of quadric hypersurfaces whose shape depends on the particular initialization of the network's parameters. When the neural network's output is a single scalar, we prove that these quadrics can have multiple connected components, limiting the set of reachable parameters during training. We analytically compute the number of these components and discuss the possibility of mapping one to the other through neuron rescaling and permutation. In this simple setting, we find that the non-connectedness results in a topological obstruction, which, depending on the initialization, can make the global optimum unreachable. We validate this result with numerical experiments.</description>
