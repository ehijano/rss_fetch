      <title>The Solvay Councils, de Broglie's brothers, and the development of wave-particle duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The meeting patronized by Ernest Solvay in 1911, the first Solvay Council, marked the beginning of what can be called the first quantum revolution. Maurice de Broglie was one of the secretaries of the Council. He participated in the two following conferences and contributed to the third Council with his work. Louis de Broglie collaborated and discussed with his elder brother. Departing from Maurice's achievements, Louis developed his approach to the wave-particle duality of light and extended it to other particles. He presented it at the fifth meeting in 1927. This paper investigates the connection between the two scientists and the Solvay Councils, arguing that this link was essential in developing the first quantum revolution, a process that ended, according to Werner Heisenberg, at the fifth Solvay Physics Council.</description>

      <title>On the detectability of paraparticles beyond bosons and fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper I present the state of the art concerning the theoretical detectability (and the open challenges for the experimental detectability) of a special class of paraparticles beyond bosons and fermions. The particles under considerations obey a parastatistics and (unlike anyons which transform under the braid group) are mutually exchanged via the permutation group.</description>

      <title>Is there any Trinity of Gravity, to start with?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14089v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, it has been rather fashionable to talk about geometric trinity of gravity. The main idea is that one can formally present the gravity equations in different terms, those of either torsion or nonmetricity instead of curvature. It starts from a very erroneous claim that the Levi-Civita connection, and therefore the (pseudo-)Riemannian geometry itself, are nothing but an arbitrary choice. The point is that, as long as we admit the need of having a metric for describing gravity, the standard approach does not involve any additional independent geometric structures on top of that. At the same time, any other metric-affine model does go for genuinely new stuff. In particular, the celebrated teleparallel framework introduces a notion of yet another parallel transport which is flat. It gives us curious new ways of modifying gravity, even though very often quite problematic. However, in GR-equivalent models, we only get a new language for describing the same physics, in terms of absolutely unobservable and unpredictable geometrical inventions. For sure, one can always safely create novel constructions which do not influence the physical equations of motion, but in itself it does not make much sense and blatantly goes against the Occam's razor.</description>
