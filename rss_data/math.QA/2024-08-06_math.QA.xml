      <title>Lattice paths and quiver generating series with higher level generators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generalized knots-quivers correspondence extends the original knots-quivers correspondence, by allowing higher level generators of quiver generating series. In this paper we explore the underlined combinatorics of such generating series, relationship with the BPS numbers of a corresponding knot, and new combinatorial interpretations of the coefficients of generating series.</description>

      <title>Doubly alternating words in the positive part of $U_q(\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}}_2)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is about the positive part $U_q^+$ of the $q$-deformed enveloping algebra $U_q(\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}}_2)$. The algebra $U_q^+$ admits an embedding, due to Rosso, into a $q$-shuffle algebra $\mathbb{V}$. The underlying vector space of $\mathbb{V}$ is the free algebra on two generators $x,y$. Therefore, the algebra $\mathbb{V}$ has a basis consisting of the words in $x,y$. Let $U$ denote the image of $U_q^+$ under the Rosso embedding. In our first main result, we find all the words in $x,y$ that are contained in $U$. One type of solution is called alternating. The alternating words have been studied by Terwilliger. There is another type of solution, which we call doubly alternating. In our second main result, we display many commutator relations involving the doubly alternating words. In our third main result, we describe how the doubly alternating words are related to the alternating words.</description>

      <title>The Cyclic and Modular Microcosm Principle in Quantum Topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monoidal categories with additional structure such as a braiding or some form of duality abound in quantum topology. They often appear in tandem with Frobenius algebras inside them. Motivations for this range from the theory of module categories to the construction of correlators in conformal field theory. We generalize the Baez-Dolan microcosm principle to consistently describe all these types of algebras by extending it to cyclic and modular algebras in the sense of Getzler-Kapranov. Our main result links the microcosm principle for cyclic algebras to the one for modular algebras via Costello's modular envelope. The result can be understood as a local-to-global construction for various flavors of Frobenius algebras that substantially generalizes and unifies the available, and often intrinsically semisimple methods using for example triangulations, state-sum constructions or skein theory. Several applications of the main result in conformal field theory are presented: We classify consistent systems of correlators for open conformal field theories and show that the genus zero correlators for logarithmic conformal field theories constructed by Fuchs-Schweigert can be uniquely extended to handlebodies. This establishes a very general correspondence between full genus zero conformal field theory in dimension two and skein theory in dimension three.</description>

      <title>Fusion and specialization for type ADE shuffle algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Root vectors in quantum groups (of finite type) generalize to fused currents in quantum loop groups ([5]). In the present paper, we construct fused currents as duals to specialization maps of the corresponding shuffle algebras ([7,8,9]) in types ADE. Both root vectors and fused currents depend on a convex order of the positive roots, and the choice we make in the present paper is that of the Auslander-Reiten order ([24]) corresponding to an orientation of the type ADE Dynkin diagram.</description>

      <title>CoHA of Cyclic Quivers and an Integral Form of Affine Yangians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate the deformed and non-deformed cohomological Hall algebra (CoHA) of the preprojective algebra for the case of cyclic quivers by studying the Kontsevich-Soibelman CoHA and using tools from cohomological Donaldson-Thomas theory. We show that for the cyclic quiver of length $K$, this algebra is the universal enveloping algebra of the positive half of a certain extension of matrix differential operators on $\mathbb{C}^{*}$, while its deformation gives a positive half of an explicit integral form of Guay's Affine Yangian $\ddot{\mathcal{Y}}_{\hbar_1,\hbar_2}(\mathfrak{gl}(K))$. By the main theorem of Botta-Davison (2023) and Schiffmann-Vasserot (2023), this also determines the positive half of the Maulik-Okounkov Yangian for the case of cyclic quivers. Furthermore, we provide evidence for the strong rationality conjecture, calculate the spherical subalgebra of the non-deformed CoHA for any quiver without loops, recover results about the CoHA of compactly supported semistable sheaves on the minimal resolution of the Kleinian singularity $\mathbb{C}^2/\mathbb{Z}_{K}$ and identify a commutative algebra inside the additive shuffle algebra associated to the cyclic quiver. We end by conjecturally relating the obtained integral form with the algebra defined by Gaiotto-Rap\v{c}\'ak-Zhou, in the context of twisted M-theory.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional conformal field theory, full vertex algebra and current-current deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.07327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2007.07327v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The main purpose of this paper is a mathematical construction of a non-perturbative deformation of a two-dimensional conformal field theory. We introduce a notion of a full vertex algebra which formulates a compact two-dimensional conformal field theory. Then, we construct a deformation family of a full vertex algebra which serves as a current-current deformation of conformal field theory in physics. The parameter space of the deformation is expressed as a double coset of an orthogonal group, a quotient of an orthogonal Grassmannian. As an application, we consider a deformation of chiral conformal field theories, vertex operator algebras. A current-current deformation of a "vertex operator algebra" may produce new vertex operator algebras. We give a formula for counting the number of the isomorphic classes of vertex operator algebras obtained in this way. We demonstrate it for some holomorphic vertex operator algebra of central charge $24$.</description>

      <title>Vertex operator algebra and parenthesized braid operad</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.10443v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conformal blocks, physical quantities of chiral 2d conformal field theory, are sheaves on the configuration spaces of the complex plane, which are mathematically formulated in terms of a vertex operator algebra, its modules and associated D-modules. We show that the operad of fundamental groupoids of the configuration spaces, the parenthesized braid operad, acts on the conformal blocks by the monodromy representation.
  More precisely, let $V$ be a vertex operator algebra with $V=\bigoplus_{n\geq 0} V_n$, $\dim V_n &lt;\infty$, $V_0=\mathbb{C}\bf{1}$ and $V\text{-mod}_{\mathrm{f.g}}$ the category of $V$-modules $M$ such that $M$ is $C_1$-cofinite and the dual module $M^\vee$ is a finitely generated $V$-module. We show that the parenthesized braid operad weakly 2-categorically acts on $V\text{-mod}_{\mathrm{f.g}}$, and consequently $V\text{-mod}_{\mathrm{f.g}}$ has a structure of the (unital) pseudo-braided category. Moreover, if $V$ is rational and $C_2$-cofinite, then $V\text{-mod}_{\mathrm{f.g}}$ is a balanced braided tensor category, which gives an alternative proof of a result of Huang and Lepowsky.</description>

      <title>Drinfeld Centers and Morita Equivalence Classes of Fusion 2-Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.04917v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the Drinfeld center of a fusion 2-category is invariant under Morita equivalence. We go on to show that the concept of Morita equivalence between connected fusion 2-categories recovers exactly the notion of Witt equivalence between braided fusion 1-categories. A strongly fusion 2-category is a fusion 2-category whose braided fusion 1-category of endomorphisms of the monoidal unit is $\mathbf{Vect}$ or $\mathbf{SVect}$. We prove that every fusion 2-category is Morita equivalent to the 2-Deligne tensor product of a strongly fusion 2-category and an invertible fusion 2-category. We proceed to show that every fusion 2-category is Morita equivalent to a connected fusion 2-category. As a consequence, we find that every rigid algebra in a fusion 2-category is separable. This implies in particular that every fusion 2-category is separable. Conjecturally, separability ensures that a fusion 2-category is 4-dualizable. We define the dimension of a fusion 2-category, and prove that it is always non-zero. Finally, we show that the Drinfeld center of any fusion 2-category is a finite semisimple 2-category.</description>
