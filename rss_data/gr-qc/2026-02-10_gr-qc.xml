      <title>Asymptotic Freedom and Vacuum Polarization Determine the Astrophysical End State of Relativistic Gravitational Collapse: Quark--Gluon Plasma Star Instead of Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A general relativistic model of an astrophysical hypermassive extremely magnetized ultra-compact self-bound quark--gluon plasma object that is supported against its ultimate gravitational implosion by the simultaneous action of the vacuum polarization driven by nonlinear electrodynamics (NLED: light-by-light scattering) and the quantum chromodynamics (QCD) asymptotic freedom, is presented. These QCD stars can be the final figures of the equilibrium of collapsing stellar cores. Post-supernova fallback material pushes the nascent remnant beyond its stability to collapse into a hybrid hypermassive neutron star (HHMNS). Hypercritical accretion can unbind the whole HHMNS's baryons to spontaneously break away color confinement, powering a first-order hadron-to-quark phase transition to a sea of ever-freer quarks and gluons. This core is hydro-stabilized by the steady, endlessly compression-admitting asymptotic freedom state, possibly via gluon-mediated enduring exchange of color charge among bound states. The nonlinear TOV equation indicates the occurrence of hypermassive QGP/QCD stars with a wide mass spectrum ($0\lesssim$ M$^{\rm{QGP}}_{\rm{Star}}\lesssim$\,7\,M$_\odot$ and beyond), for star radii ($0\lesssim R^{\rm{QGP}}_{\rm{Star}}\lesssim 24$\,km and beyond) with B-fields ($10^{14} \leq$ B$^{\rm{QGP}}_{\rm{Star}} \leq 10^{16}$\,G and beyond). Such QCD stars can emulate what the true black holes are supposed to gravitationally do in most astrophysical settings. This color quark star could be found through a search for its eternal ``yo-yo'' state gravitational-wave emission, or via lensing phenomena like gravitational rainbows, as in this scenario it is expected that the light deflection angle, directly influenced by the larger effective mass/radius and magnetic field of the deflecting object, increases as the incidence angle decreases for impact parameter lower values.</description>

      <title>Escape of quantum information across an analogue black hole horizon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The complete evaporation of black holes, as a natural endpoint of Hawking radiation, gives rise to the black hole information paradox, which fundamentally challenges the principles of unitarity and information conservation in quantum mechanics. Although the AdS/CFT correspondence indicates that information is preserved during black hole evaporation, the precise mechanism by which it is recovered from the Hawking radiation remains an open question. To explore a potential resolution, we investigate information transfer in an analog black hole spacetime realized through position-dependent coupling in an XY spin chain. We derive and demonstrate Page curve-like behavior, and analyze the transmission of quantum resources, such as entanglement and coherence, across the effective horizon. Our results show that quantum resources initially localized within an interior subsystem can be transferred to the exterior via particle radiation through the horizon. This study provides a novel perspective from quantum simulation on how information may escape from black holes, thereby contributing to the further understanding of the black hole information paradox.</description>

      <title>Neutron Stars as Perfect Fluids: Extracting the Linearized Response Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the general relativistic linear tidal response of a neutron star modeled as a barotropic perfect fluid. From the covariant fluid effective action, we linearize about equilibrium and obtain the action for fluid displacements coupled to metric perturbations. Splitting the latter into external and induced parts and integrating out the induced field yields a Hermitian operator and a discrete gapped spectrum of driven modes. Projecting the displacement onto this eigenbasis and integrating out the spatial dependence over the stellar radius reduces the dynamics to tidal-driven oscillators, with couplings set by relativistic inner products and overlap integrals. Matching to the quadrupolar worldline effective action gives a mode-sum response function and analytic dynamical tidal deformabilities from mode frequencies, normalizations, and overlaps.</description>

      <title>On the Gravitational Energy of Axial Perturbations in Regular Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The article deals with the gravitational energy associated with axial perturbations of regular black holes. We review the stability of the geometry under odd-parity perturbations and the corresponding quasinormal modes, previously obtained for this class of spacetimes. The perturbative functions describing the metric fluctuations are reconstructed from the master equation. To evaluate the energy content of these perturbations, we employ the Teleparallel Equivalent of General Relativity (TEGR), which provides a well-defined expression for gravitational energy. The gravitational energy is computed up to second order in the perturbation parameter and expressed in terms of the quasinormal mode functions. Our results establish a direct connection between the dynamical response of regular black holes and the energy carried by their gravitational perturbations.</description>

      <title>The effects of boundary conditions on Rindler's spectral anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rindler's metric is an interesting way to incorporate a set of uniformly accelerated observers into space-time coordinates; this is consistent with special and general relativity. It is known that such an acceleration gives rise to the famous Unruh effect. Interestingly, its Galilean limit already shows the appearance of quantized modes for particles in free space, given by Airy functions. This happens when a wall or boundary condition is moving in an accelerated trajectory in free space and in the presence of a field. Here we show that such a boundary, when viewed as a material obstacle in motion, gives rise to quantized modes for the Klein-Gordon and Maxwell fields, as long as the boundary does not touch the singularity at the Rindler wedge. This corresponds to a quantum-mechanical problem with an anomalous fall-to-the-origin potential $-1/x^2$ supplemented with a Dirichlet condition. We provide further mathematical analysis regarding the completeness of the solutions in terms of Hankel functions $H^{(1)}$ of imaginary index and argument, and clarify the nature of the corresponding Sobolev spaces when the boundary condition disappears for the accelerated observer. A detailed interpretation of the transition amplitudes is given in connection with particle production obtained from a Bogoliubov transformation.</description>

      <title>Circularly polarized gravitational waves from parity-violating scalar-tensor theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study both primordial GWs and scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) in a class of the parity-violating scalar-tensor (PVST) theory, of which the Lagrangian is the linear combination of seven ghost-free parity-violating scalar-tensor monomials dubbed the ``Qi-Xiu'' Lagrangians. At linear order, we obtain the quadratic action for tensor perturbations and show that parity-violating terms associated with $\mathcal{L}_{1,2,5,6,7}$ render the tensor propagation polarization dependent, leading to chiral primordial spectra and a nonvanishing degree of circular polarization. At second order, we derive the EOM for SIGWs and identify the explicit parity-violating source terms. In particular, $\mathcal{L}_3$ and $\mathcal{L}_4$ enter exclusively through the source term for SIGWs, allowing parity violation to arise even when the linear GWs propagation remains effectively GR-like. During the radiation-dominated era, we compute the fractional energy density of SIGWs for both monochromatic and lognormal curvature power spectra. We find that, around the peak frequency, SIGWs in PVST gravity exhibit characteristic deviations from those in GR, resulting in a nonzero degree of circular polarization.</description>

      <title>Probing Quantum Gravity effects with Extreme Mass Ratio Inspirals around Rotating Hayward Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) around a rotating Hayward black hole to assess the detectability of signatures arising from quantum gravity.The quantum parameter $\alpha_0$, which encodes deviations from general relativity (GR), introduces extra correction terms in both the orbital frequency and the fluxes. Our results show that after one year of accumulated observation, these corrections induce a detectable dephasing in the EMRI waveform. Using the modified orbital evolution driven by $\alpha_0$, we generate waveforms via the augmented analytic kludge (AAK) model implemented in the \texttt{FastEMRIWaveforms} package. Furthermore, we utilize the time-delay interferometry (TDI) to suppress the laser noise and phase fluctuations induced by spacecraft motion, and then employ the Fisher information matrix (FIM) to test the sensitivity of LISA in detecting deviations from GR. Our results demonstrate the potential of LISA to probe quantum-gravity effects through high-precision observations of EMRIs.</description>

      <title>A gravitationally induced decoherence model for photons in the context of the relational formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate a model of gravitationally induced decoherence for photons starting from Maxwell theory coupled to linearised gravity, expressed in terms of Ashtekar-Barbero variables and treated as an open quantum field theoretic system. In contrast to quantum mechanical models, the interaction between the system (Maxwell field) and the environment (gravitational field) is not postulated phenomenologically, but is instead dictated by the underlying action in a post-Minkowskian approximation. This framework extends earlier models for a scalar field and enables a more detailed analysis of the role of dynamical reference fields (clocks) within the relational formalism. We show that, for a suitable choice of geometrical clocks together with a U(1)-Gauss clock, and by employing an appropriate combination of the observable map and its dual, the resulting Dirac observables are given directly by the transverse components of the photon field as well as the symmetric-transverse-traceless degrees of freedom of gravitational waves on the linearised phase space of the coupled system. In addition we also compare different choices of Dirac observables and their dynamics. Upon applying a Fock quantisation to the reduced system, we derive the time convolutionless (TCL) master equation, truncated at second order, and analyse its structural properties. These results provide a foundation for further investigations of the decoherence model, including its renormalisation and a detailed study of its one-particle sector, and are found to be structurally consistent with former master equations for photons derived using ADM variables and a specific gauge fixing.</description>

      <title>Existence of Halos Outside Schwarzschild-$f(R)$ Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the possibility of photon halos (stable photon orbits) forming outside Schwarzschild-$f(R)$ black holes by analyzing null geodesics in these spacetimes. Using methods inspired by studies of spherical photon orbits around Kerr-Newman black holes, we derive conditions for the existence of such halos. We examine several f(R) gravity models, including quadratic, logarithmic, exponential, cubic, power-law, and hyperbolic forms, and find that multiple photon orbits -- both stable and unstable -- can appear outside the event horizon for certain parameter ranges. These additional orbits (halos) provide new insights into spacetime geometry and potential observational signatures of black holes in modified gravity. We present analytical expressions for the orbital radii, perform a numerical stability analysis, and discuss possible observational implications for black hole shadows. Our results indicate that while the standard Schwarzschild black hole admits only a single unstable light ring, Schwarzschild-$f(R)$ black holes can support an additional outer stable photon orbit (a halo) without triggering a black-hole bomb instability. This work deepens the understanding of photon-orbit structures in alternative theories of gravity and highlights how such effects could be detected through deviations in black hole shadow size or morphology.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Black Hole Image Generation via Latent Space Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interpreting horizon-scale black hole images currently relies on computationally intensive General Relativistic Ray Tracing (GRRT) simulations, which pose a significant bottleneck for rapid parameter exploration and high-precision tests of strong-field gravity. We demonstrate that physically accurate black hole images, synthesized from magnetized accretion flows, inherently reside on a low-dimensional manifold-encoding the essential features of spacetime geometry, plasma distribution, and relativistic emission. Leveraging this structure, we introduce a physics-conditioned diffusion model that operates in a compact latent space to generate high-fidelity black hole imagery directly from physical parameters. The model accurately reproduces critical observational signatures from full GRRT simulations-such as shadow diameter, photon-ring structure, and relativistic brightness asymmetry-while achieving over a fourfold reduction in computational expense. Compared with the previous generation of denoising diffusion models, the proposed approach achieves significant improvements in image quality, reconstruction fidelity, and parameter estimation accuracy, while reducing the average inference time per black hole image from 5.25 seconds to 1.15 seconds. Our work establishes diffusion-based latent models as efficient and scalable substitutes for traditional radiative transfer solvers, offering a practical framework toward real-time modeling and inference for next-generation black hole imaging.</description>

      <title>Geodesic Structure, Thermodynamics and Scalar Perturbations of Mod(A)Max black hole Surrounded by Perfect Fluid Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the optical properties of a spherically symmetric Mod(A)Max black hole surrounded by perfect fluid dark matter, focusing on key features such as the photon sphere radius, shadow, photon trajectories, and the effective radial force experienced by photons. We also study the dynamics of massive particles around the black hole, deriving the effective potential and, from it, the specific energy and angular momentum of particles moving in circular orbits of fixed radii is discussed. The conditions for marginally stable circular orbits are analyzed, highlighting how the geometric parameters that modify the spacetime curvature influence both the optical and dynamical features. Furthermore, we explore the thermodynamic behavior of the black hole by examining its temperature, Gibbs free energy, and heat capacity, as well as its thermodynamic topology. Finally, scalar field perturbations are considered through the massless Klein-Gordon equation, and the quasinormal modes (QNMs) in the eikonal regime are computed, illustrating how the geometric parameters affect the potential and the QNM spectra.</description>

      <title>Signatures of the Israel Junction II: Double Photon Rings in Slowly Rotating Kerr Spacetime with Thin Shell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Applying the junction conditions to the slowly rotating Kerr spacetime with a thin shell, we find that while the angular momentum $L$ and Carter constant $C$ of the ray remain unchanged upon crossing the shell, its energy $E$ does not. Consequently, the impact parameters $\eta=L/E$ and $\xi=C/E^2$ of the ray are discontinued at the shell. Utilizing this transformation, we study the shadow of this spacetime and the corresponding images from an equatorial thin accretion disk. The presence of the shell gives rise to distinctive features in the observed images. Notably, we observe distinct double photon rings in the images, which can gradually merge into a single ring. Moreover, the shadow boundaries and the photon rings do not exhibit a one-to-one correspondence. The abrupt changes in redshift factor and the truncated photon regions profoundly influence the image, producing distinctive features such as the step-like structures. These features in shell-equipped spacetimes can help evaluate, through future astronomical observations, the applicability of the Israel junction condition and the shell model in real astrophysical systems.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Black-hole Emission Tomography with Physics-informed Neural Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the success of static black-hole imaging, the next frontier is the dynamic and 3D imaging of black holes. Recovering the dynamic 3D gas near a black hole would reveal previously-unseen parts of the universe and inform new physics models. However, only sparse radio measurements from a single viewpoint are possible, making the dynamic 3D reconstruction problem significantly ill-posed. Previously, BH-NeRF addressed the ill-posed problem by assuming Keplerian dynamics of the gas, but this assumption breaks down near the black hole, where the strong gravitational pull of the black hole and increased electromagnetic activity complicate fluid dynamics. To overcome the restrictive assumptions of BH-NeRF, we propose PI-DEF, a physics-informed approach that uses differentiable neural rendering to fit a 4D (time + 3D) emissivity field given EHT measurements. Our approach jointly reconstructs the 3D velocity field with the 4D emissivity field and enforces the velocity as a soft constraint on the dynamics of the emissivity. In experiments on simulated data, we find significantly improved reconstruction accuracy over both BH-NeRF and a physics-agnostic approach. We demonstrate how our method may be used to estimate other physics parameters of the black hole, such as its spin.</description>

      <title>Waveform stability of black hole ringdown with stochastic horizon structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the robustness of black hole ringdown to stochastic horizon-scale structure within an effective field framework. Consistent with the understanding that the spectral instability of quasinormal modes does not necessarily imply observational breakdown, our results demonstrate that the macroscopic gravitational waveform remains robust. We identify the phase averaging mechanism as the physical origin of this stability, demonstrating that the spatial integration of the wave equation efficiently attenuates ultraviolet geometric details below the resolution limit of the probing wavelength. Building on the scaling law $\mathcal{M} \propto \epsilon^2$ and the characteristic mismatch profile with respect to $L_c$, we propose a geometric selection rule for observability: a detectable signal imposes a strict dual constraint requiring both macroscopic spatial coherence ($L_c \sim M$) and classical-level intensity ($\epsilon \gtrsim 10^{-4}$). This criterion quantitatively rules out the observability of incoherent, high-entropy quantum foam, suggesting that any significant ringdown deviation would serve as definitive evidence for macroscopically coherent horizon structures.</description>

      <title>Quantum Field Theory of Black Hole Perturbations with Backreaction V. Beyond Second Order Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Black hole perturbation theory beyond second order is not well understood because typically one defines the meaning of gauge invariance order by order which is ambiguous. In this series of works we therefore developed a new approach which disentangles the meaning of gauge invariance from the perturbative order. It is based on the reduced phase space approach to the Hamiltonian formulation of General Relativity and constructs a non-perturbative, albeit implicit, formulation of the dynamics of only observables that are gauge invariant to all orders. To obtain explicit expressions, perturbation theory is then employed, but now only perturbations are considered that are gauge invariant to all orders. There are both spherically symmetric and non-symmetric observables and the formulation takes the (perturbative) backreaction between those fully into account. The formulation has access to both the exterior and interior of the dynamical horizon.
  In previous papers of this series we have introduced the general formalism and performed consistency checks with second order results obtained in other approaches. The real virtue of our approach starts emerging at higher than second order where we expect differences from previous works both due to backreaction effects and because we work with observables that are gauge invariant to all orders, not only up to a given order. In this paper, we consider the third order. Also new to our approach is that we start from a non-perturbative, namely polynomial, version of the constraints which therefore are finite polynomials in all degrees of freedom before reducing, rather than an infinite series. This allows for an exact and non-perturbative, while implicit, solution of the constraints which does not need to truncate the series and thus is of tremendous technical advantage.</description>

      <title>Does fermionic entanglement always outperform bosonic entanglement in dilaton black hole?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has traditionally been believed that fermionic entanglement generally outperforms bosonic entanglement in relativistic frameworks, and that bosonic entanglement experiences sudden death in extreme gravitational environments. In this study, we analyze the genuine N-partite entanglement, measured by negativity, of bosonic and fermionic GHZ states, focusing on scenarios where a subset of $m$ ($m&lt;N$) constituents interacts with Hawking radiation generated by a Garfinkle-Horowitz-Strominger (GHS) dilaton black hole. Surprisingly, we find that quantum entanglement between the non-gravitational and gravitational modes for the bosonic field is stronger than that in the same modes for the fermionic field within dilaton spacetime. This study challenges the traditional belief that ``fermionic entanglement always outperforms bosonic entanglement" in the relativistic framework. However, quantum entanglement between the gravitational modes and the combined gravitational and non-gravitational modes is weaker for the bosonic field than for the fermionic field in the presence of a dilaton black hole. Finally, the connection between the global N-partite entanglement in the bosonic field and that in the fermionic field is influenced by the gravitational field's intensity. Our study reveals the intrinsic relationship between quantum entanglement of bosonic and fermionic fields in curved spacetime from a new perspective, and provides theoretical guidance for selecting appropriate field-based quantum resources for relativistic quantum information tasks under extreme gravitational conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.08341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Loop quantum gravity is a perspective candidate for the quantum theory of gravity. However, there is a conceptual controversy in it: having started from the Einstein-Hilbert action and describing spacetime without matter, we can hardly define spacetime as anything other than a set of relations between matter fields. Here, following the Penrose idea of combinatorial spacetime we reformulate loop quantum gravity theory solely in terms of the matter fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.08487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the embedding of regular black holes in an expanding universe and study how the ultraviolet modifications to the Schwarzschild geometry that regularize the black hole singularity affect the exterior universe's expansion rate. We consider several proposals for the regular black hole geometry and obtain the corresponding Friedmann equations for a universe filled only with dust and black holes. We show that different proposals have different implications which may be distinguished. We then test the hypothesis that the UV corrections to the black hole geometry may be responsible for the current phase of accelerated expansion. To this aim we constrain the value of the regular black hole UV cutoff parameter from observations. Interestingly we find that the best fit is obtained by values of the parameter corresponding to regular horizonless compact objects.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a coordinate invariant formalism which describes the mechanical and electromagnetic interaction of gravitational waves (GWs) with a wide class of resonant detectors. We solve the GW-modified equations of electrodynamics and elasticity with dynamic boundary conditions using an eigenmode expansion. Furthermore, we take damping effects and electromagnetic back-action on mechanical systems covariantly into account. The resulting coupling coefficients are particularly useful for high-frequency gravitational wave experiments using microwave cavities and allow a straightforward numerical implementation for arbitrary detector geometries.</description>

      <title>Dynamical System Analysis of FLRW Model in f(R,L,T) Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modified gravity theories have been extensively studied recently as viable substitutes for general relativity to deal with cosmological issues like dark energy and late-time cosmic acceleration. In the present work, we investigate the dynamical behavior of the $f(R,L,T)$ gravity model with a scalar field utilizing exponential potential, where $R$ represents the Ricci scalar, $L$ is the Lagrangian density and $T$ is the trace of the energy-momentum tensor. We concentrate on a specific type of modified gravity characterized by $f(R,L,T) =R+\alpha L+\beta T$, where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are positive constants. We study the dynamical behavior and late-time evolution of a cosmological model using a thorough phase-space analysis. We assess important cosmological parameters at the critical places, such as the density parameters corresponding to various cosmic components, the deceleration parameter, and the effective equation of state parameter. The nature of the cosmic phases such as matter-dominated, radiation-dominated, and accelerated expansion eras, described using these quantities.</description>

      <title>Post-Newtonian accelerations of a Mercury orbiter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the relativistic modeling of spacecraft motion in Mercury's post-Newtonian local coordinates. This investigation is motivated by the fact that Mercury's post-Newtonian gravitational field (as well as that of any other planet) admits an expansion in terms of multipole moments, which are most appropriately defined in the local reference system. The equations of motion in the Mercury-centric local frame include relativistic local perturbations, given by the Schwarzschild term, Lense-Thirring precession, and the acceleration due to the quadrupole moment, and relativistic third-body perturbations, which are the gravito-electric and gravito-magnetic accelerations, along with a coupling term between Mercury and other solar system bodies. The relativistic third-body perturbations are usually neglected in all practical applications. In this study, we analyze the magnitude of the post-Newtonian terms of the equations of motion formulated in the Mercury-centric frame, evaluating them along the trajectories of the two BepiColombo spacecrafts. Based on this analysis, we provide a practical approach for constructing a high-accuracy relativistic orbital model suitable for a Mercury orbiter.</description>

      <title>From the confluent Heun equation to a new factorized and resummed gravitational waveform for circularized, nonspinning, compact binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new factorized and resummed waveform for circularized, nonspinning, compact binaries that leverages on the solution of the Teukolsky equation once mapped into a confluent Heun equation. The structure of the solution allows one to identify new resummed factors that completely absorb all test-mass logarithms and transcendental numbers via exponentials and $\Gamma$-functions at any post-Newtonian (PN) order. The corresponding residual relativistic and phase corrections are thus polynomial with rational coefficients, that are in fact PN-truncated hypergeometric functions. Our approach complements the recent proposal of Ivanov et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 135 (2025) 14, 141401], notably recovering the corresponding renormalization group scaling of multipole moments from first principles and fixing the scaling constant. In the test mass limit, our approach (pushed up to 10PN) yields waveforms and fluxes that are globally more accurate than those obtained using the standard factorized approach of Damour et al. [Phys. Rev. D 79 (2009), 064004]. The method generalizes straightforwardly to comparable mass binaries implementing the new concept of universal anomalous dimension of multipole moments and might be eventually useful to improve current state of the art effective-one-body waveform models for coalescing binaries.</description>

      <title>Conservative binary dynamics to third post-Minkowskian order beyond General Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the conservative dynamics of compact binaries to third order in the post-Minkowskian approximation in a theory that extends general relativity by a massless scalar field coupled to the Gauss-Bonnet invariant. We employ the effective field theory approach to construct the effective action of binary systems by integrating out the metric and scalar degrees of freedom that mediate the gravitational interactions between the two bodies. We derive analytical expressions for the scattering impulse and the deflection angle to third order in the post-Minkowskian expansion. Our results are found to be in agreement, in the overlapping regimes, with state-of-the-art calculations in the post-Newtonian/post-Minkowskian theory.</description>

      <title>Dynamics, Ringdown, and Accretion-Driven Multiple Quasi-Periodic Oscillations of Kerr-Bertotti-Robinson Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the motion of test particles around Kerr--Bertotti--Robinson (KBR) black hole (BH) and explore how the three defining parameters the mass $M$, rotation parameter $a$, and magnetic parameter $B$ influence their dynamics. We derive analytical expressions for the energy and angular momentum of stable equatorial circular orbits, along with the corresponding radial and latitudinal oscillation frequencies, as functions of $M$, $a$, and $B$. We also examine the key features of the quasi-periodic oscillations of test particles near stable circular orbits, including the precession effects such as periastron precession and the Lense-Thirring effect. Finally, we compare our results with those corresponding to the Kerr BH. We find that particle motion is strongly shaped by the BH parameters. Using a WKB approach, we also study scalar quasinormal modes of a rotating KBR BH in an external magnetic field and show that the magnetic field increases damping, while rotation and angular momentum mainly set the oscillation frequencies. Alternatively, general relativistic modelling of Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) accretion onto a rapidly rotating KBR BH shows that two distinct physical structures emerge and cyclically transform into one another over time. These processes produce either a strongly oscillating flip-flop shock cone or a nearly stationary toroidal structure, with their formation governed by the black hole spin and magnetic curvature. Power spectral analysis shows that these configurations give rise to low and high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations, offering a unified explanation for the multiple quasi-periodic oscillations observed in rapidly spinning X--ray binaries.</description>

      <title>Cyclic universe from uniform rate inflation on the brane with a timelike extra dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a non-singular cosmological scenario in which uniform-rate inflation is realised on an anisotropic Shtanov-Sahni braneworld. The model naturally resolves the initial singularity resulting in an infinite number of smooth non-singular bounces, while accommodating a phase of accelerated expansion driven by a scalar field rolling at a constant rate. The presence of a timelike extra dimension induces high-energy corrections to the effective Friedmann dynamics, allowing anisotropic shear to be dynamically suppressed near the bounce and rendering the background evolution stable. We derive the full background dynamics analytically and demonstrate that uniform-rate inflation can be consistently embedded within an anisotropic braneworld framework. Primordial scalar and tensor perturbations are analysed using the $\delta N$ formalism, ensuring that only physically relevant modes exiting the horizon during inflation contribute to observable quantities. Remarkably, we find that observational consistency can be achieved with different levels of anisotropy in the two different scenarios we consider, without compromising the smoothness or stability of the bounce. Our results establish uniform-rate inflation on an anisotropic braneworld as a robust and observationally viable alternative to standard inflationary cosmology, offering a compelling framework in which non-singular early-universe dynamics and precision cosmology can be consistently unified.</description>

      <title>Covariant Holographic Entropy Cone</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.04888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The holographic entropy cone classifies the possible entanglement structures of quantum states with a classical gravity dual. For static geometries, Bao et al. established that this cone is polyhedral by constructing a graph model from Ryu-Takayanagi (RT) surfaces on a time-symmetric slice. Extending this framework to general, time-dependent states governed by the Hubeny-Rangamani-Takayanagi (HRT) formula has remained an open problem, as the relevant extremal surfaces do not lie on a common spatial slice. We resolve this by constructing a graph model directly from the causal structure of entanglement wedges. By proving a key "no-short-cut" theorem, we show that minimization over graph cuts reduces to a consideration of cuts corresponding to unions of complete HRT surfaces, establishing the equivalence of the covariant and static holographic entropy cones. Consequently, all foundational results, including polyhedrality and the finite nature of entropy inequalities, extend to general holographic states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.07117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the orthogonal Grassmannian as a novel kinematic space for describing correlators of massless spinning fields in de Sitter space. By automatically encoding the constraints of conformal symmetry and current conservation, the formalism drastically simplifies these correlators. We show that three-point functions are fixed by little group covariance and take the same form as the corresponding Schwinger-parameterized correlators in twistor space. The power of the Grassmannian approach is especially evident for four-point functions, which require dynamical input beyond kinematics. We demonstrate that unitarity enforces the same factorization properties as for scattering amplitudes and use these to bootstrap the four-point functions in several non-trivial examples, including Yang-Mills theory. We find expressions that are astonishingly simple and reveal a close connection to the corresponding scattering amplitudes. Our results suggest that the Grassmannian provides the natural language for spinning correlators in de Sitter space and illuminates their geometric origin.</description>

      <title>Prospective bounds on f(Q) gravity with pulsar timing arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) have recently provided compelling evidence for a stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) in the nanohertz frequency band, offering a unique window into fundamental physics. Here, we explore implications for symmetric teleparallel $f(Q)$ gravity, a theory in which deviations from General Relativity (GR) arise through the non-metricity scalar $f(Q)$. Crucially, tensor modes propagate at the speed of light in this framework. However, their amplitude undergoes a modified damping during their evolution. We adopt a model-independent parameterization and derive an analytic approximation to the tensor mode transfer function to obtain the spectral energy density of primordial inflationary gravitational waves. Comparison with the NANOGrav 15-year and IPTA second data releases show that the inferred damping parameter $n$ remains consistent with GR, yet allows small deviations that could be observable. We then conduct a Fisher information matrix forecasts which demonstrate that the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) observatory will improve these constraints by several orders of magnitude, offering the potential to distinguish $f(Q)$ gravity from GR with high precision. These results highlight PTAs as powerful probes of non-metricity-based modifications to gravity.</description>

Abstract: Understanding how and when the first stars and galaxies formed remains one of the central challenges in modern cosmology. These structures emerged during the transition from the Dark Ages to the Cosmic Dawn, a period that remains observationally unconstrained despite strong theoretical progress. During this epoch, neutral hydrogen absorbed a fraction of cosmic microwave background photons through its 21-cm hyperfine transition, producing a 21-cm absorption signal whose evolution encodes the early Universe's thermal and ionization history. However, extracting the underlying astrophysical parameters from this signal is limited by severe parameter degeneracies, which cannot be resolved without independent observational probes. The next-generation gravitational wave (GW) detectors, such as Cosmic Explorer (CE), will observe binary black hole (BBH) mergers up to very large redshifts and hence will detect a fraction of them formed within the redshift range $\sim 13-25$. The merger rate of these BBHs will depend on the star formation rate density (SFRD) at these redshifts, together with the BBH formation efficiency and a time delay distribution. Therefore, the merger rate of these BBHs can work as a tracer of the SFRD in the redshift range $\sim 13-25$. In this Letter, we establish a novel multi-messenger framework and present a proof-of-principle concept of how the observations of BBH mergers form next-generation GW detectors can improve the inference of parameters generating the 21-cm cosmic hydrogen signal, and help break degeneracies between them.</description>

      <title>Quantum Evolution of Hopf Algebra Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, growing attention has been devoted to the possibility that theories with deformed symmetries, associated with certain models of non-commutative spacetime, may encode a fundamental form of decoherence. This effect should be described by a Lindblad-like evolution governed by the non-trivial Hopf algebra structure of the time-evolution generators. In this work we provide a detailed analysis of such possibility for similar Hopf algebra deformations of the Hamiltonian of a qubit. Starting from a critical examination of the very definition of time evolution through the generalized adjoint action, we explore whether a coherent and physically viable framework can be established. In particular, our analysis shows that a more general combination of adjoint actions always guarantees a von Neumann dynamics and, also in the case of deformed spacetime symmetries considered in the literature, a physically viable Lindblad evolution cannot be established.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.07895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce an operational, boundary-first framework that embeds relativistic quantum-information protocols into anti-de Sitter/Conformal Field Theory (AdS/CFT) by coupling an Unruh--DeWitt detector directly to a local scalar primary operator of a holographic CFT. Using the universal CFT Wightman function, we compute the detector's reduced density operator perturbatively, retaining both excitation probabilities and coherences. As a concrete resource-theoretic application, we implement magic resource (mana) harvesting with a qutrit probe. For a CFT dual to global AdS, we show that the harvested mana sharply distinguishes the two admissible scalar quantizations in the Breitenlohner--Freedman window, with the standard quantization yielding systematically larger mana than the alternate one. Our results provide a viable way of testing holography principle through quantum information resource.</description>

      <title>Cancellation of one-parameter graviton gauge dependence in the effective scalar field equation in de Sitter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.07908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate gauge dependence of one-graviton-loop corrections to the effective field equation of the massless, minimally coupled scalar in de Sitter, obtained by including source and observer corrections to the effective self-mass correcting the equation. Using the $\Delta\alpha$ variation of the de Sitter-breaking graviton propagator in a one-parameter family of gauges, we compute the gauge-dependent contributions to the effective self-mass of a massless minimally coupled scalar mediating interactions between heavy scalars. We show that gauge dependence cancels provided the contributions from all diagram classes are collected, including one-loop corrections to external mode functions, which play a qualitatively new role relative to flat space. The resulting cancellation supports the construction of graviton gauge-independent cosmological quantum-gravitational observables from quantum-corrected effective equations.</description>

      <title>Self-resonance preheating in deformed attractor models: oscillon formation and evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well known that, in potentials that are quadratic near the minimum but shallower away, such as small-$\alpha$ ($\ll M_P^2$) attractors, the inflaton condensate fragments into localized compact objects known as oscillons during self-resonance preheating. In this work we investigate the self-resonance in deformed $\alpha$-attractor T-model with a Gaussian feature near the minimum, distant from inflation's end. Linear analysis reveals altered resonance bands and deformed Floquet charts dependent on feature parameters. In fully nonlinear lattice simulations, we find that the gradient energy transfer is largely independent of the potential feature parameter $h$. In contrast, after resonance terminates, the subsequent evolution of gradient energy becomes strongly dependent on $h$. Statistical analysis reveals that models with the potential feature produce larger number of smaller oscillons, with a reduced energy stored in these objects, increasingly suppressed as the magnitude of $h$ grows. By tracking the total energy and the gradient energy contained in oscillons, we find that in models with nonzero $h$ oscillons are systematically shorter-lived, with this effect strengthening for larger $h$. The gravitational wave emission is dominated by the resonance stage and is strongly suppressed once oscillons form. Potential features leave the low-frequency spectrum largely unchanged but significantly modify the high-frequency tail. Although a complete reheating description requires external couplings and higher-resolution simulations, clear qualitative differences of cosmic expansion history already emerge within our simulated time window. These results highlight the important role of potential features in shaping reheating dynamics and their cosmological implications, and provide a deeper understanding of preheating dynamics and the properties of oscillons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.08338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose that the totality of dark matter in the universe might ascribe its origin to one of the key properties of cosmological inflation, that it may be eternal: regions that at the end of the primordial accelerated expansion of the universe never reheated, but keep eternally inflating, manifest themselves as primordial black holes in our observable universe. This mechanism can provide a primordial black hole abundance which is larger than the standard one due to the gravitational collapse of sizeable overdensities in the radiation phase. It also predicts a broad spectrum for the curvature perturbation and a flat stochastic gravitational wave background at a level of $\Omega_\text{GW} h^2 \simeq 10^{-10}$ up to the mHz.</description>

      <title>Kosmulator: A Python framework for cosmological inference with MCMC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Kosmulator, a modular and vectorised Python framework designed to accelerate the statistical testing of cosmological models. As the theoretical landscape expands beyond standard $\Lambda$CDM, implementing new expansion histories into traditional Einstein--Boltzmann solvers becomes a significant computational bottleneck. Kosmulator addresses this by leveraging array-native execution and efficient ensemble slice sampling (via Zeus) to perform rapid Bayesian inference. We validate the framework against the industry-standard Cobaya code using a combination of Type Ia Supernovae, Cosmic Chronometers, and Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data. Our results demonstrate that Kosmulator reproduces Cobaya's posterior constraints to within $\leq0.3\sigma$ statistical agreement on $H_{0}$ and $\Omega_{m}$ and $&lt;0.6\%$ precision on $\chi^{2}$, while achieving a $\sim 4.5\times$ reduction in wall-clock time on a single CPU core compared to a standard MPI-parallelised baseline. Furthermore, we showcase the framework's utility by constraining the implicit power-law $f(Q)$ "$f_1$CDM" model and demonstrating its automated model selection capabilities (AIC/BIC). Kosmulator is introduced as a "scientific sieve" for rapid hypothesis testing, allowing researchers to efficiently filter theoretical candidates before deploying high-precision resources.</description>

      <title>Positive mass theorems for manifolds with ALH toroidal ends</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.08789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In work with P. Chru\'sciel, L. Nguyen and T.-T. Paetz [8], a positive mass theorem was obtained for asymptotically locally hyperbolic manifolds with boundary, having a toroidal end. The proof made use of properties of marginally outer trapped surfaces (MOTS). Here we present some new PMT results for such manifolds, but without boundary, which allow for other more general ends. The proofs, while still MOTS-based, involve a more elaborate technique (related to $\mu$-bubbles) introduced in work of D. A. Lee, M. Lesourd, and R. Unger [20] for manifolds with an asymptotically flat end, and further developed in [23] for manifolds with an asymptotically hyperbolic end.</description>

      <title>Hints of sign-changing scalar field energy density and a transient acceleration phase at $z\sim 2$ from model-agnostic reconstructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a data-driven reconstruction of the late-time expansion history and its implications for dark-energy dynamics. Modeling the reduced Hubble rate with a node-based Gaussian-process-kernel interpolant, we constrain the reconstruction using CC, Pantheon+ SNIa, BAO data from SDSS and DESI, transversal BAO data, and external $H_0$ priors (SH0ES and H0DN). Assuming GR at the background level, we map the reconstructed kinematics onto a dark-energy fluid and a scalar-field description, yielding the total potential and kinetic contributions that reproduce the inferred $H(z)$. To interpret the reconstruction, we consider both a minimal single-field model (canonical or phantom) and a two-field (quintom) system consisting of one canonical and one phantom scalar field (or families). Within the GR-based effective-fluid mapping, the inferred dark-energy density changes sign for all dataset combinations explored, transitioning from $\rho_{\rm DE}&lt;0$ at higher redshift to $\rho_{\rm DE}&gt;0$ toward the present, and defining a transition redshift $z_\dagger$ by $\rho_{\rm DE}(z_\dagger)=0$. A single canonical scalar cannot realize such a smooth evolution during expansion, whereas a phantom field or a two-field quintom framework can accommodate the required behavior; in particular, the two-field system permits smooth phantom-divide crossings at finite $\rho_{\rm DE}&gt;0$ and distinguishes them from the separate notion of a density zero crossing. The reconstructed kinematics admit intermediate-redshift structure in some combinations, including hints of an additional accelerated-expansion interval around $z\sim 1.7$--$2.3$. The present-day equation of state remains close to a cosmological constant: combinations including supernovae give $w_0\simeq -1$, while combinations without supernovae but with an external $H_0$ prior show only a mild preference for $w_0&lt;-1$ at the $\sim1.5$--$1.7\sigma$ level.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.08931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I argue that spacetime singularities entail no ontological commitment to material entities. First, I show that Penrose's singularity theorem is best understood as a theorem of incompleteness, it demonstrates the failure of specific spacetime models within General Relativity (or any theory incorporating the Raychaudhuri equation) under certain general conditions. Although this has been done before, I adopt a novel approach based on differentiating between physical and purely formal assumptions in the axiomatic foundation of general relativity. Next, I compare Penrose's result with G\"odel's incompleteness theorem, highlighting key similarities and differences. Finally, I draw philosophical conclusions regarding the limits and prospects of our epistemic reconstructions of the physical world.</description>

      <title>Hawking-type singularity theorems for worldvolume energy inequalities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.04347v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The classical singularity theorems of R. Penrose and S. Hawking from the 1960s show that, given a pointwise energy condition (and some causality as well as initial assumptions), spacetimes cannot be geodesically complete. Despite their great success, the theorems leave room for physically relevant improvements, especially regarding the classical energy conditions as essentially any quantum field theory necessarily violates them. While singularity theorems with weakened energy conditions exist for worldline integral bounds, so called worldvolume bounds are in some cases more applicable than the worldline ones, such as the case of some massive free fields. In this paper we study integral Ricci curvature bounds based on worldvolume quantum strong energy inequalities. Under the additional assumption of a - potentially very negative - global timelike Ricci curvature bound, a Hawking type singularity theorem is proven. Finally, we apply the theorem to a cosmological scenario proving past geodesic incompleteness in cases where the worldline theorem was inconclusive.</description>

      <title>Energy conditions for non-timelike thin shells</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.07326v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study energy conditions for non-timelike thin shells in arbitrary $n(\ge 3)$ dimensions. It is shown that the induced energy-momentum tensor $t_{\mu\nu}$ on a shell $\Sigma$ is of the Hawking-Ellis type I if $\Sigma$ is spacelike and either of type I, II, or III if $\Sigma$ is null. Then, we derive simple equivalent representations of the standard energy conditions for $t_{\mu\nu}$. In particular, on a spacelike shell or on a null shell with non-vanishing surface current, $t_{\mu\nu}$ inevitably violates the dominant energy condition. If the surface pressure on the null shell is vanishing in addition, $t_{\mu\nu}$ is of type III and violates all the standard energy conditions. Those fully general results are obtained without imposing a spacetime symmetry and can be used in any theory of gravity. Lastly, several applications of the main results are presented in general relativity in four dimensions.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we model the bounce phase, stability, and the reconstruction of the universe by non-minimal kinetic coupling. In the process, we obtained importance information about the energy density and the matter pressure of the universe in relation to the previous universe through the bounce quantum phase. The novelty of the work is that the scale factor is obtained directly from the model and is fitted with an exponential function, with this view we explore the process of the early universe even the bounce phase. After that, we plot the cosmological parameters in terms of time evolution. In what follows, we investigate the stability of the model by dynamical system analysis in a phase plane. Finally, we examine the stability of the universe, especially in the inflationary period, by using the phase-space trajectories.</description>

Abstract: We explicitly determine all shear-free null hypersurfaces embedded in an Einstein spacetime, including vacuum asymptotically flat spacetimes. We characterize these hypersurfaces as oriented 3-dimensional manifolds where each is equipped with a coframe basis, a structure group and a connection. Such manifolds are known as null hypersurface structures (NHSs). The coframe and connection one-forms for an NHS appear as solutions to the projection of the Cartan structure equations onto the null hypersurface. We then show that each NHS corresponds to a Carrollian structure equipped with a unique pair of Ehresmann connection and affine connection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11601v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the orbital eccentricity in compact binary mergers can be used to improve their sky localization using gravitational wave observations. Existing algorithms that conduct the localizations are not optimized for eccentric sources. We use a semi-Bayesian technique to carry out localizations of simulated sources recovered using a matched-filter search. Through these simulations, we find that if a non-negligible eccentricity is obtained during the detection, an eccentricity-optimized algorithm can significantly improve the localization areas compared to the existing methods. We also lay out the foundation for an eccentric early-warning system using the matched-filter search. The potential impact on the early-warning localization is investigated. We indicate a few possible cases of improvements while accounting for eccentricity toward any detectable eccentric neutron star binaries in the forthcoming observing scenarios of ground-based detectors. Improved localizations can be useful in effectually utilizing the capabilities of the follow-up facilities.</description>

      <title>Relativistic stars in $f(Q)$-gravity: Exact analytic solution for the power-law case $f(Q) = Q + b \: Q^\nu$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14302v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate static spherically symmetric spacetimes within the framework of symmetric teleparallel $f(Q)$ gravity in order to describe relativistic stars. We adopt a specific ansatz for the background geometry corresponding to a singularity-free space-time. We obtain an expression for the connection, which allows the derivation of solutions for any $f(Q)$ theory in this context. Our approach aims to address a recurring error appearing in the literature, where even when a connection compatible with spherical symmetry is adopted, the field equation for the connection is systematically omitted and not checked if it is satisfied. For the stellar configuration, we concentrate on the power-law model $f(Q)=Q+\alpha Q_{0}\left( \frac{Q}{Q_{0}}\right) ^{\nu }$. The de Sitter-Schwarzschild geometry naturally emerges as an attractor beyond a certain radius, we thus utilize it as the external solution beyond the boundary of the star. We perform a detailed investigation of the physical characteristics of the interior solution, explicitly determining the mass function, analyzing the resulting gravitational fluid properties and deriving the angular and radial speed of sound.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Implications of the Gong-Zhang Parameterization in Rastall Gravity: A Deep Learning and Observational Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21243v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we have explored the cosmological dynamics of an isotropic, homogeneous universe in Rastall gravity. For this purpose, we use the parameterization of the EoS parameter in the form $\omega(z) = \frac{\omega_{0}}{(z+1)} $ to derive the explicit solution of the field equations in Rastall gravity. We constrained the cosmological parameters for the derived model by the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach utilizing OHD, BAO, and Pantheon plus compilation of SN Ia datasets. We also constrained the model parameters using deep learning techniques and the CoLFI Python package. This paper introduces an innovative deep-learning approach for parameter inference. The deep learning method significantly surpasses the MCMC technique regarding optimal fit values, parameter uncertainties, and relationships among parameters. This conclusion is drawn from a comparative analysis of the two methodologies. Additionally, we determined the transition redshift $z_t = 0.941$, which signifies the shift in the Universe's model from an early deceleration phase to the present acceleration phase. The diagnosis of the model with diagnostic tools like statefinders, jerk parameter, and $O_m$ diagnostics are presented and analyzed. The validation of the model's energy conditions is also examined.</description>

      <title>Shadow curves and quasinormal modes for rotating black holes surrounded by dark matter, radiation and dust</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18505v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the impact of different fluid matter scenarios on the shadow of black holes (BH) and on frequencies of quasinormal modes (QNM) for a black hole subjected to scalar perturbations, with a comparison to the standard Kerr. The analysis of the shadow reveals a dependence on the density parameter of fluid matter $k$, with larger shadow sizes for larger values of $k$ in the dark matter and dust cases, while the shadow size becomes smaller in the radiation case. Notably, dark matter induces more visible deformations compared to radiation or dust, thereby highlighting its distinct imprint on shadow curves. We also find that dark matter reduces the real part of the QNM frequencies and significantly increases the damping time, enhancing the prospects for gravitational wave detection. The variations in spin parameter $a$, density parameter $k$ and multipole number $l$ are investigated. The analysis confirms the significant role of dark matter in modifying the behavior of QNMs, providing a promising avenue for future experiments.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal entanglement of the vacuum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21649v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the future and left Rindler wedges of Minkowski spacetime are entangled, leading to the Unruh effect. Similarly, the past and right Rindler wedges are also entangled. We propose a protocol to extract this entanglement using two two-state detectors located in the past and right Rindler wedges. By scaling the detector transition frequencies inversely with Minkowski time, entanglement from the quantum field is transferred to the detectors, suggesting they may support quantum teleportation via the vacuum. Our protocol can be implemented with current quantum systems, such as flux-tunable transmon qubits. This research provides new insights into the entanglement properties of spacetime and hints at practical applications for secure quantum information transfer using the vacuum state of a quantum field.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Dynamics of General Relativistic Binary-Single and Binary-Binary Encounters of Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03934v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this exploratory study, we demonstrate the capability of the numerical-relativity code BAM to simulate fully relativistic black-hole binary-single and binary-binary encounters. While previous work has demonstrated the general capability of numerical-relativity frameworks to evolve spacetimes with $N$ black holes, detailed explorations of such encounters remain limited. We focus on scenarios involving initially non-spinning, equal-mass black holes that result in a variety of dynamical outcomes, including flybys, delayed or accelerated eccentric mergers, exchanges, and more complex interactions. Our results show that we can reliably simulate scattering experiments involving three and four black holes, which exhibit interesting dynamics and gravitational-wave signals. The dynamics of these systems show noticeable differences compared to analogous systems in post-Newtonian approximations up to 2.5PN. A key result is that the gravitational waveforms exhibit remarkable features that could potentially make them distinguishable from regular binary mergers.</description>

      <title>Correspondence between new agegraphic dark energy and Bose-Einstein condensate dark matter in the context of \(f(T)\) gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06920v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the cosmic evolution within the framework of $f(T)$ gravity using a flat-FRW background and model the universe as consisting of three components: baryonic matter, dark matter, and dark energy. We consider the new agegraphic (NA) as an alternative for dark energy and the Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) as an alternative for dark matter. After that, first we obtain the Friedman equations and then we obtain the continuity equations in the presence of the interaction term between the dark components of the universe, where the interaction term represents the energy flow from dark matter to dark energy. In what follows, we plot the variation of the cosmological parameters of dark energy in terms of the redshift parameter by using the power-law cosmology. Finally, we investigate the evolution and stability of the universe and report the values of the density parameters of the universe components which confirm the present model with observational data.</description>

      <title>Prospects for High-Frequency Gravitational-Wave Detection with GEO600</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08315v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current ground-based interferometers are optimized for sensitivity from a few tens of Hz to about 1 kHz. While they are not currently utilized for GW detection, interferometric detectors also feature narrow bands of strong sensitivity at higher frequencies where the sideband fields created by a GW are resonantly amplified in the optical system. Small changes to system parameters allow the narrow band of high sensitivity to be scanned over a much larger range of frequencies. In this paper, we investigate whether simply modifying the detuning angle of the signal-recycling mirror of the GEO600 interferometer can make this experiment sensitive to GWs in the kilohertz frequency range. We compute the strain sensitivity for GEO600 across a frequency range from several kHz to tens of kHz for various detuning angles. We also show that LIGO cannot attain the same effect assuming that the optical components are not changed due to the narrow band response of the Fabry-Perot cavities. We then calculate the sensitivity of GEO600 to various proposed high-frequency GW sources and compare it to the sensitivity of other ground-based detectors.</description>

      <title>Spherically Symmetric Potentials in Quadratic $f(R)$ Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15123v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the gravitational potential generated by static, spherically symmetric matter distributions in a quadratic $f(R)$ gravity model. In the weak-field regime, the linearized field equations lead to a fourth-order modified Poisson equation whose solutions contain Newtonian and Yukawa-type contributions. Imposing regularity at the origin and asymptotic flatness uniquely fixes the integration constants, yielding potentials fully determined by the mass density. Analytical expressions are derived for several classical profiles, including Plummer, Hernquist, and Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW), as well as for new analytic density models introduced in this work. The dependence on the quadratic gravity parameter $\alpha$ is analyzed, and the Newtonian limit of General Relativity is consistently recovered as $\alpha \to \infty$. As an application, circular velocity curves are computed and compared with the observed rotation curve of NGC 3198. A chi-squared analysis shows that the linearized quadratic $f(R)$ model provides improved fits relative to the Newtonian case in the inner and intermediate galactic regions $r \lesssim 30$ kpc, while predicting a decline at larger radii due to Yukawa suppression.</description>

      <title>Extended black hole thermodynamics in a DGP braneworld</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18508v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop extended black-hole thermodynamics on a Dvali--Gabadadze--Porrati (DGP) brane by promoting the brane tension $\sigma$ to a thermodynamic variable within the extended Iyer--Wald framework. The brane tension acts as a localized vacuum energy with pressure $P_\sigma \equiv -\sigma$, yielding a new work term $V_\sigma\,\mathrm{d}P_\sigma$ in the first law and the corresponding Smarr relation. For static, spherically symmetric black holes we show that the conjugate volume equals the geometric volume $V_\sigma=\tfrac{4\pi}{3}r_h^3$; for stationary, axisymmetric solutions it admits a covariant, slice-independent definition and evaluates to $V_\sigma=\tfrac{4\pi}{3}\!\left(r_+^3+a^2 r_+\right)$. Working on the ghost-free normal branch, the brane is asymptotically flat with a single horizon, so the construction avoids de Sitter obstructions. Along a flat-brane path, asymptotic flatness is preserved by co-varying the bulk cosmological constant, and induced-gravity effects are suppressed by $r_h/r_c$. These results establish a consistent flat-braneworld realization of black-hole chemistry in which brane tension provides the physically motivated pressure variable.</description>

      <title>Intermediate mass-ratio inspirals in a dense dark-matter environment: Effects of the initial dark-matter distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21132v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent work has shown the possibility of detecting dense dark-matter distributions surrounding intermediate or extreme mass-ratio inspirals through gravitational waves using LISA. Modeling these systems requires evolving the coupled dynamics of the binary and the dark matter. This also requires setting reasonable initial conditions for the dark-matter distribution, which itself relies upon understanding the formation history of these systems. In this paper, we investigate how two aspects of these systems' formation histories shape the dark-matter distribution: accretion onto the primary and prior merger events. We model accretion by introducing a minimum allowed angular momentum of dark-matter particles, which removes such particles that would have been accreted by the primary. When simulating an inspiral within such a distribution, we find a smaller dephasing of the gravitational-wave signal from a vacuum binary as compared to an inspiral without such a cutoff, particularly for more extreme mass-ratios. We also simulate an inspiral which takes place within a dark-matter distribution that remains after a prior merger. We find that the decrease in dephasing from vacuum binaries when compared to the prior inspiral is most significant for less extreme mass-ratios. Nevertheless, the environmental effects from the dark matter for these different cases of initial data are still expected to be measurable by future space-based detectors.</description>

Abstract: We consider the motion of a particle in the geometry of a Schwarzschild-like black hole embedded in a dark matter (DM) halo with Dehnen type density profile and calculate the orbital periods along with the evolution of the semi-latus rectum and eccentricity for extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs). Such a system emits gravitational waves (GWs), and the particle's orbit evolves under radiation reaction. We also consider the effects of dynamical friction and accretion of DM on the orbital parameters. We find that the eccentricity and semi-latus rectum decrease faster with respect to the case in which EMRI is in empty spacetime.</description>

      <title>Gauge Boundary conditions to mitigate center-of-mass drift in BBH simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25465v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Long-term numerical relativity (NR) simulations of binary black hole (BBH) systems in the Spectral Einstein Code (SpEC) code exhibit an unexpected exponential drift of the center-of-mass (CoM) away from the simulation's origin. In our work, we analyze this phenomenon and demonstrate that it is not a physical effect but rather a manifestation of a gauge artifact. The origin of this drift is the reflection of the gauge waves off the outer boundary of the computational domain. These reflections are introduced by inaccuracies in the gauge boundary condition, specifically, the application of the Sommerfeld condition to the time derivative of the gauge fields. Such an approach fails to completely suppress or correctly absorb the outgoing modes, thereby generating artificial feedback into the simulation. To mitigate this problem, we introduce a modified boundary condition that incorporates an explicit CoM correction source term designed to counteract the CoM motion. Our numerical experiments, performed with the SpEC code, reveal that this new boundary treatment reduces the CoM drift by several orders of magnitude compared to the standard implementation, and does not introduce any unwanted physical artifacts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.07487v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the impact of ModMax parameter on the dynamics of test particles around black holes and its effect on the characteristics of Quasi-Periodic Oscillations (QPOs). The effect of the ModMax parameter $\eta$ is studied using the effective potential, angular momentum and the energy of the circular orbits of the test particles. Our analysis shows that increasing $\eta$ brings about a continuous transition from the RN regime toward the Schwarzschild limit, accompanied by noticeable modifications in the Innermost Stable Circular Orbit (ISCO) and the corresponding Keplerian frequencies. We also explore the dependence of QPO radii on the ModMax parameter $\eta$ within the framework of the PR, RP, WD, and ER models. Finally, to place observational constraints, we perform a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis using QPO data from a range of black hole sources spanning stellar-mass, intermediate-mass, and supermassive scales.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Formation of Black Holes due to Boundary Effect in Vacuum Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09508v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that a marginally outer trapped surface (MOTS) can form as a result of Einsteinian evolution in pure vacuum spacetime starting from regular initial data free of MOTSs due to pure boundary effects. We adapt a Cauchy-double-null framework and use the boundary generalized mean curvature condition for the existence of an interior MOTS imposed by the author S-T Yau in \cite{yau}. In particular, we prove that the condition of \cite{yau} can be met dynamically starting from a configuration that does not verify the same through a focusing mechanism. In fact, a very mild incoming radiation can cause a large enough generalized boundary mean curvature of an isotropically large domain so that a MOTS exists in the interior. This is fundamentally different from black hole formation by standard ``gravitational collapse" and can be interpreted as the dynamical realization of a long-suspected idea in GR: MOTS can form because of ``global geometry", not just quasi-local concentration of gravity/matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18795v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we formulate wormhole-plus-neutron-star (WH+NS) systems supported by two scalar fields, allowing for both pressure anisotropy of the neutron fluid and magnetic field. In general, such WH+NS systems contain ghosts; however, these ghosts can be eliminated. We find that the wormhole remains traversable regardless of whether anisotropy of the neutron fluid and/or magnetic fields are included. In particular, the null energy condition (NEC) remains violated in the vicinity of the wormhole throat, ensuring the traversable nature of the geometry. For magnetized configurations, the resulting WH+NS systems can become extremely massive, with ADM masses exceeding $8\,M_\odot$, and can exhibit large surface redshifts exceeding $z \simeq 1.5$. Furthermore, we analyze the gravitational-wave echo time of the systems, which serves as a potential observational imprint. Our results indicate that the echo time can vary depending on the fluid anisotropy and the magnetic field configuration, suggesting that WH+NS systems may provide distinctive signals of gravitational echo.</description>

      <title>Imprints of quantum gravity effects on gravitational waves: a comparative study using extreme mass-ratio inspirals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.00185v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Within a generally covariant Hamiltonian framework of loop quantum gravity (LQG), two black hole models parameterized by a quantum correction $\zeta$ have recently been constructed. Using extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) as high-precision probes, we investigate the imprints of this LQG deformation in the surrounding spacetime. Waveforms generated via an improved augmented analytic kludge (AAK) model in both LQG black hole backgrounds and in Schwarzschild spacetime are compared through a faithfulness analysis. This allows us to quantify the detectability of the deviation with LISA and to derive constraints on $\zeta$ based on a detection threshold. We find that the first LQG black hole model produces significantly stronger signatures in EMRI signals than the second, making its quantum gravity effects more accessible to future space-borne gravitational-wave detection.</description>

      <title>Discrete vs continuum gravitational diagrams in the soft synchronous gauge</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02181v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Due to the non-renormalizability of gravity, the perturbative expansion has sense, say, for its discrete simplicial (Regge calculus) version. A finite-difference form of gravity action has diffeomorphism symmetry at leading order over metric variations from site to site, and we add a term bilinear in $n^\lambda(g_{\lambda\mu}-g_{\lambda \mu}^{(0)})$, $n^\lambda=[1,-\varepsilon(\Delta^{(s)\alpha}\Delta^{(s)}_\alpha)^{-1}\Delta^{(s)\beta}]$, to "softly" fix the synchronous gauge $g_{0\lambda}=g_{0\lambda}^{(0)}=-\delta_{0\lambda}$ at $\varepsilon\to0$, thus removing singularities at $p_0=0$.
  For the symmetric derivative $\Delta^{(s)}_\lambda$, the propagator has a graviton pole at $\sin^2p_0=\sum^3_{\alpha=1}\sin^2p_\alpha$ or, at small $p_\alpha$, at $p_0$ close to 0 or $\pm \pi$. This pole doubling compared to the continuum does not arise from $\sin^2(p_0/2)=\sum^3_{\alpha=1}\sin^2(p_\alpha/2)$ obtained from the action $\check{S}_{\rm g}$ with the usual derivative $\Delta_\lambda = \exp (ip_\lambda)-1$ instead of $\Delta^{(s)}_\lambda=i\sin p_\lambda$ in some terms, including in the k part of some term, and $\Delta^{(s)}_\lambda$ in the 1-k part of that term.
  Given the propagator $\check{G}(n,\overline{n})$, we form a principal value type propagator $[\check{G}(n,n)+\check{G}(\overline{n},\overline{n})]/2$ by analytically continuing from real $n=\overline{n}$. Singularities are roughly resolved as $p_0^{-j}\Rightarrow[(p_0+i\varepsilon)^{-j}+(p_0-i\varepsilon)^{-j}]/2$ leading to separate diagram finiteness at $\varepsilon\to0$.
  We find that k=1 is needed for this prescription to work properly and match the continuum case. The gauge-fixing term needed for this propagator and its finiteness are considered, the ghost contribution is found to vanish at $\varepsilon\to0$. We use these results in arXiv:2601.03228. Calculations are illustrated by the electromagnetic (Yang-Mills) case.</description>

      <title>Utilizing anticoincidence veto in a search for gravitational-wave transients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02713v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We devise a technique to suppress the effect of noise transients occurring at gravitational-wave detectors based on temporal anticoincidence. Searches for gravitational-wave signals in the detector data are prone to spurious disturbances of terrestrial origin. The technique presented here benefits from the fact that the noise effects are generally non-coincident in time at geographically separated detectors. Therefore, abnormally loud detector triggers that are not time-coincident can be vetoed. We implement the veto technique in a matched-filter search for transient signals from binary black holes and observe search backgrounds to be generally close to the Gaussian limit. An improvement in the sensitivity of the search is demonstrated using simulated signals. The technique is expected to especially improve the detection efficiency of the search for short duration gravitational waves.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03228v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper develops our work on the consequences of the Regge calculus, where some edge length scale arises as an optimal starting point of the perturbative expansion with taking into account a bell-shaped form of the measure obtained using functional integration over connection.
  A "hypercubic" structure is considered (some variables are frozen), it is described by the metric $g_{\lambda \mu}$ at the sites.
  The metric is parameterized to make the measure Lebesgue. The linear part of this parametrization leads to a discrete form of Feynman diagrams that approximates finite continuum diagrams and is finite for infinite ones; the nonlinear part gives new vertices and diagrams.
  The edge length scale as some maximum point of the measure is $\sim \eta^{1 / 2}$, where $\eta$ defines the free factor like $ ( - \det \| g_{\lambda \mu} \| )^{ \eta / 2}$ in the measure and should be a large parameter to ensure true action upon integration over connection. A priori, the perturbative expansion may contain increasing powers of $\eta$, but this does not happen for the starting point inside some neighborhood of the maximum point of the measure, and it does happen outside this neighborhood. This appears to be a dynamic mechanism for establishing the edge length scale.
  We use a discrete version of the soft synchronous gauge in the principal value type prescription we discuss in the recent paper arXiv:2601.02181. This allows one to fix the timelike length scale at a low level for which the measure is known in closed form. This gauge is considered together with a refined finite-difference form of the action to match the analytical properties of the propagator to the continuum case.</description>

      <title>Viable f(R) Scenarios Unifying Inflation with Realistic Dynamical Dark Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06949v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two $F(R)$ gravity models are tested on the basis of their viability during all stages of cosmological evolution. It is shown that these models can describe both the early-time inflationary epoch and the dark energy epoch. The models are confronted with the latest observational data, including the Pantheon+ catalogue with Type Ia supernovae, the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations, the Hubble parameter estimations and data from cosmic microwave background radiation. Investigation of the viability conditions for these models, in particular, the condition $\frac{dF}{dR}&gt;0$ required a deep analysis. Both models appeared to be viable during the early-time era, but for the late-time evolution the viability conditions are not fulfilled in definite domains in the parameter spaces of these models. However the best fitted parameters, determined in confrontation with the mentioned observational data, lie far from the forbidden domains for both models. These $F(R)$ gravity models describe the observations with the large advantage over the $\Lambda$-Cold-Dark-Matter model, not only in $\chi^2$ statistics, but also with Akaike and Bayesian information criteria. This success of the two $F(R)$ gravity scenarios is connected with their capability to mimic dynamical dark energy, similarly to models with variable equation of state, that is necessary for describing the latest Pantheon+ and DESI observational data.</description>

      <title>Detectability of Gravitational-Wave Memory with LISA: A Bayesian Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.23230v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) astronomy opens a new venue to explore the universe. Future observatories such as LISA, the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna, are expected to observe previously undetectable fundamental physics effects in signals predicted by General Relativity (GR).One particularly interesting such signal is associated to the displacement memory effect, which corresponds to a permanent deformation of spacetime due to the passage of gravitational radiation. In this work, we explore the ability of LISA to observe and characterize this effect. In order to do this, we use state-of-the-art simulations of the LISA instrument, and we perform a Bayesian analysis to assess the detectability and establish general conditions to claim detection of the displacement memory effect from individual massive black hole binary (MBHB) merger events in LISA. We perform parameter estimation both to explore the impact of the displacement memory effect and to reconstruct its amplitude. We discuss the precision at which such a reconstruction can be obtained thus opening the way to tests of GR and alternative theories. To provide astrophysical context, we apply our analysis to black hole binary populations models and estimate the rates at which the displacement memory effect could be observed within the LISA planned lifetime.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the primordial curvature power spectrum at small scales between $3\times 10^{18}$ and $4.5\times 10^{21}~\rm Mpc^{-1}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18887v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The primordial curvature power spectrum $\mathcal{P}_\mathcal{R}$ has been measured with high precision on large scales $10^{-4}\lesssim k\lesssim 3~\rm Mpc^{-1}$ based on observations of the cosmic microwave background, Lyman-$\alpha$ forest and large scale structure. On small scales $3\lesssim k \lesssim 10^{23}~\rm Mpc^{-1}$, constraints are primarily derived from studies on primordial black holes (PBHs). In particular, for very small scales $10^{17}\lesssim k\lesssim 10^{23}~{\rm Mpc^{-1}}$, current limits come exclusively from investigations of the lightest supersymmetric particles produced by PBH radiation and the stable Planck-mass relics after their evaporation. Recent findings also indicate that the evaporation of light PBHs ($M_{\rm PBH}\lesssim 10^{9}~\rm g$) can modify the expansion rate of the Universe and the baryon-to-photon ratio, thereby affecting the primordial abundance of light nuclei. Moreover, it has been proposed that the ``memory burden'' effect can slow down the mass loss rate of black holes, allowing light PBHs to survive until the present day. Based on recent theoretical advancements in black hole physics and existing constraints on the initial mass fraction of light PBHs with masses $10^{3}\lesssim M_{\rm PBH}\lesssim 2\times 10^{9}~\rm g$, we derive new constraints on $\mathcal{P}_\mathcal{R}$ on small scales $3\times 10^{18}\lesssim k\lesssim 4.5\times 10^{21}~\rm Mpc^{-1}$, a regime that has been underexplored in previous literature.</description>

      <title>Transonic accretion flow in the mini discs of a binary black hole system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17108v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the general relativistic transonic accretion flow around the primary black hole, which forms the circumprimary disc (CPD), within a binary black hole (BBH) system. The BBH spacetime is characterized by the mass ratio ($q$) and the separation distance ($z_2$) between the two black holes. We numerically solve the radial momentum and energy equations to obtain the accretion solutions. It is observed that the CPD can exhibit shock solutions, which exist for a wide range parameter space spanned by flow specific angular momentum ($\lambda$) and energy ($E$). We find that the shock parameter space is modified by $q$ and $z_2$. Investigations show that $q$ and $z_2$ also affect various shock properties, such as density compression and temperature compression across the shock fronts. Moreover, we calculate the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of the CPD and examine how the SEDs are modified by $q$ and $z_2$ for both shock-free and shock-induced accretion solutions. SED is found to be nearly independent of the binary parameters. We essentially show that although $q$ and $z_2$ alter the effective horizon area of the primary black hole located at the center of the CPD, they have a minimal impact on the dynamical and spectral properties of the accretion flow around the primary black hole.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00487v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine the quantum field description of massive Carrollian field theories, emphasizing the critical role of gauge fixing within the Carrollian sector. We illustrate this importance using scalar Carrollian Electrodynamics (sCED) as a primary example. We also present the quantum field description for complex Carrollian scalar fields, Carrollian fermions, and Carrollian Electrodynamics. We highlight the challenges in scalar Carrollian electrodynamics (sCED), where the renormalized mass appears gauge-dependent, and clarify this discrepancy by carefully constructing completely gauge-fixed propagators. We discuss how certain abelian Carrollian field theories do not admit any loop corrections and are trivial in that sense.</description>

      <title>No-scale Brans-Dicke Gravity -- ultralight scalar boson &amp; heavy inflaton</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18648v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is very much intriguing if the Planck scale $M_{\rm{Pl}}$ is not a fundamental parameter. The Brans-Dicke gravity is nothing but the theory where the Planck scale $M_{\rm{Pl}}$ is indeed an illusional parameter. The theory predicts a massless scalar boson whose exchanges between matters induce unwanted long range forces. We solve this problem imposing there is no dimensionful parameter in the theory, even at the quantum level. We further extend the theory by including a $R^2$ term and a non-minimal coupling of the Standard Model Higgs to gravity, as their coefficients are dimensionless. This extension provides a heavy inflaton field that is consistent with all cosmological observations, with a potential very similar to that of the Starobinsky model. The inflaton necessarily decays into the massless scalar bosons, resulting in a non-negligible amount of dark radiation in the present universe. We demonstrate that the inflation model yields a sufficiently high reheating temperature for successful leptogenesis, and we also discuss a possible candidate for dark matter.</description>

      <title>Effective Field Theory of Chiral Gravitational Waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19059v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When a (non-)Abelian gauge field acquires an isotropic background configuration during inflation, strong gravitational waves (GWs) with parity-violating polarization, known as chiral GWs, can be produced in addition to the intrinsic unpolarized GWs. However, previous studies have analyzed individual models, leaving the generality of this phenomenon unclear. To perform a model-independent analysis, we construct an effective field theory (EFT) of chiral GWs by extending the EFT of inflation and incorporating gauge fields. The resulting action unifies inflationary models with a $SU(2)$ gauge field, such as chromo-natural inflation and gauge-flation, and ones with a triplet of $U(1)$ gauge fields, systematically encompassing all possible GW production mechanisms consistent with the symmetry breaking induced by the gauge field background. We find that chiral GWs are generically and inevitably produced, provided that the effective energy density of the background gauge field is positive and the gauge kinetic function is not fine-tuned to a specific time dependence. This EFT offers a useful foundation for future phenomenological studies as well as for deepening our theoretical understanding of chiral GWs.</description>

      <title>Scale without Conformal Invariance in bottom-up Holography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09692v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In holography, the isometry group of the bulk spacetime corresponds to the symmetries of the boundary theory. We thus approach the question of whether (and when) scale invariance in combination with Poincar\'e invariance implies full conformal invariance in quantum field theory from a holographic bulk perspective. To do so, we study bulk spacetimes that include a warped extra dimension and in which the isometry group corresponds to scale without conformal invariance. Firstly, we show that the bulk Weyl tensor plays a pivotal role in distinguishing those metrics exhibiting conformal invariance (Weyl=0) from those merely exhibiting scale invariance (Weyl$\neq$0). Based on this, we then prove the following theorem: For putative boundary theories with $n\geq2$ dimensions, the bulk metric can not exhibit scale without conformal invariance if its warped extra dimension is compact and the null energy condition is required to hold. For $n=1$, we discuss that a more general ansatz for the bulk metric must be made, a detailed analysis of which is left for future research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10250v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a Hilbert space approach to quantum mechanics where space and time are treated on an equal footing. Our approach replaces the standard dependence on an external classical time parameter with a spacetime-symmetric algebraic structure, thereby unifying the axioms that traditionally distinguish the treatment of spacelike and timelike separations. Standard quantum evolution can be recovered from timelike correlators, defined by means of a quantum action operator, a quantum version of the action of classical mechanics. The corresponding map also provides a novel perspective on the path integral formulation, which, in the case of fermions, yields an alternative to the use of Grassmann variables. In addition, the formalism can be interpreted in terms of generalized quantum states, codifying both the conventional information of a quantum system at a given time and its evolution. We show that these states are solutions to a quantum principle of stationary action grounded in timelike correlations and pseudo-entropies</description>

      <title>Self-Interacting Dark-Matter Spikes and the Final-Parsec Problem: Bayesian constraints from the NANOGrav 15-Year Gravitational-Wave Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18153v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A self-interacting dark-matter (SIDM) density spike around merging supermassive black holes (SMBHs) may be able to supply the dynamical friction needed to shrink binaries from $\sim 1\, \mathrm{pc}$ to $\sim 10^{-2} \,\mathrm{pc}$, thereby resolving the long-standing "final-parsec problem". Embedding the binary-halo system in a cosmological population model, we evolve the inspiral under the combined influence of gravitational-wave (GW) emission and SIDM drag, compute the resulting nanohertz GW background, and confront it with the NANOGrav 15-year pulsar-timing data. A six-parameter Bayesian analysis, performed with a Gaussian-process-accelerated Markov chain Monte Carlo, yields posterior constraints on the cross-section per unit mass and maximum circular velocity values that were consistent with independent galaxy-rotation and cluster-lensing limits. Within this parameter space, the SIDM spike remains intact, supplies sufficient friction to overcome the stellar depletion barrier, and produces a characteristic-strain spectrum that matches the NANOGrav signal as well as phenomenological astrophysical models.</description>

      <title>Einstein Fields: A Neural Perspective To Computational General Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11589v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Einstein Fields, a neural representation designed to compress computationally intensive four-dimensional numerical relativity simulations into compact implicit neural network weights. By modeling the metric, the core tensor field of general relativity, Einstein Fields enable the derivation of physical quantities via automatic differentiation. Unlike conventional neural fields (e.g., signed distance, occupancy, or radiance fields), Einstein Fields fall into the class of Neural Tensor Fields with the key difference that, when encoding the spacetime geometry into neural field representations, dynamics emerge naturally as a byproduct. Our novel implicit approach demonstrates remarkable potential, including continuum modeling of four-dimensional spacetime, mesh-agnosticity, storage efficiency, derivative accuracy, and ease of use. It achieves up to a $4,000$-fold reduction in storage memory compared to discrete representations while retaining a numerical accuracy of five to seven decimal places. Moreover, in single precision, differentiation of the Einstein Fields-parameterized metric tensor is up to five orders of magnitude more accurate compared to naive finite differencing methods. We demonstrate these properties on several canonical test beds of general relativity and numerical relativity simulation data, while also releasing an open-source JAX-based library: \href{https://github.com/AndreiB137/EinFields}{https://github.com/AndreiB137/EinFields}, taking the first steps to studying the potential of machine learning in numerical relativity.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Black Hole and Disk-Driven Jets: Steady Axisymmetric Ideal MHD Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23281v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Improved observational precision in relativistic jets has underscored the need for tractable theoretical models. In this study, we construct a semi-analytical hybrid jet model that incorporates both black hole-driven and disk-driven components within the framework of steady, axisymmetric, ideal MHD. We derive a condition that determines the launching sites of cold outflows, introducing a new constraint on the magnetic field configuration threading the accretion disk. Using the Bernoulli equation and critical point analysis, we derive flow solutions along various magnetic field lines. Our hybrid jet model shows that discontinuities in field-line angular velocity lead to clear velocity shear and density jumps at the interface between the two jet components. These features are accompanied by localized enhancements in velocity and density, potentially explaining the observed limb-brightening.</description>

      <title>The gyromagnetic factor of charged rotating black holes in various dimensions from scattering amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08456v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Classical black hole spacetimes can be recovered from the classical limit of quantum scattering amplitudes in a low-energy effective field theory of gravity. In this work we compute, at first post-Minkowskian and dipole order, the metric and the electromagnetic potential for charged and rotating black holes in general spacetime dimensions from amplitudes describing the emission of either a graviton or a photon from a massive and charged Dirac fermion field up to one loop. In addition, we introduce a Pauli non-minimal coupling, to parametrize the black hole's gyromagnetic factor $\mathfrak{g}$. We are able to reproduce the Kerr-Newman solution in four dimensions, as well as the Chong-Cveti\v{c}-L\"u-Pope solution, from five-dimensional supergravity, which includes a Chern-Simons interaction. Crucially, we show that for a charged Myers-Perry like black hole in $d+1$ spacetime dimensions, its gyromagnetic factor is equal to $\mathfrak{g}=(d-1)/(d-2)$. Hence, only in $3+1$ dimensions minimal coupling is sufficient to describe black holes from scattering amplitudes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03118v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the recently released B-mode polarisation data from the South Pole Telescope (SPT) favour a non-vanishing contribution of primordial gravitational waves of inflationary origin which is in tension with the previous BICEP-Keck (BK) measurements. Our analysis uses the third-order slow-roll primordial power spectra, with theoretically motivated priors, on the multifrequency SPT likelihoods complemented by the latest Planck satellite data products. The SPT measurements provide 1.0 bit of information gain on the first slow-roll parameter, which is higher than the 0.9 bit provided by BK even though the SPT sensitivity is five times lower. Moreover, the Bayesian dimensionality on the same parameter exceeds 1.5 for SPT versus 0.3 for BK showing that it is overconstrained by the SPT data. Even if this BB-tension could be the result of a yet to be understood foreground, our findings should motivate for a closer analysis of this unexpected B-modes excess.</description>

      <title>Shadows of the Colossus: Hierarchical Black Hole Mergers in a 10-million-body Globular Cluster Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21916v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The LIGO/Virgo/Kagra (LVK) Collaboration has detected numerous binary black hole mergers with properties that challenge standard binary evolution scenarios, such as component masses above the pair-instability gap and high spin magnitudes. Dense stellar environments such as globular clusters provide a natural channel for producing such systems through hierarchical mergers, where black hole remnants formed in earlier mergers are retained in the cluster and undergo successive mergers. However, gravitational-wave recoil kicks often eject merger remnants from typical globular clusters, which limits hierarchical growth. Massive clusters with deeper potential wells, such as those found in giant elliptical galaxies like M87, may overcome this barrier, but direct simulations of such massive globular clusters remains computationally challenging. In this study, we present a 10-million-body cluster simulation performed with the $\texttt{Cluster Monte Carlo}$ ($\texttt{CMC}$) code, referred to as $\texttt{colossus}$, which serves as a proxy for the most massive low-metallicity globular clusters observed in the local Universe. This simulation demonstrates that extended chains of hierarchical mergers can occur in massive globular clusters, producing black holes up to fifth generation with masses approaching $250\,M_\odot$, comparable to the most massive LVK events observed to date (e.g., GW231123). Combining the $\texttt{colossus}$ simulation with the previous $\texttt{CMC Cluster Catalog}$, we develop a framework to extrapolate binary black hole merger predictions for the thousands of globular clusters seen in the Virgo Supercluster.</description>

      <title>Turnover detection using the power spectrum and bispectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06962v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The turnover at the peak of the Fourier matter power spectrum encodes a fundamental signature of matter-radiation equality in the early Universe. This delivers a potential standard ruler, independent of baryon acoustic oscillations and therefore able to break parameter degeneracies and improve precision. Furthermore, the turnover scale is independent of redshift and clustering bias, allowing for stacking of the signals from redshift bins. In practice, the very large scale of the turnover means that sample variance and systematics are serious impediments to its detection. Detections of the turnover and measurements of its scale have been made in the WiggleZ, eBOSS, Quaia, and DESI surveys. Upcoming surveys should improve the detection significance and reduce errors on the turnover scale. We use MCMC forecasts for turnover detection in a spectroscopic Euclid-like survey and a futuristic MegaMapper-like survey. In addition to the power spectrum, we include the signal from the bispectrum in equilateral configurations. These surveys are forecast to detect the turnover at $\sim\! 6\sigma$ (Euclid-like) and $\sim\! 15\sigma$ (MegaMapper-like), with precision on the turnover scale of $\sim\! 4\%$ and $\sim\! 2\%$. The inclusion of the bispectrum delivers a modest improvement of $\sim\! 10-17\%$ in the constraints on the turnover scale.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter from Holography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.10617v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Previous studies have examined the holographic principle as a means of producing dark energy. Here we propose instead the possibility of holographic dark matter. In this case, dark matter does not arise in the framework of particle physics but is derived from the infrared cutoff set by the horizon scale. Using the Ricci cutoff, and a universe containing only baryons and radiation, we can account for the dark matter and naturally explain the coincidence between baryonic and nonbaryonic contributions to the density. In the presence of a pre-existing vacuum energy density our model reverses the sign of this density, thus accounting for the fact that certain string theories generically predict a negative vacuum energy, but observations require a positive value.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15969v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a detailed analysis of the disk path integral of timelike Liouville theory, conceived as a tractable and precise toy-model quantum cosmology in two dimensions. Disk path integrals with the insertion of matter field operators, taken along a judiciously chosen complex contour, yield states akin to the Hartle-Hawking wavefunction. Working in the fixed $K$-representation, where $K$ is the trace of the extrinsic curvature, we compute the one-loop wavefunctions and put forward a conjecture for the all-loop expressions. A suitable pairing of Liouville disk path integrals yields a $K$-independent quantity that may form the basis for a well-defined inner product on the space of Euclidean histories. We also consider other ensembles, including one with fixed area, and provide a static patch perspective with a timelike feature.</description>

      <title>The Stretched Horizon Limit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16738v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider four-dimensional general relativity with a positive cosmological constant, $\Lambda$, in the presence of a boundary, $\Gamma$, of finite spatial size. The boundary is located near a cosmological event horizon, and is subject to boundary conditions that fix the conformal class of the induced metric, and, $K$, the trace of the extrinsic curvature along $\Gamma$. The proximity of $\Gamma$ to the horizon is controlled by the dimensionless parameter ${K}{{\Lambda}^{-\frac{1}{2}}}$. We provide an exhaustive analysis of linearised gravitational perturbations for the setup. This is performed both for a $\Gamma$ encasing a portion of the static patch that ends just before the cosmological horizon (pole patch), as well as a $\Gamma$ containing only the region near the cosmological horizon (cosmic patch). In the pole patch, we uncover a layered hierarchy of modes: ordinary normal modes, a novel type of boundary gapless mode, and boundary soft modes of frequency $\omega \approx \pm 2\pi i T_{\text{dS}}$, with $T_{\text{dS}}$ the horizon temperature. Minkowskian behaviour is recovered only for angular momenta $l \gtrsim {K}{{\Lambda}^{-\frac{1}{2}}}$ which can be made parametrically large, thus attenuating previously found growing modes. In the cosmic patch, we uncover sound and shear fluid-dynamical modes that we interpret in terms of a conformal fluid with shear viscosity over entropy density ratio $\tfrac{\eta}{s} = \tfrac{1}{4\pi}$ and vanishing bulk viscosity $\zeta=0$. The fluid dynamical sector is shown to admit a non-linear treatment. We describe a scaling regime in which the stretched horizon gravitational dynamics is dictated by a universal Rindler geometry, independent to the details of the infilling horizon. We briefly discuss quantitative features that distinguish cosmological and black hole horizons away from the Rindler regime.</description>

      <title>Scattering Amplitudes and Conservative Binary Dynamics at $O(G^5)$ without Self-Force Truncation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23654v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the complete potential-graviton contributions to the conservative radial action and scattering angle for two non-spinning bodies in general relativity, accurate through fifth order in Newton's constant and including second-order self-force (2SF) effects. The calculation is carried out in the scattering-amplitude framework, combining the double copy, effective field theory, and multi-loop integration techniques based on integration by parts and differential equations. To address a major computational bottleneck, we develop improved integration-by-parts algorithms that render calculations at this order tractable. The post-Minkowskian amplitude is presented as a series expansion, following the strategy used earlier in maximal supergravity. For the first self-force sector, which involves only polylogarithmic functions, we also provide a closed-form analytic expression. For the second self-force sector, as in earlier supergravity work, we find nontrivial cancellations among contributions related to integrals supported on Calabi-Yau geometry.</description>

      <title>Local Scale Invariance in Quantum Theory: A Non-Hermitian Pilot-Wave Formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03567v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that Weyl's abandoned idea of local scale invariance has a natural realization at the quantum level in pilot-wave (de Broglie-Bohm) theory. We obtain the Weyl covariant derivative by complexifying the electromagnetic gauge coupling parameter. The resultant non-hermiticity has a natural interpretation in terms of local scale invariance in pilot-wave theory. The conserved current density is modified from $|\psi|^2$ to the local scale invariant, trajectory-dependent ratio $|\psi|^2/ \mathbf 1^2[\mathcal C]$, where $\mathbf 1[\mathcal C]$ is a scale factor that depends on the pilot-wave trajectory $\mathcal C$ in configuration space. All physical predictions are local scale invariant, even in the presence of mass terms. Our approach is general, and we implement it for the Schr\"odinger and Pauli equations, and for the Dirac equation in curved spacetime, each coupled to an external electromagnetic field. We also implement it in quantum field theory for the case of a quantized axion field interacting with a quantized electromagnetic field. We discuss the equilibrium probability density and show that the corresponding trajectories are unique. Our results provide a pivotal understanding of local scale invariance in quantum theory.</description>

      <title>Hidden pattern of self-invariant cosmic expansion: Empirical evidence from Hubble diagram of supernovae</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.05512v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present empirical evidence extracted directly from the Pantheon Catalog of SNeIa demonstrating that the speed of light varies as the universe expands. Moreover, the speed of light must vary in a specific quantifiable manner. To show this, we reformulate the kinematics of late-time acceleration using Dolgov's power-law cosmology $a=(t/t_0)^\mu$ [Phys. Rev. D 55, 5881 (1997)] and Barrow's varying speed of light $c=c_0a^{-\zeta}$ [Phys. Rev. D 59, 043515 (1999)]. In this cosmology, light traveling through an expanding universe undergoes an additional refraction caused by the varying c along its path, resulting in a modified Lemaitre redshift formula $1+z=a^{-(1+\zeta)}$. The new model achieves a high-quality fit to the Pantheon Catalog of SNeIa and exhibits a strong degeneracy along the locus $(1+\zeta)\,\mu=1$. This empirical relation indicates a self-invariant cosmic evolution: at all instants during the late-time epoch, the speed of light is exactly proportional to the rate of cosmic expansion, viz. $c=\mu^{-1}c_0t_0\,da/dt$, a characteristic that is absent in the $\Lambda$CDM model. This synchronous behavior between $c$ and $da/dt$ carries profound cosmological implications that we will discuss, regarding (i) the nature of late-time acceleration; (ii) a resolution to the horizon problem; (iii) Kolb's coasting universe model [Astrophys. J. 344, 543 (1989)]; (iv) a generalized cosmological principle into the time domain; and (v) a novel conformally flat metric applicable to cosmology. This newfound kinematic $c\propto da/dt$ relation represents a stringent requirement that any viable dynamical model of cosmology must satisfy, a requirement that the $\Lambda$CDM model does not fulfill. Thus, our paper delivers the clearest and most decisive evidence to date that challenges the standard $\Lambda$CDM paradigm of cosmology and calls for variable-$c$ modifications to General Relativity.</description>

Abstract: Timelike Liouville field theory (also known as imaginary Liouville theory or imaginary Gaussian multiplicative chaos) is expected to describe two-dimensional quantum gravity in a positive-curvature regime, but its path integral is not a probability measure and rigorous exact computations are currently available only in the charge-neutral (integer screening) case. In this paper we show that at the special coupling $b=1/\sqrt{2}$, the Coulomb-gas expansion of the timelike path integral becomes explicitly computable beyond charge neutrality. The reason is that the $n$-fold integrals generated by the interaction acquire a Vandermonde/determinantal structure at $b=1/\sqrt{2}$, which allows exact evaluation in terms of classical special functions. We derive Mellin-Barnes type representations (involving the Barnes $G$-function and, in a three-point case, Gauss hypergeometric functions) for the zero- and one-point functions, for an antipodal two-point function, and for a three-point function with a resonant insertion $\alpha_2=b$. We then address the subtle zero-mode integration: after a Gaussian regularization we obtain an explicit renormalized partition function $C(1/\sqrt{2},\mu)=e(4\pi\sqrt2 \mu)^{-1}$, identify distributional limits in the physically relevant regime $\alpha_j=\frac{1}{2}Q+\mathrm{i} P_j$, and compare with the Hankel-contour prescription recently proposed in the physics literature. These results provide the first rigorously controlled family of exact calculations in timelike Liouville theory outside charge neutrality.</description>

      <title>Detection of Gravitational Anomaly at Low Acceleration from a Highest-quality Sample of 36 Wide Binaries with Accurate 3D Velocities</title>

Abstract: We set out to accurately measure gravity in the low-acceleration range $(10^{-11},10^{-9})$ m s$^{-2}$ from 3D motions of isolated wide binary stars. Gaia DR3 provides precise measurements of the four sky-plane components of the 3D relative displacement and velocity ($\mathbf{r}, \mathbf{v}$) for a wide binary, but not comparably precise line-of-sight (radial) separation and relative velocity $v_{r}$. Based on our new observations and the public databases/publications, we assemble a sample of 36 nearby (distance $&lt;150$pc) wide binaries in the low-acceleration regime with accurate values of $v_{r}$ (uncertainty $&lt; 100$ m s$^{-1}$). Kinematic contaminants such as undetected stellar companions are well under control using various observational diagnostics such as Gaia's ruwe parameter, the color-magnitude diagram, multi-epoch observations of radial velocities, Speckle interferometric follow-up observations, and requiring Hipparcos-Gaia proper motion consistency. For the parameter $\Gamma \equiv \log_{10}\sqrt{\gamma}$ with $\gamma \equiv G/G_{\rm N}$ (where $G$ is a parameter generalizing Newton's constant $G_{\rm N}$ in elliptical orbits), we find $\Gamma=0.102_{-0.021}^{+0.023}$, inconsistent with standard gravity at $4.9\sigma$, giving a gravity boost factor of $\gamma=1.600_{-0.141}^{+0.171}$. Four wide binaries have 3D relative velocities exceeding their estimated Newtonian escape velocities with $1&lt;v_{\rm obs}/v_{\rm escN}\le1.2$. These systems are unlikely to be chance associations and are expected in a nonstandard paradigm such as Milgromian dynamics (MOND). The hypothesis that Newtonian gravity can be extrapolated to the low-acceleration limit is falsified by this independent study with accurate 3D velocities. Future radial velocity monitoring and Speckle interferometric imaging for larger samples will be useful to refine the present result.</description>

      <title>"It from Bit": The Hartle-Hawking state and quantum mechanics for de Sitter observers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05939v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The one-state statement for closed universes has sparked considerable discussion. In this paper, we examine its physical meaning in the context of the Hartle-Hawking state and de Sitter space. We argue that the one-state property of closed universes is fully compatible with the finite-dimensional quantum mechanics experienced by observers inside de Sitter space, and that this compatibility requires neither mixing of $\alpha$-sectors nor any modification of the rules of the gravitational path integral. The apparent tension is resolved by sharply distinguishing the baby-universe Hilbert space, namely the space of closed universes viewed from the outside, from the bulk Hilbert space that governs quantum mechanics for an observer inside a single de Sitter universe.
  The baby-universe Hilbert space, together with its commutative operator algebra, is not a quantum-mechanical Hilbert space: it is merely a mathematical repackaging of classical probability theory and carries no quantum-mechanical structure at all, a direct consequence of the one-state property of closed universes. Accordingly, attempting to formulate quantum mechanics directly on the baby-universe Hilbert space conflates two logically distinct structures and leads to physically incorrect conclusions. By contrast, the quantum mechanics experienced by an observer inside de Sitter space emerges from the classical statistics encoded in the baby-universe Hilbert space, providing a concrete realization of Wheeler's idea of "It from Bit." We demonstrate these features by completely solving a topological toy model of one-dimensional de Sitter spacetime. Along the way, we clarify the physical meaning of de Sitter entropy, showing that it corresponds to the coarse-grained entropy of the underlying state.</description>
