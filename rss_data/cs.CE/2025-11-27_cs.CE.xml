      <title>Numerical Optimization of Nozzle Shapes for Fused Deposition Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: In fused deposition modeling (FDM), the nozzle plays a critical role in enabling high printing speeds while maintaining precision. Despite its importance, most applications still rely on standard nozzle designs. This work investigates the influence of nozzle geometry on pressure loss inside the nozzle, a key factor in high-speed printing performance. Design/methodology/approach: We focus on optimizing the nozzle shape to minimize the pressure loss and establish a framework that allows both sim- ple angle-based optimization and more advanced spline-based parametrization. To model the polymer melt flow, we compare two constitutive descriptions commonly employed in the literature: a temperature-dependent, shear-thinning viscous model and an isothermal viscoelastic model. Findings: For the viscous model, the optimal half-opening angle exhibits a strong dependence on the feeding rate, with higher rates favoring half-opening angles near 30{\deg}, whereas lower rates are more efficient at larger angles. In con- trast, the viscoelastic model predicts a weaker dependence of the optimal angle on the feeding rate. For both models, spline-based parametrization yields only marginal improvements over angle optimization in terms of reducing pressure loss. Originality/value: This paper presents a comparative study of FDM nozzle shape optimization using different simulation models. We introduce a flexible optimization framework that accommodates both simple and advanced geomet- ric parametrizations. The results highlight the impact of model choice on the optimal nozzle geometry and provide support for improving nozzle design in high-speed printing applications.</description>

      <title>Going with the Speed of Sound: Pushing Neural Surrogates into Highly-turbulent Transonic Regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The widespread use of neural surrogates in automotive aerodynamics, enabled by datasets such as DrivAerML and DrivAerNet++, has primarily focused on bluff-body flows with large wakes. Extending these methods to aerospace, particularly in the transonic regime, remains challenging due to the high level of non-linearity of compressible flows and 3D effects such as wingtip vortices. Existing aerospace datasets predominantly focus on 2D airfoils, neglecting these critical 3D phenomena. To address this gap, we present a new dataset of CFD simulations for 3D wings in the transonic regime. The dataset comprises volumetric and surface-level fields for around $30,000$ samples with unique geometry and inflow conditions. This allows computation of lift and drag coefficients, providing a foundation for data-driven aerodynamic optimization of the drag-lift Pareto front. We evaluate several state-of-the-art neural surrogates on our dataset, including Transolver and AB-UPT, focusing on their out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization over geometry and inflow variations. AB-UPT demonstrates strong performance for transonic flowfields and reproduces physically consistent drag-lift Pareto fronts even for unseen wing configurations. Our results demonstrate that AB-UPT can approximate drag-lift Pareto fronts for unseen geometries, highlighting its potential as an efficient and effective tool for rapid aerodynamic design exploration. To facilitate future research, we open-source our dataset at https://huggingface.co/datasets/EmmiAI/Emmi-Wing.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Wildfire Spread Prediction Using an Autoregressive Conditional Generative Adversarial Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Climate change has intensified the frequency and severity of wildfires, making rapid and accurate prediction of fire spread essential for effective mitigation and response. Physics-based simulators such as FARSITE offer high-fidelity predictions but are computationally intensive, limiting their applicability in real-time decision-making, while existing deep learning models often yield overly smooth predictions that fail to capture the complex, nonlinear dynamics of wildfire propagation. This study proposes an autoregressive conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN) for probabilistic wildfire spread prediction. By formulating the prediction task as an autoregressive problem, the model learns sequential state transitions, ensuring long-term prediction stability. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CGAN-based model outperforms conventional deep learning models in both overall predictive accuracy and boundary delineation of fire perimeters. These results demonstrate that adversarial learning allows the model to capture the strong nonlinearity and uncertainty of wildfire spread, instead of simply fitting the pixel average. Furthermore, the autoregressive framework facilitates systematic temporal forecasting of wildfire evolution. The proposed CGAN-based autoregressive framework enhances both the accuracy and physical interpretability of wildfire spread prediction, offering a promising foundation for time-sensitive response and evacuation planning.</description>

      <title>Characterizing GPU Energy Usage in Exascale-Ready Portable Science Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05623v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We characterize the GPU energy usage of two widely adopted exascale-ready applications representing two classes of particle and mesh solvers: (i) QMCPACK, a quantum Monte Carlo package, and (ii) AMReXCastro, an adaptive mesh astrophysical code. We analyze power, temperature, utilization, and energy traces from double-/single (mixed)-precision benchmarks on NVIDIA's A100 and H100 and AMD's MI250X GPUs using queries in NVML and rocm_smi_lib, respectively. We explore application-specific metrics to provide insights on energy vs. performance trade-offs. Our results suggest that mixed-precision energy savings range between 6-25% on QMCPACK and 45% on AMReX-Castro. Also, we found gaps in the AMD tooling used on Frontier GPUs that need to be understood, while query resolutions on NVML have little variability between 1 ms-1 s. Overall, application level knowledge is crucial to define energy-cost/science-benefit opportunities for the codesign of future supercomputer architectures in the post-Moore era.</description>

      <title>Physics-Constrained Flow Matching: Sampling Generative Models with Hard Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04171v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep generative models have recently been applied to physical systems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs), offering scalable simulation and uncertainty-aware inference. However, enforcing physical constraints, such as conservation laws (linear and nonlinear) and physical consistencies, remains challenging. Existing methods often rely on soft penalties or architectural biases that fail to guarantee hard constraints. In this work, we propose Physics-Constrained Flow Matching (PCFM), a zero-shot inference framework that enforces arbitrary nonlinear constraints in pretrained flow-based generative models. PCFM continuously guides the sampling process through physics-based corrections applied to intermediate solution states, while remaining aligned with the learned flow and satisfying physical constraints. Empirically, PCFM outperforms both unconstrained and constrained baselines on a range of PDEs, including those with shocks, discontinuities, and sharp features, while ensuring exact constraint satisfaction at the final solution. Our method provides a flexible framework for enforcing hard constraints in both scientific and general-purpose generative models, especially in applications where constraint satisfaction is essential.</description>

      <title>Flow Matching Meets PDEs: A Unified Framework for Physics-Constrained Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08604v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative machine learning methods, such as diffusion models and flow matching, have shown great potential in modeling complex system behaviors and building efficient surrogate models. However, these methods typically learn the underlying physics implicitly from data. We propose Physics-Based Flow Matching (PBFM), a novel generative framework that explicitly embeds physical constraints, both PDE residuals and algebraic relations, into the flow matching objective. We also introduce temporal unrolling at training time that improves the accuracy of the final, noise-free sample prediction. Our method jointly minimizes the flow matching loss and the physics-based residual loss without requiring hyperparameter tuning of their relative weights. Additionally, we analyze the role of the minimum noise level, $\sigma_{\min}$, in the context of physical constraints and evaluate a stochastic sampling strategy that helps to reduce physical residuals. Through extensive benchmarks on three representative PDE problems, we show that our approach yields up to an $8\times$ more accurate physical residuals compared to FM, while clearly outperforming existing algorithms in terms of distributional accuracy. PBFM thus provides a principled and efficient framework for surrogate modeling, uncertainty quantification, and accelerated simulation in physics and engineering applications.</description>

      <title>Equivariant Flow Matching for Symmetry-Breaking Bifurcation Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03340v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bifurcation phenomena in nonlinear dynamical systems often lead to multiple coexisting stable solutions, particularly in the presence of symmetry breaking. Deterministic machine learning models struggle to capture this multiplicity, averaging over solutions and failing to represent lower-symmetry outcomes. In this work, we propose a generative framework based on flow matching to model the full probability distribution over bifurcation outcomes. Our method enables direct sampling of multiple valid solutions while preserving system symmetries through equivariant modeling. We introduce a symmetric matching strategy that aligns predicted and target outputs under group actions, allowing accurate learning in equivariant settings. We validate our approach on a range of systems, from toy models to complex physical problems such as buckling beams and the Allen-Cahn equation. Our results demonstrate that flow matching significantly outperforms non-probabilistic and variational methods in capturing multimodal distributions and symmetry-breaking bifurcations, offering a principled and scalable solution for modeling multistability in high-dimensional systems.</description>
