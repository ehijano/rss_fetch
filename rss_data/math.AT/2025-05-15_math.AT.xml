      <title>The Yang indices of Grassmannians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An elementary combinatorial technique for computing lower bounds for the Yang indices of real Stiefel manifolds and oriented real Grassmannians is described. It is used to show that the Yang index of $St(n,k)$, and consequently $G(n,k)$, is at least $n - k$. For odd $n$, the bound for $G(n,2)$ can be improved to $n-1$. These results lead to generalized Borsuk-Ulam theorems.</description>

      <title>From Persistence to Resilience: New Betti Numbers for Analyzing Robustness in Simplicial Complex Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Persistent homology is a fundamental tool in topological data analysis; however, it lacks methods to quantify the fragility or fineness of cycles, anticipate their formation or disappearance, or evaluate their stability beyond persistence. Furthermore, classical Betti numbers fail to capture key structural properties such as simplicial dimensions and higher-order adjacencies. In this work, we investigate the robustness of simplicial networks by analyzing cycle thickness and their resilience to failures or attacks. To address these limitations, we draw inspiration from persistent homology to introduce filtrations that model distinct simplicial elimination rules, leading to the definition of two novel Betti number families: thick and cohesive Betti numbers. These improved invariants capture richer structural information, enabling the measurement of the thickness of the links in the homology cycle and the assessment of the strength of their connections. This enhances and refines classical topological descriptors and our approach provides deeper insights into the structural dynamics of simplicial complexes and establishes a theoretical framework for assessing robustness in higher-order networks. Finally, we establish that the resilience of topological features to simplicial attacks can be systematically examined through biparameter persistence modules, wherein one parameter encodes the progression of the attack, and the other captures structural refinements informed by thickness or cohesiveness.</description>

      <title>Topology-driven identification of repetitions in multi-variate time series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many multi-variate time series obtained in the natural sciences and engineering possess a repetitive behavior, as for instance state-space trajectories of industrial machines in discrete automation. Recovering the times of recurrence from such a multi-variate time series is of a fundamental importance for many monitoring and control tasks. For a periodic time series this is equivalent to determining its period length. In this work we present a persistent homology framework to estimate recurrence times in multi-variate time series with different generalizations of cyclic behavior (periodic, repetitive, and recurring). To this end, we provide three specialized methods within our framework that are provably stable and validate them using real-world data, including a new benchmark dataset from an injection molding machine.</description>

      <title>Tropicalizations of locally symmetric varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper provides a rigorous study of tropicalizations of locally symmetric varieties. We give applications beyond tropical geometry, to the cohomology of moduli spaces as well as to the cohomology of arithmetic groups. We study two cases in detail: the case of level structures on the moduli space $\mathcal{A}_{g}$ of abelian varieties, and the special unitary case.</description>

      <title>A Stable Measure for Conditional Periodicity of Time Series using Persistent Homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02817v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a pair of time series, we study how the periodicity of one influences the periodicity of the other. There are several known methods to measure the similarity between a pair of time series, such as cross-correlation, coherence, cross-recurrence, and dynamic time warping. But we have yet to find any measures with theoretical stability results.
  Persistence homology has been utilized to construct a scoring function with theoretical guarantees of stability that quantifies the periodicity of a single univariate time series f1, denoted score(f1). Building on this concept, we propose a conditional periodicity score that quantifies the periodicity of one univariate time series f1 given another f2, denoted score(f1|f2), and derive theoretical stability results for the same. With the use of dimension reduction in mind, we prove a new stability result for score(f1|f2) under principal component analysis (PCA) when we use the projections of the time series embeddings onto their respective first K principal components. We show that the change in our score is bounded by a function of the eigenvalues corresponding to the remaining (unused) N-K principal components and hence is small when the first K principal components capture most of the variation in the time series embeddings. Finally we derive a lower bound on the minimum embedding dimension to use in our pipeline which guarantees that any two such embeddings give scores that are within a given epsilon of each other.
  We present a procedure for computing conditional periodicity scores and implement it on several pairs of synthetic signals. We experimentally compare our similarity measure to the most-similar statistical measure of cross-recurrence, and show the increased accuracy and stability of our score when predicting and measuring whether or not the periodicities of two time series are similar.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.05990v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a natural extension of the Novikov numbers for the basic cohomology class of a closed basic $1$-form on a proper Lie groupoid of finitely generated type. As an application, we prove corresponding Novikov inequalities for compact orbifolds.</description>
