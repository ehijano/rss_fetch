      <title>Pure Subtype Systems Are Type-Safe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the open problem of type safety in Hutchins' pure subtype systems (PSS). PSS (hereafter in the singular) harmoniously mixes terms and types, thus enabling a number of advanced language features that combine dependent types with higher-order subtyping. In PSS terms and types belong to the same kind (everything is a subtype) and the resulting theory is based on subtyping. Since PSS lacks strong normalisation, a type soundness result can only be stated in terms of type safety defined as progress and preservation. Proving type safety rests on the well-known problem of transitivity elimination in higher-order subtyping, where a key inversion lemma fails under the presence of intermediary steps in transitive subtype derivations. Despite his attempts, Hutchins failed to prove PSS type safety. We propose a reformulation of pure subtype systems with a more fine-grained notion of subtyping derivation that enables a direct proof of transitivity elimination, and thus of type safety. We also reformulate Hutchins' practical type-checking algorithm to our system and prove it correct.</description>

      <title>Approximate Relational Reasoning for Higher-Order Probabilistic Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Properties such as provable security and correctness for randomized programs are naturally expressed relationally as approximate equivalences. As a result, a number of relational program logics have been developed to reason about such approximate equivalences of probabilistic programs. However, existing approximate relational logics are mostly restricted to first-order programs without general state.
  In this paper we develop Approxis, a higher-order approximate relational separation logic for reasoning about approximate equivalence of programs written in an expressive ML-like language with discrete probabilistic sampling, higher-order functions, and higher-order state. The Approxis logic recasts the concept of error credits in the relational setting to reason about relational approximation, which allows for expressive notions of modularity and composition, a range of new approximate relational rules, and an internalization of a standard limiting argument for showing exact probabilistic equivalences by approximation. We also use Approxis to develop a logical relation model that quantifies over error credits, which can be used to prove exact contextual equivalence. We demonstrate the flexibility of our approach on a range of examples, including the PRP/PRF switching lemma, IND\$-CPA security of an encryption scheme, and a collection of rejection samplers. All of the results have been mechanized in the Coq proof assistant and the Iris separation logic framework.</description>

      <title>Strong Nominal Semantics for Fixed-Point Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nominal algebra includes $\alpha$-equality and freshness constraints on nominal terms endowed with a nominal set semantics that facilitates reasoning about languages with binders. Nominal unification is decidable and unitary, however, its extension with equational axioms such as Commutativity (which is finitary) is no longer finitary unless permutation fixed-point constraints are used. In this paper, we extend the notion of nominal algebra by introducing fixed-point constraints and provide a sound semantics using strong nominal sets. We show, by providing a counter-example, that the class of nominal sets is not a sound denotation for this extended nominal algebra. To recover soundness we propose two different formulations of nominal algebra, one obtained by restricting to a class of fixed-point contexts that are in direct correspondence with freshness contexts and another obtained by using a different set of derivation rules.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Isometric Reductions Between Infinite Strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the recursion-theoretic aspects of large-scale geometries of infinite strings, a subject initiated by Khoussainov and Takisaka (2017). We investigate several notions of quasi-isometric reductions between recursive infinite strings and prove various results on the equivalence classes of such reductions. The main result is the construction of two infinite recursive strings $\alpha$ and $\beta$ such that $\alpha$ is strictly quasi-isometrically reducible to $\beta$, but the reduction cannot be made recursive. This answers an open problem posed by Khoussainov and Takisaka.</description>

      <title>The Sticky Path to Expressive Querying: Decidability of Navigational Queries under Existential Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extensive research in the field of ontology-based query answering has led to the identification of numerous fragments of existential rules (also known as tuple-generating dependencies) that exhibit decidable answering of atomic and conjunctive queries. Motivated by the increased theoretical and practical interest in navigational queries, this paper considers the question for which of these fragments decidability of querying extends to regular path queries (RPQs). In fact, decidability of RPQs has recently been shown to generally hold for the comprehensive family of all fragments that come with the guarantee of universal models being reasonably well-shaped (that is, being of finite cliquewidth). Yet, for the second major family of fragments, known as finite unification sets (short: fus), which are based on first-order-rewritability, corresponding results have been largely elusive so far. We complete the picture by showing that RPQ answering over arbitrary fus rulesets is undecidable. On the positive side, we establish that the problem is decidable for the prominent fus subclass of sticky rulesets, with the caveat that a very mild extension of the RPQ formalism turns the problem undecidable again.</description>

      <title>TTT: A Temporal Refinement Heuristic for Tenuously Tractable Discrete Time Reachability Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reachable set computation is an important tool for analyzing control systems. Simulating a control system can show that the system is generally functioning as desired, but a formal tool like reachability analysis can provide a guarantee of correctness. For linear systems, reachability analysis is straightforward and fast, but as more complex components are added to the control system such as nonlinear dynamics or a neural network controller, reachability analysis may slow down or become overly conservative. To address these challenges, much literature has focused on spatial refinement, e.g., tuning the discretization of the input sets and intermediate reachable sets. However, this paper addresses a different dimension: temporal refinement. The basic idea of temporal refinement is to automatically choose when along the horizon of the reachability problem to execute slow symbolic queries which incur less approximation error versus fast concrete queries which incur more approximation error. Temporal refinement can be combined with other refinement approaches and offers an additional ``tuning knob'' with which to trade off tractability and tightness in approximate reachable set computation. Here, we introduce an automatic framework for performing temporal refinement and we demonstrate the effectiveness of this technique on computing approximate reachable sets for nonlinear systems with neural network control policies. We demonstrate the calculation of reachable sets of varying approximation error under varying computational budget and show that our algorithm is able to generate approximate reachable sets with a similar amount of error to the baseline approach in 20-70% less time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2205.04392v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show how to efficiently solve problems involving a quantitative measure, here called energy, as well as a qualitative acceptance condition, expressed as a B\"uchi or Parity objective, in finite weighted automata and in one-clock weighted timed automata. Solving the former problem and extracting the corresponding witness is our main contribution and is handled by a modified version of the Bellman-Ford algorithm interleaved with Couvreur's algorithm. The latter problem is handled via a reduction to the former relying on the corner-point abstraction. All our algorithms are freely available and implemented in a tool based on the open-source platforms TChecker and~Spot.</description>

      <title>From Thin Concurrent Games to Generalized Species of Structures (Extended Version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.01082v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two families of denotational models have emerged from the semantic analysis of linear logic: dynamic models, typically presented as game semantics, and static models, typically based on a category of relations. In this paper we introduce a formal bridge between a dynamic model and a static model: the model of thin concurrent games and strategies, based on event structures, and the model of generalized species of structures, based on distributors. A special focus of this paper is the two-dimensional nature of the dynamic-static relationship, which we formalize with double categories and bicategories.
  In the first part of the paper, we construct a symmetric monoidal oplax functor from linear concurrent strategies to distributors. We highlight two fundamental differences between the two models: the composition mechanism, and the representation of resource symmetries. In the second part of the paper, we adapt established methods from game semantics (visible strategies, payoff structure) to enforce a tighter connection between the two models. We obtain a cartesian closed pseudofunctor, which we exploit to shed new light on recent results in the theory of the lambda-calculus.</description>

      <title>Comparing Session Type Systems derived from Linear Logic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14763v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Session types are a typed approach to message-passing concurrency, where types describe sequences of intended exchanges over channels. Session type systems have been given strong logical foundations via Curry-Howard correspondences with linear logic, a resource-aware logic that naturally captures structured interactions. These logical foundations provide an elegant framework to specify and (statically) verify message-passing processes.
  In this paper, we rigorously compare different type systems for concurrency derived from the Curry-Howard correspondence between linear logic and session types. We address the main divide between these type systems: the classical and intuitionistic presentations of linear logic. Over the years, these presentations have given rise to separate research strands on logical foundations for concurrency; the differences between their derived type systems have only been addressed informally.
  To formally assess these differences, we develop $\pi\mathsf{ULL}$, a session type system that encompasses type systems derived from classical and intuitionistic interpretations of linear logic. Based on a fragment of Girard's Logic of Unity, $\pi\mathsf{ULL}$ provides a basic reference framework: we compare existing session type systems by characterizing fragments of $\pi\mathsf{ULL}$ that coincide with classical and intuitionistic formulations. We analyze the significance of our characterizations by considering the locality principle (enforced by intuitionistic interpretations but not by classical ones) and forms of process composition induced by the interpretations.</description>

      <title>Bisimulations and Logics for Higher-Dimensional Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01589v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Higher-dimensional automata (HDAs) are models of non-interleaving concurrency for analyzing concurrent systems. There is a rich literature that deals with bisimulations for concurrent systems, and some of them have been extended to HDAs. However, no logical characterizations of these relations are currently available for HDAs.
  In this work, we address this gap by introducing Ipomset modal logic, a Hennessy-Milner type logic over HDAs, and show that it characterizes Path-bisimulation, a variant of the standard ST-bisimulation. We also define a notion of Cell-bisimulation, using the open-maps framework of Joyal, Nielsen, and Winskel, and establish the relationship between these bisimulations (and also their "strong" variants, which take restrictions into account). In our work, we rely on the new categorical definition of HDAs as presheaves over concurrency lists and on track objects.</description>

      <title>Structure-Aware Computing By Partial Quantifier Elimination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05928v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By structure-aware computing (SAC) we mean computing that is formula-specific i.e., takes into account the structure of the formula at hand. Virtually all efficient algorithms of hardware verification employ some form of SAC. We relate SAC to $\mathit{partial}$ $\mathit{quantifier}$ $\mathit{elimination}$ (PQE). The latter is a generalization of regular quantifier elimination where one can take a $\mathit{part}$ of the formula out of the scope of quantifiers. The objective of this paper is to emphasize the significance of studying PQE for enhancing the $\mathit{existing}$ methods of SAC and creating $\mathit{new}$ ones. First, we show that interpolation (that can be viewed as an instance of SAC) is a special case of PQE. Then we describe application of SAC by PQE to three different problems of hardware verification: property generation, equivalence checking and model checking. Besides, we discuss using SAC by PQE for SAT solving.</description>

      <title>QBF Merge Resolution is powerful but unnatural</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.13428v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Merge Resolution proof system (M-Res) for QBFs, proposed by Beyersdorff et al. in 2019, explicitly builds partial strategies inside refutations. The original motivation for this approach was to overcome the limitations encountered in long-distance Q-Resolution proof system (LD-Q-Res), where the syntactic side-conditions, while prohibiting all unsound resolutions, also end up prohibiting some sound resolutions. However, while the advantage of M-Res over many other resolution-based QBF proof systems was already demonstrated, a comparison with LD-Q-Res itself had remained open. In this paper, we settle this question. We show that M-Res has an exponential advantage over not only LD-Q-Res, but even over LQU$^+$-Res and IRM, the most powerful among currently known resolution-based QBF proof systems. Combining this with results from Beyersdorff et al. 2020, we conclude that M-Res is incomparable with LQU-Res and LQU$^+$-Res.
  Our proof method reveals two additional and curious features about M-Res: (i) M-Res is not closed under restrictions, and is hence not a natural proof system, and (ii) weakening axiom clauses with existential variables provably yields an exponential advantage over M-Res without weakening. We further show that in the context of regular derivations, weakening axiom clauses with universal variables provably yields an exponential advantage over M-Res without weakening. These results suggest that M-Res is better used with weakening, though whether M-Res with weakening is closed under restrictions remains open. We note that even with weakening, M-Res continues to be simulated by eFrege $+$ $\forall$red (the simulation of ordinary M-Res was shown recently by Chew and Slivovsky).</description>

      <title>Small unsatisfiable $k$-CNFs with bounded literal occurrence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16149v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We obtain the smallest unsatisfiable formulas in subclasses of $k$-CNF (exactly $k$ distinct literals per clause) with bounded variable or literal occurrences. Smaller unsatisfiable formulas of this type translate into stronger inapproximability results for MaxSAT in the considered formula class. Our results cover subclasses of 3-CNF and 4-CNF; in all subclasses of 3-CNF we considered we were able to determine the smallest size of an unsatisfiable formula; in the case of 4-CNF with at most 5 occurrences per variable we decreased the size of the smallest known unsatisfiable formula. Our methods combine theoretical arguments and symmetry-breaking exhaustive search based on SAT Modulo Symmetries (SMS), a recent framework for isomorph-free SAT-based graph generation. To this end, and as a standalone result of independent interest, we show how to encode formulas as graphs efficiently for SMS.</description>

      <title>LLM-ARC: Enhancing LLMs with an Automated Reasoning Critic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17663v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce LLM-ARC, a neuro-symbolic framework designed to enhance the logical reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), by combining them with an Automated Reasoning Critic (ARC). LLM-ARC employs an Actor-Critic method where the LLM Actor generates declarative logic programs along with tests for semantic correctness, while the Automated Reasoning Critic evaluates the code, runs the tests and provides feedback on test failures for iterative refinement. Implemented using Answer Set Programming (ASP), LLM-ARC achieves a new state-of-the-art accuracy of 88.32% on the FOLIO benchmark which tests complex logical reasoning capabilities. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements over LLM-only baselines, highlighting the importance of logic test generation and iterative self-refinement. We achieve our best result using a fully automated self-supervised training loop where the Actor is trained on end-to-end dialog traces with Critic feedback. We discuss potential enhancements and provide a detailed error analysis, showcasing the robustness and efficacy of LLM-ARC for complex natural language reasoning tasks.</description>
