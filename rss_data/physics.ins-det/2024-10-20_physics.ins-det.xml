      <title>A multi-detector neutral helium atom microscope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scanning helium microscopy (SHeM) is an emerging technique that uses a beam of neutral atoms to image and analyse surfaces. The low energies ($\sim$64 meV) and completely non-destructive nature of the probe particles provide exceptional sensitivity for studying delicate samples and thin devices, including 2D materials. To date, around five such instruments have been constructed and are described in the literature. All represent the first attempts at SHeM construction in different laboratories, and use a single detection device. Here, we describe our second generation microscope, which is the first to offer multi-detector capabilities. The new instrument builds on recent research into SHeM optimisation and incorporates many improved design features over our previous instrument. We present measurements that highlight some of the unique capabilities the instrument provides, including 3D surface profiling, alternative imaging modes, and simultaneous acquisition of images from a mixed species beam.</description>

      <title>Comparative Performance Analysis of Crystals in Total-Body PET Scanners: Monte-Carlo Simulation Study with Different Materials and Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Total-Body PET (TB-PET) scanners represent a significant advancement in medical diagnostics, exemplified by the uEXPLORER, the world's first TB-PET system with an axial span of 194 cm, which exhibits exceptional sensitivity and spatial resolution. This study employs the Monte Carlo simulation toolkit Geant4 to evaluate various configurations and materials of detector crystals. We concentrate on three critical parameters: sensitivity, intrinsic coincidence time resolution (CTR), and energy resolution across three crystal designs: 1)standard LYSO crystals as the baseline; 2)0.1% Mg, 1% Ce doped $Gd_3Al_2Ga_3O_{12}$ (Mg,Ce:GAGG) as an alternative material; and 3)pyramid-shaped LYSO crystals, which maintain the same dimensions as the standard LYSO. The research is grounded in the geometric configuration of the uEXPLORER. Our findings reveal that pyramid-shaped LYSO crystals exhibit superior performance, achieving an impressive CTR of 42 ps. In contrast, PET detectors utilizing doped GAGG crystals demonstrate a 6% reduction in intrinsic CTR compared to LYSO. However, Mg,Ce:GAGG crystals surpass LYSO in energy resolution by 25%, while cuboidal LYSO crystals achieve approximately 37% greater sensitivity than their Mg,Ce:GAGG counterparts. These results underscore the impact of different crystal materials and geometries on PET scanner performance, emphasizing the trade-offs among sensitivity, coincidence time resolution (CTR), and energy resolution. Such insights are pivotal for informing the design of future TB-PET systems.</description>

      <title>On the Influence of Parallax Effects in Thick Silicon Sensors in Coherent Diffraction Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structure determination is a key application of XFELs and 4th generation synchrotron sources, particularly using the coherent and pulsed X-ray radiation from X-ray free-electron lasers (XFEL). Scientific interest focuses on understanding the physical, biological, and chemical properties of samples at the nanometer scale. The X-rays from XFELs enable Coherent X-ray Diffraction Imaging (CXDI), where coherent X-rays irradiate a sample, and a far-field diffraction pattern is captured by an imaging detector. By the nature of the underlying physics, the resolution, at which the sample can be probed with the CXDI technique, is limited by the wavelength of the X-ray radiation and the exposure time if a detector can record the diffraction pattern to very large scattering angles. The resolution that can be achieved under real experimental conditions, depends strongly on additional parameters. The Shannon pixel size, linked to the detector resolution, the coherent dose that can be deposited in the sample without changing its structure, the image contrast, and the signal-to-noise ratio of the detected scattered radiation at high $q$, i.e. at high scattering angles $2\Theta$, have a strong influence on the resolution. The signal-to-noise ratio at high $q$ defines the "effective" maximum solid angle in a specific experiment setup up to which a detector can efficiently detect a signal and in consequence determines the achievable resolution. The image contrast defines how well bright image features can be distinguished from dark ones. We present the preliminary results of our study on the influence of the PSF on SNR, image contrast, position resolution, and achievable sample resolution for different pixel sizes.</description>

      <title>On the Applicability Ranges of Tc Formulas for Proximity-Coupled Thin SN and SS Bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This brief note revisits the well-established $T_c$ formulas for proximity-coupled thin superconductor-normal conductor (SN) and superconductor-superconductor (SS) bilayers, highlighting their relationships and clarifying their ranges of applicability. Since these formulas are often misapplied in practical contexts, this note provides guidance for their correct use in experimental and applied settings. For SN bilayers, McMillan's formula is recommended for its broad applicability, with its SS counterpart offering similar reliability.</description>

      <title>The application of Hough transform for fast interaction vertex position estimation in heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Track reconstruction in high-multiplicity events, such as heavy-ion collisions at LHC, is a difficult and resource-demanding process. A priori knowledge of the collision vertex position would allow discarding non-viable track seeds, reducing the overall computing requirements for the track reconstruction. The method proposed in this note uses the Hough transform for the estimation of the interaction vertex position without the necessity to reconstruct the tracks first. It offers admissible resolution with linear scaling of numerical complexity with the track multiplicity.</description>

      <title>TCAD Parameters for 4H-SiC: A Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06798v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we review the models and their parameters to describe the relative permittivity, bandgap, impact ionization, mobility, charge carrier recombination/effective masses and incomplete dopand ionization of 4H silicon carbide in computer simulations. We aim to lower the entrance barrier for newcomers and provide a critical evaluation of the status quo to identify shortcomings and guide future research. The review reveals a rich set of often diverging values in literature based on a variety of calculation and measurement methods. Although research for all the selected parameters is still active, we show that sometimes old values or those determined for other kinds of silicon carbide are commonly used.</description>
