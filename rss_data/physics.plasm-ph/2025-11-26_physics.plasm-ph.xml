      <title>Investigation of Inverse Bremsstrahlung Heating Driven by Broadband Lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Broadband lasers have become a key strategy for mitigating laser plasma instabilities in inertial confinement fusion, yet their impact on collisional inverse bremsstrahlung (IB) heating remains unclear. Using one-dimensional collisional particle-in-cell simulations, we systematically examine the effect of bandwidth-induced temporal incoherence on IB absorption in Au plasmas. The simulations are first benchmarked against classical absorption theory, verifying that the implemented Coulomb collision model accurately reproduces the theoretical IB heating rate. A direct comparison of the electron temperature evolution in the broadband and monochromatic cases shows that, although spectral broadening introduces transient picosecond-scale oscillations in the heating rate driven by stochastic intensity fluctuations, the long-term averaged heating and net IB absorption remain essentially unchanged.</description>

      <title>Collisionless Shocks Mediated by Shear-Flow Magnetic Fields in Ultraintense-Laser-Produced Counter-Streaming Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation of ion-Weibel-mediated collisionless shocks (IW-CSs) in ultraintense-laser-produced counter-streaming plasmas is investigated using particle-in-cell simulations. Analysis of the underlying microphysics reveals that a shear-flow ion-Weibel instability generates magnetic fields, which isotropize the incoming flow and mediate shock formation. An analytical expression for the shear-flow magnetic field is derived, and a scaling law relating the magnetic field amplitude to the laser intensity is established. This mechanism reduces the shock formation time and the required laser energy by three and two orders of magnitude, respectively, compared to high-power laser experiments, making it feasible to produce IW-CSs using existing multi-kilojoule, picosecond ultraintense laser facilities.</description>

      <title>The PLUTO Code on GPUs: A First Look at Eulerian MHD Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present preliminary performance results of gPLUTO, the new GPU-optimized implementation of the PLUTO code for computational plasma astrophysics. Like its predecessor, gPLUTO employs a finite-volume formulation to numerically solve the equations of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) in multiple spatial dimensions. Still, this new implementation is a complete rewrite in C++ and leverages the OpenACC programming model to achieve acceleration on NVIDIA GPUs. While a more comprehensive description of the code and its several other modules will be presented in a future paper, here we focus on some preparatory results that demonstrate the code potential and performance on pre exa-scale parallel architectures.</description>

      <title>Microphysical boundary condition for the electron kinetics of a plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive and implement a suitable boundary condition for the kinetic description of the electrons inside a plasma, which takes into account microphysical processes inside the wall. It is based on the surface scattering kernel, which describes the scattering cascade of the electron in the solid and the excitation of secondary electrons. The resulting boundary condition is inelastic, angle- and energy-dependent. The implementation for a Boltzmann equation solved by a Legendre polynomial expansion method is presented, elucidating the modest additional computational cost of the new boundary condition. Results, indicating the influence of the inelasticity, are shown for the example of a silicon wall facing argon, helium and oxygen plasmas, but the described construction is also valid for other materials. An effective reflection coefficient is defined to compare the results with previously used boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Diffusion for Fusion: Designing Stellarators with Generative AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stellarators are a prospective class of fusion-based power plants that confine a hot plasma with three-dimensional magnetic fields. Typically framed as a PDE-constrained optimization problem, stellarator design is a time-consuming process that can take hours to solve on a computing cluster. Developing fast methods for designing stellarators is crucial for advancing fusion research. Given the recent development of large datasets of optimized stellarators, machine learning approaches have emerged as a potential candidate. Motivated by this, we present an open inverse problem to the machine learning community: to rapidly generate high-quality stellarator designs which have a set of desirable characteristics. As a case study in the problem space, we train a conditional diffusion model on data from the QUASR database to generate quasisymmetric stellarator designs with desirable characteristics (aspect ratio and mean rotational transform). The diffusion model is applied to design stellarators with characteristics not seen during training. We provide evaluation protocols and show that many of the generated stellarators exhibit solid performance: less than 5% deviation from quasisymmetry and the target characteristics. The modest deviation from quasisymmetry highlights an opportunity to reach the sub 1% target. Beyond the case study, we share multiple promising avenues for generative modeling to advance stellarator design.</description>

      <title>Direct Optimization of Fast-Ion Confinement in Stellarators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.11369v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Confining energetic ions such as alpha particles is a prime concern in the design of stellarators. However, directly measuring alpha confinement through numerical simulation of guiding-center trajectories has been considered to be too computationally expensive and noisy to include in the design loop, and instead has been most often used only as a tool to assess stellarator designs post hoc. In its place, proxy metrics, simplified measures of confinement, have often been used to design configurations because they are computationally more tractable and have been shown to be effective. Despite the success of proxies, it is unclear what is being sacrificed by using them to design the device rather than relying on direct trajectory calculations. In this study, we optimize stellarator designs for improved alpha particle confinement without the use of proxy metrics. In particular, we numerically optimize an objective function that measures alpha particle losses by simulating alpha particle trajectories. While this method is computationally expensive, we find that it can be used successfully to generate configurations with low losses.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Jets and Winds in Radio-Identified Supermassive Black Hole Binary Candidates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02301v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Supermassive black hole binary systems (SMBHBs) are thought to emit the recently discovered nHz gravitational wave background; however, not a single individual nHz source has been confirmed to date. Long-term radio-monitoring at the Owens Valley Radio Observatory has revealed two potential SMBHB candidates: blazars PKS 2131-021 and PKS J0805-0111. These sources show periodic flux density variations across the electromagnetic spectrum, signaling the presence of a good clock. To explain the emission, we propose a generalizable jet model, where a mildly relativistic wind creates an outward-moving helical channel, along which the ultra-relativistic jet propagates. The observed flux variation from the jet is mostly due to aberration. The emission at lower frequency arises at larger radius and its variation is consequently delayed, as observed. Our model reproduces the main observable features of both sources and can be applied to other sources as they are discovered. We make predictions for radio polarization, direct imaging, and emission line variation, which can be tested with forthcoming observations. Our results motivate future numerical simulations of jetted SMBHB systems and have implications for the fueling, structure, and evolution of blazar jets.</description>
