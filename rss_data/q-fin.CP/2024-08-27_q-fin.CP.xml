      <title>Unveiling Nonlinear Dynamics in Catastrophe Bond Pricing: A Machine Learning Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00697v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores the implications of using machine learning models in the pricing of catastrophe (CAT) bonds. By integrating advanced machine learning techniques, our approach uncovers nonlinear relationships and complex interactions between key risk factors and CAT bond spreads -- dynamics that are often overlooked by traditional linear regression models. Using primary market CAT bond transaction records between January 1999 and March 2021, our findings demonstrate that machine learning models not only enhance the accuracy of CAT bond pricing but also provide a deeper understanding of how various risk factors interact and influence bond prices in a nonlinear way. These findings suggest that investors and issuers can benefit from incorporating machine learning to better capture the intricate interplay between risk factors when pricing CAT bonds. The results also highlight the potential for machine learning models to refine our understanding of asset pricing in markets characterized by complex risk structures.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Black-Scholes Delta Hedging via Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19367v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a deep delta hedging framework for options, utilizing neural networks to learn the residuals between the hedging function and the implied Black-Scholes delta. This approach leverages the smoother properties of these residuals, enhancing deep learning performance. Utilizing ten years of daily S&amp;P 500 index option data, our empirical analysis demonstrates that learning the residuals, using the mean squared one-step hedging error as the loss function, significantly improves hedging performance over directly learning the hedging function, often by more than 100%. Adding input features when learning the residuals enhances hedging performance more for puts than calls, with market sentiment being less crucial. Furthermore, learning the residuals with three years of data matches the hedging performance of directly learning with ten years of data, proving that our method demands less data.</description>

      <title>UAMM: Price-oracle based Automated Market Maker</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.06375v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automated market makers (AMMs) are pricing mechanisms utilized by decentralized exchanges (DEX). Traditional AMM approaches are constrained by pricing solely based on their own liquidity pool, without consideration of external markets or risk management for liquidity providers. In this paper, we propose a new approach known as UBET AMM (UAMM), which calculates prices by considering external market prices and the impermanent loss of the liquidity pool. Despite relying on external market prices, our method maintains the desired properties of a constant product curve when computing slippages. The key element of UAMM is determining the appropriate slippage amount based on the desired target balance, which encourages the liquidity pool to minimize impermanent loss. We demonstrate that our approach eliminates arbitrage opportunities when external market prices are efficient.</description>

      <title>Trading Devil Final: Backdoor attack via Stock market and Bayesian Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14573v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since the advent of generative artificial intelligence, every company and researcher has been rushing to develop their own generative models, whether commercial or not. Given the large number of users of these powerful new tools, there is currently no intrinsically verifiable way to explain from the ground up what happens when LLMs (large language models) learn. For example, those based on automatic speech recognition systems, which have to rely on huge and astronomical amounts of data collected from all over the web to produce fast and efficient results, In this article, we develop a backdoor attack called MarketBackFinal 2.0, based on acoustic data poisoning, MarketBackFinal 2.0 is mainly based on modern stock market models. In order to show the possible vulnerabilities of speech-based transformers that may rely on LLMs.</description>
