      <title>Equilibrium Refinements Improve Subgame Solving in Imperfect-Information Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Subgame solving is a technique for scaling algorithms to large games by locally refining a precomputed blueprint strategy during gameplay. While straightforward in perfect-information games where search starts from the current state, subgame solving in imperfect-information games must account for hidden states and uncertainty about the opponent's past strategy. Gadget games were developed to ensure that the improved subgame strategy is robust against any possible opponent's strategy in a zero-sum game. Gadget games typically contain infinitely many Nash equilibria. We demonstrate that while these equilibria are equivalent in the gadget game, they yield vastly different performance in the full game, even when facing a rational opponent. We propose gadget game sequential equilibria as the preferred solution concept. We introduce modifications to the sequence-form linear program and counterfactual regret minimization that converge to these refined solutions with only mild additional computational cost. Additionally, we provide several new insights into the surprising superiority of the resolving gadget game over the max-margin gadget game. Our experiments compare different Nash equilibria of gadget games in several standard benchmark games, showing that our refined equilibria consistently outperform unrefined Nash equilibria, and can reduce the exploitability of the overall strategy by more than 50%</description>

      <title>Strategic AI in Cournot Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As artificial intelligence increasingly automates decision-making in competitive markets, understanding the resulting dynamics and ensuring fair market mechanisms is essential. We investigate the multi-faceted decision-making of large language models (LLMs) in oligopolistic Cournot markets, showing that LLMs not only grasp complex market dynamics--demonstrating their potential as effective economic planning agents--but also engage in sustained tacit collusion, driving prices up to 200% above Nash equilibrium levels. Our analysis examines LLM behavior across three dimensions-(1) decision type, (2) opponent strategies, and (3) market composition--revealing how these factors may shape the competitiveness of LLM-based decision-makers. Furthermore, we show that regulating a few dominant agents by enforcing best-response strategies effectively disrupts collusion and helps restore competitive pricing. Our findings identify potential concerns associated with AI integration in competitive market environments and provide regulatory policy recommendations for the era of automation.</description>

      <title>Truth-Revealing Participatory Budgeting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Participatory Budgeting (PB) is commonly studied from an axiomatic perspective, where the aim is to design procedurally fair and economically efficient rules for voters with full information regarding their preferences. In contrast, we take an epistemic perspective and consider a framework where PB projects have different levels of underlying quality, indicating how well the project will take effect, which cannot be directly observed before implementation. Agents with noisy information cast votes to aggregate their information, and aim to elect a high-quality set of projects. We evaluate the performance of common PB rules by measuring the expected utility of their outcomes, compared to the optimal set of projects. We find that the quality of approximation improves as the range of project costs shrinks. When projects have unit cost, these common rules can identify the ``best'' set with probability converging to 1. We also study whether strategic agents have incentives to honestly convey their information in the vote. We find that it happens only under very restrictive conditions. We also run numerical experiments to examine the performance of different rules empirically and support our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Distances Between Top-Truncated Elections of Different Sizes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The map of elections framework is a methodology for visualizing and analyzing election datasets. So far, the framework was restricted to elections that have equal numbers of candidates, equal numbers of voters, and where all the (ordinal) votes rank all the candidates. We extend it to the case of elections of different sizes, where the votes can be top-truncated. We use our results to present a visualization of a large fragment of the Preflib database.</description>

      <title>Credit Fairness: Online Fairness In Shared Resource Pools</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a setting in which a group of agents share resources that must be allocated among them in each discrete time period. Agents have time-varying demands and derive constant marginal utility from each unit of resource received up to their demand, with zero utility for any additional resources. In this setting, it is known that independently maximizing the minimum utility in each round satisfies sharing incentives (agents weakly prefer participating in the mechanism to not participating), strategyproofness (agents have no incentive to misreport their demands), and Pareto efficiency (Freeman et al. 2018). However, recent work (Vuppalapati et al. 2023) has shown that this max-min mechanism can lead to large disparities in the total resources received by agents, even when they have the same average demand. In this paper, we introduce credit fairness, a strengthening of sharing incentives that ensures agents who lend resources in early rounds are able to recoup them in later rounds. Credit fairness can be achieved in conjunction with either Pareto efficiency or strategyproofness, but not both. We propose a mechanism that is credit fair and Pareto efficient, and we evaluate its performance in a computational resource-sharing setting.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Multi-product Pricing: Diagonal Dominance, Nash Equilibrium, and Price of Anarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decentralized decision making in multi--product firms can lead to efficiency losses when autonomous decision makers fail to internalize cross--product demand interactions. This paper quantifies the magnitude of such losses by analyzing the Price of Anarchy in a pricing game in which each decision maker independently sets prices to maximize its own product--level revenue. We model demand using a linear system that captures both substitution and complementarity effects across products. We first establish existence and uniqueness of a pure--strategy Nash equilibrium under economically standard diagonal dominance conditions. Our main contribution is the derivation of a tight worst--case lower bound on the ratio between decentralized revenue and the optimal centralized revenue. We show that this efficiency loss is governed by a single scalar parameter, denoted by $\mu$, which measures the aggregate strength of cross--price effects relative to own--price sensitivities. In particular, we prove that the revenue ratio is bounded below by $4(1-\mu)/(2-\mu)^2$, and we demonstrate the tightness of this bound by constructing a symmetric market topology in which the bound is exactly attained. We further refine the analysis by providing an instance--exact characterization of efficiency loss based on the spectral properties of the demand interaction matrix. Together, these results offer a quantitative framework for assessing the trade--off between centralized pricing and decentralized autonomy in multi--product firms.</description>

      <title>Dicey Games: Shared Sources of Randomness in Distributed Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a 4-player version of Matching Pennies where a team of three players competes against the Devil. Each player simultaneously says "Heads" or "Tails". The team wins if all four choices match; otherwise the Devil wins. If all team players randomise independently, they win with probability 1/8; if all players share a common source of randomness, they win with probability 1/2. What happens when each pair of team players shares a source of randomness? Can the team do better than win with probability 1/4? The surprising (and nontrivial) answer is yes! We introduce Dicey Games, a formal framework motivated by the study of distributed systems with shared sources of randomness (of which the above example is a specific instance). We characterise the existence, representation and computational complexity of optimal strategies in Dicey Games, and we study the problem of allocating limited sources of randomness optimally within a team.</description>

      <title>Maps of Tournaments: Distances, Experiments, and Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We form a "map of tournaments" by adapting the map framework from the world of elections. By a tournament we mean a complete directed graph where the nodes are the players and an edge points from a winner of a game to the loser (with no ties allowed). A map is a set of tournaments represented as points on a 2D plane, so that their Euclidean distances resemble the distances computed according to a given measure. We identify useful distance measures, discuss ways of generating random tournaments (and compare them to several real-life ones), and show how the maps are helpful in visualizing experimental results (also for knockout tournaments).</description>

      <title>Stable Matching with Deviators and Conformists</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the fundamental Stable Marriage and Stable Roommates problems, there are inherent trade-offs between the size and stability of solutions. While in the former problem, a stable matching always exists and can be found efficiently using the celebrated Gale-Shapley algorithm, the existence of a stable matching is not guaranteed in the latter problem, but can be determined efficiently using Irving's algorithm. However, the computation of matchings that minimise the instability, either due to the presence of additional constraints on the size of the matching or due to restrictive preference cycles, gives rise to a collection of infamously intractable almost-stable matching problems. In practice, however, not every agent is able or likely to initiate deviations caused by blocking pairs. Suppose we knew, for example, due to a set of requirements or estimates based on historical data, which agents are likely to initiate deviations - the deviators - and which are likely to comply with whatever matching they are presented with - the conformists. Can we decide efficiently whether a matching exists in which no deviator is blocking, i.e., in which no deviator has an incentive to initiate a deviation? Furthermore, can we find matchings in which only a few deviators are blocking? We characterise the computational complexity of this question in bipartite and non-bipartite preference settings. Surprisingly, these problems prove computationally intractable in strong ways: for example, unlike in the classical setting, where every agent is considered a deviator, in this extension, we prove that it is NP-complete to decide whether a matching exists where no deviator is blocking. On the positive side, we identify polynomial-time and fixed-parameter tractable cases, providing novel algorithmics for multi-agent systems where stability cannot be fully guaranteed.</description>

      <title>Learning Real-Life Approval Elections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the independent approval model (IAM) for approval elections, where each candidate has its own approval probability and is approved independently of the other ones. This model generalizes, e.g., the impartial culture, the Hamming noise model, and the resampling model. We propose algorithms for learning IAMs and their mixtures from data, using either maximum likelihood estimation or Bayesian learning. We then apply these algorithms to a large set of elections from the Pabulib database. In particular, we find that single-component models are rarely sufficient to capture the complexity of real-life data, whereas their mixtures perform well.</description>

      <title>Winning Criteria for Open Games: A Game-Theoretic Approach to Prefix Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study two-player games with alternating moves played on infinite trees. Our main focus is on the case where the trees are full (regular) and the winning set is open (with respect to the product topology on the tree). Gale and Stewart showed that in this setting one of the players always has a winning strategy, though it is not known in advance which player. We present simple necessary conditions for the first player to have a winning strategy, and establish an equivalence between winning sets that guarantee a win for the first player and maximal prefix codes. Using this equivalence, we derive a necessary algebraic condition for winning, and exhibit a family of games for which this algebraic condition is in fact equivalent to winning. We introduce the concept of coverings, and show that by covering the graph with an infinite labeled tree corresponding to the free group, we can derive a simple trait of maximal prefix codes.</description>

      <title>DIML: Differentiable Inverse Mechanism Learning from Behaviors of Multi-Agent Learning Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study inverse mechanism learning: recovering an unknown incentive-generating mechanism from observed strategic interaction traces of self-interested learning agents. Unlike inverse game theory and multi-agent inverse reinforcement learning, which typically infer utility/reward parameters inside a structured mechanism, our target includes unstructured mechanism -- a (possibly neural) mapping from joint actions to per-agent payoffs. Unlike differentiable mechanism design, which optimizes mechanisms forward, we infer mechanisms from behavior in an observational setting. We propose DIML, a likelihood-based framework that differentiates through a model of multi-agent learning dynamics and uses the candidate mechanism to generate counterfactual payoffs needed to predict observed actions. We establish identifiability of payoff differences under a conditional logit response model and prove statistical consistency of maximum likelihood estimation under standard regularity conditions. We evaluate DIML with simulated interactions of learning agents across unstructured neural mechanisms, congestion tolling, public goods subsidies, and large-scale anonymous games. DIML reliably recovers identifiable incentive differences and supports counterfactual prediction, where its performance rivals tabular enumeration oracle in small environments and its convergence scales to large, hundred-participant environments. Code to reproduce our experiments is open-sourced.</description>

      <title>Topological traps in evolutionary games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.17821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How cooperation originates and persists among self-interested individuals is a central question in the social and behavioural sciences. In the canonical two-dimensional spatial Prisoner's Dilemma with unconditional imitation introduced by Nowak and May (1992), simulations on a Moore lattice show an abrupt drop in cooperation near the temptation $T\approx5/3$, yet even under these harsh conditions cooperative structures can still arise. However, the nucleation rates of these motifs, and their contribution along the full cooperation curve had not been quantified. Here we show, using large-scale Monte Carlo simulations combined with automatic cluster classification, that on the Moore lattice for $T\ge5/3$ residual cooperation is sustained exclusively by $3\times3$ (or larger) rectangular cooperator bricks, whereas on degree-8 random-regular graphs for $T\gtrsim1.5$ it is dominated by star-like motifs (1 hub + 8 leaves). Once the dynamics becomes nucleation limited, the macroscopic cooperation level is therefore governed by the statistics of a few exceptionally resilient shapes, rather than by many different cooperator motifs. Furthermore, we show that the lattice cooperation collapse near $T=5/3$ is kinetic rather than critical: the reduction in cooperation is not due to a loss of growth capacity of rectangular bricks, but to the progressive destabilisation of the subcritical motifs that dominate just below this threshold. Our results show that residual cooperation at high temptation is a rare-event nucleation phenomenon governed by a small set of topological traps, and highlight the value of motif-level analysis for explaining and engineering cooperation in spatial, social, and technological networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a variant of the synchronization game on finite deterministic automata. In this game, Alice chooses one input letter of an automaton $A$ on each of her moves while Bob may respond with an arbitrary finite word over the input alphabet of $A$; Alice wins if the word obtained by interleaving her letters with Bob's responses resets $A$. We prove that if Alice has a winning strategy in this game on $A$, then $A$ admits a reset word whose length is strictly smaller than the number of states of $A$. In contrast, for any $k\ge 1$, we exhibit automata with shortest reset-word length quadratic in the number of states, on which Alice nevertheless wins a version of the game in which Bob's responses are restricted to arbitrary words of length at most $k$. We provide polynomial-time algorithms for deciding the winner in various synchronization games, and we analyze the relationships between variants of synchronization games on fixed-size automata.</description>

      <title>Strategic Content Creation with Age of GenAI: To Share or Not to Share?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16358v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a game-theoretic framework examining strategic interactions between a platform and its content creators in the presence of AI-generated content. Our model's main novelty is in capturing creators' dual strategic decisions: The investment in content quality and their (possible) consent to share their content with the platform's GenAI, both of which significantly impact their utility. To incentivize creators, the platform strategically allocates a portion of its GenAI-driven revenue to creators who share their content. We focus on the class of full-sharing equilibrium profiles, in which all creators willingly share their content with the platform's GenAI system. Such equilibria are highly desirable both theoretically and practically. Our main technical contribution is formulating and efficiently solving a novel optimization problem that approximates the platform's optimal revenue subject to inducing a full-sharing equilibrium. A key aspect of our approach is identifying conditions under which full-sharing equilibria exist and a surprising connection to the Prisoner's Dilemma. Finally, our simulations demonstrate how revenue-allocation mechanisms affect creator utility and the platform's revenue.</description>

      <title>The Value Problem for Weighted Timed Games with Two Clocks is Undecidable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10550v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Value Problem for weighted timed games (WTGs) consists in determining, given a two-player weighted timed game with a reachability objective and a rational threshold, whether or not the value of the game exceeds the threshold. This problem was shown to be undecidable some ten years ago for WTGs making use of at least three clocks, and is known to be decidable for single-clock WTGs. In this paper, we establish undecidability for two-clock WTGs making use of non-negative weights, even in a time-bounded setting, closing the last remaining major gap in our algorithmic understanding of WTGs.</description>

      <title>{\epsilon}-Stationary Nash Equilibria in Multi-player Stochastic Graph Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15356v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A strategy profile in a multi-player game is a Nash equilibrium if no player can unilaterally deviate to achieve a strictly better payoff. A profile is an $\epsilon$-Nash equilibrium if no player can gain more than $\epsilon$ by unilaterally deviating from their strategy. In this work, we use $\epsilon$-Nash equilibria to approximate the computation of Nash equilibria. Specifically, we focus on turn-based, multiplayer stochastic games played on graphs, where players are restricted to stationary strategies -- strategies that use randomness but not memory.
  The problem of deciding the constrained existence of stationary Nash equilibria -- where each player's payoff must lie within a given interval -- is known to be $\exists\mathbb{R}$-complete in such a setting (Hansen and S{\o}lvsten, 2020). We extend this line of work to stationary $\epsilon$-Nash equilibria and present an algorithm that solves the following promise problem: given a game with a Nash equilibrium satisfying the constraints, compute an $\epsilon$-Nash equilibrium that $\epsilon$-satisfies those same constraints -- satisfies the constraints up to an $\epsilon$ additive error. Our algorithm runs in FNP^NP time.
  To achieve this, we first show that if a constrained Nash equilibrium exists, then one exists where the non-zero probabilities are at least an inverse of a double-exponential in the input. We further prove that such a strategy can be encoded using floating-point representations, as in the work of Frederiksen and Miltersen (2013), which finally gives us our FNP^NP algorithm.
  We further show that the decision version of the promise problem is NP-hard. Finally, we show a partial tightness result by proving a lower bound for such techniques: if a constrained Nash equilibrium exists, then there must be one that where the probabilities in the strategies are double-exponentially small.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00472v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce capital games, which generalize the definition of standard games to incorporate dynamics. In capital games, payoffs are in units of capital which are not assumed to be units of utility. The dynamics allow us to infer player utilities from their individual payoffs and linearizable capital dynamics under the assumption that players aim to maximize the time-average growth rate of their capital.</description>

      <title>Pay for The Second-Best Service: A Game-Theoretic Approach Against Dishonest LLM Providers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00847v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) through Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) induces a critical vulnerability: the potential for dishonest manipulation by service providers. This manipulation can manifest in various forms, such as secretly substituting a proclaimed high-performance model with a low-cost alternative, or inflating responses with meaningless tokens to increase billing. This work tackles the issue through the lens of algorithmic game theory and mechanism design. We are the first to propose a formal economic model for a realistic user-provider ecosystem, where a user can iteratively delegate $T$ queries to multiple model providers, and providers can engage in a range of strategic behaviors. As our central contribution, we prove that for a continuous strategy space and any $\epsilon\in(0,\frac12)$, there exists an approximate incentive-compatible mechanism with an additive approximation ratio of $O(T^{1-\epsilon}\log T)$, and a guaranteed quasi-linear second-best user utility. We also prove an impossibility result, stating that no mechanism can guarantee an expected user utility that is asymptotically better than our mechanism. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our mechanism in simulation experiments with real-world API settings.</description>

      <title>Computing Pure-Strategy Nash Equilibria in a Two-Party Policy Competition: Existence and Algorithmic Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22552v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We formulate two-party policy competition as a two-player non-cooperative game, generalizing Lin et al.'s work (2021). Each party selects a real-valued policy vector as its strategy from a compact subset of Euclidean space, and a voter's utility for a policy is given by the inner product with their preference vector. To capture the uncertainty in the competition, we assume that a policy's winning probability increases monotonically with its total utility across all voters, and we formalize this via an affine isotonic function. A player's payoff is defined as the expected utility received by its supporters. In this work, we first test and validate the isotonicity hypothesis through voting simulations. Next, we prove the existence of a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium (PSNE) in both one- and multi-dimensional settings. Although we construct a counterexample demonstrating the game's non-monotonicity, our experiments show that a decentralized gradient-based algorithm typically converges rapidly to an approximate PSNE. Finally, we present a grid-based search algorithm that finds an $\epsilon$-approximate PSNE of the game in time polynomial in the input size and $1/\epsilon$.</description>

      <title>Collective intelligence in science: direct elicitation of diverse information from experts with unknown information structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14047v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Suppose we need a deep collective analysis of an open scientific problem: there is a complex scientific hypothesis and a large online group of mutually unrelated experts with relevant private information of a diverse and unpredictable nature. This information may be results of experts' individual experiments, original reasoning of some of them, results of AI systems they use, etc. We propose a simple mechanism based on a self-resolving play-money prediction market entangled with a chat. We show that such a system can easily be brought to an equilibrium where participants directly share their private information on the hypothesis through the chat and trade as if the market were resolved in accordance with the truth of the hypothesis. This approach will lead to efficient aggregation of relevant information in a completely interpretable form even if the ground truth cannot be established and experts initially know nothing about each other and cannot perform complex Bayesian calculations. Finally, by rewarding the experts with some real assets proportionally to the play money they end up with, we can get an innovative way to fund large-scale collaborative studies of any type.</description>

      <title>On the Impact of the Utility in Semivalue-based Data Valuation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06574v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Semivalue-based data valuation uses cooperative-game theory intuitions to assign each data point a value reflecting its contribution to a downstream task. Still, those values depend on the practitioner's choice of utility, raising the question: How robust is semivalue-based data valuation to changes in the utility? This issue is critical when the utility is set as a trade-off between several criteria and when practitioners must select among multiple equally valid utilities. We address it by introducing the notion of a dataset's spatial signature: given a semivalue, we embed each data point into a lower-dimensional space where any utility becomes a linear functional, making the data valuation framework amenable to a simpler geometric picture. Building on this, we propose a practical methodology centered on an explicit robustness metric that informs practitioners whether and by how much their data valuation results will shift as the utility changes. We validate this approach across diverse datasets and semivalues, demonstrating strong agreement with rank-correlation analyses and offering analytical insight into how choosing a semivalue can amplify or diminish robustness.</description>

      <title>Strategic Tradeoffs Between Humans and AI in Multi-Agent Bargaining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09071v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Markets increasingly accommodate large language models (LLMs) as autonomous decision-making agents. As this transition occurs, it becomes critical to evaluate how these agents behave relative to their human and task-specific statistical predecessors. In this work, we present results from an empirical study comparing humans (N=216), multiple frontier LLMs, and customized Bayesian agents in dynamic multi-player bargaining games under identical conditions. Bayesian agents extract the highest surplus with aggressive trade proposals that are frequently rejected. Humans and LLMs achieve comparable aggregate surplus within their groups, but exhibit different trading strategies. LLMs favor conservative, concessionary proposals that are usually accepted by other LLMs, while humans propose trades that are consistent with fairness norms but are more likely to be rejected. These findings highlight that performance parity -- a common benchmark in agent evaluation -- can mask substantive procedural differences in how LLMs behave in complex multi-agent interactions.</description>

      <title>Data Valuation for LLM Fine-Tuning: Efficient Shapley Value Approximation via Language Model Arithmetic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15765v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data is a critical asset for training large language models (LLMs), alongside compute resources and skilled workers. While some training data is publicly available, substantial investment is required to generate proprietary datasets, such as human preference annotations or to curate new ones from existing sources. As larger datasets generally yield better model performance, two natural questions arise. First, how can data owners make informed decisions about curation strategies and data sources investment? Second, how can multiple data owners collaboratively pool their resources to train superior models while fairly distributing the benefits? This problem, data valuation, which is not specific to large language models, has been addressed by the machine learning community through the lens of cooperative game theory, with the Shapley value being the prevalent solution concept. However, computing Shapley values is notoriously expensive for data valuation, typically requiring numerous model retrainings, which can become prohibitive for large machine learning models. In this work, we demonstrate that this computational challenge is dramatically simplified for LLMs trained with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). We show how the specific mathematical structure of DPO enables scalable Shapley value computation. We believe this observation unlocks many applications at the intersection of data valuation and large language models.</description>

      <title>The incompatibility of the Condorcet winner and loser criteria with positive involvement and resolvability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10506v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that there is no preferential voting method satisfying the Condorcet winner and loser criteria, positive involvement (if a candidate $x$ wins in an initial preference profile, then adding a voter who ranks $x$ uniquely first cannot cause $x$ to lose), and $n$-voter resolvability (if $x$ initially ties for winning, then $x$ can be made the unique winner by adding some set of up to $n$ voters). This impossibility theorem holds for any positive integer $n$. In a previous note, we proved an analogous result assuming an additional axiom of ordinal margin invariance, which we now show is unnecessary for an impossibility theorem, at least if the desired voting method is defined for five-candidate elections.</description>
