      <title>Distinguishing symmetric digraphs by proper arc-colourings of type I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A symmetric digraph $\overleftrightarrow{G}$ is obtained from a simple graph $G$ by replacing each edge $uv$ with a pair of opposite arcs $\vec{uv}$, $\overrightarrow{vu}$. An arc-colouring $c$ of a digraph $\overleftrightarrow{G}$ is distinguishing if the only automorphism of $\overleftrightarrow{G}$ preserving the colouring $c$ is the identity. Behzad introduced the proper arc-colouring of type I as an arc-colouring such that any two consecutive arcs $\overrightarrow{uv}$, $\overrightarrow{vw}$ have distinct colours. We establish an optimal upper bound $\lceil 2\sqrt{\Delta(G)}\rceil$ for the least number of colours in a distinguishing proper colouring of type I of a connected symmetric digraph $\overleftrightarrow{G}$. Furthermore, we prove that the same upper bound $\lceil 2\sqrt{\Delta(G)}\rceil$ is optimal for another type of proper colouring of $\overleftrightarrow{G}$, when only monochromatic 2-paths are forbidden.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that for any two graphs $G$ and $H$, the edges of $G$ can be strongly separated by a collection of linearly many subdivisions of $H$ and single edges. This confirms a conjecture of Botler and Naia.</description>

      <title>What is and is not inside a Cayley graph?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note we show that there is a cubic graph of girth $5$ that is not a subgraph of any minimal Cayley graph. On the other hand, we show that any Generalized Petersen Graph $G(n,k)$ with $\gcd(n,k)=1$ is an induced subgraph of a minimal Cayley graph. These results give insights into two comments of L\'aszl\'o Babai in [L. Babai, \emph{Automorphism groups, isomorphism, reconstruction}. Graham, R. L. (ed.) et al., Handbook of combinatorics. Vol. 1-2, 1994].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a random subset of a finite group $G$ of cardinality $N$, we consider the VC-dimension of the family of its translates (equivalently the VC-dimension of a random Cayley graph) and prove a law of large numbers as $N\rightarrow\infty$. This answers a question of McDonald--Sahay--Wyman.</description>

      <title>Neighbor Connectivity of Undirected Toroidal Meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine the neighbor connectivity, denoted as $\kappa_{NB}$, of the undirected toroidal mesh $C(d_1,d_2,\ldots,d_n)$. We demonstrate that $\kappa_{NB}(C(d_1,d_2,\ldots,d_n)) = n$ for all $n \ge 2$ and $d_i \ge 3$ (for $1 \le i \le n$). Additionally, we perform a computer simulation experiment on neighbor connectivity in undirected toroidal meshes. This experiment not only supports our theoretical findings with empirical results but also provides a deeper understanding of neighbor structure failures in undirected toroidal meshes.</description>

      <title>A general solution for the 1-2 conjecture using real numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 1-2 conjecture posits that for every graph, weights from $\{1,2\}$ can be assigned to its vertices and edges so that adjacent vertices have distinct weighted degrees. This paper demonstrates that any set of two distinct real numbers $\{a,b\}$ can achieve the same goal, thereby confirming the 1-2 conjecture in a broader context.</description>

      <title>The set of minimal distances of the monoid of plus-minus weighted zero-sum sequences and applications to the characterization problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently a systematic investigation of monoids of sequences of plus-minus weighted zero-sum sequences had been started, which is among others motivated by applications to monoids of norms of algebraic integers. In the current paper these investigations are continued. The focus is on the set of minimal distances of these monoids, which is an important arithmetical invariant. Applications to the characterization problem are discussed as well.</description>

      <title>Schreier Sets of Multiples of an Integer, Linear Recurrence, and Pascal Triangle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A finite nonempty set $F$ is said to be Schreier (maximal Schreier, respectively) if $\min F\ge |F|$ ($\min F = |F|$, respectively). For $k,n\in\mathbb{N}$, let $$s_{k,n}\ =\ |\{F\subset\{k, 2k,\ldots, nk\}\,:\, F\mbox{ is Schreier and }nk\in F\}|.$$ We show that the sequence $(s_{k,n})_{n=1}^\infty$ satisfies a linear recurrence whose coefficients are taken from the $k$th row of the Pascal triangle. Furthermore, a similar result holds for the sequence $(s^{(m)}_{k,n})_{n=1}^\infty$ that counts maximal Schreier sets. Finally, we prove that $$s^{(m)}_{k,n}\ =\ 2s_{k,n}-s_{k,n+1}, \mbox{ for all }n\ge 1.$$</description>

      <title>The magic of tensor products of ultrafilters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tensor products of ultrafilters have special combinatorial features closely related to Ramsey's Theorem, making them useful tools in applications. Here we first review their fundamental properties and isolate some new ones, including a characterisation of the limit superior and inferior of sequences as limits along tensor products, and an application to the Banach asymptotic density. We then prove a general result on the combinatorial structure of sets belonging to tensor products and, as a result, we obtain several characterisations of the additive properties of sets of natural numbers. Finally, we show that tensor products can be described as idempotents of an appropriate semigroup.</description>

      <title>The Shortest-Path distance on graphons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define an analogue of the shortest-path distance for graphons. The proposed method is rooted on the extension to graphons of Varadhan's formula, a result that links the solution of the heat equation on a Riemannian manifold to its geodesic distance. The resulting metric is integer-valued, and for step graphons obtained from finite graphs it is essentially equivalent to the usual shortest-path distance. We further draw a link between the Varadhan distance and the communicability distance, that contains information from all paths, not just shortest-paths, and thus provides a finer distance on graphons along with a natural isometric embedding into a Hilbert space.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing finite and infinite trees of arbitrary cardinality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite or infinite graph and $m(G)$ the minimum number of vertices moved by the non-identity automorphisms of $G$. We are interested in bounds on the supremum $\Delta(G)$ of the degrees of the vertices of $G$ that assure the existence of vertex colorings of $G$ with two colors that are preserved only by the identity automorphism, and, in particular, in the number $a(G)$ of such colorings that are mutually inequivalent.
  For trees $T$ with finite $m(T)$ we obtain the bound $\Delta(T)\leq2^{m(T)/2}$ for the existence of such a coloring, and show that $a(T)= 2^{|T|}$ if $T$ is infinite. Similarly, we prove that $a(G) = 2^{|G|}$ for all tree-like graphs $G$ with $\Delta(G)\le 2^{\aleph_0}$.
  For rayless or one-ended trees $T$ with arbitrarily large infinite $m(T)$, we prove directly that $a(T)= 2^{|T|}$ if $\Delta(T)\le 2^{m(T)}$.</description>

      <title>Proof of a conjecture on eigenvalues of transposition graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transposition graph $Cay(S_n,T_n)$ is the Cayley graph on the symmetric group $S_n$ generated by the set $T_n$ of all transpositions. In this paper, we show that each integer in the interval $\left[-{\lfloor(2n+1)/3 \rfloor\choose 2}, {\lfloor(2n+1)/3 \rfloor\choose 2}\right]$ is an eigenvalue of $Cay(S_n,T_n)$. This proves a recent conjecture by Kravchuk \cite{Kravchuk}.</description>

      <title>Excluding Pinched Spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pinched sphere is the pseudo-surface $\mathbb{S}^{\circ}_0$ obtained by identifying two distinct points of the sphere. We provide a structural characterization of graphs excluding an $\mathbb{S}^{\circ}_0$-embeddable graph as a minor. Given a graph $G$ and a vertex set $X$, the bidimensionality of $X$ in $G$ is the maximum $k$ such that $G$ contains the $(k\times k)$-grid as an $X$-rooted minor, i.e., there exists a minor model of the $(k \times k)$-grid in~$G$ such that every branchset of this model contains a vertex of $X$. We prove that there is a function~$f$ such that, if a graph $G$ excludes an $\mathbb{S}^{\circ}_0$-embeddable graph $H$ as a minor, $G$ has a tree decomposition where each torso $G_{t}$ contains some set of vertices $X,$ whose bidimensionality in $G_{t}$ is at most $f(k)$ such that $G_{t}$ can be reduced to a graph embeddable in the projective plane by identifying vertices from $X$. This result is optimal in the sense that every graph admitting such a tree decomposition must exclude some $\mathbb{S}^{\circ}_0$-embeddable graph as a minor. An alternative interpretation of this result can be obtained by the fact that edge-apex graphs, i.e., graphs that can be made planar by removing an edge, are graphs embeddable in the pinched sphere. Several consequences and variants of this min-max duality are discussed.</description>

      <title>Transparent Rectangle Visibility Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A transparent rectangle visibility graph (TRVG) is a graph whose vertices can be represented by a collection of non-overlapping rectangles in the plane whose sides are parallel to the axes such that two vertices are adjacent if and only if there is a horizontal or vertical line intersecting the interiors of their rectangles.
  We show that every threshold graph, tree, cycle, rectangular grid graph, triangular grid graph and hexagonal grid graph is a TRVG. We also obtain a maximum number of edges of a bipartite TRVG and characterize complete bipartite TRVGs. More precisely, a bipartite TRVG with $n$ vertices has at most $2n-2$ edges. The complete bipartite graph $K_{p,q}$ is a TRVG if and only if $\min\{p,q\} \le 2$ or $(p,q) \in \{(3,3), (3,4)\}$. We prove similar results for the torus. Moreover, we study whether powers of cycles and their complements are TRVGs.</description>

      <title>A group-theoretic approach to Shannon capacity of graphs and a limit theorem from lattice packings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a group-theoretic approach to the Shannon capacity problem. Using this approach we extend and recover, in a structured and unified manner, various families of previously known lower bounds on the Shannon capacity. Bohman (2003) proved that, in the limit $p\to\infty$, the Shannon capacity of cycle graphs $\Theta(C_p)$ converges to the fractional clique covering number, that is, $\lim_{p \to \infty} p/2 - \Theta(C_p) = 0$. We strengthen this result by proving that the same is true for all fraction graphs: $\lim_{p/q \to \infty} p/q - \Theta(E_{p/q}) = 0$. Here the fraction graph $E_{p/q}$ is the graph with vertex set $\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$ in which two distinct vertices are adjacent if and only if their distance mod $p$ is strictly less than $q$. We obtain the limit via the group-theoretic approach. In particular, the independent sets we construct in powers of fraction graphs are subgroups (and, in fact, lattices). Our approach circumvents known barriers for structured ("linear") constructions of independent sets of Calderbank-Frankl-Graham-Li-Shepp (1993) and Guruswami-Riazanov (2021).</description>

      <title>Stability with minuscule structure for chromatic thresholds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The chromatic threshold $\delta_\chi(H)$ of a graph $H$ is the infimum of $d&gt;0$ such that the chromatic number of every $n$-vertex $H$-free graph with minimum degree at least $d n$ is bounded by a constant depending only on $H$ and $d$. Allen, B{\"o}ttcher, Griffiths, Kohayakawa, and Morris determined the chromatic threshold for every $H$; in particular, they showed that if $\chi(H)=r\ge 3$, then $\delta_\chi(H) \in\{\frac{r-3}{r-2},~\frac{2 r-5}{2 r-3},~\frac{r-2}{r-1}\}$. While the chromatic thresholds have been completely determined, rather surprisingly the structural behaviors of extremal graphs near the threshold remain unexplored.
  In this paper, we establish the stability theorems for chromatic threshold problems. We prove that every $n$-vertex $H$-free graph $G$ with $\delta(G)\ge (\delta_\chi(H)-o(1))n$ and $\chi(G)=\omega(1)$ must be structurally close to one of the extremal configurations. Furthermore, we give a stronger stability result when $H$ is a clique, showing that $G$ admits a partition into independent sets and a small subgraph on sublinear number of vertices. We show that this small subgraph has fractional chromatic number $2+o(1)$ and is homomorphic to a Kneser graph defined by subsets of a logarithmic size set; both these two bounds are best possible. This is the first stability result that captures the lower-order structural features of extremal graphs.
  We also study two variations of chromatic thresholds. Replacing chromatic number by its fractional counterpart, we determine the fractional chromatic thresholds for all graphs. Another variation is the bounded-VC chromatic thresholds, which was introduced by Liu, Shangguan, Skokan, and Xu very recently. Extending work of {\L}uczak and Thomass{\'e} on the triangle case, we determine the bounded-VC chromatic thresholds for all cliques.</description>

      <title>Careful synchronisation and the diameter of transformation semigroups with few generators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A word is called carefully synchronising for a partial deterministic finite semi-automaton if it maps all states to the same state. Equivalently, it is a composition of partial transformations equal to a constant total transformation. There is a sequence of several papers providing stronger and stronger lower bounds on the length of shortest carefully synchronising words for $n$-state partial DFAs over small alphabets. It resulted in the lower bounds of $\Omega(\frac{2^{n/3}}{n\sqrt{n}})$ and $\Omega(\frac{4^{n/5}}{n})$ for alphabets of two and three letters respectively, obtained by de Bondt, Don, and Zantema. Using a significantly simpler construction, we improve these lower bounds to $2^{(n - 4)/3}$ and $4^{(n - 4)/5}$ respectively.
  We then consider a tightly related question of the diameter of a partial DFA, which is the smallest $\ell \ge 0$ such that words of length at most $\ell$ express all the transformations induced by words in this DFA. We show that an alphabet of large enough constant size already asymptotically matches the upper bound on the diameter for arbitrary alphabet size, extending the construction of Panteleev that requires an alphabet of size exponential in the number of states. We then discuss an application to the diameter of finite semigroups of nonnegative matrices, and some open problems.</description>

      <title>A generalization of Deterministic Finite Automata related to discharging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deterministic Finite Automata (DFAs) are of central importance in automata theory. In view of how state diagrams for DFAs are defined using directed graphs, this leads us to introduce a generalization of DFAs related to a method widely used in graph theory referred to as the discharging method. Given a DFA $(Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_{0}, F)$, the transition function $\delta\colon Q \times \Sigma \to Q$ determines a directed path in the corresponding state diagram based on an input string $a_{1} a_{2} \cdots a_{n}$ consisting of characters in $\Sigma$, and our generalization can be thought of as being based on how each vertex in $D$ ''discharges'' rational values to adjacent vertices (by analogy with the discharging method) depending on the string $a_{1} a_{2} \cdots a_{n}$ and according to a fixed set of rules. We formalize this notion and pursue an exploration of the notion of a Discharging Deterministic Finite Automaton (DDFA) introduced in this paper. Our DDFA construction gives rise to a ring structure consisting of sequences that we refer to as being quasi-$k$-regular, and this ring generalizes the ring of $k$-regular sequences introduced by Allouche and Shallit.</description>

      <title>Examples of complete Calabi--Yau metrics on affine smoothings of irregular toric Calabi--Yau cones</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present new examples of affine Calabi--Yau manifolds of Euclidean volume growth and quadratic curvature decay, whose tangent cones at infinity are irregular and have smooth links. In the process, we demonstrate (and provide the relevant computer code) how to explicitly compute the Reeb field and all Minkowski decompositions of a given toric Calabi--Yau cone with smooth link from the data of its toric polytope. Minkowski decompositions of this polytope into lattice segments and/or triangles give rise to smoothings of the given cone. Furthermore, we propose an effective strategy to generate smoothable Calabi--Yau cones from a given non-smoothable one by taking Minkowski sums of certain toric diagrams, and provide an example to illustrate the method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper formally examines the network structure of Bitcoin CORE (BTC) and Bitcoin Satoshi Vision (BSV) using complex graph theory to demonstrate that home-hosted full nodes are incapable of participating in or influencing the propagation topology. Leveraging established models such as scale-free networks and small-world connectivity, we demonstrate that the propagation graph is dominated by a densely interconnected miner clique, while full nodes reside on the periphery, excluded from all transaction-to-block inclusion paths. Using simulation-backed metrics and eigenvalue centrality analysis, we confirm that full nodes are neither critical nor operationally relevant for consensus propagation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10027v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We initiate an in-depth study of pattern avoidance on modified ascent sequences. Our main technique consists in using Stanley's standardization to obtain a transport theorem between primitive modified ascent sequences and permutations avoiding a bivincular pattern of length three. We enumerate some patterns via bijections with other combinatorial structures such as Fishburn permutations, lattice paths and set partitions. We settle the last remaining case of a conjecture by Duncan and Steingr\'imsson by proving that modified ascent sequences avoiding 2321 are counted by the Bell numbers.</description>

      <title>Cyclic sieving on permutations -- an analysis of maps and statistics in the FindStat database</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16251v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a systematic study of permutation statistics and bijective maps on permutations using SageMath to search the FindStat combinatorial statistics database to identify apparent instances of the cyclic sieving phenomenon (CSP). Cyclic sieving occurs on a set of objects, a statistic, and a map of order $n$ when the evaluation of the statistic generating function at the $d$th power of the primitive $n$th root of unity equals the number of fixed points under the $d$th power of the map. Of the apparent instances found in our experiment, we prove 34 new instances of the CSP and conjecture three more. Our results are organized largely by orbit structure, proving instances of the CSP for involutions with $2^{n-1}$ fixed points and $2^{\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\rfloor}$ fixed points, as well as maps whose orbits all have the same size. The FindStat maps which exhibit the CSP include a map constructed by Corteel (using a bijection of Foata and Zeilberger) to swap the number of nestings and crossings, the invert Laguerre heap map, a map of Alexandersson and Kebede designed to preserve right-to-left minima, conjugation by the long cycle, as well as reverse, complement, rotation, Lehmer code rotation, and toric promotion. Our results combined with those of [Elder, Lafreni\`ere, McNicholas, Striker, Welch 2023] show that, contrary to common expectations, actions that exhibit homomesy are not necessarily the best candidates for the CSP, and vice versa.</description>

      <title>Chow rings and augmented Chow rings of uniform matroids and their $q$-analogs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19660v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Hilbert series and the representations of $\mathfrak{S}_n$ and $GL_n(\mathbb{F}_q)$ on the (augmented) Chow rings of uniform matroids $U_{r,n}$ and $q$-uniform matroids $U_{r,n}(q)$. The Frobenius series for uniform matroids and their $q$-analogs are computed. As a byproduct, we recover Hameister, Rao, and Simpson's formula for the Hilbert series of Chow rings of $q$-uniform matroids in terms of permutations and further obtain their augmented counterpart in terms of decorated permutations.
  We also show that the equivariant Charney--Davis quantity of the (augmented) Chow ring of a matroid is nonnegative (i.e., a genuine representation of a group of automorphisms of the matroid). When the matroid is a uniform matroid and the group is $\mathfrak{S}_n$, the representation either vanishes or is a Foulkes representation (i.e., a Specht module of a ribbon shape). Specializing to the usual Charney--Davis quantities, we obtain an elegant combinatorial interpretation of Hameister, Rao, and Simpson's formula for Chow rings of $q$-uniform matroids and its augmented counterpart.</description>

      <title>On the Uncrossed Number of Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21206v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Visualizing a graph $G$ in the plane nicely, for example, without crossings, is unfortunately not always possible. To address this problem, Masa\v{r}\'ik and Hlin\v{e}n\'y [GD 2023] recently asked for each edge of $G$ to be drawn without crossings while allowing multiple different drawings of $G$. More formally, a collection $\mathcal{D}$ of drawings of $G$ is uncrossed if, for each edge $e$ of $G$, there is a drawing in $\mathcal{D}$ such that $e$ is uncrossed. The uncrossed number $\mathrm{unc}(G)$ of $G$ is then the minimum number of drawings in some uncrossed collection of $G$.
  No exact values of the uncrossed numbers have been determined yet, not even for simple graph classes. In this paper, we provide the exact values for uncrossed numbers of complete and complete bipartite graphs, partly confirming and partly refuting a conjecture posed by Hlin\v{e}n\'y and Masa\v{r}\'ik. We also present a strong general lower bound on $\mathrm{unc}(G)$ in terms of the number of vertices and edges of $G$. Moreover, we prove NP-hardness of the related problem of determining the edge crossing number of a graph $G$, which is the smallest number of edges of $G$ taken over all drawings of $G$ that participate in a crossing. This problem was posed as open by Schaefer in his book [Crossing Numbers of Graphs 2018].</description>

      <title>On the Lottery Problem: Tracing Stefan Mandel's Combinatorial Condensation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06857v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stefan Mandel is said to have won the lottery 14 times. He never disclosed the recipe he called combinatorial condensation, which enabled him to hit the Romanian lottery jackpot in the early phase of his betting career. Combinatorial condensation is frequently mixed up with another strategy known as buying the pot, which Stefan Mandel was pursuing later on. On occasion, he dropped a few hints on combinatorial condensation. The hints are applied in this work to narrow down and assess his initial recipe. The underlying theory resembles what a weekend mathematician, as he once referred to himself, may have encountered in the 1960s. The cardinality of the (15, 6, 6, 5) and (49, 6, 6, 5) lottery schemes shows that Stefan Mandel probably wasn't aware of lottery designs. First concepts on such topics had been available at that time, but coherent theories on combinatorial designs took off only in later decades. There is no absolute evidence beyond doubt, but the size of actual covering designs and the associated efforts allow the following hypothesis: Stefan Mandel most likely pioneered in constructing a (15, 6, 5) covering design many years before others published about it, which he applied in the Romanian lottery. Calculations indicate that he took considerable risks that his method might fail, because he limited himself to a subset of 15 numbers out of 49 numbers. The risks explain why he later changed his strategy from combinatorial condensation to buying the pot.</description>

Abstract: Ascent sequences play a key role in the combinatorics of Fishburn structures. Difference ascent sequences are a natural generalization obtained by replacing ascents with $d$-ascents. We have recently extended the so-called hat map to difference ascent sequences, and self-modified difference ascent sequences are the fixed points under this map. We characterize self-modified difference ascent sequences and enumerate them in terms of certain generalized Fibonacci polynomials. Furthermore, we describe the corresponding subset of $d$-Fishburn permutations.</description>

This matches the upper bound recently proved by Alon, Buci\'c, and Sauermann for typical norms (i.e., norms lying in a comeagre set). We also show that for $d\geq 3$ and a typical norm on $\mathbb R^d$, the unit distance graph of this norm contains a copy of $K_{d,m}$ for all $m$.</description>

Abstract: Let $t\geq2$ and $k\geq1$ be integers. A $t$-regular partition of a positive integer $n$ is a partition of $n$ such that none of its parts is divisible by $t$. Let $b_{t,k}(n)$ denote the number of hooks of length $k$ in all the $t$-regular partitions of $n$. In this article, we prove some inequalities for $b_{t,k}(n)$ for fixed values of $k$. We prove that for any $t\geq2$, $b_{t+1,1}(n)\geq b_{t,1}(n)$, for all $n\geq0$. We also prove that $b_{3,2}(n)\geq b_{2,2}(n)$ for all $n&gt;3$, and $b_{3,3}(n)\geq b_{2,3}(n)$ for all $n\geq0$. Finally, we state some problems for future works.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01951v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the existence of periodic colorings and orientations in locally finite graphs. A coloring or orientation of a graph $G$ is periodic if the resulting colored or oriented graph is quasi-transitive, meaning that $V(G)$ has finitely many orbits under the action of the group of automorphisms of $G$ preserving the coloring or the orientation. When such a periodic coloring or orientation of $G$ exists, $G$ itself must be quasi-transitive and it is natural to investigate when quasi-transitive graphs have such periodic colorings or orientations. We provide examples of Cayley graphs with no periodic orientation or non-trivial coloring, and examples of quasi-transitive graphs of treewidth 2 without periodic orientation or proper coloring. On the other hand we show that every quasi-transitive graph $G$ of bounded pathwidth has a periodic proper coloring with $\chi(G)$ colors and a periodic orientation. We relate these problems with techniques and questions from symbolic dynamics and distributed computing and conclude with a number of open problems.</description>

Abstract: We find identities involving differential operators in the generic artinian reduction of the Stanley-Reisner ring of a simplicial sphere in any positive characteristic. These identities generalize the characteristic 2 identities used by Papadakis and Petrotou to give a proof of the algebraic g-conjecture. We show that these identities are a shadow of an identity on the degree map, and we use them to prove the anisotropy of certain forms on the generic artinian reduction of the Stanley--Reisner ring and to prove weak Lefschetz results.</description>

Abstract: A graph class $\mathcal{C}$ has polynomial expansion if there is a polynomial function $f$ such that for every graph $G\in \mathcal{C}$, each of the depth-$r$ minors of $G$ has average degree at most $f(r)$. In this note, we study bounded-radius variants of some classical graph parameters such as bramble number, linkedness and well-linkedness, and we show that they are pairwise polynomially related. Furthermore, in a monotone graph class with polynomial expansion they are all uniformly bounded by a polynomial in $r$.</description>

      <title>Sets of equiangular lines in dimension $18$ constructed from $A_9 \oplus A_9 \oplus A_1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06377v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2023, Greaves et~al.\ constructed several sets of 57 equiangular lines in dimension 18. Using the concept of switching root introduced by Cao et~al.\ in 2021, these sets of equiangular lines are embedded in a lattice of rank 19 spanned by norm 3 vectors together with a switching root. We characterize this lattice as an overlattice of the root lattice $A_9\oplus A_9\oplus A_1$, and show that there are at least $246896$ sets of 57 equiangular lines in dimension $18$ arising in this way, up to isometry. Additionally, we prove that all of these sets of equiangular lines are strongly maximal. Here, a set of equiangular lines is said to be strongly maximal if there is no set of equiangular lines properly containing it even if the dimension of the underlying space is increased. Among these sets, there are ones with only six distinct Seidel eigenvalues.</description>

      <title>Bootstrap percolation on a generalized Hamming cube \MakeUppercase{\romannumeral 2}</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12607v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the critical probability $p_c(Q_n,r)$ for bootstrap percolation with the infection threshold $r$ on the $n$-dimensional hypercube $Q_n$ with vertex set $V(Q_n)=\{0,1\}^n$ and edges connecting the pairs at Hamming distance $1$. More precisely, by utilizing the techniques developed by Balogh, Bollob{\'a}s, and Morris (2009), we determine the first-order term of $p_c(Q_n,n^a)$ where $\frac{2}{3}&lt;a&lt; 1$. Additionally, we obtain the critical probability $p_c(Q_{k,n},r)$ for bootstrap percolation with the infection threshold $r=\frac{N}{2}$ on the generalized $n$-dimensional hypercube $Q_{k,n}$ with vertex set $V(Q_{k,n})=\{0,1\}^n$ and edges connecting the pairs at Hamming distance $1,2,\dots,k$, where $k\ge 2$ and $N=\sum_{i=1}^k\binom{n}{i}$. More precisely, we obtain the first-order term of $p_c(Q_{k,n},\frac{N}{2})$ and some bounds on the second-order term by extending the main theorem from Balogh, Bollob{\'a}s, and Morris (2009).</description>

      <title>Principal Minors of Hermitian Laplacian Matrix of Directed Graphs and Their Connection to Directed Graph Substructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17553v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the algebraic properties of directed graph substructures by analyzing the principal minors of the Hermitian Laplacian matrix. By generalizing Bapat et al.'s nonsingular substructure theory and by defining a substructure as a vertex-edge pair $(V',E')$, where edges in $E'$ are not restricted to connecting vertices within $V'$, we establish a link between the principal minors and the topological properties of rootless tree and unicyclic graph substructures. We investigate how these algebraic invariants encode information about substructures by using the Cauchy-Binet formula to decompose principal minors into sums of determinants of these substructures, thereby contributing to the understanding of graph structures through the algebraic framework of the Hermitian Laplacian matrix. A significant finding of this work is that strategic selection of $\omega$ to be a $5$th root of unity maps the determinant contributions of unicyclic substructures into the quadratic field $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{5})$. This unique algebraic property allows for the distinction and enumeration of specific types of unicyclic components by leveraging the rational and irrational parts of their determinants.</description>

      <title>Incidences, tilings, and fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02229v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The master theorem, introduced independently by Richter-Gebert and by Fomin and the first author, provides a method for proving incidence theorems of projective geometry using triangular tilings of surfaces. We investigate which incidence theorems over C and R can or cannot be proved via the master theorem. For this, we formalize the notion of a tiling proof. We introduce a hierarchy of classes of theorems based on the underlying topological spaces. A key tool is considering the same theorems over finite fields.</description>

      <title>The combinatorics of identities involving overpartitions with distinct parts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06640v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, Andrews and EI Bachraoui discovered several companions for some famous $q$-series formulas, and derived some new identities involving partitions and overpartitions with distinct parts. In this paper, we shall refine their results by the number of parts of partitions and furthermore, we will also provide the combinatorial proofs for those partition identities.</description>

      <title>Counting homomorphisms in antiferromagnetic graphs via Lorentzian polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13659v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An edge-weighted graph $G$, possibly with loops, is said to be antiferromagnetic if it has nonnegative weights and at most one positive eigenvalue, counting multiplicities. The number of graph homomorphisms from a graph $H$ to an antiferromagnetic graph $G$ generalises various important parameters in graph theory, including the number of independent sets and proper vertex-colourings, as well as their relaxations in statistical physics.
  We obtain homomorphism inequalities for various graphs $H$ and antiferromagnetic graphs~$G$ of the form \[ \lvert\operatorname{Hom}(H,G)\rvert^2 \leq \lvert\operatorname{Hom}(H\times K_2,G)\rvert, \] where $H\times K_2$ denotes the tensor product of $H$ and $K_2$. Firstly, we show that the inequality holds for any $H$ obtained by blowing up vertices of a bipartite graph into complete graphs and any antiferromagnetic $G$. In particular, one can take $H=K_{d+1}$, which already implies a new result for the Sah--Sawhney--Stoner--Zhao conjecture on the maximum number of $d$-regular graphs in antiferromagnetic graphs. Secondly, the inequality also holds for $G=K_q$ and those $H$ obtained by blowing up vertices of a bipartite graph into complete multipartite graphs, paths or even cycles.
  Both results can be seen as the first progress towards Zhao's conjecture on $q$-colourings, which states that the inequality holds for any $H$ and $G=K_q$, after his own work. Our method leverages on the emerging theory of Lorentzian polynomials due to Br\"and\'en and Huh and log-concavity of the list colourings of bipartite graphs, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Stable functions and F{\o}lner's Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13766v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that if $G$ is an amenable group and $A\subseteq G$ has positive upper Banach density, then there is an identity neighborhood $B$ in the Bohr topology on $G$ that is almost contained in $AA^{-1}$ in the sense that $B\backslash AA^{-1}$ has upper Banach density $0$. This generalizes the abelian case (due to F{\o}lner) and the countable case (due to Beiglb\"{o}ck, Bergelson, and Fish). The proof is indirectly based on local stable group theory in continuous logic. The main ingredients are Grothendieck's double-limit characterization of relatively weakly compact sets in spaces of continuous functions, along with results of Ellis and Nerurkar on the topological dynamics of weakly almost periodic flows.</description>
