      <title>Role of Coherence in Polarization Response of Hybrid Monolayer MoS$_2$-Gold Nanoparticle Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16351v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monolayers of transition metal dichacogenides show strong second-order nonlinearity and symmetry-driven selection rules from their three-fold lattice symmetry. This process resembles the valley-contrasting selection rules for photoluminescence in these materials. However, the underlying physical mechanisms fundamentally differ since second harmonic generation is a coherent process, whereas photoluminescence is incoherent, leading to distinct interactions with photonic nanoresonators. In this study, we investigate the far- field circular polarization properties of second harmonic generation from MoS$_2$ monolayers resonantly interacting with spherical gold nanoparticles. Our results indicate that the coherence of the second harmonic allows its polarization to be mostly preserved, unlike in an incoherent process, where the polarization is scrambled. These findings provide important insights for future applications in valleytronics and quantum nanooptics, where both coherent and incoherent processes can be probed in such hybrid systems without altering sample geometry or operational wavelength.</description>

      <title>Meta-optical Miniscope for Multifunctional Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Miniaturized microscopes (miniscopes) have opened a new frontier in animal behavior studies, enabling real-time imaging of neuron activity while leaving animals largely unconstrained. Canonical designs typically use Gradient-Index (GRIN) lenses or refractive lenses as the objective module for excitation and fluorescence collection, but GRIN lenses suffer from aberrations and refractive lenses are bulky and complex. Meta-optics, composed of subwavelength diffractive elements, offer a promising alternative by combining multiple functionalities with significantly reduced footprint and weight. Here, we present meta-optical miniscopes that integrate functionalities including large field of view (FOV), extended depth of focus (EDOF), and depth sensitivity. These meta-optics replace the traditional refractive lens assembly, reducing the total track length of the objective module from 6.7 mm to 2.5 mm while enhancing imaging performance. Our results demonstrate that meta-optical miniscopes can expand the miniscope toolbox and facilitate the development of more compact and multifunctional imaging systems.</description>

      <title>Phase matching in Vector Beam Driven High Harmonic Generation with 3D-printed Gas Cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present experimental results of high harmonic generation(HHG) driven by a 1300 nm beam in three different polarization states: linear, radial, and azimuthal. We found that the optimal pressure for phasematching was roughly twice as high for the vector beam drivers than the linear driver. We attribute this difference in pressure primarily to the Gouy phase, which differs by a factor of two between the linear and vector polarization states. We demonstrate a target for HHG that produces a uniform pressure profile in the interaction region that is nearly identical to the backing pressure, and preserves the mode of the driving beam. We provide characterization and validation of this technique through flow simulations and experimental measurements.</description>

      <title>Moire Artifact Reduction in Grating Interferometry Using Multiple Harmonics and Total Variation Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray interferometry is an emerging imaging modality with a wide range of potential clinical applications, including lung and breast imaging, as well as non destructive testing in fields such as additive manufacturing and porosimetry. A grating interferometer uses a diffraction grating to produce a periodic interference pattern and measures how a patient or sample perturbs the pattern, producing three unique images that highlight X-ray absorption, refraction, and small angle scattering, known as the attenuation, differential phase, and dark-field images. Image artifacts unique to X-ray interferometry are introduced when assuming the fringe pattern is perfectly sinusoidal and the phase steps are evenly spaced. Inaccuracies in grating position, coupled with multi-harmonic fringes, lead to Moire artifacts. We have developed an image recovery algorithm that estimates the true phase stepping positions using multiple harmonics and total variation regularization, removing the Moire artifacts present in the attenuation, differential phase, and dark-field images. We demonstrate the algorithm's utility for the Talbot-Lau and Modulated Phase Grating interferometers by imaging multiple samples, including PMMA microspheres and a euthanized mouse.</description>

      <title>Miniaturized Computational Dispersion-Engineered Silicon Photonic Vernier Caliper Spectrometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of miniaturized spectrometers for cost-effective mobile applications remains challenging, as small footprints fundamentally degrade bandwidth and resolution. Typically, achieving high resolution necessitates extended and sophisticated optical paths for spectral decorrelation. These restrict bandwidth both physically (through resonant wavelength periodicity constraints) and mathematically (due to resulting ill-conditioned large matrix factorizations). Here, we report a spectrometer using a computational dispersion-engineered silicon photonic Vernier caliper. This deterministic design enables periodicity-suppressed orthogonal measurements by nature, thus overcoming the bandwidth-resolution-footprint limit of current chip-scale spectrometers. Leveraging the dispersion-engineered Vernier subwavelength grating microrings and factorization-free matrix computation, a spectral resolution of 1.4 pm is achieved throughout a bandwidth of &gt;160 nm with a footprint of &lt;55*35 {\mu}m2 in a single detection channel,establishing the highest bandwidth-to-resolution-to-footprint ratio (&gt;57 {\mu}m-2) demonstrated to date. Furthermore, broadband densely overlapped molecular absorption spectra of hydrogen cyanide are precisely measured, resolving 49 R- and P-branch lines with linewidths ranging from 15 to 86 pm which is fundamentally challenging for compressive sensing approaches. Our chip-scale spectrometer provides a new path toward precise and real-time multi-species spectral analysis and facilitates their commercialization.</description>

      <title>SPP-MIM hybridization meta-film: a biosensing structure uniting the merits of SPR and LSPR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Having a flat device-solution interface is crucial for nanophotonic biosensors to achieve stable and reproducible performance, by mitigating solid-liquid-gas interfacial processes at the nanometer scale. In this aspect, the metal-insulator-metal (MIM) film presents a capable solution, by hybridizing surface plasmon polaritons (SPP) and MIM gap plasmons, which is enabled by the latter's unique dispersion characteristic and wide tunability. In this meta-film, the SPPs propagate along a flat interface, and seal the gap plasmons which can be integrated with nanostructures, e.g., a coupling grating. In addition, by tuning the gap plasmons, the SPP-MIM hybridization meta-film can be designed to achieve a significantly reduced SPP evanescent depth and a significantly improved surface sensitivity. Using gold as the plasmonic material, such improvements are theoretically predicted across a broad spectral range, from visible to near infrared. Particularly, at 1550 nm, we show that a grating-coupled meta-film device is designed to have its evanescent depth shortened from 1.4 micrometers to 0.16 micrometers, with an enhancement factor of 5.6 in its surface sensitivity, as compared with traditional grating-coupled SPR. This unique characteristic of the SPP-MIM meta-film makes it an efficient combination of propagating SPR and LSPR, by simultaneously having a flat and simple biosensing interface, a short evanescent depth and a high surface sensitivity. It provides an inspiring approach for transforming various LSPR designs into stable biosensors.</description>

      <title>Inverse-Designed Photonic Crystal Cavities with Controllable Far-Field Numerical Aperture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic crystal cavities confine light to subwavelength volumes, enabling strong light-matter interactions for applications in low-power photonics, opto-electronics, nonlinear optics, and quantum information. These applications demand cavities that combine high quality factors, low mode volumes, and high coupling efficiencies. However, optimizing across these metrics requires exploring a large design space, motivating the use of inverse design strategies. Previous inverse design efforts targeted high quality factors and low mode volumes, sacrificing the coupling efficiency or lacking the ability to precisely control the far-field radiation pattern. In this work, we present an inverse design framework that simultaneously optimizes cavity quality factor and far-field numerical aperture, both specified as design targets. Using this method, we design L3 photonic crystal cavities, with different far-field numerical apertures, in the visible wavelength and fabricate them in silicon nitride. Photoluminescence measurements confirm experimental control of the far-field numerical aperture and reveal a 28-fold and 3.9-fold improvement in the coupling efficiency and quality factor respectively when compared to the standard L3 cavity. Disorder analysis further shows that the designs retain significant performance despite nanofabrication imperfections. Our work demonstrates a versatile inverse design framework for multi-objective optimization of photonic crystal cavities to attain high quality factors and coupling efficiency.</description>

      <title>Tolerance of Phase Noise in Single-Carrier M-Ary QAM Terahertz Wireless Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Terahertz wireless communications offer abundant untapped spectrum and are regarded as a promising playground for next-generation high-throughput links. Yet oscillator phase noise becomes the dominant impairment at such high frequencies, severely limiting the reliability of high-order QAM transmission. Here, phase noise is reconstructed from measured spectra and embedded into a single-carrier link model to evaluate its impact. Distinct distortion mechanisms are identified, with slow common phase error and instantaneous phase jitter, where the latter remains as the residual impairment after carrier phase recovery. We further adopt 3{\sigma} error criterion that maps residual distortions onto the constellation, offering a clear and practical indicator of system robustness. The results indicate that modest improvements in oscillator stability translate into significant BER gains without proportional power increase. These findings provide intuitive tolerance of phase noise in M-QAM systems and emphasizes the importance of integrating low-noise photonic oscillators.</description>

      <title>Interference Induced Complex Nonlinearities in Metal-ITO Metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We combine modeling and experiments to investigate second- and third-harmonic generation (SHG/THG) in metal-indium tin oxide (ITO) metasurfaces. Linear optics at normal incidence show moderate field enhancement near the ITO epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) wavelength, steering the focus toward intrinsic, material driven nonlinear response rather than simple linear field boosting. Wavelength resolved SHG requires a Lorentz dispersive \chi^{2} for ITO to match spectra; a static \chi^{2} fails. Angle resolved SHG/THG cannot be reproduced with purely real coefficients; grouped contributions to \chi^{3} (and effective \chi^{2}) must be complex. Using a hydrodynamic model for the metal and ITO with linear dispersion plus dispersive \chi^{2} and \chi^{3}, we show that these complex phases arise from coherent interference of nonlinear sources in the metal, ITO, and interfaces, each weighted by distinct, complex local field and radiation factors. Experimentally, we fabricated split ring resonator metasurfaces on ITO films atop a metallic ground plate and measured linear reflectance and angle resolved SHG/THG in reflection geometry. The measurements quantitatively confirm the modeling: dispersive \chi^{2} is necessary to capture SHG spectra, and complex, interference induced effective coefficients are essential to reproduce angular SHG/THG patterns. Together, these results provide a unified, physically grounded interpretation of nonlinear emission from metal-oxide metasurfaces without relying on ENZ field enhancement.</description>

      <title>Machine learning meets Singular Optics II: Single-pixel Detection of Structured Light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structured light beams, including Laguerre-Gaussian (LG), Hermite-Gaussian (HG), and perfect vortex (PV) spatial modes, have been at the forefront of modern optics due to their potential in communications, metrology, and sensing. Traditional recognition methods often demand complex alignments and high-resolution imaging. Speckle-learned recognition (SLR) has emerged as a powerful alternative, exploiting the spatio-temporal speckle fields generated by light-diffuser interactions. This paper builds upon the earlier report: Machine Learning Meets Singular Optics (Proc. SPIE 12938, 2024), which demonstrated structured light recognition using 2D speckle images in both on-axis and off-axis channels captured in the spatial domain. In the present work, the recognition framework is advanced by employing 1D speckle information captured in the spatial and temporal domains. This paper reviews how the 2D spatial information of the structured light is mapped on 1D speckle arrays captured in space and 1D temporal speckle fluctuations recorded in time. The 1D speckle arrays captured in the spatial domain have successfully recognised the parent structured light beams with accuracy exceeding 94%, even by employing 1/nth of the 2D speckle data. More recently, 2D spatial information of structured light beams has been mapped onto temporal speckle sequences recorded by a single-pixel detector in the temporal domain. This study highlights the accuracy exceeding 96% across various structured light families, with resilience to turbulence and modal degeneracy. These advances establish scalable, alignment-free, and low-latency recognition architectures suitable for optical communication, sensing, and quantum technologies.</description>

Abstract: Conventional optical imaging is limited by diffraction, preventing discrimination of closely spaced incoherent sources. Inspired by quantum parameter estimation, this thesis explores spatial-mode demultiplexing (SPADE) as a method to overcome this limit by projecting light onto an orthonormal mode basis. In this work, we design and experimentally validate a practical implementation of spatial-mode demultiplexing via Multi-Plane Light Conversion (MPLC).</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable, Temperature Resilient Phase-Change Metasurfaces Fabricated via High Throughput Nanoimprinting Lithography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The combination of metasurfaces with chalcogenide phase-change materials is a highly promising route towards the development of multifunctional and reconfigurable nanophotonic devices. However, their transition into real-world devices is hindered by several technological challenges. This includes, amongst others, the lack of large area photonic architectures produced via scalable nanofabrication methods, as required for free-space photonic applications, along with the ability to withstand the high temperatures required for the phase-change process. In this work, we present a scalable nanofabrication strategy for the production of reconfigurable metasurfaces based on high-throughput, large-area nanoimprint lithography that is fully compatible with chalcogenide phase-change materials processing. Our approach involves the direct imprinting of high melting point, thermally stable TiO2 nanoparticle pastes, followed by the deposition of an Sb2Se3 thin film as the phase-change material active layer. The patterned titania film enables the creation of thermally robust metasurfaces, overcoming the limitations of conventional polymer-based nanoimprint approaches. The versatility of our approach is showcased by producing phase-change devices with two distinct functionalities: (i) metasurfaces with tunable spectral band switching and amplitude modulation capabilities across the near- to mid-infrared, and (ii) reconfigurable chiral metasurfaces, whose chiroptical activity can be switched between the visible and the near-infrared. Experimental results show excellent agreement with numerical simulations and reveal high uniformity across large areas.</description>

      <title>Silicon Integrated Photonic Waveguide Polarizers with 2D MoS2 Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarization control is of fundamental importance for modern optical systems, and optical polarizers serve as critical components for enabling this functionality. Here, we experimentally demonstrate optical polarizers by integrating 2D molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) films onto silicon photonic waveguides. High-quality monolayer MoS2 films with highly anisotropic light absorption are synthesized via a low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) method and subsequently transferred onto silicon-on-insulator (SOI) nanowire waveguides to fabricate integrated optical polarizers. Detailed measurements are carried out for the fabricated devices with various MoS2 film coating lengths and silicon waveguide geometry. The results show that a maximum polarization-dependent loss of ~21 dB is achieved, together with a high figure of merit of ~4.2. In addition, the hybrid waveguide polarizers exhibit broad operation bandwidth exceeding ~100 nm and excellent power durability. These results highlight the strong potential for on-chip integration of 2D MoS2 films to implement high-performance polarization selective devices.</description>

      <title>Beyond Fresnel Wave Surfaces: Off-Shell Photonic Density of States and Near-Fields in Isotropy-Broken Materials with Loss or Gain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fresnel wave surfaces, or isofrequency light shells, provide a powerful framework for describing electromagnetic wave propagation in anisotropic media, yet their applicability is restricted to reciprocal, lossless materials and far-field radiation. This paper extends the concept by incorporating near-field effects and non-Hermitian responses arising in media with loss, gain, or non-reciprocity. Using the Om-potential approach to macroscopic electromagnetism, we reinterpret near fields as off-shell electromagnetic modes, in analogy with off-shell states in quantum field theory. We show that photonic density of states (PDOS) distributions near Fresnel surfaces acquire Lorentzian broadening in non-reciprocal media, directly linking this effect to the Beer-Bouguer-Lambert law of exponential attenuation or amplification. Furthermore, we demonstrate how Abraham and Minkowski momenta, locked to light shells in the far field, naturally shift to characterize source structures in the near-field regime. This unified treatment bridges the gap between sources and radiation, on-shell and off-shell modes, and reciprocal and non-reciprocal responses. The framework provides both fundamental insight into structured light and practical tools for the design of emitters and metamaterial platforms relevant to emerging technologies such as 6G communications, photonic density-of-states engineering, and non-Hermitian photonics.</description>

      <title>Design of Ultrathin Faraday Rotators based on All-dielectric Magneto-optical Metasurfaces at the Telecommunication Band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magneto-optical (MO) interactions offer a direct route to nonreciprocal optical devices but are intrinsically weak in the optical domain, posing a major challenge in downsizing MO functional devices. In this study, we present a design strategy for ultra-thin MO Faraday rotators based on all-dielectric metasurfaces supporting high-quality factor quasi-bound states in the continuum (QBIC) modes. Light trapping in QBIC modes induced by band folding significantly enhances MO interactions in a controllable manner, enabling a technologically relevant 45$^\circ$ Faraday rotation with a MO metasurface that is only a few hundred nanometers thick. The design also incorporates electromagnetically induced transparency via spectrally overlapping resonant modes to achieve high light transmittance reaching 80%. This approach not only enables compact yet practical MO Faraday rotator but also holds promises for advancing free-space magnetic sensors and MO modulators.</description>

      <title>Monolithic Expandable-FOV Metalens Enabled by Radially Gradient-Tilted Meta-Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metalens, as the most promising and applicable emerging optical device, has long been constrained by the limited field of view (FOV). Recent studies employing phase engineering or multi-layer strategies have made some progress, but they all rely on upright meta-atoms. This leads us to consider whether tilted meta-atoms could represent a promising yet underexplored approach for enhancing the field of view? In this work, we introduce the control of the tilt angle of meta-atoms as a new degree of freedom into the design of metalenses and propose a wide-field-of-view (WFOV) metalens design framework utilizing radially gradient-tilted meta-atoms. Based on the proposed method, we designed two WFOV metalenses with distinct tilt configurations to meet specific application requirements of efficiency or precision. Simulation results demonstrate that both designs, exhibiting distinct performance characteristics, achieve diffraction-limited focusing within a 120 degree FOV. Additionally, the FOV can be expanded with this method by tuning the tilt angle configurations of meta-atoms and the metalens diameter. These findings will establish a promising pathway towards compact optical systems capable of combining ultra-wide angular coverage with high-resolution imaging.</description>

      <title>Spatial phase coherence in femtosecond coherent Raman scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional femtosecond coherent laser spectroscopy predominantly focuses on the temporal phase coherence through time- or frequency-resolved methods. In this work, we suggest an alternative experimental framework based on spatial phase coherence. The intrinsic spectral dispersion of wavevectors in femtosecond pulses and sample dimensions exceeding the laser wavelength create a compelling basis to establish spatial phase coherence as a novel and robust foundation for femtosecond laser spectroscopy. Using rotational Raman coherence in gas molecules as a case study, we analyze the transverse spatial distribution of the third-order signal generated by a rotational wave-packet. Our findings reveal apparent temporal shifts and distortions in time-resolved signals that arise in conventional measurements lacking sensitivity to spatial phase coherence. Moreover, we demonstrate that spatial phase coherence can serve as a useful tool for thermometric applications, showcasing its sensitivity to temperature variations. These discoveries open new avenues in femtosecond laser spectroscopy, including an alternative single-shot detection scheme, a new form of Raman coherence imaging and molecular species quantification during overlapping fractional revivals.</description>

      <title>The Roadmap of New Capabilities of High-Intensity Lasers in Material Design and Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the current trends of laser applications in material science is using high-intensity lasers to provide fast and efficient surface or volume modifications for achieving controllable material properties, synthesis of novel materials with desired functionalities, and upscaling laser technologies with industry-demanded throughputs. Depending on the parameters, lasers can offer versatile solutions for scientific and industrial applications, starting from exploring the fundamental physics of warm dense matter and molecular chemistry at ultrashort timescales to large-scale fabrication of surfaces with anti-bacterial, tribological, hydrophobic, or hydrophilic properties. The objectives of this Chapter are to provide a review of recent advancements in several laser application fields, which involve high-intensity lasers, both ultrashort (femto- and picosecond) and short (nanosecond). After summarizing general trends in high-intensity laser processing of materials, we will first focus on the new opportunities offered by high-intensity lasers for the controlled synthesis of multielement nanoparticles for catalytic and theranostic applications. Then, the blister-based laser-induced forward transfer (BB-LIFT) technique will be presented, allowing a one-step, high-precision printing of nanomaterials on any substrates. The next section will discuss the selective crystallization of amorphous (as prepared) semiconductor nanoscale materials. The processes enabling high selectivity of crystallization into the desired phase using ultrashort powerful lasers will be analyzed. After that, opportunities for using high-power lasers will be discussed for upscaling surface nanostructuring with high throughput for bio-medical and industrial applications. Finally, an introduction to the Open Access program of the HiLASE Centre, which is targeted at offering users high-intensity beam time, will be given.</description>

      <title>Vectorial Light in Fabry-Perot Resonators in the Normal Dispersion Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ranges of existence and stability of dark cavity-soliton stationary states in a Fabry-Perot resonator with a Kerr nonlinear medium, vectorial polarization components and normal dispersion are determined. The Fabry-Perot configuration introduces nonlocal coupling that shifts the cavity detuning by the round trip average power of the intracavity field. When compared with ring resonators, nonlocal coupling leads to strongly detuned dark cavity solitons that exist over a wide range of detunings. We study symmetry breaking between fields of opposite circular polarization characterized by a codimension-2 bifurcation point unique to the regime of normal group velocity dispersion. We show the spontaneous formation of regular dark soliton crystals separated by Turing patterns of alternating polarization via "self crystallization" due to long range interactions. Frequency combs of dark soliton crystals of two orthogonal polarizations in Fabry-Perot resonators display three separate components corresponding to the cavity repetition rate, the wavelength of the periodic pattern and the soliton lattice spacing. The system also displays the formation of stationary and dynamical vectorial dark-bright solitons. These solutions are different from previous realizations with bichromatic driving in ring resonators, are composed of locked switching fronts and can undergo Hopf bifurcations when scanning the detuning. Interacting oscillating dark-bright solitons display anti-phase dynamics that changes first into quasi-periodic oscillations and then into in-phase dynamics when increasing the cavity length.</description>

      <title>Superluminal Correlations in Ensembles of Optical Phase Singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase singularities are universal features found across diverse wave systems. Their ensembles exhibit distance correlations governing exotic material phases. However, the full correlations in phase-space have remained unexplored and experimentally inaccessible. Here, we directly measure the ultrafast dynamics of optical singularity ensembles, capturing their phase-space correlations. Our observations reveal that phase singularities exhibit acceleration to unbounded velocities before annihilation, indicated by measurements of velocities exceeding the speed of light. These superluminal velocities are paradoxically amplified by the slow group velocity of hyperbolic phonon polaritons in our material platform, hexagonal boron nitride membranes. We demonstrate these phenomena using combined hardware and algorithmic advances in ultrafast electron microscopy, achieving spatial and temporal resolutions each an order of magnitude below the polaritonic wavelength and cycle period. Our findings enable probing topological defect dynamics at previously unattainable timescales, deepening our understanding of phase-singularity universality and suggesting phenomena of ultrafast information flow in polaritonic media.</description>

      <title>Single-shot pulse retrieval of femtosecond bright squeezed vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bright squeezed vacuum (BSV) is an intense quantum state of light with zero mean electric field and huge photon number fluctuations, sufficiently intense to drive extreme nonlinear processes and imprint nonclassical statistics. However, the temporal structure of single BSV shots has not been fully characterized. Here, we retrieve the spectral and temporal pulse characteristics of a set of single-peak BSV shots. It is obtained by realizing a femtosecond BSV source at 1040 nm with a single spatial mode and perform single-shot spectral interferometry with a fully characterized coherent-state reference pulse. Our approach reveals that the group delay is consistent between the various shots, resulting in an average pulse duration of 27.2 fs, much shorter than the pump pulse, and a variation of 5.5 fs (standard deviation). We also observe a characteristic nodal structure in the spectral interferograms, demonstrating the BSV's random phase ambiguity of $\pi$ rad. Our approach demonstrates that BSV is a viable source of femtosecond light pulses for attosecond sub-cycle metrology of ultrafast electron dynamics.</description>

      <title>Single image sensorless adaptive optics for microscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Images obtained by microscopes are generally degraded by aberrations. Adaptive optics (AO) has been widely used in to compensate for aberrations and improve reduced image quality. Requiring no separate wavefront sensor, sensorless AO methods deduce the aberrations from a sequence of images acquired with different phase modulations. Despite that these methods are versatile and flexible, they involve sequential acquisition of multiple images thus time-consuming to implement. Here, we propose a new sensorless AO method based on only a single image. Experimental results on a two-photon fluorescence microscope showed that our method achieved distinct correction while imaging different types of structures under various noise levels with each correction loop taking less than 1 second. This work has significantly accelerated sensorless AO, which will assist its application in many challenging imaging scenarios of microscopy.</description>

      <title>Sub-femtosecond stabilization of multicore fiber for high-fidelity quantum networking at 100% duty cycle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Originally envisioned as a solution for the capacity crunch in telecommunications networks, multicore fibers (MCF) are contributing to scientific fields beyond telecom, such as sensing and metrology. Confined within the same cladding, the cores of MCF have a high degree of noise correlation which can be harnessed for a variety of applications. Here, we investigate MCF as a solution to the challenging problem of quantum and classical light co-existence in quantum networks by operating the quantum and stabilization light in separate but highly correlated cores of a 7-core MCF. Over 40 km of spooled fiber, we achieved 100 attosecond integrated jitter on one core by using phase information derived from another core. This allows for 100% duty cycle on a quantum channel while maintaining a low spurious photon rate from crosstalk between stabilization and quantum channels. With cycle-slip-free stabilization over 6 hours, frequency detuning between designated stabilization and quantum channels, and an additional 40 dB rejection of noise photons provided by the low optical crosstalk between cores, we achieved a Raman scattering-induced spurious photon rate of only 0.01 photons/s in 100 GHz bandwidth. Our results with MCF are a promising approach to ultra-stable quantum networks with 100% duty cycle on the quantum channel.</description>

      <title>A Novel Chiroptical Spectroscopy Technique</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral objects typically exhibit a different extinction for the two circular polarizations of light. Researchers often detect the chirality of objects by measuring this extinction difference employing Circular Dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. In this Letter, we present a new spectroscopy technique for detecting the chirality of spherical objects based on measuring the Stokes parameters at any non-forward angle. The chirality measure we introduce effectively eliminates achiral background noise and is independent of both the object's concentration and the optical path length. Notably, when a solution contains both enantiomers of a chiral object, our method can discern which enantiomer predominates. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the technique is robust and verifiable in-situ by measuring the Stokes vector at two different non-forward angles of choice.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future space-ground communication networks require a seamless fusion of technologies that combine the all-weather reliability of microwave links with the ultra-high data capacity of near-infrared optical systems. Achieving this vision demands compact, robust, and multifunctional hardware, yet monolithic integration of these fundamentally distinct domains has remained elusive. Here, we present the first monolithically integrated silicon photonic chip that bridges microwave and optical domains for dual-band free-space communications and dynamic beamforming. The chip integrates a microwave true time delay (TTD) beamforming network, an optical phased array (OPA) beamforming network, and an optical coherent transceiver, all on a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) platform. By uniting the strengths of microwave resilience, optical bandwidth, and coherent detection sensitivity, this photonic integrated circuit represents a critical step toward reconfigurable, interference-resistant, high-throughput links for satellites, UAVs, and ground stations. Experimental demonstrations confirm two-dimensional dynamic beam steering in both bands 24.9 deg x 18.5 deg at microwave frequencies and 10 deg x 4.7 deg in the optical domain. In a 5-meter free-space link, the chip achieves error-free transmission at 10 Gbps for microwave and 80 Gbps per wavelength in the near infrared band. These results establish integrated microwave photonics as a promising platform for bridging Earth and orbit through compact, dual-band, beamforming-enabled transceivers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of quantum printing -- the imprinting of quantum states from photons and phonons onto quantum matter. The discussion is focusing on charged fluids (metals, superconductors, Hall fluids) and neutral systems (magnets, excitons). We demonstrate how structured light can generate topological excitations, including vortices in superconductors and skyrmions in magnets. We also discuss how quantum printing induces magnetization in quantum paraelectrics and strain-mediated magnetization in Dirac materials. Finally, we propose future applications, such as printing entangled photon states, creating entangled topological excitations, and discuss applications of quantum printing to light induced quantum turbulence in a charged fluid. This review represents the expanded version of the shorter review submitted to Nature Physics.</description>

      <title>Rapid Preparation of Rydberg Superatom W State Using Superadiabatic Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The W state, as a robust multipartite entangled state, plays an important role in quantum information processing, quantum network construction and quantum computing. In this paper, we encode quantum information on the effective energy levels of Rydberg superatoms and propose a fast scheme for preparing the Rydberg superatom W state based on the superadiabatic iterative technique, this scheme can be achieved in only one step by controlling the laser pulses. In the current scheme, the superatoms are trapped in spatially separated cavities connected by optical fibers, which significantly enhances the feasibility of experimental manipulation. A remarkable feature is that it does not require precise control of experimental parameters and interaction time. Meanwhile, the form of the counterdiabatic Hamiltonian is the same as that of the effective Hamiltonian. Through numerical simulations, the fidelity of this scheme can reach 99.94%. Even considering decoherence effects, including atomic spontaneous emission and photon leakage, the fidelity can still exceed 97.5%, further demonstrating the strong robustness of the solution. In addition, the Rabi frequency can be characterized as a linear superposition of Gaussian functions, this representation significantly alleviates the complexity encountered in practical experiments. Futhermore, we also analyzed the impact of parameter fluctuations on the fidelity, the results show that this scheme is robust against parameter fluctuations. At last, the present scheme is extended to the cases of N Rydberg superatoms, which shows the scalability of our scheme.</description>

      <title>One- and two-dimensional solitons under the action of the inverted cubic-quintic nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The usual cubic-quintic (CQ) nonlinearity is proved to sustain one- and two-dimensional (1D and 2D) broad (flat-top) solitons. In this work, we demonstrate that 1D and 2D soliton families can be supported, in the semi-infinite bandgap (SIBG), by the interplay of a lattice potential and the nonlinearity including self-defocusing cubic and self-focusing quintic terms, with the sign combination inverted with respect to the usual CQ nonlinearity. The families include fundamental and dipole solitons in 1D, and fundamental, quadrupole, and vortex solitons in 2D. The power, shapes, and stability of the solitons are reported. The results are strongly affected by the positions of the solitons in SIBG, the families being unstable very close to or very far from the SIBG's edge. The inverted CQ nonlinearity, considered in this work, sustains sharp 1D and 2D stable solitons, which can be naturally used as bit pixels in photonic data-processing applications.</description>

      <title>Free expansion of a charged nanoparticle via electrostatic compensation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coherent wavepacket expansion is a key component of recent proposals aiming to create non-classical states of a levitated dielectric nanoparticle. Free evolution, i.e., releasing the particle from its harmonic trapping potential and allowing its position variance to grow, is a simple but effective expansion scheme, but requires accurate force compensation to avoid significant mean displacements of the wavepacket during the free evolution. Here, using an optical trap-release-recapture sequence, we demonstrate an electrostatic compensation technique that enables free evolution without significant mean displacement in 3D, successfully compensating both gravity and stray electric fields. To achieve 100 microsecond free evolution times with charged particles, we developed methods to map and correct for force cross-talk, as well as to control the environmental charge state. Combined with a low decoherence environment, our approach enables the preparation of largely delocalized states without the need for long freefall trajectories or a low-gravity environment.</description>

      <title>Deciphering the dynamics of the light-induced phase transition in VO$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vanadium dioxide (VO$_2$) is central in the study of ultrafast photoinduced insulator-to-metal phase transitions in strongly correlated materials, and a primary candidate for next-generation light-driven devices. However, the physical mechanism underlying its phase transition remains unresolved. Here, we use single-cycle light transients to perform phase-resolved ultrafast spectroscopy on VO$_2$ crystals. Our experiments reveal two processes: a structural transformation from the insulating monoclinic M1-VO$_2$ phase to the excited metallic rutile R*-VO$_2$ phase, followed by electron thermalization and relaxation dynamics intrinsic to the newly formed excited metallic phase.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Trapping of Cold Atoms with Surface Forces and Blue-Detuned Evanescent Light on a Nanophotonic Waveguide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a novel hybrid nanophotonic trap for cold neutral atoms, leveraging surface forces for attraction and blue-detuned evanescent light for repulsion. We attribute the attractive potential to a combination of Casimir-Polder interactions and electrostatic charges distributed on the waveguide surface. Despite the trap's shallow depth, we efficiently load atoms into it via adiabatic transfer from a conventional two-color dipole trap. Remarkably, the hybrid trap supports a long atomic storage time of 140(9) ms and exhibits a Ramsey coherence time of 16.8(2) ms, the latter exceeding significantly previous reports for nanophotonic systems. Our results pave the way for further exploration of atom-surface interactions at the nanoscale and illustrate the potential of harnessing surface forces to enhance storage and coherence times for atoms coupled to nanophotonic waveguides. This advancement offers new opportunities for neutral-atom quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Distribution of non-Gaussian states in a deployed telecommunication fiber channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical non-Gaussian states hold great promise as a pivotal resource for advanced optical quantum information processing and fault-tolerant long-distance quantum communication. Establishing their faithful transmission in a real-world communication channel, therefore, marks an important milestone. In this study, we experimentally demonstrate the distribution of such non-Gaussian states in a functioning telecommunication channel that connects separate buildings within the DTU campus premises. We send photon-subtracted squeezed states, exhibiting pronounced Wigner negativity, through 300 m of deployed optical fibers to a distant building. Using quantum homodyne tomography, we fully characterize the states upon arrival. Our results show the survival of the Wigner function negativity after transmission when correcting for detection losses, indicating that the established link can potentially facilitate the violation of Bell's inequality and enable quantum steering. This achievement not only validates the practical feasibility of distributing non-Gaussian states in real-world settings, but also provides an exciting impetus towards realizing fully coherent quantum networks for high-dimensional, continuous-variable quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Octave-wide phase-matched four-wave mixing in dispersion engineered crystalline microresonators</title>

      <description>arXiv:1904.04455v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this Letter, we report phase-matched four-wave mixing separated by over one-octave in a dispersion engineered crystalline microresonator. Experimental and numerical results presented here confirm that primary sidebands were generated with a frequency shift up to 140 THz, and that secondary sidebands formed a localized comb structure, known as a clustered comb in the vicinity of the primary sidebands. A theoretical analysis of the phase-matching condition validated our experimental observations, and our results good agree well with numerical simulations. These results offer the potential to realize a frequency tunable comb cluster generator operating from 1 um to mid-infrared wavelengths with a single and compact device.</description>

Abstract: Dissipative Kerr soliton microcombs have inspired various intriguing applications such as spectroscopy, ranging, telecommunication, and high purity microwave generation. Mechanically actuated soliton microcombs provide enhanced controllability and flexibility for Kerr solitons, thus enabling technological progress to be made on such practical applications. Here, we present architectures for coherent dual-comb techniques and ultralow-noise microwave generation by exploiting the mechanical actuation of ultrahigh-Q crystalline microresonators. By unifying a pump laser, we demonstrate highly coherent dual-soliton combs using distinct resonators with slightly different repetition rates. We also report significant phase noise reduction achieved by directly generating Kerr solitons from a sub-Hz linewidth ultrastable laser. This study paves the way for further advancements in a wide variety of applications based on Kerr soliton microcombs.</description>

      <title>Nanoscale positioning and in-situ enhancement of single G center in silicon using a fluorescence-localization technique</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12031v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Silicon-based semiconductor nanofabrication technology has achieved a remarkable level of sophistication and maturity, and color centers in silicon naturally inherit this advantage. Besides, their emissions appear in telecommunication bands, which makes them play a crucial role in the construction of quantum network. To address the challenge of weak spontaneous emission, different optical cavities are fabricated to enhance the emission rate. However, the relative location between cavity and emitter is random, which greatly reduce the success probability of enhancement. Here, we report on a fluorescence-localization technique (FLT) for precisely locating single G center in silicon and embedding it in the center of a circular Bragg grating cavity in situ, achieving 240-times improvement of the success probability. We observe a 30-fold enhancement in luminescence intensity, 2.5-fold acceleration of the emission from single G center, corresponding to a Purcell factor exceeding 11. Our findings pave the way for the large-scale integration of quantum light sources including those with spins.</description>

      <title>Zitterbewegung, momentum and spin dynamics of electromagnetic waves in linear dielectric medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22270v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The momentum of light in dielectric media has been a century-long controversy that continues to attract significant interest. In a linear dielectric medium with refractive index n, the momentum is predicted to be smaller by a factor of n according to Abraham, and larger by the same factor according to Minkowski. By studying the coupled dynamics of electromagnetic waves and dipoles in a dielectric medium, we show that the change in momentum of the dipole, expressed by the Lorentz force, corresponds to the Abraham momentum and is given by the expectation value of the spin-projected momentum vector. On the other hand, the Minkowski momentum is obtained as the magnitude of the spin-projected momentum vector from the energy-momentum dispersion relation derived by diagonalizing the coupled Hamiltonian and determines the direction of refraction in accordance with Snell's law. Our model also predicts a zitterbewegung-like oscillation due to helicity mixing between left- and right-handed wave components, mediated by dipole oscillation. These internal wave dynamics may be observable via wavepacket motion or polarization-sensitive measurements.</description>

Abstract: AMTIR-1 chalcogenide glass has shown its potential for use in thermal imaging systems owing to its low refractive index, thermal resistance and high transparency across the infrared wavelength regime. Here we report a millimeter-scale high-Q whispering gallery mode microresonator made of AMTIR-1. The recorded Q-factor has reached $1.2\times10^7$ at 1550 nm, which is almost two-orders of magnitude higher than previously reported values. We characterize the thermal properties, where low thermal conductivity plays an important role in thermal resonance tuning. We further show that AMTIR-1 resonators support anomalous dispersion as well as a low absorption coefficient near the 7~\textmu m wavelength band, thus offering the possibility of providing suitable platforms for mid-infrared, long-wave infrared nonlinear optics including microresonator frequency comb generation.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive study on beam dynamics inside symmetrically chirped waveguide array mimicking the graded index media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00901v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we explore the beam dynamics within symmetrically chirped nonlinear waveguide arrays, focusing on linear and quadratic chirping schemes. We propose a practical structure for these arrays that enhances control over light propagation. By employing a continuous approximation of the discrete nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (DNLSE), we utilize a semi-analytical variational method to analyze beam behavior under waveguide chirping. Our findings indicate that the symmetrically chirped waveguide arrays behave similarly to graded index systems, with varying coupling coefficients analogous to the refractive index in continuous media. We derive a steady-state solution and validate it against numerical simulations, alongside conducting a linear stability analysis to assess the robustness of these solutions. The results reveal that input Gaussian beams in such waveguide arrays follow an oscillatory trajectory akin to that in parabolic index media. Notably, under nonlinear conditions, these beams evolve as discrete solitons. Our rigorous investigation of the propagation characteristics in both linear and nonlinear regimes highlights the intricate dynamics of optical beams within the engineered chirped waveguide arrays, supported by comparisons to comprehensive numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Detection of the laser induced damage using a He Ne laser reflective imaging technique</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.10217v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Laser-induced damage is a serious challenge for optical components; therefore, determining the laser-induced damage threshold (LIDT) is a crucial step in the manufacturing process. In many cases, such as for space applications, it is also necessary to account for the vacuum environment. Since conventional damage detection methods face limitations under vacuum conditions, an alternative approach is required. This article introduces a He-Ne laser imaging system designed for in-situ damage detection within a LIDT station. The system enables fourfold magnification imaging of the test sample and its surroundings without placing imaging optics inside the vacuum chamber, thereby preserving the cleanliness of the chamber. The detection method can be applied to both transparent and opaque samples; in transparent optics, damage is observable from either side. To verify the system's functionality, two sample types were investigated: a silica wafer (non-transparent for He-Ne radiation) and a commonly used dielectric mirror for 1030 nm (transparent for He-Ne radiation). Particular attention was devoted to determining the minimum damage size that can be reliably recognized. The system successfully distinguished damage features as small as 35 ${\mu}$m.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Source and Detection Noises in Auto-correlative Weak-Value Amplification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.12732v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Weak-value amplification (WVA) is a post-selection-based technique that amplifies weak physical signals by preparing nearly orthogonal pre- and post-selected quantum states. It is intrinsically limited by various kinds of technical noise, which distorts amplified weak values, especially when discarding photons in post-selection. While prior work established the efficacy of auto-correlative weak-value amplification (AWVA) under Gaussian noise, practical implementations face challenges from band-limited laser-source noise and detection noise. Here, we demonstrate that the AWVA protocol robustly suppresses both laser-power fluctuations and detection noise. Numerical experiments in Simulink further reveal AWVA dual advantage. Under high-power conditions, the noise-reduction superiority of AWVA over WVA becomes increasingly pronounced as input laser power increases. In detection-limited regimes, AWVA achieves an order-of-magnitude lower uncertainty, closely approaching the Cramer-Rao bound. This work demonstrates that AWVA improves precision in both high-power laser-noise-dominated and photon-starved regimes, thereby bridging these operating extremes and advancing precision in applications from gravitational-wave detection to hybrid quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Lossless Postselected Quantum Metrology with Quasi-pure Mixed States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00405v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Postselection can compress the metrological information and improve sensitivity in the presence of certain types of technical noise. Postselected quantum metrology with pure states has been significantly advanced recently. However, extending this framework to mixed states leads to formidable challenges, such as the difficulty in searching for lossless postselection measurements or even the loss of metrological information. In this work, we leverage the intuition for the lossless postselection of pure states and generalize the theory to the lossless postselection of a class of mixed states, dubbed quasi-pure states. We illustrate our findings in postselected quantum imaging, unitary estimation problems, and show that the quasi-pure structure can be universally engineered through only classical correlation with an ancilla. Our findings extend the utility of postselection techniques to scenarios with decoherence and also offer new perspectives to foundational questions in quantum information geometry.</description>

      <title>Dynamical thermalization, Rayleigh-Jeans condensate, vortexes and wave collapse in quantum chaos fibers and fluid of light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06534v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study analytically and numerically the time evolution of a nonlinear field described by the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation in a chaotic $D$-shape billiard. In absence of nonlinearity the system has standard properties of quantum chaos. This model describes a longitudinal light propagation in a multimode D-shape optical fiber and also those in a Kerr nonlinear medium of atomic vapor. We show that, above a certain chaos border of nonlinearity, chaos leads to dynamical thermalization with the Rayleigh-Jeans thermal distribution and the formation of the Rayleigh-Jeans condensate in a vicinity of the ground state accumulating in it about 80-90\% of total probability. Certain similarities of this phenomenon with the Fr\"ohlich condensate are discussed. Below the chaos border the dynamics is quasi-integrable corresponding to the Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser integrability. We describe also the time evolution during the process of relaxation to the thermal state and the time dependence of quantum von Neumann and classical Boltzmann entropies during this process. At a strong focusing nonlinearity we show that the wave collapse can take place even at sufficiently high positive energy being very different from the open space case. Finally for the defocusing case we establish the superfluid regime for vortex dynamics at strong nonlinearity. System parameters for optical fiber experimental studies of these effects are also discussed.</description>
