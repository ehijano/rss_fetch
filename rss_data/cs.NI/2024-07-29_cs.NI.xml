      <title>Active Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface-Aided Terahertz Wireless Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Terahertz (THz) communication is expected to be a key technology for future sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks. Furthermore, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) have been proposed to modify the wireless propagation environment and enhance system performance. Given the sensitivity to blockages and limited coverage range, RIS is particularly promising for THz communications. Active RIS can overcome the multiplicative fading effect in RIS-aided communications. In this paper, we explore active RIS-assisted THz communications. We formulate the ergodic rate, considering factors associated with active RIS, including active noise and signal amplification, and THz signals, including molecular absorption and beam misalignment</description>

      <title>MicroOpt: Model-driven Slice Resource Optimization in 5G and Beyond Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A pivotal attribute of 5G networks is their capability to cater to diverse application requirements. This is achieved by creating logically isolated virtual networks, or slices, with distinct service level agreements (SLAs) tailored to specific use cases. However, efficiently allocating resources to maintain slice SLA is challenging due to varying traffic and QoS requirements. Traditional peak traffic-based resource allocation leads to over-provisioning, as actual traffic rarely peaks. Additionally, the complex relationship between resource allocation and QoS in end-to-end slices spanning different network segments makes conventional optimization techniques impractical. Existing approaches in this domain use network models or simulations and various optimization methods but struggle with optimality, tractability, and generalizability across different slice types. In this paper, we propose MicroOpt, a novel framework that leverages a differentiable neural network-based slice model with gradient descent for resource optimization and Lagrangian decomposition for QoS constraint satisfaction. We evaluate MicroOpt against two state-of-the-art approaches using an open-source 5G testbed with real-world traffic traces. Our results demonstrate up to 21.9% improvement in resource allocation compared to these approaches across various scenarios, including different QoS thresholds and dynamic slice traffic.</description>

      <title>RRO: A Regularized Routing Optimization Algorithm for Enhanced Throughput and Low Latency with Efficient Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving landscape of wireless networks, achieving enhanced throughput with low latency for data transmission is crucial for future communication systems. While low complexity OSPF-type solutions have shown effectiveness in lightly-loaded networks, they often falter in the face of increasing congestion. Recent approaches have suggested utilizing backpressure and deep learning techniques for route optimization. However, these approaches face challenges due to their high implementation and computational complexity, surpassing the capabilities of networks with limited hardware devices.
  A key challenge is developing algorithms that improve throughput and reduce latency while keeping complexity levels compatible with OSPF. In this collaborative research between Ben-Gurion University and Ceragon Networks Ltd., we address this challenge by developing a novel approach, dubbed Regularized Routing Optimization (RRO). The RRO algorithm offers both distributed and centralized implementations with low complexity, making it suitable for integration into 5G and beyond technologies, where no significant changes to the existing protocols are needed. It increases throughput while ensuring latency remains sufficiently low through regularized optimization. We analyze the computational complexity of RRO and prove that it converges with a level of complexity comparable to OSPF. Extensive simulation results across diverse network topologies demonstrate that RRO significantly outperforms existing methods.</description>

      <title>Design and demonstration of an operating system for executing applications on quantum network nodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The goal of future quantum networks is to enable new internet applications that are impossible to achieve using solely classical communication. Up to now, demonstrations of quantum network applications and functionalities on quantum processors have been performed in ad-hoc software that was specific to the experimental setup, programmed to perform one single task (the application experiment) directly into low-level control devices using expertise in experimental physics. Here, we report on the design and implementation of the first architecture capable of executing quantum network applications on quantum processors in platform-independent high-level software. We demonstrate the architecture's capability to execute applications in high-level software, by implementing it as a quantum network operating system -- QNodeOS -- and executing test programs including a delegated computation from a client to a server on two quantum network nodes based on nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond. We show how our architecture allows us to maximize the use of quantum network hardware, by multitasking different applications on a quantum network for the first time. Our architecture can be used to execute programs on any quantum processor platform corresponding to our system model, which we illustrate by demonstrating an additional driver for QNodeOS for a trapped-ion quantum network node based on a single $^{40}\text{Ca}^+$ atom. Our architecture lays the groundwork for computer science research in the domain of quantum network programming, and paves the way for the development of software that can bring quantum network technology to society.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Device Heterogeneity in Grant-Free Random Access: A Data-Driven Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Grant-free random access (GFRA) is now a popular protocol for large-scale wireless multiple access systems in order to reduce control signaling. Resource allocation in GFRA can be viewed as a form of frame slotted ALOHA, where a ubiquitous design assumption is device homogeneity. In particular, the probability that a device seeks to transmit data is common to all devices. Recently, there has been an interest in designing frame slotted ALOHA algorithms for networks with heterogeneous activity probabilities. These works have established that the throughput can be significantly improved over the standard uniform allocation. However, the algorithms for optimizing the probability a device accesses each slot require perfect knowledge of the active devices within each frame. In practice, this assumption is limiting as device identification algorithms in GFRA rarely provide activity estimates with zero errors. In this paper, we develop a new algorithm based on stochastic gradient descent for optimizing slot allocation probabilities in the presence of activity estimation errors. Our algorithm exploits importance weighted bias mitigation for stochastic gradient estimates, which is shown to provably converge to a stationary point of the throughput optimization problem. In moderate size systems, our simulations show that the performance of our algorithm depends on the type of error distribution. We study symmetric bit flipping, asymmetric bit flipping and errors resulting from a generalized approximate message passing (GAMP) algorithm. In these scenarios, we observe gains up to 40\%, 66\%, and 19\%, respectively.</description>

      <title>Joint Slot and Power Optimization for Grant Free Random Access with Unknown and Heterogeneous Device Activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Grant Free Random Access (GFRA) is a popular protocol in the Internet of Things (IoT) to reduce the control signaling. GFRA is a framed protocol where each frame is split into two parts: device identification; and data transmission part which can be viewed as a form of Frame Slotted ALOHA (FSA). A common assumption in FSA is device homogeneity; that is the probability that a device seeks to transmit data in a particular frame is common for all devices and independent of the other devices. Recent work has investigated the possibility of tuning the FSA protocol to the statistics of the network by changing the probability for a particular device to access a particular slot. However, power control with a successive interference cancellation (SIC) receiver has not yet been considered to further increase the performance of the tuned FSA protocols. In this paper, we propose algorithms to jointly optimize both the slot selection and the transmit power of the devices to minimize the outage of the devices in the network. We show via a simulation study that our algorithms can outperform baselines (including slotted ALOHA) in terms of expected number of devices transmitting without outage and in term of transmit power.</description>

      <title>A Physical-Layer Orchestration Framework for Open System Models of Autonomous RISs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.10858v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To obviate the control of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) and related overhead, recent works envisioned the concept of autonomous RISs: Intelligent devices capable of autonomously deciding their reflection states. This paradigm is enabled by hybrid RIS (HRIS), a hardware solution that integrates sensing and channel estimation (CHEST) capabilities, enabling autonomous operation. Autonomous RISs operate independently alongside other network entities, promoting open communication system models for RISs. However, this autonomy introduces a significant challenge: How to schedule the operation of the autonomous RIS over time and frequency to minimize its impact on the network? This paper introduces a physical layer (PHY) orchestration framework within a massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) network to address this challenge. Our framework highlights an engineering trade-off termed the "autonomous RIS trade-off," which examines the performance implications of autonomy. Through mathematical analysis and numerical results, we describe the HRIS feasibility region, illustrating the conditions under which autonomous RISs are viable when properly deployed.</description>
