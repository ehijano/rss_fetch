      <title>Origin of light-induced metastability in ZrTe$_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the non-equilibrium electronic structure of a model Dirac semimetal ZrTe$_5$ by using time-and-angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy and density functional theory-based electron and phonon calculations. By measuring the electronic dispersion near the $\Gamma$ point at time delays up to 10 picoseconds, we discovered that the band spectral weight does not recover during the measured temporal window, revealing the existence of light induced metastable state in the electronic structure of this material. Our calculations find that the photoexcited $A_{1g}$ phonon mode lead to a band renormalization that both supports our experimental observations at the zone center and predicts changes to the band structure outside of our experimental window, ultimately showing the evolution from a direct to an indirect gap semimetal; such band renormalization dramatically reduces the electron-hole recombination rate giving rise to the metastability in this system.</description>

      <title>Noninvasive identification of carbon-based black pigments with pump-probe microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Carbon-based black pigments, a widely used class of pigments, are difficult to differentiate with the noninvasive techniques currently used in cultural heritage science. We utilize pump-probe microscopy to distinguish four common carbon-based black pigments as pure pigments, as two-component black pigment mixtures, and as a mixture of a black and a colorful pigment. This work also demonstrates that even nominally homogeneous pigments present remarkable, and useful, heterogeneity in pump-probe microscopy.</description>

      <title>Impacts of Point Defects on Shallow Doping in Cubic Boron Arsenide: A First Principles Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cubic boron arsenide (BAs) stands out as a promising material for advanced electronics, thanks to its exceptional thermal conductivity and ambipolar mobility. However, effective control of p- and n-type doping in BAs poses a significant challenge, mostly as a result of the influence of defects. In the present study, we employed density functional theory to explore the impacts of the common point defects and impurity on p-type doping Be$_\text{B}$ and Si$_\text{As}$, and n-type doping Si$_\text{B}$ and Se$_\text{As}$. We find that the most favorable points defects formed by C, O, and Si are C$_\text{As}$, O$_\text{B}$O$_\text{As}$, Si$_\text{As}$, C$_\text{As}$Si$_\text{B}$, and O$_\text{B}$Si$_\text{As}$, which have formation energies of less than $1.5$ eV. For p-type doping, C, O, and Si impurities do not harm the shallow state of Be$_\text{B}$ doping, while only O impurity detrimentally affects Si$_\text{As}$ doping. However for n-type dopings, C, O, and Si impurities are all harmful. Interestingly, the antisite defect pair As$_\text{B}$B$_\text{As}$ benefits both p- and n-type doping. The doping limitation analysis presented in this study can potentially pave the way for strategic development in the area of BAs-based electronics.</description>

      <title>A Processing Route to Chalcogenide Perovskites Alloys with Tunable Band Gap via Anion Exchange</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate synthesis of BaZr(S,Se)3 chalcogenide perovskite alloys by selenization of BaZrS3 thin films. The anion-exchange process produces films with tunable composition and band gap without changing the orthorhombic perovskite crystal structure or the film microstructure. The direct band gap is tunable between 1.5 and 1.9 eV. The alloy films made in this way feature 100x stronger photoconductive response and a lower density of extended defects, compared to alloy films made by direct growth. The perovskite structure is stable in high-selenium-content thin films with and without epitaxy. The manufacturing-compatible process of selenization in H2Se gas may spur the development of chalcogenide perovskite solar cell technology.</description>

      <title>Quantum emitters in van der Waals {\alpha}-MoO3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum emitters in solid-state materials are highly promising building blocks for quantum information processing and communication science. Recently, single-photon emission from van der Waals materials has been reported in transition metal dichalcogenides and hexagonal boron nitride, exhibiting the potential to realize photonic quantum technologies in two-dimensional materials. Here, we report the observation of single-photon generation from exfoliated and thermally annealed single crystals of van der Waals {\alpha}-MoO3. The second-order correlation function measurement displays a clear photon antibunching, while the luminescence intensity exceeds 100 kcounts/s and remains stable under laser excitation. Also, the zero-phonon lines of these emitters are distributed in a spectrally narrow energy range. The theoretical calculation suggests that an oxygen vacancy defect is a possible candidate for the observed emitters. Together with photostability and brightness, quantum emitters in {\alpha}-MoO3 provide a new avenue to realize photon-based quantum information science in van der Waals materials.</description>

      <title>Effects of Structural Variations to X-ray Absorption Spectra of g-C$_3$N$_4$: Insights from DFT and TDDFT Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) is widely employed for structure characterization of graphitic carbon nitride (g-C$_3$N$_4$) and its composites. Nevertheless, even for pure g-C$_3$N$_4$, discrepancies in energy and profile exist across different experiments, which can be attributed to variations in structures arising from diverse synthesis conditions and calibration procedures. Here, we conducted a theoretical investigation on XAS of three representative g-C$_3$N$_4$ structures (planar, corrugated, and micro-corrugated) optimized with different strategies, to understand the structure-spectroscopy relation. Different methods were compared, including density functional theory (DFT) with the full (FCH) or equivalent (ECH) core-hole approximation, as well as the time-dependent DFT (TDDFT). FCH was responsible for getting accurate absolute absorption energy; while ECH and TDDFT aided in interpreting the spectra, through ECH-state canonical molecular orbitals (ECH-CMOs) and natural transition orbitals (NTOs), respectively. With each method, the spectra at the three structures show evident differences, which can be correlated to different individual experiments or in between. Our calculations explained the structural reason behind the spectral discrepancies among different experiments. Moreover, profiles predicted by these methods also displayed consistency, so their differences can be used as a reliable indicator of their accuracy. Both ECH-CMOs and NTO particle orbitals led to similar graphics, validating their applicability in interpreting the transitions. This work provides a comprehensive analysis of the structure-XAS relation for g-C$_3$N$_4$, provides concrete explanations for the spectral differences reported in various experiments, and offers insight for future structure dynamical and transient X-ray spectral analyses.</description>

      <title>An FFT based approach to account for elastic interactions in OkMC: Application to dislocation loops in iron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Object kinetic Montecarlo (OkMC) is a fundamental tool for modeling defect evolution in volumes and times far beyond atomistic models. The elastic interaction between defects is classically considered using a dipolar approximation but this approach is limited to simple cases and can be inaccurate for large and close interacting defects. In this work a novel framework is proposed to include "exact" elastic interactions between defects in OkMC valid for any type of defect and anisotropic media. In this method, the elastic interaction energy of a defect is computed by volume integration of its elastic strain multiplied by the stress created by all the other defects, being both fields obtained numerically using a FFT solver. The resulting interaction energies reproduce analytical elastic solutions and show the limited accuracy of dipole approaches for close and large defects.
  The OkMC framework proposed is used to simulate the evolution in space and time of self-interstitial atoms and dislocation loops in iron. It is found that including the anisotropy has a quantitative effect in the evolution of all the type of defects studied. Regarding dislocation loops, it is observed that using the "exact" interaction energy result in higher interactions than using the dipole approximation for close loops.</description>

      <title>A resistive electron irradiation microsensor made from conductive electrospun polycaprolactone fibers loaded with carbon nanotubes and fullerene C60</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work an electron radiation detector microdevices were fabricated and characterized. The devices consisted of a conductive electrospun mat made of polycaprolactone loaded with multiwalled carbon nanotubes and fullerene C60 deposited onto gold interdigitated microelectrodes. They were capable of permanently increase their conductivity upon exposure to electron beam irradiation from 0.02 pC/{\mu}m2 accelerated at 10 and 20 keV. This phenomenon could be explained due to the ability of C60 to trap and stabilize negative charges and thus contribute to the conductivity of the polymer composite. The devices achieved their maximum conductivity at an irradiation between 0.22 and 0.27 pC/{\mu}m2 and this maximum was dependent of the electron acceleration. Montecarlo simulations were performed to explain dependence as function of electron penetration in the polymer composite. Moreover, the devices irradiated at 20keV maintained their final conductivity and the devices irradiated at 10keV increased their final conductivity after 6 days from irradiation. Fullerenes proved to act as highly efficient electron scavengers within the polymer composite and contribute to its conductivity, and the microdevice has potential application as beta radiation sensors.</description>

      <title>Low-coercive-field ferroelectric hafnia with mobile domain walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The high coercive field ($\mathcal{E}_c$) of hafnia-based ferroelectrics presents a major obstacle to their applications. The ferroelectric switching mechanisms in hafnia that dictate $\mathcal{E}_c$, especially those related to nucleation-and-growth at the domain wall (DW), have remained elusive. Through deep-learning-assisted multiscale simulations, we determine the finite-temperature thermodynamics and switching mechanisms for diverse types of 180$^\circ$ DWs, revealing a complex, stress-sensitive mobility landscape. The propagation velocities for mobile DW types under various thermal conditions can be characterized with a single creep equation, featuring a creep exponent of 2. This unconventional critical exponent results from the nucleation of a half-unit-cell-thin, elliptically-shaped critical nucleus. Our multiscale approach not only reproduces the experimental thickness ($d$) scaling, $\mathcal{E}_c\propto d^{-\frac{2}{3}}$, but also predicts that $\mathcal{E}_c$ of HfO$_2$ can be engineered to $\approx$0.1 MV/cm, even lower than perovskite ferroelectrics. The theoretical lower bound of $\mathcal{E}_c$ afforded by ferroelectric hafnia offers opportunities to realize power-efficient, high-fidelity ferroelectric nanoelectronics.</description>

      <title>Fracture of the $C$15 CaAl$_2$ Laves phase at small length-scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cubic $C$15 CaAl$_2$ Laves phase is a crucial brittle intermetallic precipitate in Mg-Al-Ca alloys. Although knowledge of the mechanical properties of coexisting phases is essential for improved alloy design, the fracture toughness is not yet studied experimentally due to the need for miniaturised testing. Here, micropillar splitting and microcantilever bending are used to experimentally determine the toughness of CaAl$_2$. It is found that the toughness value of ~1 $MPa\cdot\sqrt m$ from pillar splitting is largely insensitive to sample heat treatment, ion beam used for fabrication, micropillar diameter, and surface orientation. From nanoindentation supported by electron channelling contrast imaging and backscatter diffraction, fracture is observed to take place mostly on {011} planes. Atomistic fracture simulations on a model $C$15 Laves phase showed that the preference of {011} cleavage planes over the more energetically favourable {111} is due to lattice trapping and kinetics controlling fracture. Using rectangular microcantilever bending tests where the notch plane was misoriented to the closest possible {112} cleavage plane by ~8{\deg}, and the closest {001}, {011} and {111} plane by &gt;20{\deg}, a toughness of ca. 2 $MPa\cdot\sqrt m$ was determined along with the electron microscopy observation of significant deviations of the crack path, demonstrating that preferential crystallographic cleavage planes determine the toughness in this material. Further investigation using pentagonal microcantilevers with precise alignment of the notch with the cleavage planes revealed similar fracture toughness values for different low-index planes. The results presented here are the first detailed experimental study of fracture toughness of the $C$15 CaAl$_2$ Laves phase, and can be understood in terms of crack plane and crack front dependent fracture toughness.</description>

      <title>Toroidal orders and related phenomena in nonmagnetic and magnetic materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this short article, we overview a concept of electronic toroidal multipoles, and their ordering with associated physical properties in non-magnetic and magnetic materials. The toroidal multipoles are introduced as microscopic electronic variables in view of symmetry and connection to Dirac theory. They are classified according to crystallographic and magnetic point groups, which allows us to discuss various possible cross correlations in a transparent and unified manner. The representative examples of toroidal orders and related phenomena, and the mutual relationship between these orders are given, with focusing on monopoles and dipoles. The concept of toroidal multipoles would promote future studies toward observations and identifications of unknown electronic phases and their related physical phenomena.</description>

      <title>A general-purpose neural network potential for Ti-Al-Nb alloys towards large-scale molecular dynamics with ab initio accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High Nb-containing TiAl alloys exhibit exceptional high-temperature strength and room-temperature ductility, making them widely used in hot-section components of automotive and aerospace engines. However, the lack of accurate interatomic interaction potentials for large-scale modeling severely hampers a comprehensive understanding of the failure mechanism of Ti-Al-Nb alloys and the development of strategies to enhance the mechanical properties. Here, we develop a general-purpose machine-learned potential (MLP) for the Ti-Al-Nb ternary system by combining the neural evolution potentials framework with an active learning scheme. The developed MLP, trained on extensive first-principles datasets, demonstrates remarkable accuracy in predicting various lattice and defect properties, as well as high-temperature characteristics such as thermal expansion and melting point for TiAl systems. Notably, this potential can effectively describe the key effect of Nb doping on stacking fault energies and formation energies. Of practical importance is that our MLP enables large-scale molecular dynamics simulations involving tens of millions of atoms with ab initio accuracy, achieving an outstanding balance between computational speed and accuracy. These results pave the way for studying micro-mechanical behaviors in TiAl lamellar structures and developing high-performance TiAl alloys towards applications at elevated temperatures.</description>

      <title>HEX: High-pressure Elemental Xstals, a complete Database</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces the HEX (High-pressure Elemental Xstals) database, a complete database of the ground-state crystal structures of the first 57 elements of the periodic table, from H to La, at 0, 100, 200 and 300 GPa. HEX aims to provide a unified reference for high-pressure research, by compiling all available experimental information on elements at high pressure, and complementing it with the results of accurate evolutionary crystal structure prediction runs based on Density Functional Theory. Besides offering a much-needed reference, our work also serves as a benchmark of the accuracy of current ab-initio methods for crystal structure prediction. We find that, in 98 % of the cases in which experimental information is available, ab-initio crystal structure prediction yields structures which either coincide or are degenerate in enthalpy to within 300 K with experimental ones. The main manuscript contains synthetic tables and figures, while the Crystallographic Information File (cif) for all structures will be available on a figshare online repository when the paper will be published.</description>

      <title>Generative reconstruction of 3D volume elements for Ti-6Al-4V basketweave microstructure by optimization of CNN-based microstructural descriptors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a methodology for the generative reconstruction of 3D Volume Elements (VE) for numerical multiscale analysis of Ti-6Al-4V processed by Additive Manufacturing (AM). The basketweave morphology, which is typically dominant in AM-processed Ti-6Al-4V, is analyzed in conventional Electron Backscatter Diffusion (EBSD) micrographs. Prior \b{eta}-grain reconstruction is performed to obtain the out-of-plane orientation of the observed grains leveraging Burgers orientation relationship. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) - based microstructure descriptors are extracted from the 2D data, and used for cross-section-based optimization of pixel values on orthogonal planes in 3D, using the Microstructure Characterization and Reconstruction (MCR) implementation MCRpy [16]. In order to utilize MCRpy, which performs best for binary systems, the basketweave microstructure, which consists of up to twelve distinct grain orientations, is decomposed into several separate two-phase systems. Our reconstructions capture key characteristics of the titanium basketweave morphology and show qualitative resemblance to experimentally obtained 3D data. The preservation of volume fraction during assembly of the reconstruction remains an unadressed challenge at this stage.</description>

      <title>Efficient Matching Boundary Conditions of Two-dimensional Honeycomb Lattice for Atomic Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we design a series of matching boundary conditions for a two-dimensional compound honeycomb lattice, which has an explicit and simple form, high computing efficiency and good effectiveness of suppressing boundary reflections. First, we formulate the dynamic equations and calculate the dispersion relation for the harmonic honeycomb lattice, then symmetrically choose specific atoms near the boundary to design different forms of matching boundary conditions. The boundary coefficients are determined by matching a residual function at some selected wavenumbers. Several atomic simulations are performed to test the effectiveness of matching boundary conditions in the example of a harmonic honeycomb lattice and a nonlinear honeycomb lattice with the FPU-$\beta$ potential. Numerical results illustrate that low-order matching boundary conditions mainly treat long waves, while the high-order matching boundary conditions can efficiently suppress short waves and long waves simultaneously. Decaying kinetic energy curves indicate the stability of matching boundary conditions in numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Electrically Tunable Spin Exchange Splitting in Graphene Hybrid Heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graphene, with spin and valley degrees of freedom, fosters unexpected physical and chemical properties for the realization of next-generation quantum devices. However, the spin symmetry of graphene is rather robustly protected, hampering manipulation of the spin degrees of freedom for the application of spintronic devices such as electric gate tunable spin filters. We demonstrate that a hybrid heterostructure composed of graphene and LaCoO3 epitaxial thin film exhibits an electrically tunable spin exchange splitting. The large and adjustable spin exchange splitting of 155.9 - 306.5 meV was obtained by the characteristic shifts in both the spin symmetry broken quantum Hall states and the Shubnikov-de-Haas oscillations. Strong hybridization induced charge transfer across the hybrid heterointerface has been identified for the observed spin exchange splitting. The substantial and facile controllability of the spin exchange splitting provides an opportunity for spintronics applications with the electrically-tunable spin polarization in hybrid heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Robust Chemiresistive Behavior in Conductive Polymer/MOF Composites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising materials for gas sensing but are often limited to single-use detection. We demonstrate a hybridization strategy synergistically deploying conductive MOFs (cMOFs) and conductive polymers (cPs) as two complementary mixed ionic-electronic conductors in high-performing stand-alone chemiresistors. Our work presents significant improvement in i) sensor recovery kinetics, ii) cycling stability, and iii) dynamic range at room temperature. We demonstrate the effect of hybridization across well-studied cMOFs based on 2,3,6,7,10,11-hexahydroxytriphenylene (HHTP) and 2,3,6,7,10,11-hexaiminotripphenylene (HITP) ligands with varied metal nodes (Co, Cu, Ni). We conduct a comprehensive mechanistic study to relate energy band alignments at the heterojunctions between the MOFs and the polymer with sensing thermodynamics and binding kinetics. Our findings reveal that hole enrichment of the cMOF component upon hybridization leads to selective enhancement in desorption kinetics, enabling significantly improved sensor recovery at room temperature, and thus long-term response retention. This mechanism was further supported by density functional theory calculations on sorbate-analyte interactions. We also find that alloying cPs and cMOFs enables facile thin film co-processing and device integration, potentially unlocking the use of these hybrid conductors in diverse electronic applications.</description>

      <title>Model order reduction for transient coupled diffusion-deformation of hydrogels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study introduces a reduced-order model (ROM) for analyzing the transient diffusion-deformation of hydrogels. The full-order model (FOM) describing hydrogel transient behavior consists of a coupled system of partial differential equations in which chemical potential and displacements are coupled. This system is formulated in a monolithic fashion and solved using the Finite Element Method (FEM). The ROM employs proper orthogonal decomposition as a model order reduction approach. We test the ROM performance through benchmark tests on hydrogel swelling behavior and a case study simulating co-axial printing. Finally, we embed the ROM into an optimization problem to identify the model material parameters of the coupled problem using full-field data. We verify that the ROM can predict hydrogels' diffusion-deformation evolution and material properties, significantly reducing computation time compared to the FOM. The results demonstrate the ROM's accuracy and computational efficiency. This work paths the way towards advanced practical applications of ROMs, e.g., in the context of feedback error control in hydrogel 3D printing.</description>

      <title>A comparative analysis of transient finite-strain coupled diffusion-deformation theories for hydrogels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a comparative review and classification between some well-known thermodynamically consistent models of hydrogel behavior in a large deformation setting, specifically focusing on solvent absorption/desorption and its impact on mechanical deformation and network swelling. The proposed discussion addresses formulation aspects, general mathematical classification of the governing equations, and numerical implementation issues based on the finite element method. The theories are presented in a unified framework demonstrating that, despite not being evident in some cases, all of them follow equivalent thermodynamic arguments. A detailed numerical analysis is carried out where Taylor-Hood elements are employed in the spatial discretization to satisfy the inf-sup condition and to prevent spurious numerical oscillations. The resulting discrete problems are solved using the FEniCS platform through consistent variational formulations, employing both monolithic and staggered approaches. We conduct benchmark tests on various hydrogel structures, demonstrating that major differences arise from the chosen volumetric response of the hydrogel. The significance of this choice is frequently underestimated in the state-of-the-art literature but has been shown to have substantial implications on the resulting hydrogel behavior.</description>

      <title>Alternant Hydrocarbon Diradicals as Optically Addressable Molecular Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-spin molecules allow for bottom-up qubit design and are promising platforms for magnetic sensing and quantum information science. Optical addressability of molecular electron spins has also been proposed in first-row transition metal complexes via optically-detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) mechanisms analogous to the diamond-NV colour centre. However, significantly less progress has been made on the front of metal-free molecules, which can deliver lower costs and milder environmental impacts. At present, most luminescent open-shell organic molecules are {\pi}-diradicals, but such systems often suffer from poor ground-state open-shell characters necessary to realise a stable molecular qubit. In this work, we propose the use of alternancy symmetry to selectively minimise radical-radical interactions in the ground state, generating {\pi}-systems with high diradical characters. We call them m-dimers, referencing the need to covalently link two benzylic radicals at their meta carbon atoms for the desired symmetry. Through a detailed electronic structure analysis, we find that the excited states of alternant hydrocarbon m-diradicals contain important symmetries that can be used to construct ODMR mechanisms. The molecular parameters are set in the context of a tris(2,4,6-trichlorophenyl)methyl (TTM) radical dimer covalently tethered at the meta position, demonstrating the feasibility of realising a molecular colour centre with alternant {\pi}-diradicals.</description>

      <title>Topological Optical Spin Injection Beyond Regular Weyl semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photoinduced effects are now reckoned to be important tools to reveal a rich gamut of entrancing physics in topological materials, which are normally inaccessible via conventional probes. Here we investigate one of these intriguing effects, namely, {\it optical spin injection} (OSI) beyond the regular Weyl semimetal (WSM), specifically in multi- and higher-order WSMs. Remarkably, we demonstrate that OSI in multi-WSMs can emerge as a frequency-independent quantized response engendered by band linearity and topological charge associated with the node. Interestingly, the frequency independence can be destroyed by going beyond the first-order topological phase. We show that the OSI response is accompanied by peaks for the first-order Weyl nodes while dips for the second-order Weyl nodes. In addition, we elucidate the behavior of OSI in type-II Weyl phases. The predicted signatures of OSI beyond the regular WSM, i.e., multi- and higher-order WSM, could be experimentally exploited, leading us to effectively access as well as distinguish different-order nontrivial Weyl topology.</description>

      <title>Quantum effects in the H-bond symmetrization and in the thermodynamic properties of high pressure ice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the structural and thermodynamic properties of high-pressure ice by incorporating quantum anharmonicity at a non-perturbative level. Quantum fluctuations reduce the critical pressure of the phase transition between phase VIII (with asymmetric H-bonds) and phase X (with symmetric H-bonds) by 65 GPa from its classical value of 116 GPa at 0K. Moreover, quantum effects make it temperature-independent over a wide temperature range (0K-300K), in agreement with experimental estimates obtained through vibrational spectroscopy and in striking contrast to the strong temperature dependence found in the classical approximation. The equation of state shows fingerprints of the transition in accordance with experimental evidence. Additionally, we demonstrate that, within our approach, proton disorder in phase VII has a negligible impact on the occurrence of phase X. Finally, we reproduce with high accuracy the 10 GPa isotope shift due to the hydrogen-to-deuterium substitution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conversion of charge to orbital angular momentum through the orbital Hall effect (OHE) holds transformative potential for the development of orbital-based electronics, however, it is challenging to directly observe the electrically generated orbital accumulation. Here, we detect the OHE by directly quantifying the orbital accumulation along the edges of a titanium thin film using a scanning transmission electron microscope. We measure the Ti L-edge using electron energy-loss spectroscopy with nanometer resolution and find a sizable orbital accumulation at the sample's outer perimeters, consistent with all signatures expected for the OHE, and determine an orbital diffusion length $\ell_o \approx 7.3$ nm. Our data points to a surprising dependence of the orbital diffusion length on the nano-structural morphology.</description>

      <title>Observation of quantum oscillations near the Mott-Ioffe-Regel limit in CaAs3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Mott-Ioffe-Regel limit sets the lower bound of carrier mean free path for coherent quasiparticle transport. Metallicity beyond this limit is of great interest because it is often closely related to quantum criticality and unconventional superconductivity. Progress along this direction mainly focuses on the strange-metal behaviors originating from the evolution of quasiparticle scattering rate such as linear-in-temperature resistivity, while the quasiparticle coherence phenomena in this regime are much less explored due to the short mean free path at the diffusive bound. Here we report the observation of quantum oscillations from Landau quantization near the Mott-Ioffe-Regel limit in CaAs3. Despite the insulator-like temperature dependence of resistivity, CaAs3 presents giant magnetoresistance and prominent Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations from Fermi surfaces, indicating highly coherent band transport. In contrast, the quantum oscillation is absent in the magnetic torque. The quasiparticle effective mass increases systematically with magnetic fields, manifesting a much larger value than the expectation given by magneto-infrared spectroscopy. It suggests a strong many-body renormalization effect near Fermi surface. We find that these unconventional behaviors may be explained by the interplay between the mobility edge and the van Hove singularity, which results in the formation of coherent cyclotron orbits emerging at the diffusive bound. Our results call for further study on the electron correlation effect of the van Hove singularity.</description>

      <title>Influence of Dimensionality of Carbon-based Additives on Thermoelectric Transport Parameters in Polymer Electrolytes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the thermoelectric properties of solid polymer electrolytes (SPE) containing lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) and sodium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (NaTFSI) salts, along with carbon-based additives of various dimensionalities. Increasing salt concentration leads to higher Seebeck coefficients as a result of the increasing number of free charge carriers and additional, superimposed effects by ion-ion and ion-polymer interactions. NaTFSI-based electrolytes exhibit negative Seebeck coefficients (up to $S = -1.5\,\mathrm{mV\,K^{-1}}$), indicating dominant mobility of $\mathrm{TFSI^-}$ ions. Quasi-one-dimensional carbon nanotubes (CNTs) increase the Seebeck coefficient by a factor of 3. Planar, two-dimensional graphite flakes (GF) moderately enhance it, affecting $\mathrm{Na^+}$ and $\mathrm{TFSI^-}$ ion mobilities and electronic conductivity. Bulky, three-dimensional carbon black (CB) additives induce a unique behavior where the sign of the Seebeck coefficient changes with temperature, presumably due to interaction with $\mathrm{TFSI^-}$ ions within the CB structure. Changes in activation energy and Vogel temperature with salt concentration suggest structural and mechanical modifications in the polymer matrix. The choice of carbon-based additives and salt concentration significantly influences the thermoelectric properties of SPEs thermoelectric properties, providing insights into their potential for thermoelectric applications. Sodium-based electrolytes emerge as promising, sustainable alternatives to lithium-based systems, aligning with sustainable energy research demands.</description>

      <title>Topological responses from gapped Weyl points in 2D altermagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Altermagnetism combines aspects of both ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism, breaking spin degeneracy while possessing no net magnetization. In this work, we study the symmetry requirements for topologically protected Weyl points in 2D altermagnets, involving bands with the same spin quantum number. We classify all spin-wallpaper groups whose symmetries protect 2D Weyl points and show that their nontrivial topology is charactrized by a quantized $\pi$-Berry phase. Representative electronic tight-binding and magnonic linear spin-wave models are constructed to investigate the unusual transport characteristics of these 2D Weyl points. Different mass terms, induced for example through strain or via coupling to light or a substrate, gap out the Weyl points leading to emerging gapped topological phases. Depending on the mass terms, these phases carry finite Chern and/or spin Chern numbers and exhibit protected edge states as well as anomalous electronic and thermal Hall responses. We calculate these Hall currents for the different topological phases.</description>

      <title>Evidence for an Excitonic Insulator State in Ta$_2$Pd$_3$Te$_5$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14455v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The excitonic insulator (EI) is an exotic ground state of narrow-gap semiconductors and semimetals arising from spontaneous condensation of electron-hole pairs bound by attractive Coulomb interaction. Despite research on EIs dating back to half a century ago, their existence in real materials remains a subject of ongoing debate. In this study, through systematic experimental and theoretical investigations, we provide evidence for the existence of an EI ground state in a van der Waals compound Ta$_2$Pd$_3$Te$_5$. Density-functional-theory calculations suggest that it is a semimetal with a small band overlap, whereas various experiments exhibit an insulating ground state with a clear band gap. Upon incorporating electron-hole Coulomb interaction into our calculations, we obtain an EI phase where the electronic symmetry breaking opens a many-body gap. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements exhibit that the band gap is closed with a significant change in the dispersions as the number of thermally excited charge carriers becomes sufficiently large in both equilibrium and nonequilibrium states. Structural measurements reveal a slight breaking of crystal symmetry with exceptionally small lattice distortion in the insulating state, which cannot account for the significant gap opening. Therefore, we attribute the insulating ground state with a gap opening in Ta$_2$Pd$_3$Te$_5$ to exciton condensation, where the coupling to the symmetry-breaking electronic state induces a subtle change in the crystal structure.</description>

Abstract: Using machine learning with a variational formula for diffusivity, we recast diffusion as a sum of individual contributions to diffusion--called "kinosons"--and compute their statistical distribution to model a complex multicomponent alloy. Calculating kinosons is orders of magnitude more efficient than computing whole trajectories, and elucidates kinetic mechanisms for diffusion. The distribution of kinosons with temperature leads to new accurate analytic models for macroscale diffusivity. This combination of machine learning with diffusion theory promises insight into other complex materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02070v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the major challenges towards understanding and further utilizing the properties and functional behaviors of grain boundaries (GB) is the complexity of general GBs with mixed tilt and twist character. Here, we demonstrated that the structures and stress fields of mostly mixed GBs could be considered as the superposition of their tilt and twist GB components by computationally examining 26.8 million large-scale structures of 4964 unique silicon mixed GB characters. The results indicate that low angle mixed GB is formed by the dislocation interactions between its decomposed tilt and twist components, while various complex sub-structures with dislocation stress but without conventional dislocation core structures are discovered on twin and structural unit GBs. A universal Read-Shockley model that physically captures the energy trends of the mixed GB is proposed, and its superiority, universality and transferability are proven in a variety of GB structures across different lattices. We confirm the validity of this work by comparing the results with experimental observations and first-principles calculations. Earlier works should now be reassessed in the light of these findings.</description>

Abstract: Grain growth competition during directional solidification of a polycrystal with hexagonal (hcp) symmetry (Mg-1wt%Gd alloy) is studied by phase-field modeling, exploring the effect of the temperature gradient G on the resulting grain boundary (GB) orientation selection. Results show that selection mechanisms and scaling laws derived for cubic (fcc, bcc) crystals also apply to hcp materials (within their basal plane), provided a re-estimation of fitting parameters and re-scaling to account for the sixfold symmetry. While grain growth competition remains stochastic with rare events of unexpected elimination or side-branching along the developing GBs, we also confirm an overall transition from a geometrical limit to a favorably oriented grain limit behavior with an increase of thermal gradient within the dendritic regime, and the progressive alignment of dendrites and GBs toward the temperature gradient direction with an increase of G during the dendritic-to-cellular morphological transition. Comparisons with original thin-sample directional solidification experiments show a qualitative agreement with PF results, yet with notable discrepancies, which nonetheless can be explained based on the stochastic variability of selected GB orientations, and the statistically limited experimental sample size. Overall, our results extend the understanding of GB formation and grain growth competition during solidification of hcp materials, and the effect of thermal conditions, nonetheless concluding on the challenges of extending the current studies to three dimensions, and the need for much broader (statistically significant) data sets of GB orientation selected under well-identified solidification conditions.</description>

      <title>Strain-driven phonon topological phase transition impedes thermal transport in titanium monoxide</title>

Abstract: Topological phonon states in crystalline materials have attracted significant research interests due to their importance for fundamental physical phenomena, yet their implication on phonon thermal transport remains largely unexplored. Here, we use density functional theory calculations and symmetry analyses to explore topological phonon phase transitions under uniaxial strains and their tuning effects on thermal transport in titanium monoxide (TiO). Our calculation shows that application of 10% tension significantly diminishes lattice thermal conductivity of TiO by 77% and 66% along the a and c axes, respectively, at room temperature. This suppression is found to result largely from the breaking of symmetry protected degeneracy of acoustic branches, which induces a substantial enhancement of phonon scattering phase space due to the easier fulfillment of scattering selection rules. Our study provides evidence for the importance of phononic band topology in modulating thermal conductivity and offers a promising route towards controlling solid-state heat transport.</description>

      <title>Generation of Picosecond Ion Pulses by Ultrafast Electron-Stimulated Desorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02631v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an efficient method to produce laser-triggered proton pulses below 500\,ps pulse width at keV energies. We use femtosecond photoelectron pulses emitted from a cathode to enable ultrafast electron-stimulated desorption of adsorbates on a stainless steel plate under ultrahigh vacuum conditions. While direct photoionization of atoms to form well-timed ion pulses can suffer from a laser-focus-limited large starting volume, in our method the starting plane of the ions is defined with nanometer precision at a solid surface. We clearly outline how the method could be used in the future to efficiently produce ion beam pulses in the (sub-)picosecond range for pump-probe experiments with ions.</description>

      <title>ComDMFT v.2.0: Fully Self-Consistent ab initio GW+EDMFT for the Electronic Structure of Correlated Quantum Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04613v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: ComDMFT is a parallel computational package designed to study the electronic structure of correlated quantum materials from first principles. Our approach is based on the combination of first-principles methods and dynamical mean field theories. In version 2.0, we implemented fully-diagrammatic GW+EDMFT from first-principles. In this approach, correlated electrons are treated within full GW+EDMFT and the rest are treated within full-GW, seamlessly. This implementation enables the electronic structure calculation of quantum materials with weak, intermediate, and strong electron correlation without prior knowledge of the degree of electron correlation.</description>

      <title>Exponentially localised interface eigenmodes in finite chains of resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09667v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies wave localisation in chains of finitely many resonators. There is an extensive theory predicting the existence of localised modes induced by defects in infinitely periodic systems. This work extends these principles to finite-sized systems. We consider finite systems of subwavelength resonators arranged in dimers that have a geometric defect in the structure. This is a classical wave analogue of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. We prove the existence of a spectral gap for defectless finite dimer structures and find a direct relationship between eigenvalues being within the spectral gap and the localisation of their associated eigenmode. Then we show the existence and uniqueness of an eigenvalue in the gap in the defect structure, proving the existence of a unique localised interface mode. To the best of our knowledge, our method, based on Chebyshev polynomials, is the first to characterise quantitatively the localised interface modes in systems of finitely many resonators.</description>
