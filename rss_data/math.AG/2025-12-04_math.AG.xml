      <title>Dynamical Non-Commutative Algebraic Geometry: Inflation, Bifurcation, and the Dynamics of Collapse across Division Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a framework for dynamical non-commutative algebraic geometry (DNCAG) by analyzing the evolution and stability of polynomial root manifolds in real normed division algebras ($\mathbb{H}$ and $\mathbb{O}$). We establish a Generalized Inflation Theorem, demonstrating that for central polynomials, the root set forms a homogeneous space $G/H$, where $G$ is the automorphism group of the algebra ($SO(3)$ for $\mathbb{H}$, $G_2$ for $\mathbb{O}$). This mechanism generates continuous geometry from non-commutativity. We analyze the dynamics under central modulation (breathing modes), classifying topological bifurcations ($\Delta=0$). We then analyze the topological collapse induced by non-central perturbations, governed by symmetry reduction. We utilize the Localization Theorem (Gordon-Motzkin) to explain the alignment of roots with coefficient subalgebras. We formalize the dynamics of collapse using gradient flow on the potential landscape $\mathcal{V}(x) = \|P(x)\|^2$, characterizing it as a deformation retract and proving that the collapse timescale exhibits critical slowing down with quadratic scaling ($T_{\rm collapse} \propto \epsilon^{-2}$). Finally, we introduce a thermodynamic formalism, proving an Entropy Scaling Law that rigorously characterizes the collapse as a symmetry-breaking phase transition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We find explicit equations of a new pair of fake projective planes, labeled by $(C18,p=3,\{2I\})$ in the Cartwright-Steger classification. Our method involves starting with known equations of a commensurable fake projective plane $(C18,p=3,\emptyset,d_3 D_3)$ and working through a chain of cyclic covers and quotients to get to the new one.</description>

      <title>Generalizing M. Dale's results from secants to joins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnar Dale's paper ``Terracini's lemma and the secant variety of a curve" contains various facts about secant varieties, nearly all of whose proofs can immediately be extended to the situation of embedded joins of varieties. This note provides the necessary details on how to do so, and as an application shows how to use this information to calculate the degree of the canonical map from the ruled join down to the embedded join.</description>

      <title>Moduli of vector bundles on $\mu_n$-gerbes over genus 2 curves and the period-index problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a framework for describing vector bundles on $\mu_n$-gerbes over curves and illustrate the construction through two detailed examples. Using the interpretation of Brauer classes as obstructions to descending determinantal line bundles from the algebraic closure, together with a geometric analysis of the moduli space of twisted sheaves, we prove that for genus $2$ curves there exist Brauer classes over the base field whose period equals their index. Over $C_1$-fields, we further show that every $2$-torsion class in the Brauer group of a genus $2$ curve satisfies the period-index problem. As an application, we construct higher-dimensional varieties obtained as fibre products of genus $2$ curves over $C_1$-fields whose $2$-torsion algebraic Brauer classes also satisfy the period-index problem, providing new evidence toward the period-index conjecture.</description>

      <title>Arithmetic invariants of Euclidean lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the arithmetic invariants of Euclidean lattice in the context of Arakelov geometry. We regard a Euclidean lattice as a hermitian vector bundle $\bar E$ on ${\rm Spec}(\mathbb{Z})$ and consider two typical arithmetic analogues of the dimension of the space of global sections of a vector bundle on an algebraic curve. One is $$h^0_{\rm Ar}(\bar E):=\log \vert E\cap B_1 \vert$$ where $B_1$ is the unit ball, and the other is $$h^0_{\theta}(\bar{E}):=\log\sum_{v\in E}e^{-\pi\Vert v\Vert^2}$$ where $\sum_{v\in E}e^{-\pi\Vert v\Vert^2}$ is the theta function of $\bar E$. In this paper, we shall prove the following three statements: (i) the fact that one can not reach an absolute Riemann-Roch theorem for $h^0_{\rm Ar}(\bar E)$ is an instance of the Heissenberg uncertainty principle; (ii) the finiteness of equivalence classes in the genus of a positive quadratic form defined over $\mathbb{Z}$ is equivalent to the finiteness of certain isometry classes of hermitian vector bundles on ${\rm Spec}(\mathbb{Z})$, and it can be deduced from a finiteness theorem in Arakelov theory of ${\rm Spec}(\mathbb{Z})$; (iii) for any smooth function $f$ on $\mathbb{R}_{+}$ such that $f&gt;0$ and that $f\circ {\rm exp}$ is a Schwartz function on $\mathbb{R}$, the Mellin transform of $f$ can be written as an integral over the Arakelov divisor class group of ${\rm Spec}(\mathbb{Z})$.</description>

Abstract: We prove that, in all except one case, a Gorenstein del Pezzo surface of Picard rank 1 admits an int-amplified endomorphism if and only if it is a quotient of a toric variety by a finite group which acts freely in codimension one and preserves the open torus. We classify all such quotients.</description>

      <title>A simple algebraic proof of the non-transitivity of the braid group action on full exceptional sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Chang--Haiden--Schroll shows that the braid group action on full exceptional collections in a triangulated category is not transitive but has infinitely many orbits in general. Their proof is based on a geometric model and the theory of branched coverings such as Birman--Hilden theory. This paper provides a simple algebraic proof of their theorem.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolicity properties of moduli spaces of marked hyperk{\"a}hler manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the hyperbolicity properties of moduli spaces of marked hyperk{\"a}hler manifolds along directions corresponding to families having positivity properties for their Hodge bundle. In particular, we show that the Kobayashi pseudo-distance computed using disks tangent to these directions vanishes. As an intermediate step, we establish the existence of families of marked hyperk{\"a}hler manifolds over arbitrary curves having a prescribed period map to the corresponding period domain. This generalizes a recent theorem of Greb and Schwald [GS24] to the case of hyperk{\"a}hler manifolds of arbitrary dimensions and nonnecessarily compact curves. Finally, using Nevanlinna theory, we establish restrictions on families of hyperk{\"a}hler manifolds over C having positive Hodge bundle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the mapping class group-valued monodromy of any sufficiently ample linear system on any smooth simply connected projective surface, identifying this with the r-spin mapping class group associated to a maximal root of the adjoint line bundle. This gives a characterization of the simple closed curves that can arise as vanishing cycles for nodal degenerations in the linear system, as well as other corollaries concerning discriminants, Lefschetz fibrations, and surfaces in 4-manifolds.</description>

      <title>Degeneracy and Sato-Tate groups of $y^2=x^{p^2}-1$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We say that an abelian variety is degenerate if its Hodge ring is not generated by divisor classes. Degeneracy leads to some interesting challenges when computing Sato-Tate groups, and there are currently few examples and techniques presented in the literature. In this paper we focus on the Jacobians of the family of curves $C_{p^2}: y^2=x^{p^2}-1$, where $p$ is an odd prime. Using a construction developed by Shioda in the 1980s, we are able to characterize so-called indecomposable Hodge classes as well as the Sato-Tate groups of these Jacobian varieties. Our work is inspired by computation, and examples and methods are described throughout the paper.</description>

      <title>On stationary real matrix Schubert varieties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study when a real matrix Schubert variety is stationary with respect to the first variation. We first show that a necessary condition for its open dense regular part to be a minimal submanifold is that the corresponding partial permutation is vexillary. Among vexillary partial permutations, we establish minimality by a geometric argument when the Rothe diagram is of Grassmannian type and has at most two connected components. We further obtain, as a corollary, the minimality of those varieties that decompose as products of this type. These varieties include all determinantal varieties as well as some new minimal cones.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the K\"ahler-Einstein metrics on the four families of examples of symmetric toric Fano manifolds presented by Batyrev and Selivanova cannot be realized as metrics induced by immersions into projective spaces equipped with Fubini-Study metrics. We obtain a similar conclusion for the non-symmetric examples discovered by Nill and Paffenholz. A consequence is that a centrally symmetric toric Fano manifold admits a K\"ahler-Einstein metric induced by a projective immersion if and only if it is a product of projective lines. These results provide evidence for a broader conjecture characterizing which K\"ahler-Einstein metrics can be induced by projective immersions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Condensed mathematics as developed by Clausen and Scholze yields a version of derived functors over the category of continuous $G$-modules for a Hausdorff topological group $G$. We study the resulting notion of group cohomology and its relation to continuous group cohomology and the condensed/sheaf/singular cohomology of classifying spaces. While condensed group cohomology is generally a more refined invariant than continuous group cohomology, we show that for a broad class of topological groups, continuous group cohomology with solid coefficients, such as locally profinite continuous $G$-modules, can be realized as a derived functor in the condensed setting. We also revisit cornerstones of condensed mathematics, paying special attention to set-theoretic size issues. To this end, we review a framework for working with accessible (hyper)sheaves on large sites satisfying suitable accessibility conditions and show that the associated categories retain many topos-like properties. Moreover, we generalize identifications of condensed with sheaf cohomology obtained by Clausen and Scholze.</description>

      <title>Calabi-Yau structures on derived and singularity categories of symmetric orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct left and right Calabi-Yau structures on derived respectively singularity categories of symmetric orders $\Lambda$ over commutative Gorenstein rings $R$. For this, we first construct Calabi-Yau structures over $R$ by lifting Amiot's construction of Calabi-Yau structures on Verdier quotients to the dg level. Then we prove base change properties relating Calabi-Yau structures over $R$ to those over the base field $k$. As a result, we prove the existence of a right Calabi-Yau structure on the dg singularity category associated with $\Lambda$ which is a cyclic lift of the weak Calabi-Yau structure constructed by the first-named author and Iyama. We also show the existence of a left Calabi-Yau structure on the dg bounded derived category of $\Lambda$. This is a non-commutative generalization of a result by Brav and Dyckerhoff. By combining the existence of the right Calabi-Yau structure on the dg singularity category with a structure theorem by Keller and the second-named author, we deduce that under suitable hypotheses, the singularity category associated with $\Lambda$ is triangle equivalent to a generalized cluster category in the sense of Amiot.</description>

Abstract: We study the topological obstructions of dynamical convexity on contact manifolds focusing on fillability by cotangent bundles and subcritical surgeries. Using links to algebraic geometry, we motivate and define a stronger version of dynamical convexity, and investigate the topology of these manifolds. More precisely, we show that strongly dynamically convex contact manifolds cannot arise as a unit cotangent bundle $(ST^*M,\lambda_{std})$ of a closed manifold $M$ and in particular that dynamically convex contact manifolds cannot arise as the unit cotangent bundle $(ST^*M,\lambda_{std})$ of a simply connected manifold $M$. We also show obstructions to dynamical convexity that arises from studying different kinds of subcritical surgeries.</description>

Using invariant logarithmic $2$-jet differentials with negative twists, we prove the estimate \[ T_f(r) \leqslant 5 \sum_{i=1}^3 N_f^{[1]}(r, \mathcal{C}_i) + o\big(T_f(r)\big)\quad\parallel, \] where $T_f(r)$ is the Nevanlinna characteristic function, and $N_f^{[1]}(r, \mathcal{C}_i)$ is the 1-truncated counting function.</description>

      <title>Canonical metrics on families of vector bundles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a geometric partial differential equation for families of holomorphic vector bundles, generalising the theory of Hermite--Einstein metrics. We consider families of holomorphic vector bundles which each admit Hermite--Einstein metrics, together with a first order deformation. On such families, we define the family Hermite--Einstein equation for Hermitian metrics, which we view as a notion of a canonical metric in this setting.
  We prove two main results concerning family Hermite--Einstein metrics. Firstly, we construct Hermite--Einstein metrics in adiabatic classes on product manifolds, assuming the existence of a family Hermite--Einstein metric. Secondly, we prove that the associated parabolic flow admits a unique smooth solution for all time, and use this to show that the Dirichlet problem always admits a unique solution.</description>

      <title>Polystability of Stokes representations and differential Galois groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.09067v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Polystability of (twisted) Stokes representations (i.e. wild monodromy representations) will be characterised, in terms of the corresponding differential Galois group (generalising the Zariski closure of the monodromy group in the tame case). This extends some results of Richardson. Further, the intrinsic approach to such results will be established, in terms of reductions of Stokes local systems.</description>

      <title>Maximum number of rational points on hypersurfaces in weighted projective spaces over finite fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07522v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An upper bound for the maximum number of rational points on an hypersurface in a projective space over a finite field has been conjectured by Tsfasman and proved by Serre in 1989. The analogue question for hypersurfaces on weighted projective spaces has been considered by Castryck, Ghorpade, Lachaud, O'Sullivan, Ram and the first author in 2017. A conjecture has been proposed there and proved in the particular case of the dimension 2. We prove here the conjecture in any dimension provided the second weight is also equal to one.</description>

      <title>An abundance-type result for the tangent bundles of smooth Fano varieties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03799v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we prove the following abundance-type result: for any smooth Fano variety $X$, the tangent bundle $T_X$ is nef if and only if it is big and semiample in the sense that the tautological line bundle $\mathscr{O}_{\mathbb{P}T_X}(1)$ is so, by which we establish a weak form of the Campana-Peternell conjecture (Camapan-Peternell, 1991).</description>

      <title>An Algorithm to compute the Kronecker cone and other moment cones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08812v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe a new algorithm that computes the minimal list of inequalities for the moment cone of any representation of a complex reductive group, with implementation details for two fundamental cases: the Kronecker cone (governing the asymptotic support of Kronecker coefficients) and the fermionic cone. These correspond to the actions of ${\mathrm GL}\_{d\_1}({\mathbb C})\times\cdots\times {\mathrm GL}\_{d\_s}({\mathbb C})$ on ${\mathbb C}^{d\_1}\otimes\cdots\otimes {\mathbb C}^{d\_s}$ and ${\mathrm GL}\_d({\mathbb C})$ on $\bigwedge^r{\mathbb C}^d$, respectively. An implementation for these two cases in Python-Sage is available at https://ea-icj.github.io/. Our work overcomes the fundamental limitations that previously restricted such computations to cases like ${\mathbb C}^4\otimes{\mathbb C}^4\otimes{\mathbb C}^4$. The state-of-the-art method by Vergne-Walter faced two major bottlenecks: one from combinatorial geometry in finite-dimensional vector spaces, and another from deciding whether certain dominant morphisms are birational - a problem in effective algebraic geometry that lacked a direct algorithmic solution. We surmount these obstacles by: a novel use of Weyl group actions to master combinatorial complexity, and an original algorithm for deciding birationality that replaces previous workarounds relying on convex geometry. Our approach allow us to tackle problems at a new scale. We compute the minimal list of 5,333 (up to $\mathfrak S\_3$) inequalities for the Kronecker cone ${\mathbb C}^6\otimes{\mathbb C}^6\otimes{\mathbb C}^6$ in 2 hours. Furthermore, a parallel implementation computes the 64,792 (up to $\mathfrak S\_3$) inequalities for ${\mathbb C}^7\otimes{\mathbb C}^7\otimes{\mathbb C}^7$ in 188 hours.</description>

      <title>A nonspecial divisor in the moduli space of cubic fourfolds via 10-nodal plane sextics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13187v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the moduli space $\mathcal{C}$ of complex cubic hypersurfaces $X\subset\mathbb{P}^5$, we study the condition that $X$ admits a net of polar quadrics whose discriminant locus is a $10$-nodal irreducible plane sextic curve. Our main result is that such a condition defines an irreducible divisor in $\mathcal{C}$ which is not of Noether-Lefschetz type.</description>

      <title>Conformal blocks, parahoric torsors and Borel-Weil-Bott</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17573v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a smooth projective curve over an algebraically closed field $k$. Let $\mathcal{G}$ be a parahoric group scheme on $X$ as in \cite{pr}. Via the principle of Hecke correspondences, we set-up relationships between the cohomology of lines bundles on various moduli stacks of torsors. This approach gives a proof of \cite[Conjecture 3.7]{pr} for group schemes $\mathcal G$ as above in characteristic zero. This further gives as a consequence, the principle of propagation of vacua. We give a direct proof of the independence of central charge on base points. Projective flatness is recovered as a corollary of Faltings construction of the Hitchin connection. Using C.Teleman's basic results (\cite{bwb}), we deduce the analogous result that cohomology of line bundles on the stack of principal $G$-bundles vanish in all degrees except possibly one. Results on twisted vacua \cite{hongkumar} are obtained as immediate consequences.</description>

      <title>On algebro-geometric quotients of torus-invariant subvarieties of the flag variety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06074v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the subvarieties of a complex flag variety that are invariant under the action of a maximal torus. Using combinatorial techniques derived from matroid theory, we introduce a decomposition of this variety into affine, locally closed subsets, which we refer to as thin Schubert cells, each indexed by an element of a Cartesian product of matroids. We also show that the set of orbits for each of these thin Schubert cells under the action of the torus is, in fact, an orbit space, which gives rise to topologically trivial fiber bundles. As a consequence of this, we prove the existence of algebro-geometric quotients in the sense of Mumford's Geometric Invariant Theory. The main result of this work is the existence of a surjective map from the set of geometric quotients of thin Schubert cells to the invariant scheme-theoretic points of a complex flag variety, which allows us to decompose it in terms of such quotients and also define a map from the set of these geometric quotients to the invariant homology of the variety. Finally, we give a complete description of the thin Schubert cells for the special case of the flag variety $\mathds{F}_{1&lt;n-1}(\mathds{C}^n)$ and derive explicit counting formulas.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we presents a method for factoring morphisms between arithmetic surfaces based on the regularity of arithmetic surfaces. Using this factorization, we derive a Riemann-Hurwitz formula satisfied by the ramification divisor and the canonical divisor on arithmetic surfaces.

      <title>Embedded topological triviality of separable families of singularities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.23185v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding how singularities behave under small perturbations is a central theme in singularity theory. In this paper we establish sufficient conditions for families of analytic function-germs on a germ of a complex analytic space to admit an embedded topological trivialization. Our results extend previous work of the third author and collaborators, moving from abstract triviality to the embedded setting. As an application, we obtain new instances of topological stability, including a broad class of $\mu$-constant deformations. These findings provide a new insight into the long-standing $\mu$-constant conjecture, one of the major open problems in the field.</description>

      <title>Some remarks on L-equivalence for cubic fourfolds and hyper-K\"ahler manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01968v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that if two very general cubic fourfolds are L-equivalent then they are isomorphic, and we observe that there exist special cubic fourfolds which are L-equivalent but not isomorphic. When the cubic fourfolds are very general in certain Hassett divisors, we prove that if they are L-equivalent then they are also Fourier-Mukai partners. We also provide further examples in support of the fact that L-equivalent hyper-K\"ahler manifolds should be D-equivalent, as conjectured by Meinsma.</description>
