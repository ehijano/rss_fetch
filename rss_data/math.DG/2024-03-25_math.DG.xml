      <title>On the inverse mean curvature flow by parallel hypersurfaces in space forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the inverse mean curvature flow by parallel hypersurfaces in space forms. We show that such a flow exists if and only if the initial hypersurface is isoparametric. The flow is characterized by an algebraic equation satisfied by the distance function of the parallel hypersurfaces. The solutions to the flow are obtained explicitly when the distinct principal curvatures have the same multiplicity. This is an additional assumption only for isoparametric hypersurfaces of the hyperbolic space or of the sphere with two or four distinct principal curvatures. The boundaries of the maximal interval of definition, when finite, are determined in terms of the number $g$ of distinct principal curvatures, their multiplicities $m$ and the mean curvature $H$ of the initial hypersurface. We describe the collapsing submanifolds of the flow at the boundaries of the interval. In particular, we show in the Euclidean space the solutions are eternal, while in the hyperbolic space there are eternal and immortal solutions. Starting with a connected isoparametric submanifold of the sphere, we show that the flow is an ancient solution, that collapses into a minimal hypersurface whose square length of its second fundamental form and its scalar curvature are constants given in terms of $g$ and $n$. The minimal hypersurface is totally geodesic when $g=1$, it is a Clifford minimal hypersurface of the sphere when $g=2$ and it is a Cartan type minimal submanifold when $g\in\{3,4,6\}$.</description>

      <title>Homological vector fields over differentiable stacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we solve the problem of providing a Morita invariant definition of Lie and Courant algebroids over Lie groupoids. By relying on supergeometry, we view these structures as instances of vector fields on graded groupoids which are homological up to homotopy. We describe such vector fields in general from two complementary viewpoints: firstly, as Maurer-Cartan elements in a differential graded Lie algebra of multivector fields and, secondly, we also view them from a categorical approach, in terms of functors and natural transformations. Thereby, we obtain a unifying conceptual framework for studying LA-groupoids, $L_2$-algebroids (including semistrict Lie 2-algebras and 2-term representations up to homotopy), infinitesimal gerbe prequantizations, higher gauge theory (specifically, 2-connections on 2-bundles), quasi-Poisson groupoids and (twisted) multiplicative Courant algebroids.</description>

      <title>Translation surfaces with large systoles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we continue to investigate the systolic landscape of translation surfaces started in [CHMW]. We show that there is an infinite sequence of surfaces $(S_{g_k})_k$ of genus $g_k$, where $g_k \to \infty$ with large systoles. On the other hand we show that for hyperelliptic surfaces we can find a suitable homology basis, where a large number of loops that induce the basis are short.</description>

      <title>Translators of the Mean Curvature Flow in Hyperbolic Einstein's Static Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we deal with non-degenerate translators of the mean curvature flow in the well-known hyperbolic Einstein's static universe. We classify translators foliated by horospheres and rotationally invariant ones, both space-like and time-like. For space-like translators, we show a uniqueness theorem as well as a result to extend an isometry of the boundary of the domain to the whole translator, under simple conditions. As an application, we obtain a characterization of the the bowl when the boundary is a ball, and of certain translators foliated by horospheres whose boundary is a rectangle.</description>

      <title>Calabi-Yau threefolds with boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop the deformation theory of Calabi-Yau threefolds, by which we mean 3-dimensional complex manifolds with a nowhere-vanishing holomorphic 3-form, on manifolds with boundary. The boundary data is a closed, real 3-form on the 5-dimensional boundary. In the case of strongly pseudoconvex boundary, we obtain an analogue of Hitchin's local Torelli Theorem for compact manifolds, modulo a finite dimensional obstruction space, which we show is zero in many cases of interest.</description>

      <title>Geometric Generative Models based on Morphological Equivariant PDEs and GANs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Content and image generation consist in creating or generating data from noisy information by extracting specific features such as texture, edges, and other thin image structures. We are interested here in generative models, and two main problems are addressed. Firstly, the improvements of specific feature extraction while accounting at multiscale levels intrinsic geometric features; and secondly, the equivariance of the network to reduce its complexity and provide a geometric interpretability. To proceed, we propose a geometric generative model based on an equivariant partial differential equation (PDE) for group convolution neural networks (G-CNNs), so called PDE-G-CNNs, built on morphology operators and generative adversarial networks (GANs). Equivariant morphological PDE layers are composed of multiscale dilations and erosions formulated in Riemannian manifolds, while group symmetries are defined on a Lie group. We take advantage of the Lie group structure to properly integrate the equivariance in layers, and are able to use the Riemannian metric to solve the multiscale morphological operations. Each point of the Lie group is associated with a unique point in the manifold, which helps us derive a metric on the Riemannian manifold from a tensor field invariant under the Lie group so that the induced metric has the same symmetries. The proposed geometric morphological GAN (GM-GAN) is obtained by using the proposed morphological equivariant convolutions in PDE-G-CNNs to bring nonlinearity in classical CNNs. GM-GAN is evaluated on MNIST data and compared with GANs. Preliminary results show that GM-GAN model outperforms classical GAN.</description>

      <title>Pursuit-Evasion on a Sphere and When It Can Be Considered Flat</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In classical works on a planar differential pursuit-evasion game with a faster pursuer, the intercept point resulting from the equilibrium strategies lies on the Apollonius circle. This property was exploited for the construction of the equilibrium strategies for two faster pursuers against one evader. Extensions for planar multiple-pursuer single-evader scenarios have been considered. We study a pursuit-evasion game on a sphere and the relation of the equilibrium intercept point to the Apollonius domain on the sphere. The domain is a generalization of the planar Apollonius circle set. We find a condition resulting in the intercept point belonging to the Apollonius domain, which is the characteristic of the planar game solution. Finally, we use this characteristic to discuss pursuit and evasion strategies in the context of two pursuers and a single slower evader on the sphere and illustrate it using numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Short incompressible graphs and $2$-free groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.10924v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider a finite connected $2$-complex $X$ endowed with a piecewise Riemannian metric and whose fundamental group is freely indecomposable, of rank at least $3$, and in which every $2$-generated subgroup is free. In this paper we show that we can always find a connected graph $\Gamma\subset X$ such that $\pi_1 \Gamma\simeq {\mathbb F}_2 \hookrightarrow\pi_1 X$ (in short, a $2$-incompressible graph) whose length satisfies the following curvature-free inequality: $\ell(\Gamma)\leq 4\sqrt{2\text{Area}(X)}$. This generalizes a previous inequality proved by Gromov for closed Riemannian surfaces with negative Euler characteristic. As a consequence we obtain that the volume entropy of such $2$-complexes with unit area is always bounded away from zero.</description>

      <title>Llarull type theorems on complete manifolds with positive scalar curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10173v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, without assuming that manifolds are spin, we prove that if a compact orientable, and connected Riemannian manifold $(M^{n},g)$ with scalar curvature $R_{g}\geq 6$ admits a non-zero degree and $1$-Lipschitz map to $(\mathbb{S}^{3}\times \mathbb{T}^{n-3},g_{\mathbb{S}^{3}}+g_{\mathbb{T}^{n-3}})$, for $4\leq n\leq 7$, then $(M^{n},g)$ is locally isometric to $\mathbb{S}^{3}\times\mathbb{T}^{n-3}$. Similar results are established for noncompact cases as $(\mathbb{S}^{3}\times \mathbb{R}^{n-3},g_{\mathbb{S}^{3}}+g_{\mathbb{R}^{n-3}})$ being model spaces (see Theorem \ref{noncompactrigidity1}, Theorem \ref{noncompactrigidity2}, Theorem \ref{noncompactrigidity3}, Theorem \ref{noncompactrigidity4}). We observe that the results differ significantly when $n=4$ compared to $n\geq 5$. Our results imply that the $\epsilon$-gap length extremality of the standard $\mathbb{S}^3$ is stable under the Riemannian product with $\mathbb{R}^m$, $1\leq m\leq 4$ (see $D_{3}$. Question in Gromov's paper \cite{Gromov2017}, p.153).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04944v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The square root velocity transformation is crucial for efficiently employing the elastic approach in functional and shape data analysis of curves. We study fundamental geometric properties of curves under this transformation. Moreover, utilizing natural geometric constructions, we employ the approach for intrinsic comparison within several classes of surfaces and augmented curves, which arise in the real world applications such as tubes, ruled surfaces spherical strips, protein molecules and hurricane tracks.</description>

      <title>Tangential Tensor Fields on Deformable Surfaces -- How to Derive Consistent $L^2$-Gradient Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.13272v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider gradient flows of surface energies which depend on the surface by a parameterization and on a tangential tensor field. The flow allows for dissipation by evolving the parameterization and the tensor field simultaneously. This requires the choice of a notation for independence. We introduce different gauges of surface independence and show their consequences for the evolution. In order to guarantee a decrease in energy, the gauge of surface independence and the time derivative have to be chosen consistently. We demonstrate the results for a surface Frank-Oseen-Hilfrich energy.</description>

      <title>The Fine Structure of the Singular Set of Area-Minimizing Integral Currents III: Frequency 1 Flat Singular Points and $\mathcal{H}^{m-2}$-a.e. Uniqueness of Tangent Cones</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.11553v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider an area-minimizing integral current $T$ of codimension higher than 1 ins a smooth Riemannian manifold $\Sigma$. We prove that $T$ has a unique tangent cone, which is a superposition of planes, at $\mathcal{H}^{m-2}$-a.e. point in its support. In combination with works of the first and third authors, we conclude that the singular set of $T$ is countably $(m-2)$-rectifiable.</description>
