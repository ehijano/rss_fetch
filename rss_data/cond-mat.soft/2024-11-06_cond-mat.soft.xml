      <title>On the shape of Gaussian scale-free polymer networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the model of complex hyperbranched polymer structures formed on the basis of scale-free graphs, where functionalities (degrees) $k$ of nodes obey a power law decaying probability $p(k)\sim{k^{-\alpha}}$. Such polymer topologies can be considered as generalization of regular hierarchical dendrimer structures with fixed functionalities. The conformational size and shape characteristics, such as averaged asphericity $\langle A_3 \rangle$ and size ratio $g$ of such polymer networks are obtained numerically by application of Wei's method, which defines the configurations of any complex Gaussian network in terms of eigenvalue spectra of corresponding Kirchhoff matrix. Our quantitative results indicate, in particular, an increase of compactness and symmetry of network structures with the decrease of parameter $\alpha$.</description>

      <title>Unified percolation scenario for the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ processes in simple glass formers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given the vast differences in interaction details, describing the dynamics of structurally disordered materials in a unified theoretical framework presents a fundamental challenge to condensed-matter physics and materials science. This paper investigates numerically a percolation scenario for the two most important relaxation processes of supercooled liquids and glasses. For nine binary glass formers we find that, as temperature is lowered from the liquid state, percolation of immobile particles takes place at the temperature locating the $\alpha$ process. Mirroring this, upon continued cooling into the glass, mobile-particle percolation pinpoints a Johari-Goldstein $\beta$ relaxation whenever it is well separated from the $\alpha$ process. For 2D systems under the same conditions, percolation of mobile and immobile particles occurs nearly simultaneously and no $\beta$ relaxation can be identified. Our findings suggest a general description of glassy dynamics based on a percolation perspective.</description>

      <title>Gauge theory for topological waves in continuum fluids with odd viscosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider two-dimensional continuum fluids with odd viscosity under a chiral body force. The chiral body force makes the low-energy excitation spectrum of the fluids gapped, and the odd viscosity allows us to introduce the first Chern number of each energy band in the fluids. Employing a mapping between hydrodynamic variables and U(1) gauge-field strengths, we derive a U(1) gauge theory for topologically nontrivial waves. The resulting U(1) gauge theory is given by the Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory with an additional term associated with odd viscosity. We then solve the equations of motion for the gauge fields concretely in the presence of the boundary and find edge-mode solutions. We finally discuss the fate of bulk-boundary correspondence (BBC) in the context of continuum systems.</description>

      <title>Tensegrity-Inspired Polymer Films: Progressive Bending Stiffness through Multipolymeric Patterning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Materials with J-shaped stress-strain behavior under uniaxial stretching, where strength increases as deformation progresses, have been developed through various materials designs. On the other hand, polymer materials that progressively stiffen under bending remain unrealized. To address this gap, this study drew inspiration from membrane tensegrity structures, which achieve structural stability by balancing compressive forces in rods and tensile forces in membrane. Notably, some of these structures exhibit increased stiffness under bending. Using a multipolymer patterning technique, we developed a polymer film exhibiting membrane tensegrity-like properties that stiffens under bending. This effect results from membrane tension generated by rod protrusions and an increase in second moment of area at regions with maximum curvature.</description>

      <title>Vibrational similarities in jamming-unjamming of polycrystalline and disordered granular packings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jammed structures with finite shear modulus emerge from polycrystalline monodisperse and disordered bidisperse granular packings. To link these macroscopic mechanical properties with microstructural characteristics, we examine the vibrational behavior of two-dimensional polycrystalline monodisperse and disordered bidisperse systems using discrete element method simulations. The vibrational density of states (DOS) reflects structural disorder and soft modes, and we analyze this for both types of packings as they approach jamming and unjamming densities. Our results reveal that the low-frequency plateau in the DOS, observed in both polycrystalline and disordered packings, originates from nonaffine particle displacements, particularly those involving "rattlers", which are prominent near jamming and unjamming states. Although the jamming and unjamming process is irreversible, we find no evidence of expected history dependence in the DOS across any of the systems studied.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic DLVO-like interaction for charge patchiness in colloids and proteins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The behaviour and stability of soft and biological matter depend significantly on electrostatic interactions, as particles such as proteins and colloids acquire a charge when dispersed in an electrolytic solution. A typical simplification used to understand bulk phenomena involving electrostatic interactions is the isotropy of the charge on the particles. However, whether arising naturally or by synthesis, charge distributions are often inhomogeneous, leading to an intricate particle-particle interaction landscape and complex assembly phenomena. The fundamental complexity of these interactions gives rise to models based on distinct assumptions and varying degrees of simplifications which can blur the line between genuine physical behaviour and artefacts arising from the choice of a particular electrostatic model. Building upon the widely-used linearized Poisson-Boltzmann theory, we propose a theoretical framework that -- by bridging different models -- provides a robust DLVO-like description of electrostatic interactions between inhomogeneously charged particles. By matching solely the {\em single-particle} properties of two different mean-field models, we find a quantitative agreement between the {\em pair interaction energies} over a wide range of system parameters. Our work identifies a strategy to merge different models of inhomogeneously charged particles and paves the way to a reliable, accurate, and computationally affordable description of their interactions.</description>

      <title>Hotter isn't faster for a melting RNA hairpin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the denaturation dynamics of nucleic acids through extensive molecular dynamics simulations of a coarse-grained RNA hairpin model. In apparent contradiction with Arrhenius' law, our findings reveal that the denaturation time of RNA hairpins is a non-monotonous function of temperature for molecules longer than few persistence lengths, with an optimal temperature above the melting point, $T_m$, at which denaturation occurs fastest. This anomaly arises from the existence of two distinct pathways: ``unidirectional'' unzipping, progressing from one end to the other and favored near $T_m$, and ``bidirectional'' denaturation, where competing unzipping events initiate from both ends at higher temperatures. The two regimes manifest distinct scaling laws for the melting time \textit{vs.} length, $L$, and are separated by a crossover temperature $T_\times$, with $(T_\times-T_m) \sim L^{-1}$. The results highlight the significant role of the helical structure in the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of RNA/DNA denaturation and unveil multiple surprises in a decades-old problem.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of adhesion strength through microvibrations: modeling and experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-frequency micrometrical vibrations have been shown to greatly influence the adhesive performance of soft interfaces, however a detailed comparison between theoretical predictions and experimental results is still missing. Here, the problem of a rigid spherical indenter, hung on a soft spring, that is unloaded from an adhesive viscoelastic vibrating substrate is considered. The experimental tests were performed by unloading a borosilicate glass lens from a soft PDMS substrate excited by high-frequency micrometrical vibrations. We show that as soon as the vibration starts, the contact area increases abruptly and during unloading it decreases following approximately the JKR classical model, but with a much increased work of adhesion. We find that the pull-off force increases with respect to the amplitude of vibration up to a certain saturation level, which appeared to be frequency dependent. Under the hypothesis of short range adhesion, a lumped mechanical model was derived, which, starting from an independent characterization of the rate-dependent interfacial adhesion, predicted qualitatively and quantitatively the experimental results, without the need of any adjustable parameters.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Flows and Quantum Analogies in Heterogeneous Active Nematic Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Incorporating the inherent heterogeneity of living systems into models of active nematics is essential to provide a more realistic description of biological processes such as bacterial growth, cell dynamics and tissue development. Spontaneous flow of a confined active nematic is a fundamental feature of these systems, in which the role of heterogeneity has not yet been considered. We therefore determine the form of spontaneous flow transition for an active nematic film with heterogeneous activity, identifying a correspondence between the unstable director modes and solutions to Schr\"{o}dinger's equation. We consider both activity gradients and steps between regions of distinct activity, finding that such variations can change the signature properties of the flow. The threshold activity required for the transition can be raised or lowered, the fluid flux can be reduced or reversed and interfaces in activity induce shear flows. In a biological context fluid flux influences the spread of nutrients while shear flows affect the behaviour of rheotactic microswimmers and can cause the deformation of biofilms. All the effects we identify are found to be strongly dependent on not simply the types of activity present in the film but also on how they are distributed.</description>

      <title>Mpemba effect in the relaxation of an active Brownian particle in a trap without metastable states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the role of activity in the occurrence of the Mpemba effect within a system of an active colloid diffusing in a potential landscape devoid of metastable minimum. The Mpemba effect is characterized by a phenomenon where a hotter system reaches equilibrium quicker than a colder one when both are rapidly cooled to the same low temperature. While a minimal asymmetry in the potential landscape is crucial for observing this effect in passive colloidal systems, the introduction of activity can either amplify or reduce the threshold of this minimal asymmetry, resulting in the activity-induced and suppressed Mpemba effect. We attribute these variations in the Mpemba effect to the effective translational shift in the phase space, which occurs as activity is changed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, using \textit{hydrodynamic entropy} we quantify the multiscale disorder in Euler and hydrodynamic turbulence. These examples illustrate that the hydrodynamic entropy is not extensive because it is not proportional to the system size. Consequently, we cannot add hydrodynamic and thermodynamic entropies, which measure disorder at macroscopic and microscopic scales, respectively. In this paper, we also discuss the hydrodynamic entropy for the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equation and Ising spins.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent electrostatic formalism of bulk electrolytes based on the asymmetric treatment of the short- and long-range ion interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04556v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We predict the thermodynamic behavior of bulk electrolytes from an ionic Hard-Core (HC) size-augmented self-consistent formalism incorporating asymmetrically the short- and long-range ion interactions via their virial and cumulant treatment, respectively. The characteristic splitting length separating these two ranges is obtained from a variational equation solved together with the Schwinger-Dyson (SD) equations. Via comparison with simulation results from the literature, we show that the asymmetric treatment of the distinct interaction ranges significantly extends the validity regime of our previously developed purely cumulant-level Debye-H\"uckel (DH) theory. Namely, for monovalent solutions with typical ion sizes, the present formalism can accurately predict up to molar concentrations the liquid pressure dominated by HC interactions, the internal energies driven by charge correlations, and the local ion distributions governed by the competition between HC and electrostatic interactions. We evaluate as well the screening length of the liquid and investigate the deviations of the macromolecular interaction range from the DH length. In fair agreement with simulations and experiments, our theory is shown to reproduce the overscreening and underscreening effects occurring respectively in submolar mono- and multivalent electrolytes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23784v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To unlock the potential for assembling complex colloidal "molecules", we investigate a minimal binary system of programmable colloidal atom-electron equivalents (PAE-EE), where electron equivalents (EEs) are multivalent linkers with two distinct types of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) ends complementary to those ssDNAs on binary programmable atom equivalents (PAEs). We derive a statistical mechanical framework for calculating the effective interaction between PAEs mediated by EEs with arbitrary valency, which quantitatively agrees with simulations that explicitly include EEs. Our analysis reveals an anomalous dependence of PAE-PAE interactions on the EE valency, showing that EE-mediated interactions converge at the large valency limit. Moreover, we identify an optimal EE valency that maximizes the interaction difference between targeted and non-targeted binding pairs of PAEs. These findings offer design principles for targeted self-assembly in PAE-EE systems.</description>

      <title>On modeling fracture of soft polymers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00231v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Soft polymers are ubiquitous materials found in nature and as engineering materials with properties varying from rate-independent to significantly rate-dependent depending on the crosslinking mechanisms. Current fracture toughness measures such as energy release rate are non-unique for rate-dependent soft materials for varying loading profiles and specimen geometries. Works on modeling fracture in rate-dependent soft polymers are limited to crack tip stress field analyses or crack tip driving force approaches for specific pre-cracked geometries. We have developed a model to predict damage initiation and growth in soft polymers based on a generalized multi-mechanism gradient damage framework. We propose and show that a critical value of stress work $\mathit{W}_{cr}$ can uniquely quantify the total energy dissipation per unit referential volume associated with the complete failure of a material point under a loading mode. $\mathit{W}_{cr}$ can be evaluated using homogeneous deformation experiments and without a constitutive model. $\mathit{W}_{cr}$ is demonstrated to be approximately constant with strain rate for two rate-dependent soft polymers and different loading modes for an elastomer. We propose the energetic contribution to $\mathit{W}_{cr}$ as a suitable damage initiation criterion. The proposed initiation criterion in the damage model enabled successful predictions of fracture in an important rate-stiffening soft polymer Polyborosiloxane in a variety of experiments involving different specimen geometries and loading conditions. The model also provides a consistent energy density estimate for fracture-associated microstructural processes in Polyborosiloxane. The broader applicability of the fracture model is shown by its ability to predict fracture in an elastomer (EPDM) and another viscous soft polymer (EPS25 vitrimer).</description>

      <title>Epithelial layer fluidization by curvature-induced unjamming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.12667v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The transition of an epithelial layer from a stationary, quiescent state to a highly migratory, dynamic state is required for wound healing, development, and regeneration. This transition, known as the unjamming transition (UJT), is responsible for epithelial fluidization and collective migration. Previous theoretical models have primarily focused on the UJT in flat epithelial layers, neglecting the effects of strong surface curvature characteristic of the epithelium in vivo. In this study, we investigate the role of surface curvature on tissue plasticity and cellular migration using a vertex model embedded on a spherical surface. Our findings reveal that increasing curvature promotes the UJT by reducing the energy barriers to cellular rearrangements. Higher curvature favors cell intercalation, mobility, and self-diffusivity, resulting in epithelial structures that are malleable and migratory when small, but become more rigid and stationary as they grow. As such, the greater is the curvature the stronger becomes the tendency for curvature-induced unjamming to emerge as a novel mechanism promoting epithelial layer fluidization, malleability, and remodeling. Conversely, the lesser the curvature, as in tissue development and growth, the stronger becomes the tendency for jamming to emerge as a mechanism of progressive epithelial layer solidification and stabilization. Together, these results provide a conceptual framework to better understand how cell shape, cell propulsion, and tissue geometry contribute to tissue malleability, remodeling, and stabilization.</description>
