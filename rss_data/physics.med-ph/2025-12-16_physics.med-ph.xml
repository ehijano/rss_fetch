      <title>DarkSPARC: Dark-Blood Spectral Self-Calibrated Reconstruction of 3D Left Atrial LGE MRI for Post-Ablation Scar Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: To develop DarkSPARC, a retrospective, training-free, self-calibrated spectral reconstruction method that converts routine bright-blood 3D left atrial (LA) late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) MRI into a dark-blood image, and to quantify its impact on LA scar-pool CNR, SNR, effective CNR (eCNR), and scar quantification accuracy.
  Methods: DarkSPARC embeds bright-blood LA LGE into a calibrator-conditioned (N+1)-dimensional spectral domain and reconstructs a dark-blood-like image using scan-specific spectral landmarks. A scan-specific 3D numerical phantom framework was built from LAScarQS post-ablation LGE by cloning remote myocardium into the LA wall and imposing controlled scar burden. Five baseline cases spanning the 5th-95th percentiles of native scar-pool CNR, each with multiple scar burdens and 10 CNR degradation levels, yielded 200 phantoms. For every phantom, LA scar-pool CNR, SNR, eCNR, and Scar% were measured on bright-blood and DarkSPARC images. In vivo performance was evaluated in 60 public post-ablation scans of atrial fibrillation patients.
  Results: In scan-specific phantoms, DarkSPARC increased LA scar-pool CNR, SNR, and eCNR over bright-blood in all 200 experiments, with DarkSPARC/bright-blood ratios up to about 30-fold for CNR and about 6-fold for SNR in the lowest-CNR conditions. At 70% CNR degradation, bright-blood underestimated ground-truth LA Scar% by -37% to -54%, whereas DarkSPARC reduced bias to about -3% to -5%. In vivo, DarkSPARC similarly improved metrics: median scar-pool CNR, SNR, and eCNR increased from 20.0 to 135.9 (6.8x), 70.6 to 200.6 (2.8x), and 0.22 to 0.75 (3.4x), respectively (all p&lt;0.001), and LA Scar% increased from 3.9% to 9.75%.
  Conclusion: DarkSPARC is a self-calibrated, training-free reconstruction that yields dark-blood 3D LA LGE, boosting CNR/SNR/eCNR and stabilizing reliable scar quantification without extra scans.</description>

      <title>Fast label-free point-scanning super-resolution imaging for endoscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical endoscopy plays a crucial role in minimally invasive medical diagnostics and therapeutic procedures. Nonetheless, state-of-the-art endoscopic zoom objectives are bulky, requiring multi-element lens actuation, which can limit continued miniaturization. Point-scanning super-resolution approaches improve spatial resolution by illuminating the scene with a reduced-width focused spot, yet mechanical scanning requirements limit applicability in clinical settings. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a Fast label-free point-scanning super-resolution (Flaps) microscopy system, which exploits a multi-level phase-only diffractive optical element (DOE) to generate super-resolution spot(s) and uses a high-speed digital micromirror device (DMD) to deliver the illumination without mechanical scanning. Two imaging architectures are explored: a single super-resolution spot (0.47 Airy spot) or a 5 times 5 super-resolution spot array (0.52 Airy spot) in the far-field; the DMD scans the spot or spot array in the object plane at kHz rates. To demonstrate super-resolution imaging with high-speed acquisition using optical elements suitable for future deployment in endoscopy, we image a label-free resolution test target and fluorescently labelled cells.</description>

      <title>Robust Simultaneous Multislice MRI Reconstruction Using Slice-Wise Learned Generative Diffusion Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21600v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simultaneous multislice (SMS) imaging is a powerful technique for accelerating magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) acquisitions. However, SMS reconstruction remains challenging due to complex signal interactions between and within the excited slices. In this study, we introduce ROGER, a robust SMS MRI reconstruction method based on deep generative priors. Utilizing denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM), ROGER begins with Gaussian noise and gradually recovers individual slices through reverse diffusion iterations while enforcing data consistency from measured k-space data within the readout concatenation framework. The posterior sampling procedure is designed such that the DDPM training can be performed on single-slice images without requiring modifications for SMS tasks. Additionally, our method incorporates a low-frequency enhancement (LFE) module to address the practical issue that SMS-accelerated fast spin echo (FSE) and echo planar imaging (EPI) sequences cannot easily embed fully-sampled autocalibration signals. Extensive experiments on both retrospectively and prospectively accelerated datasets demonstrate that ROGER consistently outperforms existing methods, enhancing both anatomical and functional imaging with strong out-of-distribution generalization. The source code and sample data for ROGER are available at https://github.com/Solor-pikachu/ROGER.</description>
