      <title>Velocity correlations of vortices and rarefaction pulses in compressible planar quantum fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a quantitive analytical treatment of two-point velocity correlations for two important classes of superfluid excitation in compressible quantum fluids: vortices, and rarefaction pulses. We achieve this using two approaches. First, we introduce a new ansatz for describing vortex cores in planar quantum fluids with improved analytic integrability that provides analytic results for power spectra and velocity correlations for general vortex distributions, in good agreement with numerical results using the exact vortex shape. The results show signatures of short and long range correlations associated with vortex dipoles and vortex pairs respectively. Second, for the fast rarefaction pulse regime of the Jones-Roberts soliton the asymptotic high velocity wavefunction provides analytical results for the velocity power spectrum and correlation function, capturing the main length scale of the soliton. We compare our analytical treatment of the homogeneous system with numerical results for a trapped system, finding good quantitative agreement. Our results are relevant to experimental work to characterize quantum vortices and solitons in quantum fluids of atoms and light, and for studies of quantum turbulence.</description>

      <title>Band-edge superfluid of Bose-Einstein condensates in the spin-orbit-coupled Zeeman lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the first experimental realization of Bose-Einstein condensates in a spin-orbit-coupled Zeeman lattice, a wide range of applications have been found in these systems. Here, we systematically study the ground-state phase diagram of the systems. We address that the band-edge phase in the ground-state phase diagram is exotic and exists in a very broad parameter regime. The superfluidity of the band-edge states is identified by elementary excitations and superfluid fraction.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of the Bose-Hubbard Model Induced by On-Site or Long-Range Two-Body Losses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theoretical study of the dissipative dynamics of the Bose-Hubbard model induced by on-site or long-range two-body losses. We first consider the one-dimensional chain and the two-dimensional square lattice, and study the dynamics induced by the sudden switch-on of two-body losses on a weakly-interacting superfluid state. The time-dependent density is obtained in the spirit of the Bogolyubov approach by calculating theoretically the equations of motion associated to the relevant quadratic bosonic correlators. In the one-dimensional case, our results compare very well with quasi-exact numerical calculations based on the quantum jump method implemented using tensor networks. We find that the intermediate-time dynamics of the density displays an algebraic decay characterized by an interaction-dependent power-law exponent. The latter property still holds for long-range two-body loss processes but it is absent in the two-dimensional square lattice with on-site losses. We finally investigate the dissipative quench dynamics starting from a strongly-correlated superfluid state or from a Mott-insulating state; for the Bose-Hubbard chain initially confined in the superfluid-correlated regime, an unexpected strong decay of the density appearing at short times is revealed.</description>

      <title>Soliton resuscitations: asymmetric revivals of the breathing mode of an atomic bright soliton in a harmonic trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the collective modes of an atomic bright soliton realised in a quasi-one-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensate, using Bogoliubov-de Gennes theory. In particular we focus on the breathing mode of the soliton, which is not a single linearized normal mode but a common component of many modes, and therefore decays within a $t^{-1/2}$ envelope due to dispersion. If the soliton is held in the center of a harmonic trap, we show that the breathing amplitude revives periodically, as atoms shed from the vibrating soliton oscillate in the trap, and return. After each revival the breathing amplitude again decays, and this cycle repeats every trap half-period. The amplitude envelope of these breathing revivals shows a curious asymmetry, however, with a gradual increase in breathing followed by sudden drop in breathing amplitude that becomes more and more pronounced in later revivals. We explain this asymmetrical revival pattern by deriving a close analytical approximation to the Bogoliubov-de Gennes frequency spectrum, and offer this coherent Bogoliubov-de Gennes phenomenon as a background against which to compare possible quantum many-body effects, including decoherence over trap-period time scales.</description>

      <title>Collective magnetism of atomic momentum states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Organization and ordering from interactions in many-body systems underlies our understanding of phases of classical and quantum matter. Magnetism has played a particularly foundational role in the study of many-body phases. Here, we explore the collective magnetism that emerges from two laser-coupled momentum modes of a scalar bosonic quantum gas. We employ adiabatic state preparation and explore the collective magnetization response to an applied bias potential, finding that the relative increase of interactions leads to an enhanced and muted response for the ground state and excited state, respectively. We further find evidence for significant $Z_2$ symmetry breaking of the sample magnetization for the ground state, consistent with the expected beyond-mean-field behavior. These results suggest that the nonlinear interactions of scalar Bose condensates could provide a simple, direct path towards the squeezing of momentum states for quantum sensing.</description>

      <title>Counterflow of lattice polarons in harmonically confined optical lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a mobile impurity in a one-dimensional harmonically confined optical lattice interacting repulsively with a bosonic bath. The behavior of the impurity across baths with superfluid and Mott-insulator domains is examined, including its full back-action effect on the bath. We characterize the bath-impurity phase diagram and reveal the appearance of a correlated counterflow phase, which we support with an analytical model for a mobile impurity-hole pair. This phase shows a combined insulator domain of unity filling but no independent domain of constant density. The transition to this phase features a sudden orthogonality catastrophe and the change of the shape of the impurity's profile to that of a free particle in an infinite square well. The findings of this work suggest the appearance of unconventional counterflow in trapped imbalanced atomic mixtures.</description>

      <title>Bose-Einstein condensation of five $\alpha$ clusters in $^{20}$Ne and supersolidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the five $\alpha$ cluster states recently observed in $^{20}$Ne, slightly above the five $\alpha$ threshold energy, are Bose-Einstein condensates of five $\alpha$ clusters. The states are described well using a superfluid cluster model, where the order parameter is defined. We suggest that the the five $\alpha$ states are fragmented. Theory predicts the emergence of a five $\alpha$ rotational roton band characterized by a large moment of inertia. This band is formed through roton excitations of the five $\alpha$ BEC vacuum and possesses dual properties of superfluidity and crystallinity, a property of supersolidity. The persistent existence of such a roton bandis discussed and confirmed for the four $\alpha$ condensate above the four $\alpha$ threshold in $^{16}$O and the three $\alpha$ condensate above the three $\alpha$ threshold in $^{12}$C.</description>

      <title>Solitons in Bose-Einstein Condensates with Attractive Self-Interaction on a M\"obius Strip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the matter-wave solitons in Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) trapped on a M\"{o}bius strip (MS), based on the respective Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) equation with the mean-field theory. In the linear regime, vortex states are characterized by quantum numbers, $n$ and $m$, corresponding to the transverse and circumferential directions, with the phase structure determined by the winding number (WN) $m$. Odd and even values of $n$ must associate, respectively, with integer and half-integer values of $m$, the latter ones requiring two cycles of motion around MS for returning to the initial phase. Using variational and numerical methods, we solve the GP equation with the attractive nonlinearity, producing a family of ground-state (GS) solitons for values of the norm below the critical one, above which the collapse sets in. Vortex solitons with $n=1,m=1$ and $% n=2,m=1/2$ are obtained in a numerical form. The vortex solitons with $% n=1,m=1$ are almost uniformly distributed in the azimuthal direction, while ones with $n=2,m=1/2$ form localized states. The Vakhitov-Kolokolov criterion and linear-stability analysis for the GS soliton solutions and vortices with $n=1,m=1$ demonstrates that they are completely stable, while the localized states with $n=2,m=1/2$ are completely unstable. Finally, the motion of solitons on the MS and the collision of two solitons are discussed.</description>

      <title>Delta-Kick Collimation of Heteronuclear Feshbach Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a theoretical study of delta-kick collimation (DKC) applied to heteronuclear Feshbach molecules, focusing on both condensed and thermal ensembles across various interaction and temperature regimes. We demonstrate that DKC enables significant reductions in molecular cloud expansion energies and beam divergence, achieving expansion energies in the picokelvin range, comparable to state-of-the-art results obtained experimentally with atoms. Furthermore, we show that vibrational and translational motions remain strongly decoupled throughout the process, ensuring molecular stability during the delta-kick. This work paves the way for advanced experimental sequences involving degenerate ground state molecules, light-pulse molecular interferometry, and applications of dual-species precision measurements, such as testing the universality of free fall.</description>

      <title>Superspin Renormalization and Slow Relaxation in Random Spin Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop an excited-state real-space renormalization group (RSRG-X) formalism to describe the dynamics of conserved densities in randomly interacting spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ systems. Our formalism is suitable for systems with $\textrm{U}(1)$ and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetries, and we apply it to chains of randomly positioned spins with dipolar $XX+YY$ interactions, as arise in Rydberg quantum simulators and other platforms. The formalism generates a sequence of effective Hamiltonians which provide approximate descriptions for dynamics on successively smaller energy scales. These effective Hamiltonians involve ``superspins'': two-level collective degrees of freedom constructed from (anti)aligned microscopic spins. Conserved densities can then be understood as relaxing via coherent collective spin flips. For the well-studied simpler case of randomly interacting nearest-neighbor $XX+YY$ chains, the superspins reduce to single spins. Our formalism also leads to a numerical method capable of simulating the dynamics up to an otherwise inaccessible combination of large system size and late time. Focusing on disorder-averaged infinite-temperature autocorrelation functions, in particular the local spin survival probability $\overline{S_p}(t)$, we demonstrate quantitative agreement in results between our algorithm and exact diagonalization (ED) at low but nonzero frequencies. Such agreement holds for chains with nearest-neighbor, next-nearest-neighbor, and long-range dipolar interactions. Our results indicate decay of $\overline{S_p}(t)$ slower than any power law and feature no significant deviation from the $\sim 1/ \log^2(t)$ asymptote expected from the infinite-randomness fixed-point of the nearest-neighbor model. We also apply the RSRG-X formalism to two-dimensional long-range systems of moderate size and find slow late-time decay of $\overline{S_p}(t)$.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional quantum breakdown model with Krylov subspace many-body localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10968v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a two-dimensional (2d) quantum breakdown model of hardcore bosons interacting with disordered spins which would be classical without the bosons. It resembles particles incident into supersaturated vapor. The model exhibits a set of subsystem symmetries, and has a strong fragmentation into Krylov subspaces in each symmetry sector. The Hamiltonian in each Krylov subspace maps to a single-particle problem in a Cayley tree-like graph. At zero disorder, the Krylov subspaces exhibit either (possible) integrable features, or quantum chaos with quantum scar states showing irregular energy and degeneracy patterns. At nonzero disorders, they enter a 2d many-body localization (MBL) phase beyond certain disorder strength $W_*$, as indicated by Poisson level spacing statistics and entanglement entropy growing as $\log t$ with time $t$. Our theoretical arguments suggest $W_*$ is finite or zero for boson number $N_b\lesssim L^\gamma/\log L$ ($1/2\le \gamma \le 1$) as system size $L\rightarrow\infty$. This gives a more stringent condition for MBL than that in the 1d quantum breakdown models. This model reveals the possibility of MBL in systems of quantum particles interacting with classical degrees of freedom.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01252v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I demonstrate a pairing mechanism of dopants in a magnetic lattice, emerging from the underlying high-temperature disorder of the spins. The effect is demonstrated in a mixed-dimensional model, where dopants travel along a two-leg ladder, while the spins feature Ising interactions along the rungs and the legs of the ladder. The dynamics following the sudden immersion of two nearest neighbor dopants in an infinite temperature spin lattice shows that thermal spin disorder frustrates the relative motion of the dopants and enforces them to co-propagate. The predictions are shown to be realistically testable in quantum simulation experiments.</description>

      <title>Violation of the Leggett-Garg inequality for dynamics of a Bose-Einstein condensate in a double-well potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05304v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Leggett-Garg inequality (LGI) serves as a criterion to determine the adherence of macroscopic system dynamics to macrorealism, as introduced by Leggett and Garg. A violation of this inequality implies either the absence of a realistic description of the system or the impossibility of noninvasive measurement. In this Letter, we investigate the violation of the LGI for the system of bosons in a double-well potential. Specifically, we explore the violation of the LGI in the dynamics of bosons in a double-well potential in the Bose-Einstein-condensation (BEC) regime, where the system can be considered as two weakly coupled Bose condensates, and in the single-particle regime to establish the conditions under which the violation of the LGI occurs. Our analysis reveals that the LGI is violated due to Josephson oscillations, while it remains unviolated in the strong coupling regime, attributed to the self-trapping phenomena. Notably, we observe that the violation of the LGI becomes increasingly significant as the particle number increases. These findings provide valuable insights into the macrorealistic behavior of Bose condensates and highlight the effect of measurements on the dynamics of a macroscopic system.</description>

      <title>Instability of the engineered dark state in two-band fermions under number-conserving dissipative dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04987v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Correlated quantum many-body states can be created and controlled by the dissipative protocols. Among these, particle number-conserving protocols are particularly appealing due to their ability to stabilize topologically nontrivial phases. Is there any fundamental limitation to their performance? We address this question by examining a general class of models involving a two-band fermion system subjected to dissipation designed to transfer fermions from the upper band to the lower band. By construction, these models have a guaranteed steady state - a dark state - with a completely filled lower band and an empty upper band. In the limit of weak dissipation, we derive equations governing the long-wavelength and long-time dynamics of the fermion densities and analyze them numerically. These equations belong to the Fisher-Kolmogorov-Petrovsky-Piskunov reaction-diffusion universality class. Our analysis reveals that the engineered dark state is generically unstable, giving way to a new steady state with a finite density of particles in the upper band. We also estimate the minimum system sizes required to observe this instability in finite systems. Our results suggest that number-conserving dissipative protocols may not be a reliable universal tool for stabilizing dark states.</description>
