      <title>The Quantum Dynamics of Cost Accounting: Investigating WIP via the Time-Independent Schrodinger Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The intersection of quantum theory and accounting presents a novel and intriguing frontier in exploring financial valuation and accounting practices. This paper applies quantum theory to cost accounting, specifically Work in Progress (WIP) valuation. WIP is conceptualized as materials in a quantum superposition state whose financial value remains uncertain until observed or measured. This work comprehensively reviews the seminal works that explored the overlap between quantum theory and accounting. The primary contribution of this work is a more nuanced understanding of the uncertainties involved, which emerges by applying quantum phenomena to model the complexities and uncertainties inherent in managerial accounting. In contrast, previous works focus more on financial accounting or general accountancy.</description>

      <title>Arbitrage impact on the relationship between XRP price and correlation tensor spectra of transaction networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing use of cryptoassets for international remittances has proven to be faster and more cost-effective, particularly for migrants without access to traditional banking. However, the inherent volatility of cryptoasset prices, independent of blockchain-based remittance mechanisms, introduces potential risks during periods of high volatility. This study investigates the intricate dynamics between XRP price fluctuations across diverse crypto exchanges and the correlation of the largest singular values of the correlation tensor of XRP transaction networks. Particularly, we show the impact of arbitrage opportunities across different crypto exchanges on the relationship between XRP price and correlation tensor spectra of transaction networks. Distinct periods, non-bubble and bubble, showcase different characteristics in XRP price fluctuations. Establishing a connection between XRP price and transaction networks, we compute correlation tensors and singular values, emphasizing the significance of the largest singular value. Comparisons with reshuffled and Gaussian random correlation tensors validate the uniqueness of the empirical tensor. A set of simulated weekly XRP prices, resembling arbitrage opportunities across various crypto exchanges, further confirms the robustness of our findings. It reveals a pronounced anti-correlation during bubble periods and a non-significant correlation during non-bubble periods with the largest singular value, irrespective of price fluctuations across different crypto exchanges.</description>

      <title>NumLLM: Numeric-Sensitive Large Language Model for Chinese Finance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, many works have proposed various financial large language models (FinLLMs) by pre-training from scratch or fine-tuning open-sourced LLMs on financial corpora. However, existing FinLLMs exhibit unsatisfactory performance in understanding financial text when numeric variables are involved in questions. In this paper, we propose a novel LLM, called numeric-sensitive large language model (NumLLM), for Chinese finance. We first construct a financial corpus from financial textbooks which is essential for improving numeric capability of LLMs during fine-tuning. After that, we train two individual low-rank adaptation (LoRA) modules by fine-tuning on our constructed financial corpus. One module is for adapting general-purpose LLMs to financial domain, and the other module is for enhancing the ability of NumLLM to understand financial text with numeric variables. Lastly, we merge the two LoRA modules into the foundation model to obtain NumLLM for inference. Experiments on financial question-answering benchmark show that NumLLM can boost the performance of the foundation model and can achieve the best overall performance compared to all baselines, on both numeric and non-numeric questions.</description>

      <title>The Shape of Money Laundering: Subgraph Representation Learning on the Blockchain with the Elliptic2 Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19109v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Subgraph representation learning is a technique for analyzing local structures (or shapes) within complex networks. Enabled by recent developments in scalable Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), this approach encodes relational information at a subgroup level (multiple connected nodes) rather than at a node level of abstraction. We posit that certain domain applications, such as anti-money laundering (AML), are inherently subgraph problems and mainstream graph techniques have been operating at a suboptimal level of abstraction. This is due in part to the scarcity of annotated datasets of real-world size and complexity, as well as the lack of software tools for managing subgraph GNN workflows at scale. To enable work in fundamental algorithms as well as domain applications in AML and beyond, we introduce Elliptic2, a large graph dataset containing 122K labeled subgraphs of Bitcoin clusters within a background graph consisting of 49M node clusters and 196M edge transactions. The dataset provides subgraphs known to be linked to illicit activity for learning the set of "shapes" that money laundering exhibits in cryptocurrency and accurately classifying new criminal activity. Along with the dataset we share our graph techniques, software tooling, promising early experimental results, and new domain insights already gleaned from this approach. Taken together, we find immediate practical value in this approach and the potential for a new standard in anti-money laundering and forensic analytics in cryptocurrencies and other financial networks.</description>
