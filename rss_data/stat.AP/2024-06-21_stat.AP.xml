      <title>Evaluation of Missing Data Analytical Techniques in Longitudinal Research: Traditional and Machine Learning Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Missing Not at Random (MNAR) and nonnormal data are challenging to handle. Traditional missing data analytical techniques such as full information maximum likelihood estimation (FIML) may fail with nonnormal data as they are built on normal distribution assumptions. Two-Stage Robust Estimation (TSRE) does manage nonnormal data, but both FIML and TSRE are less explored in longitudinal studies under MNAR conditions with nonnormal distributions. Unlike traditional statistical approaches, machine learning approaches do not require distributional assumptions about the data. More importantly, they have shown promise for MNAR data; however, their application in longitudinal studies, addressing both Missing at Random (MAR) and MNAR scenarios, is also underexplored. This study utilizes Monte Carlo simulations to assess and compare the effectiveness of six analytical techniques for missing data within the growth curve modeling framework. These techniques include traditional approaches like FIML and TSRE, machine learning approaches by single imputation (K-Nearest Neighbors and missForest), and machine learning approaches by multiple imputation (micecart and miceForest). We investigate the influence of sample size, missing data rate, missing data mechanism, and data distribution on the accuracy and efficiency of model estimation. Our findings indicate that FIML is most effective for MNAR data among the tested approaches. TSRE excels in handling MAR data, while missForest is only advantageous in limited conditions with a combination of very skewed distributions, very large sample sizes (e.g., n larger than 1000), and low missing data rates.</description>

      <title>Temperature in the Iberian Peninsula: Trend, seasonality, and heterogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose fitting unobserved component models to represent the dynamic evolution of bivariate systems of centre and log-range temperatures obtained monthly from minimum/maximum temperatures observed at a given location. In doing so, the centre and log-range temperature are decomposed into potentially stochastic trends, seasonal, and transitory components. Since our model encompasses deterministic trends and seasonal components as limiting cases, we contribute to the debate on whether stochastic or deterministic components better represent the trend and seasonal components. The methodology is implemented to centre and log-range temperature observed in four locations in the Iberian Peninsula, namely, Barcelona, Coru\~{n}a, Madrid, and Seville. We show that, at each location, the centre temperature can be represented by a smooth integrated random walk with time-varying slope, while a stochastic level better represents the log-range. We also show that centre and log-range temperature are unrelated. The methodology is then extended to simultaneously model centre and log-range temperature observed at several locations in the Iberian Peninsula. We fit a multi-level dynamic factor model to extract potential commonalities among centre (log-range) temperature while also allowing for heterogeneity in different areas in the Iberian Peninsula. We show that, although the commonality in trends of average temperature is considerable, the regional components are also relevant.</description>

      <title>Enhancing multivariate post-processed visibility predictions utilizing CAMS forecasts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In our contemporary era, meteorological weather forecasts increasingly incorporate ensemble predictions of visibility - a parameter of great importance in aviation, maritime navigation, and air quality assessment, with direct implications for public health. However, this weather variable falls short of the predictive accuracy achieved for other quantities issued by meteorological centers. Therefore, statistical post-processing is recommended to enhance the reliability and accuracy of predictions. By estimating the predictive distributions of the variables with the aid of historical observations and forecasts, one can achieve statistical consistency between true observations and ensemble predictions. Visibility observations, following the recommendation of the World Meteorological Organization, are typically reported in discrete values; hence, the predictive distribution of the weather quantity takes the form of a discrete parametric law. Recent studies demonstrated that the application of classification algorithms can successfully improve the skill of such discrete forecasts; however, a frequently emerging issue is that certain spatial and/or temporal dependencies could be lost between marginals. Based on visibility ensemble forecasts of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts for 30 locations in Central Europe, we investigate whether the inclusion of Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) predictions of the same weather quantity as an additional covariate could enhance the skill of the post-processing methods and whether it contributes to the successful integration of spatial dependence between marginals. Our study confirms that post-processed forecasts are substantially superior to raw and climatological predictions, and the utilization of CAMS forecasts provides a further significant enhancement both in the univariate and multivariate setup.</description>

      <title>Integrating time-resolved $nrf2$ gene-expression data into a full GUTS model as a proxy for toxicodynamic damage in zebrafish embryo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The immense production of the chemical industry requires an improved predictive risk assessment that can handle constantly evolving challenges while reducing the dependency of risk assessment on animal testing. Integrating 'omics data into mechanistic models offers a promising solution by linking cellular processes triggered after chemical exposure with observed effects in the organism. With the emerging availability of time-resolved RNA data, the goal of integrating gene expression data into mechanistic models can be approached. We propose a biologically anchored TKTD model, which describes key processes that link the gene expression level of the stress regulator $nrf2$ to detoxification and lethality by associating toxicodynamic damage with $nrf2$ expression. Fitting such a model to complex datasets consisting of multiple endpoints required the combination of methods from molecular biology, mechanistic dynamic systems modeling and Bayesian inference. In this study we successfully integrate time-resolved gene expression data into TKTD models, and thus provide a method for assessing the influence of molecular markers on survival. This novel method was used to test whether, $nrf2$, can be applied to predict lethality in zebrafish embryos. With the presented approach we outline a method to successively approach the goal of a predictive risk assessment based on molecular data.</description>

      <title>Scale-Translation Equivariant Network for Oceanic Internal Solitary Wave Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Internal solitary waves (ISWs) are gravity waves that are often observed in the interior ocean rather than the surface. They hold significant importance due to their capacity to carry substantial energy, thus influence pollutant transport, oil platform operations, submarine navigation, etc. Researchers have studied ISWs through optical images, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, and altimeter data from remote sensing instruments. However, cloud cover in optical remote sensing images variably obscures ground information, leading to blurred or missing surface observations. As such, this paper aims at altimeter-based machine learning solutions to automatically locate ISWs. The challenges, however, lie in the following two aspects: 1) the altimeter data has low resolution, which requires a strong machine learner; 2) labeling data is extremely labor-intensive, leading to very limited data for training. In recent years, the grand progress of deep learning demonstrates strong learning capacity given abundant data. Besides, more recent studies on efficient learning and self-supervised learning laid solid foundations to tackle the aforementioned challenges. In this paper, we propose to inject prior knowledge to achieve a strong and efficient learner. Specifically, intrinsic patterns in altimetry data are efficiently captured using a scale-translation equivariant convolutional neural network (ST-ECNN). By considering inherent symmetries in neural network design, ST-ECNN achieves higher efficiency and better performance than baseline models. Furthermore, we also introduce prior knowledge from massive unsupervised data to enhance our solution using the SimCLR framework for pre-training. Our final solution achieves an overall better performance than baselines on our handcrafted altimetry dataset.

      <title>A finite-infinite shared atoms nested model for the Bayesian analysis of large grouped data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The use of hierarchical mixture priors with shared atoms has recently flourished in the Bayesian literature for partially exchangeable data. Leveraging on nested levels of mixtures, these models allow the estimation of a two-layered data partition: across groups and across observations. This paper discusses and compares the properties of such modeling strategies when the mixing weights are assigned either a finite-dimensional Dirichlet distribution or a Dirichlet process prior. Based on these considerations, we introduce a novel hierarchical nonparametric prior based on a finite set of shared atoms, a specification that enhances the flexibility of the induced random measures and the availability of fast posterior inference. To support these findings, we analytically derive the induced prior correlation structure and partially exchangeable partition probability function. Additionally, we develop a novel mean-field variational algorithm for posterior inference to boost the applicability of our nested model to large multivariate data. We then assess and compare the performance of the different shared-atom specifications via simulation. We also show that our variational proposal is highly scalable and that the accuracy of the posterior density estimate and the estimated partition is comparable with state-of-the-art Gibbs sampler algorithms. Finally, we apply our model to a real dataset of Spotify's song features, simultaneously segmenting artists and songs with similar characteristics.</description>

      <title>Gradient-Boosted Generalized Linear Models for Conditional Vine Copulas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vine copulas are flexible dependence models using bivariate copulas as building blocks. If the parameters of the bivariate copulas in the vine copula depend on covariates, one obtains a conditional vine copula. We propose an extension for the estimation of continuous conditional vine copulas, where the parameters of continuous conditional bivariate copulas are estimated sequentially and separately via gradient-boosting. For this purpose, we link covariates via generalized linear models (GLMs) to Kendall's $\tau$ correlation coefficient from which the corresponding copula parameter can be obtained. Consequently, the gradient-boosting algorithm estimates the copula parameters providing a natural covariate selection. In a second step, an additional covariate deselection procedure is applied. The performance of the gradient-boosted conditional vine copulas is illustrated in a simulation study. Linear covariate effects in low- and high-dimensional settings are investigated for the conditional bivariate copulas separately and for conditional vine copulas. Moreover, the gradient-boosted conditional vine copulas are applied to the temporal postprocessing of ensemble weather forecasts in a low-dimensional setting. The results show, that our suggested method is able to outperform the benchmark methods and identifies temporal correlations better. Eventually, we provide an R-package called boostCopula for this method.</description>

      <title>Temporal label recovery from noisy dynamical data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analyzing dynamical data often requires information of the temporal labels, but such information is unavailable in many applications. Recovery of these temporal labels, closely related to the seriation or sequencing problem, becomes crucial in the study. However, challenges arise due to the nonlinear nature of the data and the complexity of the underlying dynamical system, which may be periodic or non-periodic. Additionally, noise within the feature space complicates the theoretical analysis. Our work develops spectral algorithms that leverage manifold learning concepts to recover temporal labels from noisy data. We first construct the graph Laplacian of the data, and then employ the second (and the third) Fiedler vectors to recover temporal labels. This method can be applied to both periodic and aperiodic cases. It also does not require monotone properties on the similarity matrix, which are commonly assumed in existing spectral seriation algorithms. We develop the $\ell_{\infty}$ error of our estimators for the temporal labels and ranking, without assumptions on the eigen-gap. In numerical analysis, our method outperforms spectral seriation algorithms based on a similarity matrix. The performance of our algorithms is further demonstrated on a synthetic biomolecule data example.</description>

      <title>Association of neighborhood disadvantage with cognitive function and cortical disorganization in an unimpaired cohort</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neighborhood disadvantage is associated with worse health and cognitive outcomes. Morphological similarity network (MSN) is a promising approach to elucidate cortical network patterns underlying complex cognitive functions. We hypothesized that MSNs could capture changes in cortical patterns related to neighborhood disadvantage and cognitive function. This cross-sectional study included cognitively unimpaired participants from two large Alzheimers studies at University of Wisconsin-Madison. Neighborhood disadvantage status was obtained using the Area Deprivation Index (ADI). Cognitive performance was assessed on memory, processing speed and executive function. Morphological Similarity Networks (MSN) were constructed for each participant based on the similarity in distribution of cortical thickness of brain regions, followed by computation of local and global network features. Association of ADI with cognitive scores and MSN features were examined using linear regression and mediation analysis. ADI showed negative association with category fluency,implicit learning speed, story recall and modified pre-clinical Alzheimers cognitive composite scores, indicating worse cognitive function among those living in more disadvantaged neighborhoods. Local network features of frontal and temporal regions differed based on ADI status. Centrality of left lateral orbitofrontal region showed a partial mediating effect between association of neighborhood disadvantage and story recall performance. Our preliminary findings suggest differences in local cortical organization by neighborhood disadvantage, which partially mediated the relationship between ADI and cognitive performance, providing a possible network-based mechanism to, in-part, explain the risk for poor cognitive functioning associated with disadvantaged neighborhoods.</description>

      <title>Averaging polyhazard models using Piecewise deterministic Monte Carlo with applications to data with long-term survivors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polyhazard models are a class of flexible parametric models for modelling survival over extended time horizons. Their additive hazard structure allows for flexible, non-proportional hazards whose characteristics can change over time while retaining a parametric form, which allows for survival to be extrapolated beyond the observation period of a study. Significant user input is required, however, in selecting the number of latent hazards to model, their distributions and the choice of which variables to associate with each hazard. The resulting set of models is too large to explore manually, limiting their practical usefulness. Motivated by applications to stroke survivor and kidney transplant patient survival times we extend the standard polyhazard model through a prior structure allowing for joint inference of parameters and structural quantities, and develop a sampling scheme that utilises state-of-the-art Piecewise Deterministic Markov Processes to sample from the resulting transdimensional posterior with minimal user tuning.</description>

Abstract: In various stereological problems an $n$-dimensional convex body is intersected with an $(n-1)$-dimensional Isotropic Uniformly Random (IUR) hyperplane. In this paper the cumulative distribution function associated with the $(n-1)$-dimensional volume of such a random section is studied. This distribution is also known as chord length distribution and cross section area distribution in the planar and spatial case respectively. For various classes of convex bodies it is shown that these distribution functions are absolutely continuous with respect to Lebesgue measure. A Monte Carlo simulation scheme is proposed for approximating the corresponding probability density functions.</description>

      <title>Predicting Progression Events in Multiple Myeloma from Routine Blood Work</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18051v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ability to accurately predict disease progression is paramount for optimizing multiple myeloma patient care. This study introduces a hybrid neural network architecture, combining Long Short-Term Memory networks with a Conditional Restricted Boltzmann Machine, to predict future blood work of affected patients from a series of historical laboratory results. We demonstrate that our model can replicate the statistical moments of the time series ($0.95~\pm~0.01~\geq~R^2~\geq~0.83~\pm~0.03$) and forecast future blood work features with high correlation to actual patient data ($0.92\pm0.02~\geq~r~\geq~0.52~\pm~0.09$). Subsequently, a second Long Short-Term Memory network is employed to detect and annotate disease progression events within the forecasted blood work time series. We show that these annotations enable the prediction of progression events with significant reliability (AUROC$~=~0.88~\pm~0.01$), up to 12 months in advance (AUROC($t+12~$mos)$~=0.65~\pm~0.01$). Our system is designed in a modular fashion, featuring separate entities for forecasting and progression event annotation. This structure not only enhances interpretability but also facilitates the integration of additional modules to perform subsequent operations on the generated outputs. Our approach utilizes a minimal set of routine blood work measurements, which avoids the need for expensive or resource-intensive tests and ensures accessibility of the system in clinical routine. This capability allows for individualized risk assessment and making informed treatment decisions tailored to a patient's unique disease kinetics. The represented approach contributes to the development of a scalable and cost-effective virtual human twin system for optimized healthcare resource utilization and improved patient outcomes in multiple myeloma care.</description>

      <title>Augmented Degree Correction for Bipartite Networks with Applications to Recommender Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.06436v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recommender systems, users rate items, and are subsequently served other product recommendations based on these ratings. Even though users usually rate a tiny percentage of the available items, the system tries to estimate unobserved preferences by finding similarities across users and across items. In this work, we treat the observed ratings data as partially observed, dense, weighted, bipartite networks. For a class of systems without outside information, we adapt an approach developed for dense, weighted networks to account for unobserved edges and the bipartite nature of the problem. This approach allows for community structure, and for local estimation of flexible patterns of ratings across different pairs of communities. We compare the performance of our proposed approach to existing methods on a simulated data set, as well as on a data set of joke ratings, examining model performance in both cases at differing levels of sparsity.</description>

      <title>Lazy Data Practices Harm Fairness Research</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17293v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data practices shape research and practice on fairness in machine learning (fair ML). Critical data studies offer important reflections and critiques for the responsible advancement of the field by highlighting shortcomings and proposing recommendations for improvement. In this work, we present a comprehensive analysis of fair ML datasets, demonstrating how unreflective yet common practices hinder the reach and reliability of algorithmic fairness findings. We systematically study protected information encoded in tabular datasets and their usage in 280 experiments across 142 publications.
  Our analyses identify three main areas of concern: (1) a \textbf{lack of representation for certain protected attributes} in both data and evaluations; (2) the widespread \textbf{exclusion of minorities} during data preprocessing; and (3) \textbf{opaque data processing} threatening the generalization of fairness research. By conducting exemplary analyses on the utilization of prominent datasets, we demonstrate how unreflective data decisions disproportionately affect minority groups, fairness metrics, and resultant model comparisons. Additionally, we identify supplementary factors such as limitations in publicly available data, privacy considerations, and a general lack of awareness, which exacerbate these challenges. To address these issues, we propose a set of recommendations for data usage in fairness research centered on transparency and responsible inclusion. This study underscores the need for a critical reevaluation of data practices in fair ML and offers directions to improve both the sourcing and usage of datasets.</description>

      <title>Testing the Fairness-Improvability of Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04816v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many organizations use algorithms that have a disparate impact, i.e., the benefits or harms of the algorithm fall disproportionately on certain social groups. Addressing an algorithm's disparate impact can be challenging, especially because it is often unclear whether reducing this impact is possible without sacrificing other important objectives of the organization, such as accuracy or profit. Establishing the improvability of algorithms with respect to multiple criteria is of both conceptual and practical interest: in many settings, disparate impact that would otherwise be prohibited under US federal law is permissible if it is necessary to achieve a legitimate business interest. The question is how a policy-maker can formally substantiate, or refute, this necessity defense. In this paper, we provide an econometric framework for testing the hypothesis that it is possible to improve on the fairness of an algorithm without compromising on other pre-specified objectives. Our proposed test is simple to implement and can be applied under any exogenous constraint on the algorithm space. We establish the large-sample validity and consistency of our test, and illustrate its practical application by evaluating a healthcare algorithm originally considered by Obermeyer et al 2019. In this application, we reject the null hypothesis that it is not possible to reduce the algorithm's disparate impact without compromising on the accuracy of its predictions.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Structural Model Updating with Multimodal Variational Autoencoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09051v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A novel framework for Bayesian structural model updating is presented in this study. The proposed method utilizes the surrogate unimodal encoders of a multimodal variational autoencoder (VAE). The method facilitates an approximation of the likelihood when dealing with a small number of observations. It is particularly suitable for high-dimensional correlated simultaneous observations applicable to various dynamic analysis models. The proposed approach was benchmarked using a numerical model of a single-story frame building with acceleration and dynamic strain measurements. Additionally, an example involving a Bayesian update of nonlinear model parameters for a three-degree-of-freedom lumped mass model demonstrates computational efficiency when compared to using the original VAE, while maintaining adequate accuracy for practical applications.</description>
