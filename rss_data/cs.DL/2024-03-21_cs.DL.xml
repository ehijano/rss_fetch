      <title>Quantitative Analysis of AI-Generated Texts in Academic Research: A Study of AI Presence in Arxiv Submissions using AI Detection Tool</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many people are interested in ChatGPT since it has become a prominent AIGC model that provides high-quality responses in various contexts, such as software development and maintenance. Misuse of ChatGPT might cause significant issues, particularly in public safety and education, despite its immense potential. The majority of researchers choose to publish their work on Arxiv. The effectiveness and originality of future work depend on the ability to detect AI components in such contributions. To address this need, this study will analyze a method that can see purposely manufactured content that academic organizations use to post on Arxiv. For this study, a dataset was created using physics, mathematics, and computer science articles. Using the newly built dataset, the following step is to put originality.ai through its paces. The statistical analysis shows that Originality.ai is very accurate, with a rate of 98%.</description>

      <title>Can Generative AI Generate Breakthrough Ideas?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16839v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The surge in generative AI capabilities has affected sectors such as drug discovery and creative text generation, fueling widespread enthusiasm about its potential to revolutionize scientific discovery through efficient exploration of knowledge combinations. But is this belief well-founded? This belief is rooted in the recombinant growth theory, which posits that innovation accelerates when existing ideas are iteratively combined. However, the theory encounters two significant challenges in understanding the nature of breakthroughs. First, breakthroughs such as relativity replacing Newtonian physics drive progress through competition, because they are fundamentally substitutive of older ones. Second, the recombinant strategy often only generates different ideas rather than better ones. Building on these, our study indicates the limitation of combinatorial view of innovation and point to the role of idea competition rather than combination in advancing science, even in the age of AI. Our results suggest that breakthroughs occur when ideas compete, not when they combine, and that combining more ideas tends to result in smaller innovations. This challenges the combinatoric metaphor of innovation that has captivated academia for three decades and complements subsequent studies equating content novelty with transformative innovation. Policymakers and researchers should focus on fostering environments that encourage idea competition and the development of AI systems capable of generating novel, disruptive ideas.</description>
