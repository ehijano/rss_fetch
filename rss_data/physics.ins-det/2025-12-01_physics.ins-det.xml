      <title>Timing resolution from very thin LGAD sensors tested on particle beam down to 12 ps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper reports on the timing resolution obtained with the Low-Gain Avalanche Diode (LGAD) sensors for extreme fluences at the DESY Test Beam Facility with 4 GeV/c electrons. The LGADs adopt an $n$-in-$p$ technology with a $p^{+}$-type boron gain implant, co-implanted with carbon to mitigate acceptor deactivation. The substrate thickness of the sensors varies from 20 $\mu$m to 45 $\mu$m, with an active area spanning from 0.75 $\times$ 0.75 to 1.28 $\times$ 1.28 mm$^{2}$. A set of 30 $\mu$m sensors irradiated with neutrons at fluences between 4 $\times$ 10$^{14}$ and 2.5 $\times$ 10$^{15}$ n$_{\textrm{1 MeV eq.}}$cm$^{-2}$ were tested on the beam. The gain was measured between 7 and 40 across all non-irradiated sensors in the study, and between 7 and 30 in irradiated sensors. The experimental setup consisted of a 45 $\mu$m-thick trigger sensor with an active area of 3.6 $\times$ 3.6 mm$^{2}$, four device-under-test (DUT) planes, and a Photonis micro-channel plate photomultiplier tube (MCP) as a time reference. The timing resolution was calculated from Gaussian fitting of the difference in times of arrival of a particle at a DUT and the MCP, using the constant fraction discrimination technique. A timing resolution of 26.4 ps was achieved in 45 $\mu$m sensors, and down to 16.6 ps in 20 $\mu$m sensors. The combination of two 20 $\mu$m LGAD sensors reached a timing resolution of 12.2 ps. A timing resolution of below 20 ps was obtained in all irradiated 30 $\mu$m sensors.</description>

      <title>Accurate simulations of magnetic excitations in the neutron simulation package McStas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new component for the accurate simulation of neutron scattering from magnetic excitations has been developed for the neutron ray-tracing software McStas. The component SpinWave_BCO simulates inelastic neutron scattering from ferro-, antiferro-, and altermagnetic excitations in a body-centered orthorhombic crystal structure, where the dispersion relation and scattered neutron intensities are derived using linear spin wave theory.
  Data from a simulated Triple-Axis Spectrometer with an extremely high resolution have been verified by direct comparison with theory and by comparison to data simulated using the package SpinW. The component serves as a proof-of-concept for the implementation of a more general linear spin wave component in McStas.</description>

      <title>A nonlinear multiphysics model for the design validation of the ASTAROTH copper-steel cryogenic chamber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Among the global efforts to directly detect dark matter, the only positive claim so far relies on NaI(Tl) crystal detectors, making this technology of particular interest. ASTAROTH is a project aimed at developing the next generation of such detectors by reading out their scintillation light with SiPM matrices operated at cryogenic temperatures. This paper describes the innovative design of the ASTAROTH cryostat, consisting of a double-walled copper-steel cryogenic chamber that cools the detectors by means of a liquid argon bath. The detectors are thermalized in a helium atmosphere at a temperature tunable from 87 to 150 K. The design has been validated in terms of heat transfer efficiency and mechanical stress, developing of a nonlinear multiphysics model. The mechanical properties of OFHC copper were experimentally evaluated on dedicated tensile samples. The simulation results show that the structural integrity is guaranteed. At the highest operating temperature, the region with the steepest temperature gradient exhibits stresses that slightly exceed the yield strength of copper (localized strain-hardened condition). Following construction, the cryostat was commissioned and has been in regular operation for over 30 cooling cycles, with no signs of degradation. The temperature can be tuned across the full target range and remains stable within 0.1 K. These results demonstrate that this is a viable design for next-generation dark matter detectors, as well as for a variety of applications requiring uniform and tunable gas-conducted cooling of instrumentation.</description>

      <title>Initial Assessment of Second Generation of Large-Area Picosecond Photodetectors with Multi-Channel Systems-on-a-Chip Readout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We first briefly describe the history and motivation behind Cherenkov and scintillation light detection. We then discuss the instrumentation needed to detect these photons as it applies to both photodetectors and readout electronics. One of the motivations is future large neutrino detectors that could in principle differentiate between Cherenkov and scintillation light if using novel water-based scintillators. In this paper, we present the first measurements utilizing the second generation of Large Area Picosecond Photodetectors (LAPPDs) in conjunction with commercial system-on-a-chip readouts from Nalu Scientific -- specifically, the High Density System on Chip (HDSoC) and Advanced ASoC Rapid Digitizer, Variable Adaptive Readout Chip (AARDVARC) platforms. These state-of-the-art full-waveform digitizers feature sampling rates on the order of 1 and 10 samples per nanosecond, respectively. Using a picosecond laser, we measured the timing jitter between a pair of LAPPD channels, demonstrating the potential of this setup for precise timing applications.</description>

      <title>Statistical analysis and correction of the pile-up effect in MAPMT single photoelectron counting with the SPACIROC-3 ASIC: application to the Mini-EUSO experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study addressing pile-up effects in single photoelectron counting with R-11265 Hamamatsu multi-anode photomultiplier tubes (MAPMTs) equipped with the SPACIROC-3 ASIC. Extended dead time in the electronics causes saturation and quenching of the counting rate, an effect we counter by inverting the pile-up plot once the double pulse resolution is determined. Our work combines extensive numerical simulations with experimental validations to quantify the statistical uncertainties associated with the corrected event rates. We apply this methodology to the Mini-EUSO experiment onboard the International Space Station where machine learning techniques are employed to extract pixel-by-pixel double pulse resolutions from long-term photon count histograms. This integrated approach enables the accurate recovery of true photon fluxes essential for studying ELVES, meteors and other transient phenomena detected by Mini-EUSO.</description>

      <title>An interpretable unsupervised representation learning for high precision measurement in particle physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unsupervised learning has been widely applied to various tasks in particle physics. However, existing models lack precise control over their learned representations, limiting physical interpretability and hindering their use for accurate measurements. We propose the Histogram AutoEncoder (HistoAE), an unsupervised representation learning network featuring a custom histogram-based loss that enforces a physically structured latent space. Applied to silicon microstrip detectors, HistoAE learns an interpretable two-dimensional latent space corresponding to the particle's charge and impact position. After simple post-processing, it achieves a charge resolution of $0.25\,e$ and a position resolution of $3\,\mu\mathrm{m}$ on beam-test data, comparable to the conventional approach. These results demonstrate that unsupervised deep learning models can enable physically meaningful and quantitatively precise measurements. Moreover, the generative capacity of HistoAE enables straightforward extensions to fast detector simulations.</description>

      <title>Theory of magnetic circular dichroism spectroscopy technique in reflected light using an additional mirror</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The theory of the method of magnetic circular dichroism spectroscopy in reflected light (RMCD) has been developed using a simplified scheme without an analyzer, with the use of an additional mirror in the optical system and with the application of the method of phase modulation of the light wave using a photoelastic modulator. An additional mirror reflector, together with the mirror surface of the sample, forms a double mirror located between the pole pieces of a powerful laboratory electromagnet. The presence of an additional mirror leads to mixing of the amplitude ($\Delta R/R$) and phase ($\Delta \phi$) RMCD-components in the amplitudes of the signals at the first and second harmonics of the phase modulation. It is shown that the RMCD spectroscopy technique using a simplified scheme and an additional mirror requires the synchronous measurement of three electrical signals proportional to the amplitudes of the corresponding terms in the expression for the total intensity of monochromatic radiation detected by the photodetector: a constant signal $V_{dc}$ and high-frequency amplitudes $V_f$ and $V_{2f}$ at phase modulation frequencies $f$ and $2f$. The ratios $V_f/V_{dc}$ and $V_2f/Vdc$ determine a system of linear equations for $\Delta R/R$ and $\Delta \phi$ with known ellipsometric parameters $\tan\Psi$ and $\Delta$ of the additional mirror, which are found either from additional measurements using an ellipsometer or directly (in sity) using the RMCD spectrometer itself.</description>

      <title>Interrogation trajectory optimisation for Fabry-Perot based photoacoustic tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fabry-P\'erot based photoacoustic tomography (FP-PAT) is a promising all-optical imaging modality for a wide range of preclinical and clinical applications. However, there exist several challenges in routinely applying FP-PAT in time-critical experiments. Among those, the need for spectral tuning of the laser between each scan position can severely limit the effective imaging speed. Here, we present an interrogation trajectory optimization approach which allows to increase the overall speed in a way that is independent of the type of interrogation laser used as well as the FP quality. Our approach provides a way to tackle speed degradation caused by hardware limitations and simplify the use of FP-PAT systems.</description>

      <title>Optical sound pressure measurement using Fabry-P\'erot cavity for primary acoustic standards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10480v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical sound pressure measurement is a promising technology to establish primary acoustic standards without reliance on specific types of microphones. We developed a precision optical sound pressure measurement system by combining a Fabry-P\'erot optical cavity, a phase-stabilized optical frequency comb, and a custom-made phasemeter. The optical cavity detects changes in the air's refractive index induced by sound waves as changes in its resonance frequency. A continuous-wave laser frequency is stabilized at the resonance, and the frequency comb detects the changes in the laser frequency. The frequency changes are measured with high sensitivity and accuracy using a phasemeter that we developed. The sound pressures measured by this system agreed with the measurement value obtained using a reference microphone within 5% at sound pressure levels of 78 dB and 84 dB, within a frequency range of 100 Hz to 1 kHz. A systematic deviation of 2.6% was observed, with the optical system yielding higher values than the microphone. To identify the cause of this deviation, we performed vibration displacement measurements of the cavity mirrors and finite element analysis, which revealed that fluctuations in the optical path length due to insufficient fixation of the mirrors were responsible.</description>

Abstract: Here we present the thermal neutron counter from the ELI Gamma Above Neutron Threshold setup at the Extreme Light Infrastructure - Nuclear Physics. We describe the mechanical design of the setup, the properties of the ${}^{3}$He gas counters, and the hardware data-acquisition electronics and software digital signal processing.

      <title>On the nature and charge state of the X-Defect, a radiation-induced Silicon defect with field-enhanced charge carrier emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16197v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The elusive X-Defect, a defect found in low-resistivity $p$-type Silicon after irradiation, observed as a low-temperature shoulder of the $\mathrm{B}_\mathrm{i}\mathrm{O}_\mathrm{i}$ defect (Boron-interstitial-Oxygen-interstitial complex) in Thermally Stimulated Current (TSC) measurements, was investigated to determine its properties, matching them with those of a previously identified defect. Through a combination of TSC, Deep-Level Transient Spectroscopy (DLTS), Difference-DLTS (DDLTS), numerical simulations of field-enhanced charge carrier emissions in TSC measurements and a comparison to literature, the X-Defect was identified as the singly positively charged Silicon di-vacancy $\mathrm{V}_2(+/0)$. This assignment is supported by an agreement in activation energy, capture cross-section, trap type and charge emission process, as well as simulations comparing the effects of phonon-assisted tunnelling (PAT) and Poole-Frenkel (PF) mechanisms on TSC spectra. DDTLS measurements revealed a quadratic dependence of the activation energy on the electric field strength, confirming PAT as the prevailing mechanism over PF in the case of the radiation-induced X-Defect. Assigning the X-Defect to an electrically neutral defect in the space charge region resolves previous contradictions regarding its deficiency in impacting on the effective doping concentration.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium nonlinear response theory of amplitude-dependent dissipative conductivity in disordered superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09766v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work investigates amplitude-dependent nonlinear corrections to the dissipative conductivity in superconductors, using the Keldysh--Usadel theory of nonequilibrium superconductivity, which captures the nonequilibrium dynamics of both quasiparticles and the pair potential. Our rigorous formulation naturally incorporates both the direct nonlinear action of the photon field and indirect contributions mediated by nonequilibrium variations in the pair potential, namely the Eliashberg effect and the Higgs mode. The third-harmonic current, often regarded as a hallmark of the Higgs mode in disordered superconductors, arises from both the direct photon action and the Higgs mode. Our numerical results are in excellent agreement with previous studies. In contrast, the first-harmonic current, and consequently the dissipative conductivity, receives contributions from all three mechanisms: the direct photon action, the Higgs mode, and the Eliashberg effect. It is shown that that the nonlinear correction to dissipative conductivity in dirty-limit superconductors can serve as a fingerprint of the Higgs mode, appearing as a resonance peak at a frequency near the superconducting gap \( \Delta \). In addition, our results provide microscopic insight into amplitude-dependent dissipation at frequencies well below \( \Delta \), which is particularly relevant for applied superconducting devices. In particular, the long-standing issue concerning the frequency dependence of the amplitude-dependent quality factor is explained as originating from the direct nonlinear action of the photon field, rather than from contributions by the Higgs mode and the Eliashberg effect. Our practical and explicit expression for the nonlinear conductivity formula makes our results accessible to a broad range of researchers.</description>

      <title>Measurements of the Birks' coefficient of GAGG:Ce using hard X-rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02920v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inorganic scintillators continue to be widely used within astrophysical X-ray and gamma-ray detectors. This is in part thanks to the development of new scintillators, such as GAGG:Ce, as well as the availability of new scintillator readout sensors such as Silicon Photomultipliers and Silicon Drift Detectors. In order to use such scintillator materials for spectrometry or polarimetry, a detailed understanding of their response is important. One parameter that can affect the scintillator performance, particularly at lower photon energies, is their Birks' coefficient, which correlates the relative light yield to the ionization energy density. While for many high-Z inorganic scintillators this effect can be ignored, for GAGG:Ce this appears to not be the case. Here we provide a measurement of the Birks' coefficient for GAGG:Ce using data from a detector irradiated in the 20-80~keV energy range at the LARIX-A X-ray beam in Ferrara, Italy. While the effects due to Birks' law are visible below 30 keV, they also significantly influence the performance of GAGG:Ce performance near one of the K-edges, affecting both the measured gain and the energy resolution. Here, we use beam test data to derive the Birks' coefficient from GAGG:Ce. The results indicate that for usage in hard X-ray and soft gamma-ray missions, this coefficient has a significant effect on the measurements.</description>
