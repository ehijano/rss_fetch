      <title>Analysis of Factors Affecting the Entry of Foreign Direct Investment into Indonesia (Case Study of Three Industrial Sectors in Indonesia)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The realization of FDI and DDI from January to December 2022 reached Rp1,207.2 trillion. The largest FDI investment realization by sector was led by the Basic Metal, Metal Goods, Non-Machinery, and Equipment Industry sector, followed by the Mining sector and the Electricity, Gas, and Water sector. The uneven amount of FDI investment realization in each industry and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in Indonesia are the main issues addressed in this study. This study aims to identify the factors that influence the entry of FDI into industries in Indonesia and measure the extent of these factors' influence on the entry of FDI. In this study, classical assumption tests and hypothesis tests are conducted to investigate whether the research model is robust enough to provide strategic options nationally. Moreover, this study uses the ordinary least squares (OLS) method. The results show that the electricity factor does not influence FDI inflows in the three industries. The Human Development Index (HDI) factor has a significant negative effect on FDI in the Mining Industry and a significant positive effect on FDI in the Basic Metal, Metal Goods, Non-Machinery, and Equipment Industries. However, HDI does not influence FDI in the Electricity, Gas, and Water Industries in Indonesia.</description>

      <title>Testing identifying assumptions in Tobit Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops sharp testable implications for Tobit and IV-Tobit models' identifying assumptions: linear index specification, (joint) normality of latent errors, and treatment (instrument) exogeneity and relevance. The new sharp testable equalities can detect all possible observable violations of the identifying conditions. We propose a testing procedure for the model's validity using existing inference methods for intersection bounds. Simulation results suggests proper size for large samples and that the test is powerful to detect large violation of the exogeneity assumption and violations in the error structure. Finally, we review and propose new alternative paths to partially identify the parameters of interest under less restrictive assumptions.</description>

      <title>Kullback-Leibler-based characterizations of score-driven updates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Score-driven models have been applied in some 400 published articles over the last decade. Much of this literature cites the optimality result in Blasques et al. (2015), which, roughly, states that sufficiently small score-driven updates are unique in locally reducing the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence relative to the true density for every observation. This is at odds with other well-known optimality results; the Kalman filter, for example, is optimal in a mean squared error sense, but may move in the wrong direction for atypical observations. We show that score-driven filters are, similarly, not guaranteed to improve the localized KL divergence at every observation. The seemingly stronger result in Blasques et al. (2015) is due to their use of an improper (localized) scoring rule. Even as a guaranteed improvement for every observation is unattainable, we prove that sufficiently small score-driven updates are unique in reducing the KL divergence relative to the true density in expectation. This positive$-$albeit weaker$-$result justifies the continued use of score-driven models and places their information-theoretic properties on solid footing.</description>

      <title>A Double Robust Approach for Non-Monotone Missingness in Multi-Stage Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.01010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.01010v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multivariate missingness with a non-monotone missing pattern is complicated to deal with in empirical studies. The traditional Missing at Random (MAR) assumption is difficult to justify in such cases. Previous studies have strengthened the MAR assumption, suggesting that the missing mechanism of any variable is random when conditioned on a uniform set of fully observed variables. However, empirical evidence indicates that this assumption may be violated for variables collected at different stages. This paper proposes a new MAR-type assumption that fits non-monotone missing scenarios involving multi-stage variables. Based on this assumption, we construct an Augmented Inverse Probability Weighted GMM (AIPW-GMM) estimator. This estimator features an asymmetric format for the augmentation term, guarantees double robustness, and achieves the closed-form semiparametric efficiency bound. We apply this method to cases of missingness in both endogenous regressor and outcome, using the Oregon Health Insurance Experiment as an example. We check the correlation between missing probabilities and partially observed variables to justify the assumption. Moreover, we find that excluding incomplete data results in a loss of efficiency and insignificant estimators. The proposed estimator reduces the standard error by more than 50% for the estimated effects of the Oregon Health Plan on the elderly.</description>

      <title>Inference in Cluster Randomized Trials with Matched Pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.14903v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies inference in cluster randomized trials where treatment status is determined according to a "matched pairs" design. Here, by a cluster randomized experiment, we mean one in which treatment is assigned at the level of the cluster; by a "matched pairs" design, we mean that a sample of clusters is paired according to baseline, cluster-level covariates and, within each pair, one cluster is selected at random for treatment. We study the large-sample behavior of a weighted difference-in-means estimator and derive two distinct sets of results depending on if the matching procedure does or does not match on cluster size. We then propose a single variance estimator which is consistent in either regime. Combining these results establishes the asymptotic exactness of tests based on these estimators. Next, we consider the properties of two common testing procedures based on t-tests constructed from linear regressions, and argue that both are generally conservative in our framework. We additionally study the behavior of a randomization test which permutes the treatment status for clusters within pairs, and establish its finite-sample and asymptotic validity for testing specific null hypotheses. Finally, we propose a covariate-adjusted estimator which adjusts for additional baseline covariates not used for treatment assignment, and establish conditions under which such an estimator leads to strict improvements in precision. A simulation study confirms the practical relevance of our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Double Robustness of Local Projections and Some Unpleasant VARithmetic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09509v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider impulse response inference in a locally misspecified vector autoregression (VAR) model. The conventional local projection (LP) confidence interval has correct coverage even when the misspecification is so large that it can be detected with probability approaching 1. This result follows from a "double robustness" property analogous to that of popular partially linear regression estimators. In contrast, the conventional VAR confidence interval with short-to-moderate lag length can severely undercover, even for misspecification that is small, economically plausible, and difficult to detect statistically. There is no free lunch: the VAR confidence interval has robust coverage only if the lag length is so large that the interval is as wide as the LP interval.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Principal Component Regression with Applications to Panel Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.01357v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Principal component regression (PCR) is a popular technique for fixed-design error-in-variables regression, a generalization of the linear regression setting in which the observed covariates are corrupted with random noise. We provide the first time-uniform finite sample guarantees for (regularized) PCR whenever data is collected adaptively. Since the proof techniques for analyzing PCR in the fixed design setting do not readily extend to the online setting, our results rely on adapting tools from modern martingale concentration to the error-in-variables setting. We demonstrate the usefulness of our bounds by applying them to the domain of panel data, a ubiquitous setting in econometrics and statistics. As our first application, we provide a framework for experiment design in panel data settings when interventions are assigned adaptively. Our framework may be thought of as a generalization of the synthetic control and synthetic interventions frameworks, where data is collected via an adaptive intervention assignment policy. Our second application is a procedure for learning such an intervention assignment policy in a setting where units arrive sequentially to be treated. In addition to providing theoretical performance guarantees (as measured by regret), we show that our method empirically outperforms a baseline which does not leverage error-in-variables regression.</description>
