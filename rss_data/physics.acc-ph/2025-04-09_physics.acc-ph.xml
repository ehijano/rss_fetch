      <title>Beam-driven plasma-wakefield acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beam-driven plasma-wakefield acceleration (PWFA) has emerged as a transformative technology with the potential to revolutionize the field of particle acceleration, especially toward compact accelerators for high-energy and high-power applications. Charged particle beams are used to excite density waves in plasma with accelerating fields reaching up to 100 GV/m, thousands of times stronger than the fields provided by radio-frequency cavities. Plasma-wakefield-accelerator research has matured over the span of four decades from basic concepts and proof-of-principle experiments to a rich and rapidly progressing sub-field with dedicated experimental facilities and state-of-the-art simulation codes. We review the physics, including theory of linear and nonlinear plasma wakefields as well as beam dynamics of both the wakefield driver and trailing bunches accelerating in the plasma wake, and address challenges associated with energy efficiency and preservation of beam quality. Advanced topics such as positron acceleration, self-modulation, internal injection, long-term plasma evolution and multistage acceleration are discussed. Simulation codes and major experiments are surveyed, spanning the use of electron, positron and proton bunches as wakefield drivers. Finally, we look ahead to future particle colliders and light sources based on plasma technology.</description>

      <title>Mains-Synchronized Timing Trigger for Stability Enhancement in FEL Pulsed Microwave Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pulsed microwave stability in linear accelerators (LINACs) is critical for maintaining high-quality electron beams in synchrotron radiation and free-electron laser (FEL) facilities. This study establishes and validates a zero-crossing synchronization strategy to suppress mains-induced disturbances in the Dalian Coherent Light Source (DCLS) accelerator. Through comprehensive numerical simulations at 10 Hz, 20 Hz, and 25 Hz repetition rates, we first demonstrate the temporal evolution of microwave amplitude perturbations under mains power disturbances. Experimental validation with the digital Low-Level Radio Frequency (LLRF) system reveals a substantial similarity between simulated and measured interference patterns, confirming the susceptibility of the klystron output to mains power modulation. The developed synchronization technique integrates real-time mains zero-crossing detection with precision timing sequence generation, effectively decoupling the microwave system from power frequency fluctuations. It achieves remarkable inter-pulse stability improvements, reducing microwave amplitude fluctuation from ~0.30% RMS to 0.07% RMS. This approach not only addresses the inherent bandwidth limitations of conventional proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controllers in low-repetition-rate accelerators but also provides a solution for troubleshooting power-related instabilities in advanced light source facilities.</description>
