      <title>Nil 3-manifolds and cusps of complex hyperbolic surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: McReynolds showed that every compact Nil 3-manifold occurs as the cusp cross-section of some arithmetic complex hyperbolic 2-manifold. We classify which commensurability classes of cusped, arithmetic, complex hyperbolic 2-manifolds admit cusps with cross-section homeomorphic to a given compact Nil 3-manifold. In particular, there are some Nil 3-manifolds which occur as cusps in every such commensurability class, and some which only occur in a single commensurability class. We also show that every compact Nil 3-manifold occurs as the cusp cross-section of some non-arithmetic complex hyperbolic 2-manifold.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If $M$ is a hyperbolic 3-manifold fibering over the circle, the fundamental group of $M$ acts faithfully by homeomorphisms on a circle (the circle at infinity of the universal cover of the fiber), preserving a pair of invariant (stable and unstable) laminations. Many different kinds of dynamical structures (e.g. taut foliations, quasigeodesic or pseudo-Anosov flows) are known to give rise to universal circles -- a circle with a faithful $\pi_1(M)$ action preserving a pair of invariant laminations -- and these universal circles play a key role in relating the dynamical structure to the geometry of $M$. In this paper we introduce the idea of zippers, which give a new and direct way to construct universal circles, streamlining the known constructions in many cases, and giving a host of new constructions in others. In particular, zippers (and their associated universal circles) may be constructed directly from uniform quasimorphisms or from uniform left orders.</description>

      <title>On a classification of Morse functions on $3$-dimensional manifolds represented as connected sums of manifolds of Heegaard genus one</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Morse functions are important objects and tools in understanding topologies of manifolds since the 20th century. Their classification has been natural and difficult problems, and surprisingly, this is recently developing. Since the 2010's, results for cases of surfaces have been presented by Gelbukh, Marzantowicz and Michalak for example. We have also longed for higher dimensional cases. We present a classification of Morse functions on $3$-dimensional manifolds represented as connected sums of manifolds of Heegaard genus one. We concentrate on Morse functions such that preimages of single points containing no singular points are disjoint unions of spheres and tori. Existence of such functions implies that the $3$-dimensional closed and connected manifolds are of such manifolds. This has been shown by Saeki in 2006 and we further study structures of these functions.</description>

      <title>On sections of configurations of points on orientable surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the configuration space of distinct, unordered points on compact orientable surfaces of genus $g$, denoted $S_g$. Specifically, we address the section problem, which concerns the addition of $n$ distinct points to an existing configuration of $m$ distinct points on $S_g$ in a way that ensures the new points vary continuously with respect to the initial configuration. This problem is equivalent to the splitting problem in surface braid groups.
  For $g \geq 1$ and $m = 1$, we take a geometric approach to demonstrate that a section exists for all values of $n$. With an algebraic approach, for $g \geq 1$ and $m \geq 2$, we establish necessary conditions for the existence of a section, showing that if a section exists, then $n$ must be a multiple of $m + (2g - 2)$.
  Using the theory of Jenkins--Strebel differentials and the corresponding ribbon graph on $S_g$, we construct, for $g \geq 0$, sections for a wide range of values of $n$, while we equip $S_g$ with a Riemann structure, which we allow to vary. In particular, we construct sections for $n = 3km + 3k(2g - 2)$, $n = 2m + 2(2g - 2)$, and $n = (3k + 2)m + (3k + 2)(2g - 2)$, where $k \in \mathbb{N}$. Furthermore, we focus specifically on the case of the 2-sphere, presenting for the first time a section for $m = 5$. We make interesting observations comparing our results with those of Gon\c{c}alves--Guaschi and Chen--Salter on the section problem for the 2-sphere, where in their work, either the 2-sphere is considered without a Riemannian structure or the Riemannian structure is held fixed.</description>

      <title>Commensurability Among Deligne-Mostow Monodromy Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper gives the commensurability classification of Deligne-Mostow ball quotients and shows that the 104 Deligne-Mostow lattices form 38 commensurability classes. Firstly, we find commensurability relations among Deligne-Mostow monodromy groups, which are not necessarily discrete. This recovers and generalizes previous work by Sauter and Deligne-Mostow in dimension two. In this part, we consider certain projective surfaces with two fibrations over the projective line, which induce two sets of Deligne-Mostow data. The correspondences of moduli spaces provide the geometric realization of commensurability relations. Secondly, we obtain commensurability invariants from conformal classes of Hermitian forms and toroidal boundary divisors. This completes the commensurability classification of Deligne-Mostow lattices and also reproves Kappes-Moller and McMullen's results on non-arithmetic Deligne-Mostow lattices.</description>

      <title>Which reducible representations are Anosov?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a characterization of the Anosov condition for reducible representations in terms of the eigenvalue magnitudes of the irreducible block factors of its block diagonalization. As in previous work, these Anosov representations comprise a collection of bounded convex domains in a finite-dimensional vector space, and this perspective allows us to conclude for many non-elementary hyperbolic groups that connected components of the character variety which consist entirely of Anosov representations do not contain reducible representations.</description>

      <title>Graphical models for topological groups: A case study on countable Stone spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By analogy with the Cayley graph of a group with respect to a finite generating set or the Cayley-Abels graph of a totally disconnected, locally compact group, we introduce countable connected graphs associated to Polish groups that we term Cayley-Abels-Rosendal graphs. A group admitting a Cayley-Abels-Rosendal graph acts on it continuously, coarsely metrically properly and cocompactly by isometries of the path metric. By an expansion of the Milnor-Schwarz lemma, it follows that the group is generated by a coarsely bounded set and the group equipped with (a suitably compatible alteration of) a word metric with respect to a coarsely bounded generating set and the graph are quasi-isometric. In other words, groups admitting Cayley-Abels-Rosendal graphs are topological analogues of the finitely generated groups. Our goal is to introduce this topological perspective to a geometric group theorist.
  We apply these concepts to homeomorphism groups of countable Stone spaces. We completely characterize when these homeomorphism groups are coarsely bounded, when they are locally bounded (all of them are), and when they admit a Cayley-Abels-Rosendal graph, and if so produce a coarsely bounded generating set.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we define the edge zeta function of weighted complex. We also present the formula for the edge zeta function of the standard non-uniform complex $\operatorname{PGL}(3,\mathbb{F}_q[t])\backslash\operatorname{PGL}(3,\mathbb{F}_q(\!(t^{-1})\!))/\operatorname{PGL}(3,\mathbb{F}_q[\![t^{-1}]\!])$, arising from the group $\operatorname{PGL}_3$, as a rational function. Applying trunction in a specific direction is one of the main ingredient. As a result, we obtain the exact formula for the number of closed cycles coming from geodesics in the building.</description>

      <title>The Stability of Persistence Diagrams Under Non-Uniform Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the stability of persistence diagrams \( D \) under non-uniform scaling transformations \( S \) in \( \mathbb{R}^n \). Given a finite metric space \( X \subset \mathbb{R}^n \) with Euclidean distance \( d_X \), and scaling factors \( s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_n &gt; 0 \) applied to each coordinate, we derive explicit bounds on the bottleneck distance \( d_B(D, D_S) \) between the persistence diagrams of \( X \) and its scaled version \( S(X) \). Specifically, we show that \[ d_B(D, D_S) \leq \frac{1}{2} (s_{\max} - s_{\min}) \cdot \operatorname{diam}(X), \] where \( s_{\min} \) and \( s_{\max} \) are the smallest and largest scaling factors, respectively, and \( \operatorname{diam}(X) \) is the diameter of \( X \). We extend this analysis to higher-dimensional homological features, alternative metrics such as the Wasserstein distance, and iterative or probabilistic scaling scenarios. Our results provide a framework for quantifying the effects of non-uniform scaling on persistence diagrams.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study nonmaximal representations of surface groups in PU(2,1). We show the existence in genus large enough, of convex-cocompact representations of nonmaximal Toledo invariant admitting a unique equivariant minimal surface, which is holomorphic and of second fundamental form arbitrarily small. These examples can be obtained for any Toledo invariant of the form 2-2g+(2/3)d, provided g is large compared to d. When d is not divisible by 3, this yields examples of convex-cocompact representations in PU(2,1) which do not lift to SU(2,1).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be a discrete and torsion-free subgroup of $\mathrm{PU}(n,1)$, the group of biholomorphisms of the unit ball in $\mathbb{C}^{n}$, denoted by $\mathbb{H}^{n}_{\mathbb{C}}$. We show that if $\Gamma$ is Abelian, then $\mathbb{H}^{n}_{\mathbb{C}}/\Gamma$ is a Stein manifold. If the critical exponent $\delta(\Gamma)$ of $\Gamma$ is less than 2, a conjecture of Dey and Kapovich predicts that the quotient $\mathbb{H}^{n}_{\mathbb{C}}/\Gamma$ is Stein. We confirm this conjecture in the case where $\Gamma$ is parabolic or geometrically finite. We also study the case of quotients with $\delta(\Gamma)=2$ that contain compact complex curves and confirm another conjecture of Dey and Kapovich. We finally show that $\mathbb{H}^{n}_{\mathbb{C}}/\Gamma$ is Stein when $\Gamma$ is a parabolic or geometrically finite group preserving a totally real and totally geodesic submanifold of $\mathbb{H}^{n}_{\mathbb{C}}$, without any hypothesis on the critical exponent.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2012.12587v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A central problem in low-dimensional topology asks which homology $3$-spheres bound contractible $4$-manifolds or homology $4$-balls. In this paper, we address this question for plumbed $3$-manifolds and we present two new infinite families. We consider most of the classical examples from around the nineteen eighties by reproving that they all bound Mazur manifolds. We also show that several well-known families bound possibly different types of $4$-manifolds, called Po\'enaru homology $4$-balls. To unify classical and new results in a fairly simple way, we modify Mazur's argument and work with Po\'enaru manifolds.</description>

      <title>Basmajian's identity over non-Archimedean local fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.09992v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\Sigma$ be a connected compact oriented surface with boundary and negative Euler characteristic. Let $k$ be a non-Archimedean local field. In this paper, we prove Basmajian's identity for projective Anosov representations $\rho \colon \pi_1\Sigma \to {\rm PSL}(d,k), d\ge 2$. Our series identity exhibits a drastic difference from all the Basmajian-type identities over the Archimedean fields $\mathbb{R}$ and $\mathbb{C}$. In particular, the series is a signed finite sum. When $d=2$, we give a geometric proof of the identity using Berkovich hyperbolic geometry.</description>

      <title>Unknotting nonorientable surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.12305v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a nonorientable, locally flatly embedded surface in the $4$-sphere of nonorientable genus $h$, Massey showed that the normal Euler number lies in $\lbrace -2h,-2h+4,\ldots,2h-4,2h \rbrace$. We prove that every such surface with knot group of order two is topologically unknotted, provided that the normal Euler number is not one of the extremal values in Massey's range. When $h$ is $1$, $2$, or $3$, we prove the same holds even with extremal normal Euler number. We also study nonorientable embedded surfaces in the 4-ball with boundary a knot $K$ in the 3-sphere, again where the surface complement has fundamental group of order two and nonorientable genus $h$. We prove that any two such surfaces with the same normal Euler number become topologically isotopic, rel. boundary, after adding a single tube to each. If the determinant of $K$ is trivial, we show that any two such surfaces are isotopic, rel. boundary, again provided that they have non-extremal normal Euler number, or that $h$ is $1$, $2$, or $3$.</description>

      <title>Anosov representations acting on homogeneous spaces: domains of discontinuity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.08607v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct open domains of discontinuity for Anosov representations acting on some homogeneous spaces, including (pseudo-Riemannian) symmetric spaces. This generalizes work of Kapovich-Leeb-Porti on flag spaces. Our results complement those of Gu\'eritaud-Guichard-Kassel-Wienhard, who constructed proper actions of Anosov representations. For Zariski dense Anosov representations with respect to a minimal parabolic subgroup acting on some symmetric spaces, we show that our construction describes the largest possible open domains of discontinuity.</description>

      <title>A groupoid rack and spatial surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.06423v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A spatial surface is a compact surface embedded in the $3$-sphere. We assume that a spatial surface is oriented and that each connected component of a spatial surface is neither a disk nor without a boundary. A diagram of a spatial surface is a diagram of a spatial trivalent graph that is a spine of the spatial surface. In this paper, we introduce the notion of a groupoid rack, which is used for considering colorings for diagrams of spatial surfaces in order to obtain an invariant of spatial surfaces. Furthermore, we show that a groupoid rack has a universal property on colorings for diagrams of spatial surfaces.</description>

      <title>Finite type invariants in low degrees and the Johnson filtration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09924v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the behaviour of the Casson invariant $\lambda$, its square, and Othsuki's second invariant $\lambda_2$ as functions on the Johnson subgroup of the mapping class group. We show that since $\lambda$ and $d_2 = \lambda_2 - 18 \lambda^2$ are invariants that are morphisms on respectively the second and the third level of the Johnson filtration they never vanish on any level of this filtration. In contrast we prove that the invariant $\lambda_2-18\lambda^2 +3\lambda$ vanishes on the fifth level of the Johnson filtration, $\mathcal{M}_{g,1}(5)$, and as a consequence we prove that, for instance, the Poincar\'e homology sphere does not admit any Heegaard splitting with gluing map an element in $\mathcal{M}_{g,1}(5)$. Finally we determine a surgery formula for Othsuki's second invariant $\lambda_2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21476v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a continuous map from the space of orders on quandles to the space of quandle actions on one-manifolds, providing an answer to a question posed by Idrissa Ba and Mohamed Elhamdadi. As an application of this map, we characterize isolated orders on quandles in terms of strong rigidity. As another application, we prove that there is no isolated right order on the free quandles, except for specific cases.</description>

      <title>Edge subdivisions and the $L^2$-homology of right-angled Coxeter groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08009v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: If $L$ is a flag triangulation of $S^{n-1}$, then the Davis complex $\Sigma_L$ for the associated right-angled Coxeter group $W_L$ is a contractible $n$-manifold. A special case of a conjecture of Singer predicts that the $L^2$-homology of such $\Sigma_L$ vanishes outside the middle dimension. We give conditions which guarantee this vanishing is preserved under edge subdivision of $L$. In particular, we verify Singer's conjecture when $L$ is the barycentric subdivision of the boundary of an $n$-simplex, and for general barycentric subdivisions of triangulations of $S^{2n-1}$. Using this, we construct explicit counterexamples to a torsion growth analogue of Singer's conjecture.</description>

      <title>Combed Trisection Diagrams and Non-Semisimple 4-Manifold Invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.08461v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a triple $H$ of (possibly non-semisimple) Hopf algebras equipped with pairings satisfying a set of properties, we describe a construction of an associated smooth, scalar invariant $\tau_H(X,\pi)$ of a simply connected, compact, oriented $4$-manifold $X$ and an open book $\pi$ on its boundary. This invariant generalizes an earlier semisimple version and is calculated using a trisection diagram $T$ for $X$ and a certain type of combing of the trisection surface. We explain a general calculation of this invariant for a family of exotic 4-manifolds with boundary called Stein nuclei, introduced by Yasui. After investigating many low-dimensional Hopf algebras up to dimension 11, we have not been able to find non-semisimple Hopf triples that satisfy the criteria for our invariant. Nonetheless, appropriate Hopf triples may exist outside the scope of our explorations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00556v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Assuming that every hyperbolic group is residually finite, we prove the congruence subgroup property for mapping class groups of hyperbolic surfaces of finite type. Under the same assumption, it follows that profinitely equivalent hyperbolic 3-manifolds are commensurable.</description>
