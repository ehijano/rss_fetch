      <title>The Fastest Path to Discovering the Second Electromagnetic Counterpart to a Gravitational Wave Event</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of a second electromagnetic counterpart to a gravitational wave event represents a critical goal in the field of multi-messenger astronomy. In order to determine the optimal strategy for achieving this goal, we perform comprehensive simulations comparing two potential paths forward: continuing the current LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) observing run, O4, versus temporarily shutting down the detectors for upgrades before beginning the next observing run, O5. Our simulations incorporate current O4 instrument sensitivities and duty cycles, as well as projected configurations for O5, while accounting for variables such as binary neutron star merger rates, system properties, viewing angles, dust extinction, and kilonova (KN) observables. Our results indicate that a KN discovery would occur $125^{+253}_{-125}$~days (middle 50\% interval) sooner in O5 compared to O4, suggesting that extending O4 would lead to faster discovery if the shutdown period between runs is $&gt;$4~months. Moreover, for 88\% of our simulations, continuing O4 results in earlier KN discovery when compared to the expected two-year shutdown between O4 and O5. Given these findings and the critical importance of avoiding a $&gt;$10 year gap between first and second electromagnetic counterpart discoveries, we suggest LVK consider extending O4 operations for as long as feasible prior to shutting down for critical upgrades.</description>

      <title>Quark Star Mergers: The Equation of State of Decompressed Quark Matter and Observational Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quark stars are challenging to confirm or exclude observationally because they can have similar masses and radii as neutron stars. By performing the first calculation of the non-equilibrium equation of state of decompressed quark matter at finite temperature, we determine the properties of the ejecta from binary quark-star or quark star-black hole mergers. We account for all relevant physical processes during the ejecta evolution, including quark nugget evaporation and cooling, and weak interactions. We find that these merger ejecta can differ significantly from those in neutron star mergers, depending on the binding energy of quark matter. For relatively high binding energies, quark star mergers are unlikely to produce r-process elements and kilonova signals. We propose that future observations of binary mergers and kilonovae could impose stringent constraints on the binding energy of quark matter and the existence of quark stars.</description>

      <title>Polarization properties of 28 repeating fast radio burst sources with CHIME/FRB</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As part of the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment Fast Radio Burst (CHIME/FRB) project, we report 41 new Rotation Measures (RMs) from 20 repeating Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) obtained between 2019 and 2023 for which no previous RM was determined. We also report 22 additional RM measurements for eight further repeating FRBs. We observe temporal RM variations in practically all repeating FRBs. Repeaters appear to be separated into two categories: those with dynamic and those with stable RM environments, differentiated by the ratios of RM standard deviations over the averaged RM magnitudes. Sources from stable RM environments likely have little RM contributions from the interstellar medium (ISM) of their host galaxies, whereas sources from dynamic RM environments share some similarities with Galactic pulsars in eclipsing binaries but appear distinct from Galactic centre solitary pulsars. We observe a new stochastic, secular, and again stochastic trend in the temporal RM variation of FRB 20180916B, which does not support binary orbit modulation being the reason for this RM changes. We highlight two more repeaters that show RM sign change, namely FRBs 20290929C and 20190303A. We perform an updated comparison of polarization properties between repeating and non-repeating FRBs, which show a marginal dichotomy in their distribution of electron-density-weighted parallel-component line-of-sight magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Origin of the twice ${90}^{\circ}$ rotations of the polarization angle in GRB 170114A and GRB 160821A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The observed twice abrupt ${90}^{\circ}$ rotations of the polarization angle (PA) in the prompt phase of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are difficult to be understandable within the current one-emitting-shell models. Here, we apply a model with multiple emitting shells to solve this new challenging problem. Two configurations of large-scale ordered magnetic fields in the shells are considered: toroidal and aligned. Together with the light curves and the spectral peak-energy evolutions, the twice ${90}^{\circ}$ PA rotations in GRB 170114A and GRB 160821A could be well interpreted with the multi-shell aligned magnetic fields configuration. Our numerical calculations also show that the multiple shells with the toroidal magnetic field configuration could not explain the observed twice ${90}^{\circ}$ PA rotations. An aligned magnetic field configuration in the GRB outflow usually indicate to prefer a magnetar central engine, while a toroidal field configuration is typically related to a central black hole. Therefore, the magnetar central engines for the two GRBs are favored.</description>

      <title>Time-integrated polarizations in GRB prompt phase via the Multi-window interpretation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The multi-window observations, including the light curve and the evolutions of the spectral peak energy ($E_p$), the polarization degree (PD) and the polarization angle (PA), are used to infer the model parameters to predict the time-integrated PD in gamma-ray burst (GRB) prompt phase. We select 23 GRBs co-detected by Fermi/GBM and polarization detectors (i.e., GAP, POLAR and AstroSat). In our multi-window fitting, the light curve, $E_p$ curve, PD curve and PA curve are interpreted simultaneously under the synchrotron radiation model in ordered magnetic fields (i.e., the aligned-fields case and the toroidal-fields case). For the bursts with abrupt PA rotations, the predicted time-integrated PD of the aligned-fields case roughly matches the corresponding observed best fit value, while it is higher for the toroidal-fields case. For the bursts without abrupt PA rotation(s), the predicted PDs of the aligned-fields case and the toroidal-fields case are comparable and could interpret the observational data equally well. For GRB 170206A, its observed time-resolved and time-integrated PDs are comparable and both smaller than our predicted upper limits in ordered magnetic fields. So mixed magnetic fields, i.e., the magnetic fields with both ordered and random components, should be reside in the radiation regions of this burst. Except 1 out of the total 23 bursts, the predicted time-integrated PDs, which are around $\sim44\%$ for the aligned-fields case and around $49\%$ for the toroidal-fields case, are consistent with the corresponding observed values. Therefore, consistent with the former study, the models with synchrotron radiation in ordered magnetic fields could interpret most of the current polrization data within $1\sigma$ error bar.</description>

      <title>Geminga: A Window of the Role Played by Local Halo in the Cosmic Ray Propagation Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An emerging commonality among the recently observed pulsar halos is the presence of distinct radiation patterns at high energies, while no extended radiation is detected around the GeV energy band. This commonality suggests that pulsar halos play a crucial role in the local propagation of cosmic rays, making it necessary to investigate the underlying mechanisms of this phenomenon. This work focuses on the 3D propagation study of cosmic rays, incorporating the Geminga pulsar into our propagation model to investigate its contribution to different observational spectra. We consider Geminga a dominant local source of positrons, successfully reproducing the observed positron spectrum and multi-energy spectra of the Geminga halo. Through calculations of signal and background at different angles, we find that: (1) at low energies, the slow diffusion characteristic around the pulsar region leads to a low electron density in the extended area around Geminga, causing the background radiation to exceed the signal intensity far; (2) at high energies, the larger effective diffusion radius of high-energy electrons/positrons causes the signal from Geminga to dominate the local high-energy phenomena; (3) the observed fluctuation of diffuse gamma-ray radiation by LHAASO is likely due to the incomplete subtraction of radiation from the local halo. We hope LHAASO will detect more cosmic ray halo sources to validate our model further.</description>

      <title>Fast Radio Bursts and Interstellar Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are transient radio events with millisecond-scale durations, and debated origins. Collisions between planetesimals and neutron stars have been proposed as a mechanism to produce FRBs; the planetesimal strength, size and density determine the time duration and energy of the resulting event. One source of planetesimals is the population of interstellar objects (ISOs), free-floating objects expected to be extremely abundant in galaxies across the Universe as products of planetary formation. We explore using the ISO population as a reservoir of planetesimals for FRB production, finding that the expected ISO-neutron star collision rate is comparable with the observed FRB event rate. Using a model linking the properties of planetesimals and the FRBs they produce, we further show that observed FRB durations are consistent with the sizes of known ISOs, and the FRB energy distribution is consistent with the observed size distributions of Solar System planetesimal populations. Finally, we argue that the rate of ISO-neutron star collisions must increase with cosmic time, matching the observed evolution of the FRB rate. Thus, ISO-neutron star collisions are a feasible mechanism for producing FRBs.</description>

      <title>Particle Acceleration via Transient Stagnation Surfaces in MADs During Flux Eruptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we focus on the simulation of accretion processes in Magnetically Arrested Disks (MADs) and investigate the dynamics of plasma during flux eruption events.
  We employ general relativistic magneto-hydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations and search for regions with a divergent velocity during a flux eruption event. These regions would experience rapid and significant depletion of matter. For this reason, we monitor the activation rate of the floor and the mass supply required for stable simulation evolution to further trace this transient stagnation surface.
  Our findings reveal an unexpected and persistent stagnation surface that develops during these eruptions, located around 2-3 gravitational radii (${\rm r_g}$) from the black hole. The stagnation surface is defined by a divergent velocity field and is accompanied by enhanced mass addition. This represents the first report of such a feature in this context. The stagnation surface is ($7-9\,\,{\rm r_g}$) long. We estimate the overall potential difference along this stagnation surface for a supermassive black hole like M87 to be approximately $\Delta V \approx 10^{16}$ Volts.
  Our results indicate that, in MAD configurations, this transient stagnation surface during flux eruption events can be associated with an accelerator of charged particles in the vicinity of supermassive black holes. In light of magnetic reconnection processes during these events, this work presents a complementary or an alternative mechanism for particle acceleration.</description>

      <title>The origin channels of hierarchical binary black hole mergers in the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA O1, O2, and O3 runs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We infer the origin channels of hierarchical mergers observed in the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) O1, O2, and O3 runs using a hierarchical Bayesian analysis under a parametric population model. By assuming the active galactic nucleus (ANG) disk and nuclear star cluster (NSC) channels, we find that NSCs likely dominate the hierarchical merger rate in the universe, corresponding to a fraction of $f_{\rm NSC}=0.87_{-0.29}^{+0.10}$ at 90\% credible intervals in our fiducial model; AGN disks may contribute up to nearly half of hierarchical mergers detectable with LVK, specifically $f_{\rm det,AGN}=0.34_{-0.26}^{+0.38}$. We investigate the impact of the escape speed, along with other population parameters on the branching fraction, suggesting that the mass, mass ratio, and spin of the sources play significant roles in population analysis. We show that hierarchical mergers constitute at least $\sim$$10\%$ of the gravitational wave events detected by LVK during the O1-O3 runs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that it is challenging to effectively infer detailed information about the host environment based solely on the distribution of black hole merger parameters if multiple formation channels are considered.</description>

      <title>Reinvestigation of Fast Radio Bursts Host Galaxy and Event Rate Density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are radio burst signals that lasting milliseconds. They originate from cosmological distances and have relatively high dispersion measures (DMs), making them being excellent distance indicators. However, there are many important questions about FRBs remain us to resolve. With its wide field of view and excellent sensitivity, CHIME/FRB has discovered more than half of all known FRBs. As more and more FRBs are located within or connected with their host galaxies, the study of FRB progenitors is becoming more important. In this work, we collect the currently available information related to the host galaxies of FRBs, and the MCMC analysis about limited localized samples reveals no significant difference in the $\mathrm{DM_{host}}$ between repeaters and non-repeaters. After examining CHIME/FRB samples, we estimated the volumetric rates of repeaters and non-repeaters, accounting for $\mathrm{DM_{host}}$ contributions. We compare event rate with rates of predicted origin models and transient events. Our results indicate that $\mathrm{DM_{host}}$ significantly affects volumetric rates and offer insights into the origin mechanisms of FRB populations.</description>

      <title>Constraint on Lorentz Invariance Violation for spectral lag transition in GRB 160625B using profile likelihood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We reanalyze the spectral lag data for of GRB 160625B using frequentist inference to constrain the energy scale ($E_{QG}$) of Lorentz Invariance Violation (LIV). For this purpose, we use profile likelihood to deal with the astrophysical nuisance parameters. This is in contrast to Bayesian inference implemented in previous works, where marginalization was carried out over the nuisance parameters. We show that with profile likelihood, we do not find a global minimum for $\chi^2$ as a function of $E_{QG}$ below the Planck scale for both the linear and quadratic models of LIV, whereas bounded credible intervals were obtained using Bayesian inference. Therefore, we can set lower limits in a straightforward manner. We find that $E_{QG} \geq 3.7 \times 10^{16}$ GeV and $E_{QG} \geq 2.6 \times 10^7$ GeV at 68\% c.l., for linear and quadratic LIV, respectively. Therefore, this is the first proof of principles application of profile likelihood method to the analysis of GRB spectral lag data to constrain LIV.</description>

      <title>A Recent Supermassive Black Hole Binary in the Galactic Center Unveiled by the Hypervelocity Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dozens of B-type hypervelocity stars (HVSs) moving faster than the Galactic escape speed have been discovered in the Galactic halo and are produced most likely by the supermassive black hole (SMBH) at the Galactic Center (GC). However, the velocity distribution and in particular the deficit of the HVSs above 700 km/s is seriously inconsistent with the expectations of the present models. Here we show that the high-velocity deficit is due to the deficiency in close interactions of stars with the SMBH, because an orbiting intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) of about 15,000 Solar mass kicked away slowly approaching stars 50-250 million years ago. The SMBH-IMBH binary formed probably after the merger of the Galaxy with the Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE) dwarf galaxy, and coalesced about 10 million years ago. Afterwards, HVSs with speed up to above 3000 km/s are produced by binary tidal disruptions and the counterparts formed the S-star cluster at the GC.</description>

      <title>On the possible contributions of two nearby blazars to the NGC 4151 neutrino hotspot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of the high-energy astrophysical neutrinos discovered by IceCube remains unclear, with both blazars and Seyfert galaxies emerging as potential sources. Recently, the IceCube Collaboration reported a ${\sim}{3}\sigma$ neutrino signal from the direction of a nearby Seyfert galaxy NGC 4151. However, two gamma-ray loud BL Lac objects, 4FGL 1210.3+3928 and 4FGL J1211.6+3901, lie close to NGC 4151, at angular distances of 0.08$^\circ$ and 0.43$^\circ$, respectively. We investigate the potential contribution of these two blazars to the observed neutrino signal from the direction of NGC 4151 and assess their detectability with future neutrino observatories. We model the multi-wavelength spectral energy distributions of both blazars using a self-consistent numerical radiation code, AM$^3$. We calculate their neutrino spectra and compare them to the measured NGC 4151 neutrino spectrum and future neutrino detector sensitivities. Our models predict neutrino emission peaking at $\sim$10$^{17}$ eV for both blazars, with fluxes of ${\sim}10^{-12}~\mathrm{erg~cm^{-2}~s^{-1}}$. This indicates their contribution to the $\sim$10 TeV neutrino signal observed from the direction of NGC 4151 is minor. While detection with current facilities is challenging, both sources should be detectable by future radio-based neutrino telescopes such as IceCube-Gen2's radio array and GRAND, with 4FGL~J1210.3+3928 being the more promising candidate.</description>

      <title>Low-Energy Cosmic Rays and Associated MeV Gamma-Ray Emissions in the Protoplanetary System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-energy cosmic rays (LECRs) play a crucial role in the formation of planetary systems, and detecting and reconstructing the properties of early LECRs is essential for understanding the mechanisms of planetary system formation. Given that LECRs interact with the surrounding medium to produce nuclear de-excitation line emissions, which are gamma-ray emissions with energy mainly within 0.1--10 MeV and are unaffected by stellar wind modulation, these emissions can accurately reflect the properties of LECRs. This study introduces an innovative method for using gamma-ray emissions to infer LECR properties. We employed the Parker transport equation to simulate the propagation and spectral evolution of LECRs in a protoplanetary disk and calculated the characteristic gamma-ray emissions resulting from interactions between LECRs and disk material. These gamma-ray emissions encapsulate the spectral information of LECRs, providing a powerful tool to reconstruct the cosmic ray environment at that time. This method, supported by further theoretical developments and observations, will fundamentally enhance our understanding of the impact of CRs on the origin and evolution of planetary systems and address significant scientific questions regarding the cosmic ray environment at the origin of life.</description>

      <title>Towards Multi Energy Neutrino Astronomy: Diagnosing Enhanced Circumstellar Material around Stripped-Envelope Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel approach is proposed to reveal a secret birth of enhanced circumstellar material (CSM) surrounding a collapsing massive star using neutrinos as a unique probe. In this scheme, non-thermal TeV-scale neutrinos produced in ejecta-CSM interactions are tied with thermal MeV neutrinos emitted from a pre-explosion burning process, based on a scenario that CSM had been formed via the pre-supernova activity. Taking a representative model of the pre-supernova neutrinos, spectrum and light curve of the corresponding high-energy CSM neutrinos are calculated at multiple mass-loss efficiencies considered as a systematic uncertainty. In addition, as a part of method demonstration, the detected event rates along time at JUNO and IceCube, as representative detectors, are estimated for the pre-supernova and CSM neutrinos, respectively, and are compared with the expected background rate at each detector. The presented method is found to be reasonably applicable for the range up to 1 kpc and even farther with future experimental efforts. Potentialities of other neutrino detectors, such as SK-Gd, Hyper-Kamiokande and KM3NeT, are also discussed. This is a pioneering work of performing astrophysics with neutrinos from diverse energy regimes, initiating multi energy neutrino astronomy in the forthcoming era where next-generation large-scale neutrino telescopes are operating.</description>

      <title>Two-temperature treatments in magnetically arrested disk GRMHD simulations more accurately predict light curves of Sagittarius A*</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration (EHTC) observed the Galactic centre source Sgr A* and used emission models primarily based on single ion temperature (1T) general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations. This predicted emission is strongly dependent on a modelled prescription of the ion-to-electron temperature ratio. The two most promising models are magnetically arrested disk (MAD) states. However, these and nearly all MAD models exhibit greater light-curve variability at 230 GHz compared to historical observations. Moreover, no model successfully passes all the variability and multiwavelength constraints. This limitation possibly stems from the fact that the actual temperature ratio depends on microphysical dissipation, radiative processes and other effects not captured in ideal fluid simulations. Therefore, we investigate the effects of two-temperature (2T) thermodynamics in MAD GRMHD simulations of Sgr A*, where the temperatures of both species are evolved more self-consistently. We include Coulomb coupling, radiative cooling of electrons, and model heating via magnetic reconnection. We find that the light-curve variability more closely matches historical observations when we include the 2T treatment and variable adiabatic indices, compared to 1T simulations. Contrary to the common assumption of neglecting radiative cooling for the low accretion rates of Sgr A*, we also find that radiative cooling still affects the accretion flow, reducing the electron temperature in the inner disk by about 10%, which in turn lowers both the average flux and variability at 230 GHz by roughly 10%.</description>

      <title>Effect of viewing angle in Gamma-ray Burst properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The empirical classification of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) is based on their distribution in the plane of burst duration and spectral hardness. Two distinct distributions, long-soft and short-hard bursts, are observed in this plane, forming the basis for the long and short classification scheme. Traditionally, this scheme was mapped to two different GRB progenitor classes. However, several recent bursts have challenged this mapping. This work investigates how an observer's viewing angle relative to the jet axis influences the duration-hardness plane. We simulate single-pulse GRBs using an optically and geometrically thin homogeneous top-hat jet model. Bursts are simulated with an isotropic viewing angle distribution, and we calculate the pulse duration and spectral hardness corresponding to \textit{FERMI} Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (GBM) energy bands. The viewing angle significantly impacts spectral hardness for our assumed broken power-law spectra, while its effect on duration is less pronounced. Our analysis indicates that soft and low-luminous bursts are likely off-axis events. It is possible that some of the fast X-ray transients and X-ray rich GRBs observed by the Einstein Probe and the Space Variable Objects Monitor (SVOM) missions originate from off-axis jets.</description>

      <title>A study on late time UV-emission in core collapse supernovae and the implications for the peculiar transient AT2018cow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over time, core-collapse supernova (CCSN) spectra become redder due to dust formation and cooling of the SN ejecta. A UV detection of a CCSN at late times thus indicates an additional physical process such as interaction between the SN ejecta and the circumstellar material, or viewing down to the central engine of the explosion. Both these models have been proposed to explain the peculiar transient AT2018cow, a luminous fast blue optical transient that has been detected in the UV 2-4 years after the event with only marginal fading over this time period. To identify if the late-time UV detection of AT2018cow could indicate that it is a CCSN, we investigate if CCSNe are detected in the UV between 2-5 years after the explosion. We use a sample of 51 nearby (z&lt;0.065) CCSNe observed with the Hubble Space Telescope within 2-5 years of discovery. We measure their brightness, or determine an upper limit on the emission through an artificial star experiment if there is no detection. For two CCSNe we detect a point source within the uncertainty region of the SN position. Both have a low chance alignment probability with bright objects within their host galaxies and are thus likely related to the SNe. Comparing the absolute UV magnitude of AT2018cow to the absolute UV magnitudes of the two potential SN detections, there is no evidence that a late-time UV detection of AT2018cow is atypical for interacting SNe. However, when limiting to CCSNe closer than AT2018cow, we see that it is brighter than the upper limits on most non-detections. Combined with a very small late time photospheric radius of AT2018cow, this leads us to conclude that AT2018cow's late-time UV detection was not driven by interaction. It suggests instead that we are possibly viewing the inner region of the explosion. Such properties are naturally expected in tidal disruption models and are less straightforward in supernova scenarios.</description>

      <title>The equilibrium configurations of neutron stars in the optimized $f(R,T)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct equilibrium configurations for neutron stars using a specific $f(R,T)$ functional form, recently derived through gaussian process applied to measurements of the Hubble parameter. By construction, this functional form serves as an alternative explanation for cosmic acceleration, circumventing the cosmological constant problem. Here, we aim to examine its applicability within the stellar regime. In doing so, we seek to contribute to the modified gravity literature by applying the same functional form of a given gravity theory across highly distinct regimes. Our results demonstrate that equilibrium configurations of neutron stars can be obtained within this theory, with the energy density and maximum mass slightly exceeding those predicted by General Relativity. Additionally, we show that the value of some parameters in the $f(R,T)$ functional form must differ from those obtained in cosmological configurations, suggesting a potential scale-dependence for these parameters. We propose that further studies apply this functional form across different regimes to more thoroughly assess this possible dependence.</description>

      <title>AT 2021hdr: A candidate tidal disruption of a gas cloud by a binary super massive black hole system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With a growing number of facilities able to monitor the entire sky and produce light curves with a cadence of days, in recent years there has been an increased rate of detection of sources whose variability deviates from standard behavior, revealing a variety of exotic nuclear transients. The aim of the present study is to disentangle the nature of the transient AT 2021hdr, whose optical light curve used to be consistent with a classic Seyfert 1 nucleus, which was also confirmed by its optical spectrum and high-energy properties. From late 2021, AT 2021hdr started to present sudden brightening episodes in the form of oscillating peaks in the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) alert stream, and the same shape is observed in X-rays and UV from Swift data. The oscillations occur every about 60-90 days with amplitudes of around 0.2 mag in the g and r bands. Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) observations show no radio emission at milliarcseconds scale. It is argued that these findings are inconsistent with a standard tidal disruption event (TDE), a binary supermassive black hole (BSMBH), or a changing-look active galactic nucleus (AGN); neither does this object resemble previous observed AGN flares, and disk or jet instabilities are an unlikely scenario. Here, we propose that the behavior of AT 2021hdr might be due to the tidal disruption of a gas cloud by a BSMBH. In this scenario, we estimate that the putative binary has a separation of about 0.83 mpc and would merge in about 70000 years. This galaxy is located at 9 kpc from a companion galaxy, and in this work we report this merger for the first time. The oscillations are not related to the companion galaxy.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a Dense Association of Stars in the Vicinity of the Supermassive Black Hole Sgr A*</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We focus on a sample of 42 sources in the vicinity of the bow-shock source IRS 1W (N-sources), located at the distance of $6.05''$ north-east of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), within the radius of $1.35''$. We present the first proper motion measurements of N-sources and find that a larger subset of N-sources (28 sources) exhibit a north-westward flying angle. These sources can be bound by an intermediate mass black hole (IMBH) or the concentration that we observe is due to a disk-like distribution projection along the line of sight. We detect the N-sources in $H$, $K_s$, and $L$' bands. The north-westward flying sources could be a bound collection of stars. We discuss a tentative existence of an IMBH or an inclined disk distribution to explain a significant overdensity of stars. The first scenario of having an IMBH implies the lower limit of $\sim 10^4~M_\odot$ for the putative IMBH. Our measurements for the first time reveal that the dense association of stars containing IRS 1W is a co-moving group of massive, young stars. This stellar association might be the remnant core of a massive stellar cluster that is currently being tidally stripped as it inspirals towards Sgr A*. The second scenario suggests that the appearance of the N-sources might be influenced by the projection of a disk-like distribution of younger He-stars and/or dust-enshrouded stars.</description>

      <title>Injection process of pickup ion acceleration at an oblique heliospheric termination shock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Injection process of pickup ion acceleration at a heliospheric termination shock is investigated. Using two-dimensional fully kinetic particle-in-cell simulation, accelerated pickup ions are self-consistently reproduced by tracking long time evolution of shock with unprecedentedly large system size in the shock normal direction. Reflected pickup ions drive upstream large amplitude waves through resonant instabilities. Convection of the large amplitude waves causes shock surface reformation and alters the downstream electromagnetic structure. A part of pickup ions are accelerated to tens of upstream flow energy in the time scale of $\sim 100$ times inverse ion gyro frequency. The initial acceleration occurs through shock surfing acceleration mechanism followed by shock drift acceleration mechanism. Large electrostatic potential accompanied by the upstream waves enables the shock surfing acceleration to occur.</description>

      <title>Mechanism of generating collisionless shock in magnetized gas plasma driven by laser-ablated target plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mechanism of generating collisionless shock in magnetized gas plasma driven by laser-ablated target plasma is investigated by using one-dimensional full particle-in-cell simulation. The effect of finite injection time of target plasma, mimicking finite width of laser pulse, is taken into account. It was found that the formation of a seed-shock requires a recursor. The precursor is driven by gyrating ions, and its origin varies depending on the injection time of the target plasma. When the injection time is short, the target plasma entering the gas plasma creates a precursor, otherwise, gas ions reflected by the strong piston effect of the target plasma create a precursor. The precursor compresses the background gas plasma, and subsequently, a compressed seed-shock forms in the gas plasma. The parameter dependence on the formation process and propagation characteristics of the seed-shock was discussed. It was confirmed that the seed-shock propagates through the gas plasma exhibiting behavior similar to the shock front of supercritical shocks.</description>

      <title>Post-Newtonian templates for phase evolution of spherical extreme mass ratio inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present various post-Newtonian (PN) models for the phase evolution of compact objects moving along quasi-spherical orbits in Kerr spacetime derived by using the 12PN analytic formulas of the energy, angular momentum and their averaged rates of change calculated in the framework of the black hole perturbation theory. To examine the convergence of time-domain PN models (TaylorT families), we evaluate the dephasing between approximants with different PN orders. We found that the TaylorT1 model shows the best performance and the performance of the TaylorT2 is the next best. To evaluate the convergence of frequency-domain PN models (TaylorF families), we evaluate the mismatch between approximants with different orders. We found that the performance of the TaylorF2 model is comparable with the TaylorT2 model. Although the TaylorT2 and TaylorF2 models are not so accurate as the TaylorT1, the fully analytical expressions give us easy-to-handle templates and are useful to discuss effects beyond general relativity.</description>

      <title>Solar flares in the Solar Orbiter Era: Short exposure EUI/FSI observations of STIX flares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aims: This paper aims to demonstrate the importance of short-exposure extreme ultraviolet (EUV) observations of solar flares in the study of particle acceleration, heating and energy partition in flares. This work highlights the observations now available from the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI) instrument suite onboard Solar Orbiter while operating in short exposure mode.
  Methods: A selection of noteworthy flares observed simultaneously by the Spectrometer Telescope for Imaging X-rays (STIX) and the Full Sun Imager of EUI (EUI/FSI) are detailed. New insights are highlighted and potential avenues of investigation are demonstrated, including forward modelling the atmospheric response to a non-thermal beam of electrons using the RADYN 1D hydrodynamic code, in order to compare the predicted and observed EUV emission.
  Results: The examples given in this work demonstrate that short exposure EUI/FSI observations are providing important diagnostics during flares. A dataset of more than 9000 flares observed by STIX (from November 2022 until December 2023) with at least one short exposure EUI/FSI 174 \r{A} image is currently available. The observations reveal that the brightest parts of short-exposure observations consist of substructure in flaring ribbons which spatially overlap with the hard X-ray emission observed by STIX in the majority of cases. We show that these observations provide an opportunity to further constrain the electron energy flux required for flare modelling, among other potential applications.</description>

Abstract: We analyze the sensitivity of non-radial fluid oscillation modes and tidal deformations in neutron stars to high-order nuclear empirical parameters (NEP). In particular, we study the impact of the curvature and skewness of the symmetry energy $K_{\rm sym}$, $Q_{\rm sym}$, and the skewness of the binding energy in symmetric nuclear matter $Q_{\rm sat}$. As we are interested in the possibility of gravitational wave detection by future interferometers, we consider that the tidal interaction is the driving force for the quadrupolar non-radial fluid oscillations. We have also studied the correlations between those quantities, which will be useful to understand the strong physics of gravitational wave phenomena. Our main results show that $K_{\rm sym}$ impacts the frequencies of the fundamental mode mainly for low-mass neutron stars. The NEP $Q_{\rm sym}$ and $Q_{\rm sat}$ affect the fundamental modes of intermediate and heavy neutron stars, respectively. In the case of the first pressure mode, $K_{\rm sym}$ shows a small effect, while $Q_{\rm sat}$ shows a considerable decrease in this oscillation mode independent of the neutron star mass. Similarly, for tidal deformability, the NEP $Q_{\rm sat}$ and $Q_{\rm sym}$ show a bigger impact than $K_{\rm sym}$. Given the impact of the NEP on gravitational wave phenomena and the currently large uncertainties of these parameters, the prospect of higher sensitivity in future gravitational wave detectors promise a possible new tool to constrain high-order NEP.</description>

      <title>Searching for quantum-gravity footprint around stellar-mass black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: According to the asymptotically safe gravity, black holes can have characteristics different from those described according to general relativity. Particularly, they are more compact, with a smaller event horizon, which in turn affects the other quantities dependent on it, like the photon ring and the size of the innermost stable circular orbit. We decided to test the latter by searching in the literature for observational measurements of the emission from accretion disk around stellar-mass black holes. All published values of the radius of the inner accretion disk were made homogeneous by taking into account the most recent and more reliable values of mass, spin, viewing angle, and distance from the Earth. We do not find any significant deviation from the expectations of general relativity. Some doubtful cases can be easily understood as due to specific states of the object during the observation or instrumental biases.</description>

      <title>X-ray reverberation modelling of the continuum, optical/UV time-lags in quasars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context: Extensive, multi-wavelength monitoring campaigns of nearby and higher redshift active galactic nuclei (AGN) have shown that the UV/optical variations are well correlated with time delays which increase with increasing wavelength. Such behaviour is expected in the context of the X-ray thermal reverberation of the accretion disc in AGN. Aims: Our main objective is to use time-lag measurements of luminous AGN and fit them with sophisticated X-ray reverberation time-lags models. In this way we can investigate whether X-ray reverberation can indeed explain the observed continuum time lags, and whether time-lag measurements can be used to measure physical parameters such as the X-ray corona height and the spin of the black hole (BH) in these systems. Methods: We use archival time-lag measurements for quasars from different surveys, and we compute their rest frame, mean time-lags spectrum. We fit the data with analytical X-ray reverberation models, using $\chi^2$ statistics, and fitting for both maximal and non spinning BHs, for various colour correction values and X-ray corona heights. Results: We found that X-ray reverberation can explain very well the observed time lags, assuming the measured BH mass, accretion rate and X-ray luminosity of the quasars in the sample. The model agrees well with the data both for non-rotating and maximally rotating BHs, as long as the corona height is larger than $\sim 40$ gravitational radii. This is in agreement with previous results which showed that X-ray reverberation can also explain the disc radius in micro-lensed quasars, for the same corona heights. The corona height we measure depends on the model assumption of a perfectly flat disc. More realistic disc models may result in lower heights for the X-ray corona.</description>

      <title>Diffuse supernova neutrino background with up-to-date star formation rate measurements and long-term multidimensional supernova simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.15254v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The sensitivity of current and future neutrino detectors like Super-Kamiokande (SK), JUNO, Hyper-Kamiokande (HK), and DUNE is expected to allow for the detection of the diffuse supernova neutrino background (DSNB). However, the DSNB model ingredients like the core-collapse supernova (CCSN) rate, neutrino emission spectra, and the fraction of failed supernovae are not precisely known. We quantify the uncertainty on each of these ingredients by (i) compiling a large database of recent star formation rate density measurements, (ii) combining neutrino emission from long-term axisymmetric CCSNe simulations and strategies for estimating the emission from the protoneutron star cooling phase, and (iii) assuming different models of failed supernovae. Finally, we calculate the fluxes and event rates at multiple experiments and perform a simplified statistical estimate of the time required to significantly detect the DSNB at SK with the gadolinium upgrade and JUNO. Our fiducial model predicts a flux of $5.1\pm0.4^{+0.0+0.5}_{-2.0-2.7}\,{\rm cm^2~s^{-1}}$ at SK employing Gd-tagging, or $3.6\pm0.3^{+0.0+0.8}_{-1.6-1.9}$ events per year, where the errors represent our uncertainty from star formation rate density measurements, uncertainty in neutrino emission, and uncertainty in the failed-supernova scenario. In this fiducial calculation, we could see a $3\sigma$ detection by $\sim2030$ with SK-Gd and a $5\sigma$ detection by $\sim2035$ with a joint SK-Gd/JUNO analysis, but background reduction remains crucial.</description>

      <title>Multi-wavelength Emission from Jets and Magnetically Arrested Disks in Nearby Radio Galaxies: Application to M87</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02759v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Radio galaxies are a subclass of active galactic nuclei that drive relativistic jets from their center and are observed in radio to very-high-energy gamma rays. The emission mechanisms and regions are still unknown. High-energy gamma rays can be explained by the emission from the magnetically arrested disks (MADs) around the central supermassive black hole, for which the magnetic flux threading the black hole is in a saturation level, although the emission from the MADs does not explain the optical and X-ray data. We construct a two-zone multi-wavelength emission model in which optical and X-rays come from jets, while mm/sub-mm and gamma rays come from MADs. Our model takes into account the particle injection by the magnetic reconnection at the jet base close to the black hole and particle entrainment from the ambient gas at the jet emission zone. We apply our model to M87 and find that our model can explain the simultaneous multi-wavelength data, except for the radio data which could be explained if we extend our one-zone emission model to a one-dimensional one. We also find that the strong plasma entrainment is necessary to explain the multi-wavelength data. Our model will be tested by variability analysis among the multi-wavelength data.</description>

      <title>Shock breakouts from compact CSM surrounding core-collapse SN progenitors may contribute significantly to the observed $\gtrsim10$ TeV neutrino background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14233v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Growing observational evidence suggests that enhanced mass loss from the progenitors of core-collapse supernovae (SNe) is common during $\sim1$ yr preceding the explosion, creating an optically thick circum-stellar medium (CSM) shell at $\sim10^{14.5}$ cm radii. We show that if such mass loss is indeed common, then the breakout of the SN shock through the dense CSM shell produces a neutrino flux that may account for a significant fraction of the observed $\gtrsim10$ TeV neutrino background. The neutrinos are created within a few days from the explosion, during and shortly after the shock breakout, which produces also large UV (and later X-ray) luminosity. The compact size and large UV luminosity imply a pair production optical depth of $\sim10^4$ for $&gt;100$ GeV photons, naturally accounting for the lack of a high-energy gamma-ray background accompanying the neutrino background. SNe producing $&gt;1$ neutrino event in a 1 km$^2$ detector are expected at a rate of $\lesssim0.1$/yr. A quantitative theory describing the evolution of the electromagnetic spectrum during a breakout, as the radiation-mediated shock is transformed into a collisionless one, is required to enable (i) using data from upcoming surveys that will systematically detect large numbers of young, $&lt;1$ d old SNe, to determine the pre-explosion mass loss history of the SN progenitor population, and (ii) a quantitative determination of the neutrino luminosity and spectrum.</description>

      <title>Improved Analytic Modeling of Neutron Star Interiors</title>

      <description>arXiv:1904.05954v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Studies of neutron stars are extremely timely given the recent detection of gravitational waves from a binary neutron star merger GW170817, and an International Space Station payload NICER currently in operation that aims to determine radii of neutron stars to a precision better than 5%. In many cases, neutron star solutions are constructed numerically due to the complexity of the field equations with realistic equations of state. However, in order to relate observables like the neutron star mass and radius to interior quantities like central density and pressure, it would be useful to provide an accurate, analytic modeling of a neutron star interior. One such solution for static and isolated neutron stars is the Tolman VII solution characterized only by two parameters (e.g. mass and radius), though its agreement with numerical solutions is not perfect. We here introduce an improved analytic model based on the Tolman VII solution by introducing an additional parameter to make the analytic density profile agree better with the numerically obtained one. This additional parameter can be fitted in terms of the stellar mass, radius and central density in an equation-of-state-insensitive way. In most cases, we find that the new model more accurately describes realistic profiles than the original Tolman VII solution by a factor of 2-5. Our results are first-step calculations towards constructing analytic interior solutions for more realistic neutron stars under rotation or tidal deformation.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave seismology of charged strange stars in the Cowling approximation: the fluid pulsation modes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06412v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we study, within the framework of Cowling approximation, the effect of the electric charge on the gravitational wave frequency of fluid oscillation modes of strange quark stars. For this purpose, the dense matter of the stellar fluid is described by the MIT bag model equation of state (EoS), while for the electric charge profile, we consider that the electric charge density is proportional to the energy density. We find that the gravitational wave frequencies change with the increment of electric charge; these effects are more noticeable at higher total mass values. We obtain that the $f$-mode is very sensitive to the change in the electric charge of the star. Furthermore, in the case of the $p_1$ mode, the effect of the electric charge is not very significant. Our results reveal that the study of the fundamental pulsation mode of an electrically charged compact star is very important in distinguishing whether compact stars could contain electric charge. We also employ another electric charge distribution profile that follows a power law, and it is found that the $f$-mode change is more noticeable than the $p_1$-mode when the electric charge is incremented.</description>

      <title>Ringdown stability: greybody factors as stable gravitational-wave observables</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01692v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quasinormal mode spectrum of black holes plays a crucial role in the modelling of post-merger ringdown signals. However, the spectrum is extremely sensitive to small deformations of the system and describes the linear response only in a certain (not precisely defined) timeframe after the merger. We argue here that the greybody factors, recently shown to describe the ringdown spectral amplitude at relatively high frequencies, are instead stable under small perturbations of the system and free of certain ambiguities that plague the quasinormal mode spectrum. Our analysis also unveils a nontrivial interplay: while certain ringdown quantities are dominated by the contribution of spectrally unstable quasinormal modes, these modes conspire to produce stable observables. Thus, we propose a complementary approach to ringdown studies, which circumvents some limitations of the standard quasinormal mode description.</description>

      <title>Population synthesis of Thorne-\.Zytkow objects: Rejuvenated donors and unexplored progenitors in the common envelope formation channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11680v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Context. Common envelope evolution of a massive star and a neutron star companion has two possible outcomes: formation of a short-period binary (a potential gravitational wave source progenitor) or a merger of the massive star with the neutron star. If the binary merges, a structure with a neutron star core surrounded by a large diffuse envelope, a so-called Thorne-\.Zytkow object (T\.ZO), may form. The predicted appearance of this hypothetical class of star is very similar to red supergiants, making observational identification difficult.
  Aims. Our objective is to understand the properties of systems that are potential T\.ZO progenitors, e.g., binary systems that enter a common envelope phase with a neutron star companion. We also aim to distinguish those that have been through a previous stable mass transfer phase, which can rejuvenate the accretor. We estimate the number of T\.ZOs in the Milky Way and assess the impact of uncertainties in their formation.
  Methods. We use the rapid population synthesis code COMPAS at Solar metallicity and with common envelope efficiency parameter set to unity to determine the population demographics of T\.ZOs. We use one-dimensional evolutionary T\.ZO models from the literature to determine a fit for T\.ZO lifetime in order to estimate the current number of T\.ZOs in the Galaxy as well as to assess core disruption during the merger.
  Results. We explore the progenitors in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, calculate formation rates, and investigate kinematics of the progenitor stars. We find that the vast majority ($\approx 92\%$) of T\.ZO progenitors in our population have experienced mass transfer and become rejuvenated before their formation event. Using a constant star formation rate we estimate $\approx 2\times 10 ^{-4}$ T\.ZOs per $M_\odot$ in our Galaxy, corresponding to $\approx 5\pm 1$ T\.ZOs in the Milky Way at present.</description>

      <title>Resonant excitation of eccentricity in spherical extreme-mass-ratio inspirals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02004v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational radiation reaction, has been one of the fundamental issues in general relativity. Over a span of decades, this process has been analyzed in the adiabatic limit, in order to comprehend how it drives extreme-mass-ratio binaries, that are prime targets for space-borne detectors. It has been shown that spherical orbits around Schwarzschild and Kerr black holes remain spherical (zero eccentricity) under the influence of gravitational radiation reaction. Here, we show that spherical orbits in non-Kerr black holes, that still preserve most of the good qualities and symmetries of Kerr spacetime, can access certain resonances in such a way that an initially spherical inspiral acquires non-zero eccentricity and becomes non-spherical. Therefore, the crossing of resonances under radiation reaction interrupts and even inverts, up to some small radius close to plunge, the process of circularization of orbits. The strength of resonant excitation of eccentricity depends on the initial position and inclination of the integrable extreme-mass-ratio system, as well as the integrability-breaking parameter introduced in the background spacetime that amplifies further the excitation. We find that the harmonics of gravitational waves emitted from these inspirals undergo a frequency modulation as the orbit `metamorphoses' from spherical to non-spherical, due to the effect of resonant eccentricity excitation. The gain that low-amplitude harmonics experience in these oligochromatic EMRIs, due to resonances, may be detectable with future spaceborne detectors and serves as an indicator of non-Kerrness of the background spacetime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15669v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To address the discrepancy where disk sizes exceed those predicted by standard models, we explore two extensions to disk size estimates within the UV/optical wavelength range: disk winds and color correction. We provide detailed, self-consistent derivations and analytical formulas, including those based on a power-law temperature approximation, offering efficient tools for analyzing observational data. Applying our model to four type I AGNs with intensive reverberation mapping observations, we find a shallower temperature slope ($T\propto R^{-0.66}$, compared to $R^{-3/4}$ traditionally) and a color correction factor ($f_{\rm col} \approx 1.6$), consistent with previous studies. We observe a positive correlation between accretion rate and color correction with black hole mass. However, the small sample size limits our conclusions. The strong degeneracy between the temperature slope and accretion rate suggests that incorporating flux spectra or spectral energy distributions could improve fitting accuracy. Our simulation approach rapidly generates quasar light curves while accommodating various observational scenarios for reverberation mapping, making it well-suited for training machine learning algorithms.</description>
