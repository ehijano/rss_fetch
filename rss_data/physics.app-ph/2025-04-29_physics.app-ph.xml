      <title>Unlocking Spin Dynamics: Spin-Orbit Coupling Driven Spin State Interconversion in Carbazole-Containing TADF Emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The determination of transport mechanisms in organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) is crucial for optimizing device performance. Magnetic field measurements enable the differentiation of spin state interconversion mechanisms, but data interpretation remains challenging. Here, experimental and theoretical investigations were combined to provide a comprehensive understanding of the underlying processes. This study systematically compares three cyanoarene-based emitters with different singlet-triplet gaps to explore factors influencing reverse intersystem crossing (RISC). The comparison of all-$^1$H and all-$^2$H 4CzIPN isotopologues confirms that RISC is governed by spin-orbit coupling (SOC) rather than hyperfine interactions. Magnetic field-dependent measurements reveal that charge transport in OLED devices is driven by triplet-charge annihilation in 3CzClIPN and 4CzIPN, while triplet-triplet annihilation dominates for 5CzBN. Theoretical calculations further indicate that SOC-mediated RISC in 3CzClIPN and 4CzIPN can additionally occur via a $T_2$ intermediate state with an activation energy distinct from the singlet-triplet energy gap. A temperature-dependent analysis of the devices was conducted to quantify this activation energy and compare it with the computational findings. These findings establish key correlations between activation energy, spin dynamics, and magnetic field effects in TADF emitters, advancing our understanding of excitonic processes in OLEDs.</description>

      <title>Injection locking of surface acoustic wave phononic crystal oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-noise gigahertz (GHz) frequencies sources are essential for applications in signal processing, sensing, and telecommunications. Surface acoustic wave (SAW) resonator-based oscillators offer compact form factors and low phase noise due to their short mechanical wavelengths and high quality (Q) factors. However, their small footprint makes them vulnerable to environmental variation, resulting in their poor long-term frequency stability. Injection locking is widely used to suppress frequency drift of lasers and oscillators by synchronizing to an ultra-stable reference. Here, we demonstrate injection locking of a 1-GHz SAW phononic crystal oscillator, achieving 40-dB phase noise reduction at low offset frequencies. Compared to a free-running SAW oscillator, which typically exhibits frequency drifts of several hundred hertz over minutes, the injection-locked oscillator reduces the frequency deviation to below 0.35 Hz. We also investigated the locking range and oscillator dynamics in the injection pulling region. The demonstrated injection-locked SAW oscillator could find applications in high-performance portable telecommunications and sensing systems.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of Incremental Forming of Sheet Metal with a Negative Die: Experimental and Numerical Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-point incremental forming (TPIF) is a flexible sheet metal forming process, commonly divided into positive and negative configurations. In order to improve the dimensional accuracy, thickness distribution, and overall formability of conical sheet parts, this study examines the negative TPIF approach. A series of experiments were conducted by varying key process parameters including tool diameter, vertical step size, forming strategy, and lubricant type. The forming process was performed on 0.9 mm thick St12 steel sheets using a CNC milling machine equipped with a full die set and a spherical-head forming tool. According to the results, increasing the tool diameter reduced material thinning and failure risk by improving thickness distribution and increasing the minimum wall thickness from 0.24 mm to 0.5 mm. On the other hand, sharp features were better defined with smaller tool diameters. The corresponding plastic strain was decreased and the risk of tearing was reduced by using a multi-stage forming technique, which also improved strain distribution and decreased thinning. Lubricant type showed limited influence on geometric accuracy or thickness uniformity but had a noticeable effect on surface finish. Overall, this study demonstrates that tool geometry and forming strategy are critical in optimizing the performance of negative TPIF processes. The findings provide practical guidelines for improving the structural integrity and precision of incrementally formed sheet metal parts.</description>

      <title>Spreading of highly cohesive metal powders with transverse oscillation kinematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Powder bed additive manufacturing processes such as laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) or binder jetting (BJ) benefit from using fine (D50 $\leq20~\mu m$) powders. However, the increasing level of cohesion with decreasing particle size makes spreading a uniform and continuous layer challenging. As a result, LPBF typically employs a coarser size distribution, and rotating roller mechanisms are used in BJ machines, that can create wave-like surface profiles due to roller run-out.
  In this work, a transverse oscillation kinematic for powder spreading is proposed, explored computationally, and validated experimentally. Simulations are performed using an integrated discrete element-finite element (DEM-FEM) framework and predict that transverse oscillation of a non-rotating roller facilitates the spreading of dense powder layers (beyond 50% packing fraction) with a high level of robustness to kinematic parameters. The experimental study utilizes a custom-built mechanized powder spreading testbed and X-ray transmission imaging for the analysis of spread powder layers. Experimental results generally validate the computational results, however, also exhibit parasitic layer cracking. For transverse oscillation frequencies above 200 Hz, powder layers of high packing fraction (between 50-60%) were formed, and for increased layer thicknesses, highly uniform and continuous layers were deposited. Statistical analysis of the experimental powder layer morphology as a function of kinematic spreading parameters revealed that an increasing transverse surface velocity improves layer uniformity and reduces cracking defects. This suggests that with minor improvements to the machine design, the proposed transverse oscillation kinematic has the potential to result in thin and consistently uniform powder layers of highly cohesive powder.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal scattering of elastic waves at time interfaces induced by spatiotemporal modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatiotemporally modulated elastic metamaterials have garnered increasing interest for their potential applications in nonreciprocal wave devices. Most existing studies, however, focus on systems where spatiotemporal modulation is continuous and infinite in time. Here, we investigate the temporal dynamics of elastic waves at time interfaces created by the sudden activation or deactivation of spatiotemporal modulation in a medium's elastic properties. By developing an ad hoc mode-coupling theory, we reveal that such time interfaces enable controlled frequency and wavenumber conversion through mode redistribution and energy pumping. Specifically, we quantitatively evaluate the temporal scattering behavior of elastic longitudinal waves under two representative spatiotemporal modulations: subsonic and supersonic. These modulations give rise to frequency and wavenumber bandgaps, respectively. We demonstrate that subsonic modulation induces nonreciprocal energy reversal, while supersonic modulation leads to nonreciprocal energy amplification. Our findings pave the way for the development of temporal elastic metamaterials with practical applications in designing one-way elastic filters, amplifiers, and frequency converters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work describes sputtered scandium aluminum nitride (ScAlN) thin-film bulk acoustic resonators (FBAR) at 12.5 GHz with high electromechanical coupling (k2) of 9.5% and quality factor (Q) of 208, resulting in a figure of merit (FoM, Qk2) of 19.8. ScAlN resonators employ a stack of 90 nm thick 20% Sc doping ScAlN piezoelectric film on the floating bottom 38 nm thick platinum (Pt) electrode to achieve low losses and high coupling toward centimeter wave (cmWave) frequency band operation. Three fabricated and FBARs are reported, show promising prospects of ScAlN-Pt stack towards cmWave front-end filters.</description>

      <title>Threshold Switching in Vertically Aligned MoS${_2}$/SiO${_x}$ Heterostructures based on Silver Ion Migration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Threshold switching (TS) is a phenomenon where non-permanent changes in electrical resistance of a two-terminal device can be controlled by modulating the voltage bias. TS based on silver (Ag) conductive filaments has been observed in many materials, including layered two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). 2D TMDs are particularly promising for metal ion movement due to their van der Waals (vdW) gaps between their sheets, facilitating ion migration and filament formation without disturbing covalent chemical bonds. In this work, we demonstrate the heterostructure growth of vertically aligned molybdenum disulfide (VAMoS${_2}$) with an amorphous silicon oxide (SiO${_x}$) layer on top after sulfurization. We show that Ag ions migrate through this material stack, enabling TS. Our Ag/SiO${_x}$/VAMoS${_2}$/gold (Au) devices exhibit TS at low voltages of ~0.63 V, with high on-state currents over 200 ${\mu}$A and stable switching exceeding 10${^4}$ cycles. Moreover, we identify two rate-limiting steps for filament formation through a physics-based dynamical model and simulate the switching kinetics. Our devices show a fast on-switching time of 311 ns and spontaneous relaxation in 233 ns. These findings deepen the understanding of SiOx/MoS${_2}$-based RS devices and demonstrate the promise for applications in emerging memories and neuromorphic computing systems.</description>

      <title>True Solid-State Electrical Conduction of Proteins shows them to be Efficient Transport Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While solid-state protein junctions have shown efficient electron transport over lengths that surpass those of conventional organic semiconducting systems, interfacial or contact effects may obscure the intrinsic protein charge transport properties. Therefore, contact resistance (RC) effects need to be quantified and then minimized, which poses a problem if 4-probe geometries cannot be used. Here we show how RC can be extracted quantitatively from the measured junction resistance (RP) by using the extrapolated zero-length resistance (RZLR) and short-circuit resistance (RS). We used AC (impedance spectroscopy) and DC measurements to examine charge transport in junctions of human serum albumin (HSA) and bacteriorhodopsin (bR) films with varying thicknesses. Three contact configurations, Si-Au, Au-EGaIn, and, in a micropore device (MpD), Au-Pd, were compared. While Si-Au and Au-EGaIn junctions exhibit substantial RC that we ascribe to interfacial oxides and electrostatic protein-electrode interactions, MpD effectively eliminates RC, enabling measuring the intrinsic electron transport across HSA and bR films. The exponential length dependence of RP shows a transport decay constant (beta) that varies with interfacial conditions, underscoring the role of contact engineering. By minimizing RC, exceptionally low beta values (0.7 to 1.1 per nm) are found, proving that, indeed, proteins can have outstanding charge transport efficiencies.</description>

      <title>Cracking in polymer substrates for flexible devices and its mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mechanical reliability plays an outsized role in determining the durability of flexible electronic devices because of the significant mechanical stresses they can experience during manufacturing and operation. These devices are typically built on sheets comprising stiff thin-film electrodes on compliant polymer substrates, and it is generally assumed that the high-toughness substrates do not crack easily. Contrary to this widespread assumption, here we reveal severe, pervasive, and extensive cracking in the polymer substrates during bending of electrode/substrate sheets, which compromises the overall mechanical integrity of the entire device. The substrate-cracking phenomenon appears to be general, and it is driven by the amplified stress intensity factor caused by the elastic mismatch at the film/substrate interface. To mitigate this substrate cracking, an interlayer-engineering approach is designed and experimentally demonstrated. This approach is generic, and it is potentially applicable to myriad flexible electronic devices that utilize stiff films on compliant substrates, for improving their durability and reliability.</description>

      <title>Thermoregulation Variation in Vertebrates Reveals Differences in Thermal Fatigue Resistance of Bones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we propose the hypothesis that there is a significant difference in thermal cycling fatigue resistance between the bones of ectothermic and endothermic animals. We performed an experiment to test whether bones of endothermic animals, having potentially lost their ability to adapt to thermal cycling, exhibit reduced resistance to thermal fatigue compared to ectothermic animals, which may have retained this adaptive trait due to their environmental conditions. The change in stiffness were determined using shifts in the resonant peaks of the frequency spectrum obtained from Resonant Ultrasonic Spectroscopy (RUS). To achieve this, samples of compact (cortical) and spongy bone tissue were extracted and polished before undergoing a 29-day period of thermal cycling. The changes in the resonance frequencies were then observed. Changes in resonant frequencies imply corresponding changes in elastic constants. The primary findings indicated that bones from ectothermic species exhibited minimal changes in elastic properties compared to those from endothermic species, as evidenced by the smaller shifts in resonant peak magnitudes following thermal cycling.</description>

      <title>Interface Magnetism in Vanadium-doped MoS$_2$/Graphene Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetism in two-dimensional materials is of great importance in discovering new physical phenomena and developing new devices at the nanoscale. In this paper, first-principles simulations are used to calculate the electronic and magnetic properties of heterostructures composed of Graphene and MoS$_2$ considering the influence of point defects and Vanadium doping. It is found that the concentration of the dopants and the types of defects can result in induced magnetic moments leading to ferromagnetically polarized systems with sharp interfaces. This provides a framework for interpreting the experimental observations of enhanced ferromagnetism in both MoS$_2$/Graphene and V-doped MoS$_2$/Graphene heterostructures. The computed electronic and spin polarizations give a microscopic understanding of the origin of ferromagnetism in these systems and illustrate how doping and defect engineering can lead to targeted property tunability. Our work has demonstrated that through defects engineering, ferromagnetism can be achieved in V-doped MoS$_2$/Graphene heterostructures, providing a potential way to induce magnetization in other TMDC/Graphene materials and opening new opportunities for their applications in nano-spintronics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Levitated optomechanics is an emerging field in quantum science that explores the quantum motion of mesoscopic particles levitated in a vacuum. Expanding this approach to particles with intrinsic quantum defects opens new opportunities for quantum sensing and nontrivial quantum state generation. Here, we explore silicon carbide (SiC) nanoparticles as a promising platform that offers a range of controllable quantum defects and material tunability. We demonstrate stable optical levitation of 3C-polytype SiC nanoparticles containing single photon emitters in a vacuum. We observe stable fluorescence from the levitated particle, confirming the preservation of the emitters in the levitated state. We also investigate particle loss at low pressure and explore thermal annealing as a potential method to improve trapping stability. Our results establish SiC as a viable platform for levitated optomechanics, providing additional quantum degrees of freedom and material engineering capabilities.</description>

      <title>In Situ Nanometer-Resolution Strain and Orientation Mapping for Gas-Solid Reactions via Precession-Assisted Four-dimensional Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chemomechanical interactions in gas or liquid environments are crucial for the functionality and longevity of various materials used in sustainable energy technologies, such as rechargeable batteries, water-splitting catalysts, and next-generation nuclear reactors. A comprehensive understanding of nanoscale strain evolution involved in these processes can advance our knowledge of underlying mechanisms and facilitate material design improvements. However, traditional microscopy workflows face challenges due to trade-offs between field of view (FOV), spatial resolution, temporal resolution, and electron beam damage, particularly in gas or liquid environments. Here, we demonstrate in situ nanometer-resolution strain and orientation mapping in a temperature-controlled gas environment with a large FOV. This is achieved by integrating a microelectromechanical system (MEMS)-based closed-cell TEM holder, precession-assisted four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM), and a direct electron detector (DED). Using the strain evolution during zirconium initial oxidation as a case study, we first outline critical strategies for focused ion beam gas-cell sample preparation and gas-phase TEM workflows to enhance experimental success. We then show that integrating DED with precession electron diffraction and optimizing gas pressure substantially improve the quantity and quality of the detected Bragg peaks in nano-beam electron diffraction patterns, enabling more precise strain measurements. Furthermore, we introduce a practical protocol to pause the reactions, allowing sufficient time for 4D-STEM data collection while ensuring the temporal resolution needed to resolve material dynamics. Our methodology and workflow provide a robust framework for quantitative analysis of chemomechanical evolutions in materials exposed to gas or liquid environments.</description>

      <title>Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices based on InSb nanoflag Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Planar Josephson junctions (JJs) based on InSb nanoflags have recently emerged as an intriguing platform in superconducting electronics. This letter presents the fabrication and investigation of superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) employing InSb nanoflag JJs. We provide measurements of interference patterns in both symmetric and asymmetric geometries. The interference patterns in both configurations can be modulated by a back-gate voltage, a feature well reproduced through numerical simulations. The observed behavior aligns with the skewed current-phase relations of the JJs, demonstrating significant contributions from higher harmonics. We explore the magnetic field response of the devices across a wide range of fields ($\pm 30$ mT), up to the single-junction interference regime, where a Fraunhofer-like pattern is detected. Finally, we assess the flux-to-voltage sensitivity of the SQUIDs to evaluate their performance as magnetometers. A magnetic flux noise of $S^{1/2}_\Phi = 4.4 \times 10^{-6} \Phi_0 / \sqrt{Hz}$ is identified, indicating potential applications in nanoscale magnetometry.</description>

      <title>A Workflow for Correlative in-situ Nano-chip Liquid Cell Transmission Electron Microscopy and Atom Probe Tomography Enabled by Cryogenic Plasma Focused Ion Beam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Operando/in-situ liquid cell transmission electron microscopy (LCTEM) allows for real time imaging of dynamic nanoscale liquid-based processes. However, due to the thick liquid cell of traditional LCTEM holders and thus scattering of the electron beam passing through the cell, the achievable spatial and chemical resolution is limited. Cryogenic atom probe tomography (cryo-APT) overcomes these limitations by offering (near-)atomic scale compositional analysis of frozen liquid-solid interfaces. However, APT provides limited structural analysis and has no capacity for dynamic or operando liquid cell studies. This work presents a novel workflow for site-specific cryo-APT sample preparation of liquid-solid interfaces from in-situ electrochemical LCTEM Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) chips. Using cryogenic inert gas transfer suitcase and a cryogenic plasma-focused ion beam (PFIB), a MEMs nanochip containing a Li electrolyte from an electrochemistry LCTEM holder was successfully frozen, transferred to the cryo stage of a PFIB and prepared into APT needle samples containing the electrolyte-electrode interface at cryogenic temperatures, followed by cryogenic transfer to an atom probe for nanoscale compositional analysis. This correlative approach provides dynamic nanoscale imaging and near atomic scale compositional analysis of liquid-solid interfaces. This method enables reliable and reproducible APT sample preparation of these frozen interfaces from MEMs based nanochips and can hence be used across materials systems and energy-conversion or storage devices.</description>

      <title>Composable and adaptive design of machine learning interatomic potentials guided by Fisher-information analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An adaptive physics-informed model design strategy for machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) is proposed. This strategy follows an iterative reconfiguration of composite models from single-term models, followed by a unified training procedure. A model evaluation method based on the Fisher information matrix (FIM) and multiple-property error metrics is proposed to guide model reconfiguration and hyperparameter optimization. Combining the model reconfiguration and the model evaluation subroutines, we provide an adaptive MLIP design strategy that balances flexibility and extensibility. In a case study of designing models against a structurally diverse niobium dataset, we managed to obtain an optimal configuration with 75 parameters generated by our framework that achieved a force RMSE of 0.172 eV/{\AA} and an energy RMSE of 0.013 eV/atom.</description>

      <title>Exploring binary intermetallics for advanced interconnect applications using ab initio simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The challenge of increasing copper (Cu) resistivity with diminishing Cu interconnect dimensions in complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) transistors, along with the imperative for efficient electron transport paths to fulfill scaling requirements in interconnects is significant. First-principles electronic structures calculations based on density functional theory have been performed to evaluate the potential scalability of some Cu, Al, Ru and Mo based binary alloys to replace Cu. We evaluate the expected sensitivity of the resistivity of these binary alloys to reduced line dimensions with a figure of merit that is based on generalized finite-temperature transport tensors. These transport tensors allow for a straightforward comparison between highly anisotropic intermetallics with given transport directions and Cu, and are evaluated together with their resistance to electromigration. Based on the figure-of-merit analysis, we identify several aluminides that show potential to outperform Cu at reduced interconnect dimensions in terms of their electronic transport and reliability properties.</description>

      <title>Dependence of the Radical Dynamics on the Beam Temporal Profile in FLASH Radiotherapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Purpose: This study aims to investigate the impact of the beam temporal profile on the radical dynamics and inter-track interactions of FLASH radiotherapy, supporting parameter optimization for the equipment development and clinical implementation. Methods: MonteCarlo simulations based on the IRT method were performed to analyze the dynamics after irradiation, including single-pulse or multi-pulses irradiation, pulse repetition rate, width and dose. The physicochemical experiments were performed to measure the eaq-lifetimes for validation. The generation and recombination of OH and eaq-radicals were recorded under 6 MeV electron irradiation with varying beam temporal profiles. The radial distributions of the radicals were statistically analyzed, and the corresponding LETd and LETt were calculated. The inter-track interactions were assessed through a mathematical model. Results: The spatial distribution and temporal evolution of radicals were significantly affected by the beam time profiles. Compared with multi-pulses irradiation, single-pulse mode with a width less than 1/10 of the radical lifetime, a repetition interval longer than the radical lifetime, and a dose exceeding 1 Gy/pulse can lead to radicals rapid consumption, reducing the residual content. Instantaneous high dose rates induced radical tracks overlaps. When the single-pulse dose exceeded 1 Gy, the overlap probability approached 100%, aligning with the threshold for radical instantaneous combination. Conclusion: Under a low-duty cycle and high instantaneous dose-rate time profile, the radicals were rapidly consumed through track overlap hence reduced damage to normal tissues, inducing FLASH effect. The optimized time profile can be used to guide the development of equipment and parameter settings in clinical practice to maximize the FLASH effect, such as the laser accelerators and superconducting photocathode guns.</description>

      <title>Textured growth and electrical characterization of Zinc Sulfide on back-end-of-the-line (BEOL) compatible substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scaling of transistors has enabled continuous improvements in logic device performance, especially through materials engineering. However, surpassing horizontal limitations in chip manufacturing requires a vertical, third dimension. Three-dimensional integration of high-performance logic demands solving the challenge of low-temperature (less than 450{\deg}C) synthesis of high-mobility n-type and p-type semiconductor thin films for back-end-of-line (BEOL) compatible transistors. Metal oxides, particularly indium oxides alloyed with gallium and tungsten, are promising n-type channel materials, but suitable p-type materials for BEOL remain scarce. Zinc sulfide (ZnS), a wide band-gap semiconductor, shows room-temperature p-type conductivity when doped with copper and crystallizes below 400{\deg}C. Here, we report growth of crystalline ZnS thin films by pulsed laser deposition on amorphous and polycrystalline surfaces including silicon nitride, thermal silicon dioxide, yttrium oxide, hafnium dioxide, sapphire, platinum, and titanium nitride. X-ray diffraction reveals out-of-plane texturing across all surfaces, while grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering probes in-plane crystalline quality. Surface and interface properties are assessed using X-ray reflectivity and atomic force microscopy. Electrical characterization via J-V measurements (ZnS on Pt) and metal-oxide-semiconductor capacitor (ZnS on silicon dioxide) measurements show low leakage current ($10^{-5} A/cm^2$ at 0.40 MV/cm) and bilayer capacitor behavior, suggesting ZnS is highly intrinsic with minimal electrically active defects. Further work on doping ZnS with copper or other p-type elements is needed to realize ZnS as a dopable wide band-gap semiconductor for BEOL integration. This work demonstrates a novel thin-film growth method for sulfide semiconductors under BEOL-compatible conditions.</description>

      <title>Closely piling up of multiple adhesive fronts in adhesive friction due to re-attachment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05283v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As a fundamental force, friction exerts a profound influence on various aspects of our daily lives across multiple disciplines. To understand why adhesive friction is associated with the contact area, here we investigate the generic sliding of elastic solids adhered to a rigid surface by considering re-attachment/healing. We then reveal multiple adhesive fronts closely aligning along the interface with the number of these regions generally increasing with the contact area. These adhesive fronts exhibit rich dynamics and their accumulation along an interface can aid each other through re-attachment/healing in friction, apparently resulting in the increase in the calculated shear-off force with the contact area. Based on these findings, we propose a generalized law of adhesive friction. Our analysis further suggests that accumulating adhesive fronts possibly to a critical area density along the interface can trigger crack-like propagation of individual fronts at high velocities, which potentially bridges the gap between tribology and fracture mechanics. We discuss the relevance of this work to earthquake mechanics, which might provide a unified framework that captures key aspects of fault behavior. We expect that this work can provide a fundamental understanding of healing-mediated interfacial phenomena in diverse systems spanning biology, geology, and engineering.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18670v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum optics plays a crucial role in developing quantum computers on different platforms. In photonics, precise control over light's degrees of freedom, including discrete variables (polarization, photon number, orbital angular momentum) and continuous variables (phase, amplitude quadratures, frequency), is fundamental. Our model manipulates photonic systems to encode and process quantum information via the photon's spatial degree of freedom, employing polarization as an auxiliary qubit. We propose a programmable photonic circuit that simulates quantum channels, including phase-damping, amplitude-damping, and bit-flip channels, through adjustable interferometric parameters. Furthermore, the interferometer extends to complex channels, such as the squeezed generalized amplitude damping. This work contributes to advancing quantum simulation techniques and serves as a foundation for exploring quantum computing applications, while highlighting pathways for their practical implementation.</description>

Abstract: Scattering and absorption are fundamental processes in optical engineering and applications. This study investigates the use of the food dye tartrazine to design refractive index fluids that enhance light propagation through scattering media.
