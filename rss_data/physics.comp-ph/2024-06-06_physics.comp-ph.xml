      <title>Astral: training physics-informed neural networks with error majorants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The primal approach to physics-informed learning is a residual minimization. We argue that residual is, at best, an indirect measure of the error of approximate solution and propose to train with error majorant instead. Since error majorant provides a direct upper bound on error, one can reliably estimate how close PiNN is to the exact solution and stop the optimization process when the desired accuracy is reached. We call loss function associated with error majorant $\textbf{Astral}$: neur$\textbf{A}$l a po$\textbf{ST}$erio$\textbf{RI}$ function$\textbf{A}$l Loss. To compare Astral and residual loss functions, we illustrate how error majorants can be derived for various PDEs and conduct experiments with diffusion equations (including anisotropic and in the L-shaped domain), convection-diffusion equation, temporal discretization of Maxwell's equation, and magnetostatics problem. The results indicate that Astral loss is competitive to the residual loss, typically leading to faster convergence and lower error (e.g., for Maxwell's equations, we observe an order of magnitude better relative error and training time). We also report that the error estimate obtained with Astral loss is usually tight enough to be informative, e.g., for a highly anisotropic equation, on average, Astral overestimates error by a factor of $1.5$, and for convection-diffusion by a factor of $1.7$.</description>

      <title>Towards high-order consistency and convergence of conservative SPH approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) offers distinct advantages for modeling many engineering problems, yet achieving high-order consistency in its conservative formulation remains to be addressed. While zero- and higher-order consistencies can be obtained using particle-pair differences and the kernel gradient correction (KGC) approaches, respectively, for SPH gradient approximations, their applicability for discretizing conservation laws in practical simulations is limited due to their non-conservative feature. Although the standard anti-symmetric SPH approximation is able to achieve conservative zero-order consistency through particle relaxation, its straightforward extensions with the KGC fail to satisfy either zero- or higher-order consistency. In this paper, we propose the reverse KGC (RKGC) formulation, which is conservative and able to precisely satisfy both zero- and first-order consistencies when particles are relaxed based on the KGC matrix. Extensive numerical examples show that the new formulation considerably improves the accuracy of the Lagrangian SPH method. In particular, it is able to resolve the long-standing high-dissipation issue for simulating free-surface flows. Furthermore, with fully relaxed particles, it enhances the accuracy of the Eulerian SPH method even when the ratio between the smoothing length and the particle spacing is considerably reduced. Indeed, the reverse KGC formulation holds the potential for the extension to even higher-order consistencies. However, addressing the corresponding particle relaxation problem remains a pending challenge.</description>

      <title>Circle packing on spherical caps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have studied the packing of congruent disks on a spherical cap, for caps of different size and number of disks, $N$. This problem has been considered before only in the limit cases of circle packing inside a circle and on a sphere (Tammes problem), whereas all intermediate cases are unexplored. Finding the preferred packing configurations for a domain with both curvature and border could be useful in the description of physical and biological systems (for example, colloidal suspensions or the compound eye of an insect), with potential applications in engineering and architecture (e.g. geodesic domes).
  We have carried out an extensive search for the densest packing configurations of congruent disks on spherical caps of selected angular widths ($\theta_{\rm max} = \pi/6$, $\pi/4$, $\pi/2$, $3\pi/4$, $5 \pi/6$) and for several values of $N$. The numerical results obtained in the present work have been used to establish (at least qualitatively) some general features for these configurations, in particular the behavior of the packing fraction as function of the number of disks and of the angular width of the cap, or the nature of the topological defects in these configurations (it found that as the curvature increases the overall topological on the border tends to become more negative).
  Finally we have studied the packing configurations for $N = 19$, $37$, $61$, $91$ (hexagonal numbers) for caps ranging from the flat disk to the whole sphere, to observe the evolution (and eventual disappearance) of the curved hexagonal packing configurations while increasing the curvature.</description>

      <title>Giant enhancement of hole mobility for 4H-silicon carbide through suppressing interband electron-phonon scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 4H-Silicon Carbide (4H-SiC) possesses a high Baliga figure of merit, making it a promising material for power electronics. However, its applications are limited by its low hole mobility. Herein, we found that the hole mobility of 4H-SiC is mainly limited by the strong interband electron-phonon scattering using mode-level first-principles calculations. Our research indicates that applying compressive strain can reverse the sign of crystal-field splitting and change the ordering of electron bands close to the valence band maximum. Therefore, the interband electron-phonon scattering is severely suppressed, and the out-of-plane hole mobility of 4H-SiC can be enhanced by 200% with 2% uniaxial compressive strain applied. This work provides new insights into the electron transport mechanisms in semiconductors and suggests a strategy to improve hole mobility that could be applied to other semiconductors with hexagonal crystalline geometries.</description>

      <title>Leveraging KANs For Enhanced Deep Koopman Operator Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02875v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-layer perceptrons (MLP's) have been extensively utilized in discovering Deep Koopman operators for linearizing nonlinear dynamics. With the emergence of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) as a more efficient and accurate alternative to the MLP Neural Network, we propose a comparison of the performance of each network type in the context of learning Koopman operators with control. In this work, we propose a KANs-based deep Koopman framework with applications to an orbital Two-Body Problem (2BP) and the pendulum for data-driven discovery of linear system dynamics. KANs were found to be superior in nearly all aspects of training; learning 31 times faster, being 15 times more parameter efficiency, and predicting 1.25 times more accurately as compared to the MLP Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) in the case of the 2BP. Thus, KANs shows potential for being an efficient tool in the development of Deep Koopman Theory.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive and FAIR comparison between MLP and KAN representations for differential equations and operator networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) were recently introduced as an alternative representation model to MLP. Herein, we employ KANs to construct physics-informed machine learning models (PIKANs) and deep operator models (DeepOKANs) for solving differential equations for forward and inverse problems. In particular, we compare them with physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and deep operator networks (DeepONets), which are based on the standard MLP representation. We find that although the original KANs based on the B-splines parameterization lack accuracy and efficiency, modified versions based on low-order orthogonal polynomials have comparable performance to PINNs and DeepONet although they still lack robustness as they may diverge for different random seeds or higher order orthogonal polynomials. We visualize their corresponding loss landscapes and analyze their learning dynamics using information bottleneck theory. Our study follows the FAIR principles so that other researchers can use our benchmarks to further advance this emerging topic.</description>

      <title>Theory and Modeling of Transport in Nanoporous Materials: From Microscopic to Coarse-Grained Descriptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This review presents the state of the art on the theory, molecular simulation, and coarse-grained strategies applied to the transport of gases and liquids in nanoporous materials (pore size in the range 1 - 100 nm). Recent advances in the understanding of molecular diffusion and transport under thermodynamic gradients in nanoporous adsorbents are discussed with special emphasis on small molecules in zeolites, active carbons, metal organic frameworks, but also in nanoporous materials with larger pores such as ordered and disordered mesoporous oxides. We provide a description of the fundamentals and principles of the different atom-scale and mesoscopic methods as well as of the theoretical formalisms that can be used to address such an important problem. Special attention is paid to the investigation of different molecular transport coefficients - including the so-called self, collective and transport diffusivities - but also to the determination of free energy barriers and their role in overall adsorption/separation process rates. We also introduce other available approaches such as hierarchical simulations and upscaling strategies.</description>

      <title>MESS: Modern Electronic Structure Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electronic structure simulation (ESS) has been used for decades to provide quantitative scientific insights on an atomistic scale, enabling advances in chemistry, biology, and materials science, among other disciplines. Following standard practice in scientific computing, the software packages driving these studies have been implemented in compiled languages such as FORTRAN and C. However, the recent introduction of machine learning (ML) into these domains has meant that ML models must be coded in these languages, or that complex software bridges have to be built between ML models in Python and these large compiled software systems. This is in contrast with recent progress in modern ML frameworks which aim to optimise both ease of use and high performance by harnessing hardware acceleration of tensor programs defined in Python. We introduce MESS: a modern electronic structure simulation package implemented in JAX; porting the ESS code to the ML world. We outline the costs and benefits of following the software development practices used in ML for this important scientific workload. MESS shows significant speedups n widely available hardware accelerators and simultaneously opens a clear pathway towards combining ESS with ML. MESS is available at https://github.com/graphcore-research/mess.</description>

      <title>Determination of Optimal Chain Coupling made by Embedding in D-Wave Quantum Annealer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The qubits in a D-wave quantum annealer (D-wave QA) are designed on a Pegasus graph that is different from structure of a combinatorial optimization problem. This situation requires embedding with the chains connected by ferromagnetic (FM) coupling $J_c$ between the qubits. Weak and strong $J_c$ values induce chain breaking and enforcement of chain energy, which reduce the accuracy of quantum annealing (QA) measurements, respectively. In addition, we confirmed that even though the D-Wave Ocean package provides a default coupling $J_c^{\text{default}}$, it is not an optimal coupling $J_c^{\text{optimal}}$ that maximizes the possible correct rate of QA measurements. In this paper, we present an algorithm how $J_c^{\text{optimal}}$ with the maximum probability $p$ for observing the possible lowest energy is determined. Finally, we confirm that the extracted $J_c^{\text{optimal}}$ show much better $p$ than $J_c^{\text{default}}$ in QA measurements of various parameters of frustrated and fully connected combinatorial optimization problems. The open code is available in \textit{https://github.com/HunpyoLee/OptimizeChainStrength}.</description>

      <title>Computational Supremacy of Quantum Eigensolver by Extension of Optimized Binary Configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We developed a quantum eigensolver (QE) which is based on an extension of optimized binary configurations measured by quantum annealing (QA) on a D-Wave Quantum Annealer (D-Wave QA). This approach performs iterative QA measurements to optimize the eigenstates $\vert \psi \rangle$ without the derivation of a classical computer. The computational cost is $\eta M L$ for full eigenvalues $E$ and $\vert \psi \rangle$ of the Hamiltonian $\hat{H}$ of size $L \times L$, where $M$ and $\eta$ are the number of QA measurements required to reach the converged $\vert \psi \rangle$ and the total annealing time of many QA shots, respectively. Unlike the exact diagonalized (ED) algorithm with $L^3$ iterations on a classical computer, the computation cost is not significantly affected by $L$ and $M$ because $\eta$ represents a very short time within $10^{-2}$ seconds on the D-Wave QA. We selected the tight-binding $\hat{H}$ that contains the exact $E$ values of all energy states in two systems with metallic and insulating phases. We confirmed that the proposed QE algorithm provides exact solutions within the errors of $5 \times 10^{-3}$. The QE algorithm will not only show computational supremacy over the ED approach on a classical computer but will also be widely used for various applications such as material and drug design.</description>

      <title>Physics and geometry informed neural operator network with application to acoustic scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a physics and geometry informed neural operator network with application to the forward simulation of acoustic scattering. The development of geometry informed deep learning models capable of learning a solution operator for different computational domains is a problem of general importance for a variety of engineering applications. To this end, we propose a physics-informed deep operator network (DeepONet) capable of predicting the scattered pressure field for arbitrarily shaped scatterers using a geometric parameterization approach based on non-uniform rational B-splines (NURBS). This approach also results in parsimonious representations of non-trivial scatterer geometries. In contrast to existing physics-based approaches that require model re-evaluation when changing the computational domains, our trained model is capable of learning solution operator that can approximate physically-consistent scattered pressure field in just a few seconds for arbitrary rigid scatterer shapes; it follows that the computational time for forward simulations can improve (i.e. be reduced) by orders of magnitude in comparison to the traditional forward solvers. In addition, this approach can evaluate the scattered pressure field without the need for labeled training data. After presenting the theoretical approach, a comprehensive numerical study is also provided to illustrate the remarkable ability of this approach to simulate the acoustic pressure fields resulting from arbitrary combinations of arbitrary scatterer geometries. These results highlight the unique generalization capability of the proposed operator learning approach.</description>

      <title>Self-supervised Representations and Node Embedding Graph Neural Networks for Accurate and Multi-scale Analysis of Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.03563v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Supervised machine learning algorithms, such as graph neural networks (GNN), have successfully predicted material properties. However, the superior performance of GNN usually relies on end-to-end learning on large material datasets, which may lose the physical insight of multi-scale information about materials. And the process of labeling data consumes many resources and inevitably introduces errors, which constrains the accuracy of prediction. We propose to train the GNN model by self-supervised learning on the node and edge information of the crystal graph. Compared with the popular manually constructed material descriptors, the self-supervised atomic representation can reach better prediction performance on material properties. Furthermore, it may provide physical insights by tuning the range information. Applying the self-supervised atomic representation on the magnetic moment datasets, we show how they can extract rules and information from the magnetic materials. To incorporate rich physical information into the GNN model, we develop the node embedding graph neural networks (NEGNN) framework and show significant improvements in the prediction performance. The self-supervised material representation and the NEGNN framework may investigate in-depth information from materials and can be applied to small datasets with increased prediction accuracy.</description>

      <title>Predicting The One-Particle Density Matrix With Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06533v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two of the most widely used electronic structure theory methods, namely Hartree-Fock and Kohn-Sham density functional theory, both requires the iterative solution of a set of Schr\"odinger-like equations. The speed of convergence of such self-consistent field process depends on the complexity of the system under investigation and on the initial guess for the density matrix. An initial density matrix close to the ground-state one will effectively allow one to cut out many of the self-consistent steps necessary to achieve convergence. Here, we predict the density matrix of Kohn-Sham density functional theory by constructing a neural network, which uses the atomic positions as only information. Such neural network provides an initial guess for the density matrix far superior to any other recipes available, in particular for molecules with metallic bonds. Furthermore, the quality of such neural-network density matrix is good enough for the evaluation of interatomic forces. This allows us to run accelerated {\it ab-initio} molecular dynamics with little to no self-consistent steps.</description>

Abstract: The unavailability of accurate boundary treatment methods for compressible Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) severely limits its ability to simulate flows in and around bodies. To this end, challenges specific to compressible flows with SPH are carefully considered. Based on these, robust and widely applicable boundary treatment methods for compressible SPH are proposed. These are accompanied by a novel technique to prevent particle penetration at boundaries. The proposed methods are shown to be significantly better than other recent approaches. A wide variety of test problems, many of which are not shown to be simulated with SPH thus far, are employed to highlight the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed methods. The implementation is open source and the results are automated in the interest of reproducibility. Overall, this research contributes to the advancement of SPH as a viable alternative to mesh-based methods for compressible flow simulations.</description>

Abstract: We consider a test problem for Navier-Stokes solvers based on the flow around a cylinder that exhibits chaotic behavior, to examine the behavior of various numerical methods. We choose a range of Reynolds numbers for which the flow is time-dependent but can be characterized as essentially two-dimensional. The problem requires accurate resolution of chaotic dynamics over a long time interval. It also requires the use of a relatively large computational domain, part of which is curved. We review the performance of different finite element methods for the proposed range of Reynolds numbers. These tests indicate that some of the most established methods do not capture the correct behavior. The key requirements identified are pressure-robustness of the method, high resolution, and appropriate numerical dissipation when the smallest scales are under-resolved.</description>

Abstract: Magic angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) presents a fascinating platform for investigating the effects of electron interactions in topological flat bands. The Bistritzer-MacDonald (BM) model provides a simplified quantitative description of the flat bands. Introducing long-range Coulomb interactions leads to an interacting BM (IBM) Hamiltonian, a momentum-space continuum description which offers a very natural starting point for many-body studies of MATBG. Accurate and reliable many-body computations in the IBM model are challenging, however, and have been limited mostly to special fillings, or smaller lattice sizes. We employ state-of-the-art auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) method to study the IBM model, which constrains the sign problem to enable accurate treatment of large system sizes. We determine ground-state properties and quantify errors compared to mean-field theory calculations. Our calculations identify correlated metal states and their competition with the insulating Kramers inter-valley coherent state at both half-filling and charge neutrality. Additionally, we investigate one- and three-quarter fillings, and examine the effect of many-body corrections beyond single Slater determinant solutions. We discuss the effect that details of the IBM Hamiltonian have on the results, including different forms of double-counting corrections, and the need to establish and precisely specify many-body Hamiltonians to allow more direct and quantitative comparisons with experiments in MATBG.</description>
