      <title>Disability, Job Satisfaction, and Workplace Accommodations: Evidence from the Healthcare Industry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose. This paper examines the extent to which job satisfaction, requests for accommodations, and the likelihood of a request being granted vary by disability status. We further analyze whether being granted workplace accommodations moderates the relationship between work satisfaction and disability.
  Methods. We use a novel survey of healthcare workers centered on disability status, perceptions of work experiences, and the provision of accommodations. The data are used in a descriptive analysis and multiple regressions to examine the moderating effect of accommodations on the relationship between disability and indicators related to job satisfaction.
  Results. Results show that people with disabilities have more negative perceptions of their work experiences than people without disabilities. Although people with disabilities are more likely to request accommodations than people without disabilities, they are equally likely to have their requests wholly or partly granted. Regression results indicate that the negative relationships between disability status and most measures of work experience are largely eliminated when accounting for the disposition of accommodation requests. The main exception is turnover intentions, in which the adverse relationship with having a disability does not change even when an accommodation is granted. Partly granting accommodations is helpful only for some metrics of job experience.
  Conclusion. Our paper shows that fully granting accommodations can go a long way to closing the disability gap in job satisfaction between people with and without disabilities.</description>

      <title>Prevalence of Food and Housing Insecurity among Direct Support Professionals in New York</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background. Low earnings are associated with household insecurity. Direct Support Professionals (DSPs) provide support for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities, typically for wages close to state minimums, and may experience insecurity.
  Objective. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the prevalence of food and housing insecurity among DSPs.
  Methods. We conducted a statewide, cross-sectional survey of DSPs in New York State (2022-2023). Measures included detailed questions about food and housing insecurity. We used chi-square analyses and logistic regressions to examine relationships between insecurity and demographic characteristics as proxies for social determinants of health. A total of 4,503 DSPs responded to the survey. The analytic sample contained 2,766 respondents with complete data for all relevant variables.
  Results. Overall, 62.6% experienced food and/or housing insecurity, with over half of those respondents experiencing both. Insecurity was highest among DSPs with a disability (76.2%), DSPs of color (75.7%), and those with lower income (72.4%), but over 50% of DSPs across demographic groups experienced insecurity.
  Conclusions. The widespread insecurity this study demonstrates is an occupational hazard that reduces worker welfare. At the macro-level, household insecurity is a critical threat to the stability of the care and support delivery system. The human services sector is projected to grow rapidly in the future. If growth continues along low wage lines, it implies an equally rapid expansion of worker insecurity. Government action to raise pay and interventions that enhance food and housing security are needed to support workers in the care delivery system for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities.</description>

      <title>The Role of Family Support in the Well-Being of Older People: Evidence from Malaysia and Viet Nam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Demographics in Malaysia and Viet Nam are evolving rapidly, potentially disrupting traditional family support to older people. We estimate a set of Poisson random effects models with panel data from the Malaysia Ageing and Retirement Survey and the Viet Nam Aging Survey to analyze how living arrangements, marital status, and support from children influence the mental and physical health of older people. In Malaysia, having living children plays an important protective role for both mental and physical health, while living with a son appears to have a protective effect for physical health. Results are similar for Viet Nam, except older women, who are at greater risk of mental and physical health problems, appear to enjoy a greater protective effect for their mental health from a child living nearby than do men. Our analysis underscores the importance of social safety nets for the health of senior citizens living alone.</description>

      <title>Intelligence Without Integrity: Why Capable LLMs May Undermine Reliability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As LLMs become embedded in research workflows and organizational decision processes, their effect on analytical reliability remains uncertain. We distinguish two dimensions of analytical reliability -- intelligence (the capacity to reach correct conclusions) and integrity (the stability of conclusions when analytically irrelevant cues about desired outcomes are introduced) -- and ask whether frontier LLMs possess both. Whether these dimensions trade off is theoretically ambiguous: the sophistication enabling accurate analysis may also enable responsiveness to non-evidential cues, or alternatively, greater capability may confer protection through better calibration and discernment. Using synthetically generated data with embedded ground truth, we evaluate fourteen models on a task simulating empirical analysis of hospital merger effects. We find that intelligence and integrity trade off: frontier models most likely to reach correct conclusions under neutral conditions are often most susceptible to shifting conclusions under motivated framing. We extend work on sycophancy by introducing goal-conditioned analytical sycophancy: sensitivity of inference to cues about desired outcomes, even when no belief is asserted and evidence is held constant. Unlike simple prompt sensitivity, models shift conclusions away from objective evidence in response to analytically irrelevant framing. This finding has important implications for empirical research and organizations. Selecting tools based on capability benchmarks may inadvertently select against the stability needed for reliable and replicable analysis.</description>

      <title>Some Simple Economics of AGI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For millennia, human cognition was the primary engine of progress on Earth. As AI decouples cognition from biology, the marginal cost of measurable execution falls to zero, absorbing any labor capturable by metrics--including creative, analytical, and innovative work. The binding constraint on growth is no longer intelligence but human verification bandwidth: the capacity to validate, audit, and underwrite responsibility when execution is abundant. We model the AGI transition as the collision of two racing cost curves: an exponentially decaying Cost to Automate and a biologically bottlenecked Cost to Verify. This structural asymmetry widens a Measurability Gap between what agents can execute and what humans can afford to verify. It also drives a shift from skill-biased to measurability-biased technical change. Rents migrate to verification-grade ground truth, cryptographic provenance, and liability underwriting--the ability to insure outcomes rather than merely generate them. The current human-in-the-loop equilibrium is unstable: eroded from below as apprenticeship collapses (Missing Junior Loop) and from within as experts codify their obsolescence (Codifier's Curse). Unverified deployment becomes privately rational--a Trojan Horse externality. Unmanaged, these forces pull toward a Hollow Economy. Yet by scaling verification alongside agentic capabilities, the forces that threaten collapse become the catalyst for unbounded discovery and experimentation--an Augmented Economy. We derive a practical playbook for individuals, companies, investors, and policymakers. Today's defining challenge is not the race to deploy the most autonomous systems; it is the race to secure the foundations of their oversight. Only by scaling our bandwidth for verification alongside our capacity for execution can we ensure that the intelligence we have summoned preserves the humanity that initiated it.</description>

      <title>Can Interest-Bearing Positions Solve the Long-Horizon Problem in Prediction Markets?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prediction markets suffer from reduced liquidity and price accuracy for long-horizon events due to the opportunity cost of committed capital. Recently, major platforms have introduced interest-bearing positions to mitigate this "long-horizon problem." I evaluate this policy using agent-based simulations with large language model (LLM) traders in a 2 x 2 factorial design, varying time horizon (4 days vs. 2 years) and the presence of interest. While long horizons degrade accuracy, the observed pricing bias (0.72 percentage points) is significantly smaller than theoretical and prior empirical estimates. Paying interest eliminates approximately 83% of the horizon effect on accuracy and more than triples market participation (from 17% to 62% of wealth). These findings suggest the long-horizon problem may be overstated in existing literature and that interest-bearing positions are a highly effective intervention, primarily by incentivizing participation rather than correcting bias.</description>

      <title>A Branch-Price-Cut-And-Switch Approach for Optimizing Team Formation and Routing for Airport Baggage Handling Tasks with Stochastic Travel Times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20912v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In airport operations, optimally using dedicated personnel for baggage handling tasks plays a crucial role in the design of resource-efficient processes. Teams of workers with different qualifications must be formed, and loading or unloading tasks must be assigned to them. Each task has a time window within which it can be started and should be finished. Violating these temporal restrictions incurs severe financial penalties for the operator. In practice, various components of this process are subject to uncertainties. We consider the aforementioned problem under the assumption of time-dependent stochastic travel times across the apron. We present two binary program formulations to model the problem at hand and propose a novel solution approach that we call Branch-Price-Cut-and-Switch, in which we dynamically switch between two master problem formulations. Furthermore, we use an exact separation method to identify violated rank-1 Chv\'atal-Gomory cuts and utilize an efficient branching rule relying on task finish times. We test the algorithm on instances generated based on real-world data from a major European hub airport with a planning horizon of up to two hours, 30 flights per hour, and three available task execution modes to choose from. Our results indicate that our algorithm is able to significantly outperform existing solution approaches. Moreover, an explicit consideration of stochastic travel times allows for solutions that utilize the available workforce more efficiently, while simultaneously guaranteeing a stable service level for the baggage handling operator.</description>

      <title>Causal Claims in Economics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06873v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As economics scales, a key bottleneck is representing what papers claim in a comparable, aggregable form. We introduce evidence-annotated claim graphs that map each paper into a directed network of standardized economic concepts (nodes) and stated relationships (edges), with each edge labeled by evidentiary basis, including whether it is supported by causal inference designs or by non-causal evidence. Using a structured multi-stage AI workflow, we construct claim graphs for 44,852 economics papers from 1980-2023. The share of causal edges rises from 7.7% in 1990 to 31.7% in 2020. Measures of causal narrative structure and causal novelty are positively associated with top-five publication and long-run citations, whereas non-causal counterparts are weakly related or negative.</description>

      <title>Managing Procurement Auction Failure: Bid Requirements or Reserve Prices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03996v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper examines bid requirements, where the government may cancel a procurement contract unless two or more bids are received. Using a first-price auction model with endogenous entry, we compare the bid requirement and reserve price mechanisms in terms of auction failure and procurement costs. We find that, in comparison with bid requirements, reserve prices can reduce procurement costs and substantially lower failure probabilities, especially when entry costs are high or signals are sufficiently informative. Bid requirements are more likely to result in zero entry, while reserve prices can sustain positive entry under broader conditions.</description>

      <title>How much does context affect the accuracy of AI health advice?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18310v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to provide health advice, yet evidence on how their accuracy varies across languages, topics and information sources remains limited. We assess how linguistic and contextual factors affect the accuracy of AI-based health-claim verification. We evaluated seven widely used LLMs on two datasets: (i) 1,975 legally authorised nutrition and health claims from UK and EU regulatory registers translated into 21 languages; and (ii) 9,088 journalist-vetted public-health claims from the PUBHEALTH corpus spanning COVID-19, abortion, politics and general health, drawn from government advisories, scientific abstracts and media sources. Models classified each claim as supported or unsupported using majority voting across repeated runs. Accuracy was analysed by language, topic, source and model. Accuracy on authorised claims was highest in English and closely related European languages and declined in several widely spoken non-European languages, decreasing with syntactic distance from English. On real-world public-health claims, accuracy was substantially lower and varied systematically by topic and source. Models performed best on COVID-19 and government-attributed claims and worst on general health and scientific abstracts. High performance on English, canonical health claims masks substantial context-dependent gaps. Differences in training data exposure, editorial framing and topic-specific tuning likely contribute to these disparities, which are comparable in magnitude to cross-language differences. LLM accuracy in health-claim verification depends strongly on language, topic and information source. English-language performance does not reliably generalise across contexts, underscoring the need for multilingual, domain-specific evaluation before deployment in public-health communication.</description>

      <title>Preventive Care Disruptions and Emergency Hospitalizations: Evidence from COVID-19 and SHARE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18342v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study whether disruptions to preventive care during the first wave of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic affected subsequent acute hospital use. Using the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe from eight countries, we focus on women aged 50-69, the target group for organized breast cancer screening. The outcome is an indicator for any all-cause emergency overnight hospitalization in the prior twelve months. To address selection into screening, we use an instrumental variables design based on six interview-month cohorts in Wave 9 (March-August 2022) interacted with country indicators. Because mammography is reported over a two-year recall window anchored to the interview month, these cohort-by-country interactions shift how much of the March-August 2020 restriction period falls inside the recall window, generating variation in mammography uptake across cohorts within countries. The estimates imply that mammography reduces emergency overnight hospitalization by about six percentage points. No effect appears among women aged 70 and above. Results are robust to controls, disruption measures, and falsification tests.</description>
