      <title>Angular Resolution Enhancement of Electron Backscatter Diffraction Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a simple 'shift-and-add' based improvement in the angular resolution of single electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) patterns. Sub-pixel image registration is used to measure the (sub-pixel) difference in projection parameters for patterns collected within a map, and then the pattern is shifted and added together. The resultant EBSD-pattern is shown to contain more angular information than a long-exposure single pattern, via 2D Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)-based analysis. In particular, this method has the potential to enhance the scope of small compact direct electron detectors (DEDs).</description>

      <title>Development of a microwave SQUID multiplexer for magnetic microbolometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The search for primordial B-modes in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) requires highly sensitive and scalable detector systems. The magnetic microbolometer (MMB) is an emerging detector concept that exploits the magnetic properties of paramagnetic materials at sub-kelvin temperatures, offering bolometers with a high dynamic range and low intrinsic noise. In recent years, the microwave SQUID multiplexer ($\mu$MUX) has become a key technology to efficiently read large low temperature detector arrays, enabling the readout of hundreds to thousands of detectors over a single transmission line with low noise and minimal power dissipation while reducing the cryogenic setup complexity. In this work, we report the design, fabrication and characterization of a $\mu$MUX optimized for MMB detectors and share our latest experimental results from a bolometer prototype. These findings provide valuable insight of the $\mu$MUX in advancing next-generation CMB instrumentation and also demonstrate its suitability for novel detector technologies such as the MMB.</description>

      <title>Microwave SQUID Multiplexer Readout Performance Using a Direct-RF RFSoC-Based Software-Defined Radio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we report the experimental readout results of a {\mu}MUX device using a Direct-RF SDR prototype based on the ZCU216 Radio-Frequency System-on-Chip (RFSoC) evaluation board. First, the analog performance of the SDR system was evaluated both in loopback and coupled to the cryogenic multiplexing system. Then, the SDR system performance was optimized for {\mu}MUX readout, focusing on bolometric applications. Finally, the minimum demodulated flux noise was obtained through the optimally conditioned readout of a {\mu}MUX channel. The results presented are comparable to those obtained with traditional SDR architectures and demonstrate that the Direct-RF SDR prototype is suitable for the readout of {\mu}MUX devices. We anticipate that Direct-RF SDR technology will play a key role in enabling the next generation of SDR readout systems for frequency-multiplexed low-temperature detector arrays.</description>

      <title>Wafer-Level Prototyping Tools for CMOS Bioelectronic Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrating biology with complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) sensors can enable highly parallel measurements with minimal parasitic effects, significantly enhancing sensitivity. However, realizing this potential often requires overcoming substantial barriers related to design, fabrication, and heterogeneous integration. In this context, we present a comprehensive suite of tools and methods designed for wafer-scale biosensor prototyping that is sensitive, highly parallelizable, and manufacturable. A central component of our approach is a new initiative that allows for open-source multi-project wafers (MPW), giving all participants access to the designs submitted by others. We demonstrate that this strategy not only promotes design reuse but also facilitates advanced back-end-of-line (BEOL) fabrication techniques, improving the manufacturability and process yield of CMOS biosensors. Developing CMOS-based biosensors also involves the challenge of heterogeneous integration, which includes external electrical, mechanical, and fluid layers. We demonstrate simple modular designs that enable such integration for sample delivery and signal readout. Finally, we showcase the effectiveness of our approach in measuring the hybridization of DNA molecules by focusing on data acquisition and machine learning (ML) methods that leverage the parallelism of the sensors to enable robust classification of desirable analyte interactions.</description>

      <title>Laboratory and Synchrotron Validation of $\mu$-XRF for Sulfur Mapping in CTMP Paper Samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transition toward renewable, fiber-based packaging requires an improved understanding of chemical modifications in high-yield pulps such as chemithermomechanical pulp (CTMP). Sulfonation uniformity is essential for the energy-efficient production of high-strength CTMP pulp. However, laboratory methods only measure total sulfur and cannot illustrate its distribution at the fiber level, which can be visualized using $\mu$-XRF. In this work, we present a laboratory $\mu$-XRF system developed at Mid Sweden University and assess its capability to detect light elements in CTMP paper handsheets. A 32 $\times$ 32 point grid scan (1.6-1.6 mm$^2$ field of view, 50 $\mu$m step, 300 s/point) successfully resolved sulfur K$\alpha$ (2.31 keV) and calcium K$\alpha$ (3.69 keV) fluorescence without helium flushing. Comparative measurements at the Elettra synchrotron confirmed consistency of sulfur peak position and spatial distribution, with higher spectral resolution and signal-to-noise ratio. Histogram analysis using Wasserstein distance metrics demonstrated close agreement between datasets despite differing acquisition conditions. These results demonstrate that laboratory XRF can reproducibly detect and map sulfur in CTMP fibers under ambient conditions, providing a practical tool to complement synchrotron studies and supporting the development of energy-efficient, fiber-based packaging materials.</description>

      <title>The development of a high granular crystal calorimeter prototype of VLAST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Very Large Area gamma-ray Space Telescope (VLAST) is the next-generation flagship space observatory for high-energy gamma-ray detection proposed by China. The observation energy range covers from MeV to TeV and beyond, with acceptance of 10 m^2sr. The calorimeter serves as a crucial subdetector of VLAST, responsible for high-precision energy measurement and electron/proton discrimination. This discrimination capability is essential for accurately identifying gamma-ray events among the background of charged particles. To accommodate such an extensive energy range, a high dynamic range readout scheme employing dual avalanche photodiodes (APDs) has been developed, achieving a remarkable dynamic range of 10^6. Furthermore, a high granular prototype based on bismuth germanate (BGO) cubic scintillation crystals has been developed. This high granularity enables detailed imaging of the particle showers, improving both energy resolution and particle identification. The prototype's performance is evaluated through cosmic ray testing, providing valuable data for optimizing the final calorimeter design for VLAST.</description>

      <title>Single-shot, simultaneous spatially resolved polarimetry and wavefront sensing with stress engineered optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an experimental test of the use of stress engineered optics incorporated into a Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor in such a way that the shape of the point spread function (PSF) provides polarization information while the displacement of the PSF gives information about the local wavefront gradient, allowing a reconstruction of the wavefront gradient. Using calibrated polarizations and wavefront tilts we construct a measurement matrix capable of reconstructing both the Stokes parameters and the wavefront, yielding a measurement of wavefront gradients as small as 100 $\mu$rad with a polarimetric angular error of approximately 0.1 radians on the Poincar\'e sphere in a single frame measurement.</description>

      <title>Ultralow-Temperature Cryogenic Transmission Electron Microscopy Using a New Helium Flow Cryostat Stage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advances in cryogenic electron microscopy have opened new avenues for probing quantum phenomena in correlated materials. This study reports the installation and performance of a new side-entry condenZero cryogenic cooling system for JEOL (Scanning) Transmission Electron Microscopes (S/TEM), utilizing compressed liquid helium (LHe) and designed for imaging and spectroscopy at ultra-low temperatures. The system includes an external dewar mounted on a vibration-damping stage and a pressurized, low-noise helium transfer line with a remotely controllable needle valve, ensuring stable and efficient LHe flow with minimal thermal and mechanical noise. Performance evaluation demonstrates a stable base temperature of 6.58 K measured using a Cernox bare chip sensor on the holder with temperature fluctuations within 0.04 K. Complementary in-situ electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) via aluminum bulk plasmon analysis was used to measure the local specimen temperature and validate cryogenic operation during experiments. The integration of cryogenic cooling with other microscopy techniques, including electron diffraction and Lorentz TEM, was demonstrated by resolving charge density wave (CDW) transitions in NbSe2 using electron diffraction, and imaging nanometric magnetic skyrmions in MnSi via Lorentz TEM. This platform provides reliable cryogenic operation below 7 K, establishing a low-drift route for direct visualization of electronic and magnetic phase transformations in quantum materials.</description>

      <title>CHRONOS: Cryogenic sub-Hz cROss torsion bar detector with quantum NOn-demolition Speed meter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a next-generation ground-based gravitational-wave detector, the Cryogenic sub-Hz cROss torsion-bar detector with quantum NOn-demolition Speed meter (CHRONOS), optimized for the unexplored 0.1-10Hz band bridging the gap between the space-based LISA and future ground-based detectors such as Cosmic Explorer and the Einstein Telescope. CHRONOS combines a ring-cavity Sagnac interferometer with torsion-bar test masses to realize the first quantum nondemolition (QND) measurement of angular momentum in a macroscopic system. By implementing a speed-meter readout in the rotational degree of freedom, CHRONOS coherently cancels quantum radiation-pressure noise and enables sub-Hz observations. We show that detuned power recycling and cavity-length optimization can simultaneously relax technical requirements on both torsion bars and speed meters. Assuming a realistic optical design with a 1m torsion bar, we estimate strain sensitivities of $h \simeq 1 \times 10^{-18}\mathrm{Hz}^{-1/2}$ at 1Hz for detectors with arm lengths of 2.5m, 40m, and 300m. These sensitivities enable (i) direct detection of intermediate-mass black hole binaries up to 380Mpc with ${\rm SNR}=3$, (ii) probing stochastic gravitational-wave backgrounds down to $\Omega_{\rm GW} \sim 3.2 \times 10^{-9}$ at 0.2Hz with 5yr accumulation. Furthermore, CHRONOS enables prompt detection of gravity-gradient signals from magnitude-5.5 earthquakes even with a 2.5m prototype. CHRONOS thus opens new opportunities for quantum-limited geophysical observation and multi-band, multi-messenger gravitational-wave astronomy.</description>

Abstract: Low-temperature systems play a vital role in a variety of scientific research applications, including the next generation of cosmology and astrophysics telescopes. More ambitious cryogenic applications require precise estimates of the thermal conductivity of materials and thermal joints to meet project goals. We present the development of the Cryogenic Material Repository (CMR), a public GitHub repository of cryogenic material properties data created to support and enable researchers across scientific disciplines to accurately and efficiently design and assess cryogenic systems.

      <title>Bromine-methanol etching of semiconductor crystals $Cd_{1-x}Zn_{x}Te_{1-y}Se_{y}$ with different selenium concentrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effect of the selenium concentration in the composition of the $Cd_{1-x}Zn_{x}Te_{1-y}Se_{y}$ semiconductor crystals on their etching with a bromine-methanol solution was studied. A thermodynamic model is proposed to describe the degree of etching of $Cd_{1-x}Zn_{x}Te$ and $Cd_{1-x}Zn_{x}Te_{1-y}Se_{y}$ crystals. A thermodynamic law is obtained for the first time to describe the change in the etching rate of $Cd_{1-x}Zn_{x}Te_{1-y}Se_{y}$ crystals with different selenium concentrations. Experimental dependencies are constructed for etching trajectories and etching rates with 5% bromine-methanol solutions of $Cd_{1-x}Zn_{x}Te_{1-y}Se_{y}$ crystal samples with nominal $x\sim 0.1$ and selenium concentrations of $y=0$, $y=0.02$, $y=0.06$, and $y=0.1$. The average etching rates were 24${\mu }$m/min, 18${\mu }$m/min, 15${\mu }$m/min, and 13${\mu }$m/min. The threshold effect of a strong decrease in the etching rate upon transition from ternary $Cd_{1-x}Zn_{x}Te$ to quaternary $Cd_{1-x}Zn_{x}Te_{1-y}Se_{y}$ crystals, associated with hardening of the crystal structure, is identify and theoretically explained. The obtained experimental data are in good agreement with the theoretical estimates and will be useful for choosing the optimal regimes of crystal treatment.</description>

      <title>Broadband Magnetless Isolator using Adiabatic Flux Modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Isolators are commonly found in the amplification chain of microwave setups to shield sensitive devices such as superconducting qubits from noise and back-scattered signals. Conventional ferrite-based isolators are bulky, lossy and rely on strong magnetic fields, which pose challenges for their co-integration in large-scale superconducting devices. Here, we present a magnetless isolator that overcomes these limitations with simulated performances on par with the state-of-the-art. Using a dispersion-engineered transmission line with a propagating adiabatic flux modulation, the simulated device achieves more than 20 dB isolation over a broad frequency band ranging from 4 to 8 GHz, which can be modified based on the device parameters. Moreover, we propose a compact, low-loss, on-chip superconducting device that shows promise against parameter variations and enables a scalable path for co-integration with large-scale superconducting systems of the future.</description>

      <title>Magnetic dipole-dipole transition for scintillation quenching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11361v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A magnetic dipole-dipole interaction is proposed as a scintillation quenching mechanism. The interaction rate follows $R^{-6}$ as the electric dipole-dipole interaction in F$\mathrm{\ddot{o}}$ster resonance energy transfer theory. The proposed mechanism causes a long-range resonance energy transfer, and the resonance condition is that the spins of donor and acceptor electrons both flip, and the energy level differences are the same. The new mechanism is distinct to the known spin-orbit coupling induced intersystem crossing, and it can enhance the overall intersystem crossing rate. When oxygen or organic molecules including heavy elements are dissolved in a liquid scintillator, these requirements are possible to be satisfied. The proposal in the paper adds a new approach for scintillation quenching in liquid scintillators.</description>

While typically negligible, this contribution - known as intrinsic resolution (IR) - presents significant challenges for both experimental measurement and Monte Carlo simulation. Using the phenomenological model proposed in~[1], we interpreted multiple datasets of IR measurements in organic scintillators. Although our results generally agree with the IR dataset examined in~[1], a comprehensive evaluation of systematic uncertainties highlights the necessity for more detailed investigation. Based on our findings, we offer specific recommendations for future measurements.</description>

      <title>First Event-by-Event Identification of Cherenkov Radiation from Sub-MeV Particles in Liquid Argon</title>

Abstract: This Letter reports the event-by-event observation of Cherenkov light from sub-MeV electrons in a high scintillation light-yield liquid argon (LAr) detector by the Coherent CAPTAIN-Mills (CCM) experiment. The CCM200 detector, located at Los Alamos National Laboratory, instruments 7 tons (fiducial volume) of LAr with 200 8-inch photomultiplier tubes (PMTs), 80% of which are coated in a wavelength shifting material and the remaining 20% are uncoated. In the prompt time region of an event, defined as $-6 \leq t &lt; 0$ ns relative to the event start time $t=0$, the uncoated PMTs are primarily sensitive to visible Cherenkov photons. Using gamma-rays from a $^{22}$Na source for production of sub-MeV electrons, we isolated prompt Cherenkov light with $&gt;5\sigma$ confidence and developed a selection to obtain a low-background electromagnetic sample. This is the first event-by-event observation of Cherenkov photons from sub-MeV electrons in a high-yield scintillator detector, and represents a milestone in low-energy particle detector development.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the Liquid Argon Scintillation Pulse Shape Using Differentiable Simulation in the Coherent CAPTAIN-Mills Experiment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08887v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Coherent CAPTAIN-Mills (CCM) experiment is a liquid argon (LAr) light collection detector searching for MeV-scale neutrino and Beyond Standard Model physics signatures. Two hundred 8-inch photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) instrument the 7 ton fiducial volume with 50% photocathode coverage to detect light produced by charged particles. CCM's light-based approach reduces requirements of LAr purity, compared to other detection technologies, such that sub-MeV particles can be reliably detected without additional LAr filtration and with O(1) parts-per-million of common contaminants. We present a measurement of LAr light production and propagation parameters, with uncertainties, obtained from a sample of MeV-scale electromagnetic events. The optimization of this high-dimensional parameter space was facilitated by a differentiable optical photon Monte-Carlo simulation, and detailed PMT response characterization. This result accurately predicts the timing and spatial distribution of light due to scintillation and Cherenkov emission in the detector. This is the first description of photon propagation in LAr to include several effects, including: anomalous dispersion of the index of refraction near the ultraviolet resonance, Mie scattering from impurities, and Cherenkov light production.</description>

      <title>Wavelength-tunable femtosecond pulsed laser for the characterisation of solid-state sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01546v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Two-Photon Absorption (TPA) process provides an excellent method for the characterisation of solid-state sensors due to its intrinsic 3D resolution for the excitation of electron-hole pairs. This paper presents the commissioning of a system composed of a Light Conversion PHAROS laser read out with an ORPHEUS optical parametric amplifier with tuneable output wavelength across $310-16000$ nm. This is one of the few facilities suitable for particle physics detector applications with a very wide wavelength range and ultra short pulses. The voxel characterisation shows a Rayleigh length of $12.20 \pm 0.47$ $~\mu$m and the beam radius at the waist of $1.53 \pm 0.04$$~\mu$m. Initial measurements with silicon and diamond samples are described. The apparatus is characterised with both devices, demonstrating the expected quadratic dependency with the energy per pulse, and different models are presented to explain the signal generated due to reflection. The signal generated in the silicon diode is in good agreement with one dimension voxel model predictions.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Electromagnetic Calorimeter Module: Enhanced Performance through Integration of Silicon Pixel Layer into Scintillator Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17997v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study constructs a hybrid module with a multi-material collaborative detection architecture by integrating silicon pixel layers into the longitudinally segmented scintillating fiber sampling calorimeter module and optimizes the placement of the silicon layers. The module utilizes the pre-shower characteristics of the front-end scintillator units to ensure sufficient energy deposition in the silicon pixel layers, thereby maintaining its high-precision detection capability. A dedicated simulation framework combining Geant4 modeling for the scintillator section and a parameterized approach for the silicon pixel layer is employed for module verification and performance study. The hybrid module demonstrates overall performance enhancement. The maximum achievable improvements are 56% for position resolution and 26% for time resolution, respectively. These advancements also lead to significant increase of physics sensitivity, especially for physics channels with low-energy photons, for instance, a 16% boost in signal significance for $D^{*0}$ from the $B^-\rightarrow D^{*0}(\rightarrow D^0 \gamma)\pi^-$ decay.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20390v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report results of optical characterizations of new wavelength-shifting and scintillating-wavelength-shifting fibers EJ-182 and EJ-160 from Eljen Technology and compare them to the wavelength-shifting fiber BCF-91A from Saint-Gobain. The wavelength-dependence of attenuation was derived from spectral measurements confirming that the long attenuation length increases with wavelength, while short attenuation effects become less significant at longer wavelengths. The impact of environmental refractive index was measured by immersing a fiber in water. Immersing the fibers in water reduced the light yield and led to a suppression of the short attenuation length, consistent with the expected decrease in the refractive index contrast.</description>

      <title>Development of advanced photon calibrator for Kamioka gravitational wave detector (KAGRA)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.12180v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Kamioka Gravitational wave detector (KAGRA) cryogenic gravitational-wave observatory has commenced joint observations with the worldwide gravitational wave detector network. Precise calibration of the detector response is essential for accurately estimating parameters of gravitational wave sources. A photon calibrator is a crucial calibration tool used in laser interferometer gravitational-wave observatory, Virgo, and KAGRA, and it was utilized in joint observation 3 with GEO600 in Germany in April 2020. In this paper, KAGRA implemented three key enhancements: a high-power laser, a power stabilization system, and remote beam position control. KAGRA employs a 20 W laser divided into two beams that are injected onto the mirror surface. By utilizing a high-power laser, the response of the detector at kHz frequencies can be calibrated. To independently control the power of each laser beam, an optical follower servo was installed for power stabilization. The optical path of the photon calibrator beam positions was controlled using pico-motors, allowing for the characterization of the detector rotation response. Additionally, a telephoto camera and quadrant photodetectors were installed to monitor beam positions, and beam position control was implemented to optimize the mirror response. In this paper, we discuss the statistical errors associated with the measurement of relative power noise. We also address systematic errors related to the power calibration model of the photon calibrator and the simulation of elastic deformation effects using finite element analysis. Ultimately, we have successfully reduced the total systematic error from the photon calibrator to 2.0 /%.</description>

      <title>Calculation and comparison of sensitivities in $0\nu\beta\beta$ experiments based on key parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03548v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Worldwide efforts are underway to detect neutrinoless double beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay using experiments based on various technologies and target isotopes. Future experiments in this regard aim to exclude the inverted order (IO) condition or explore the normal order (NO) band. Consequently, comparing the sensitivities of proposed $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay experiments with promising prospects is essential. The current study adopts sensitivity metrics, including exclusion and discovery sensitivities, half-life sensitivities, and $m_{\beta\beta}$ sensitivities, to provide a comprehensive evaluation of ten typical promising experiments: LEGEND, CDEX, nEXO, XLZD, PandaX, NEXT, KamLAND-Zen, JUNO, SNO+, and CUPID, and highlight their unique features. Based on reported experimental parameters, the concept of a ``technical line'' is introduced to determine the location that each experiment may realize in the $\xi$ and $\lambda_{b}$ space, where $\xi$ represents the sensitive exposure per year, and $\lambda_{b}$ denotes the expected annual rate of background events. Half-life sensitivities for the selected experiments are calculated, some of them in multiple phases and others in conservative or aggressive condition. The results indicate that increasing the operation time is more beneficial for zero-background experiments, which also demonstrate greater competitiveness in discovery sensitivity. $m_{\beta\beta}$ sensitivities are presented as uncertainty bands arising from the nuclear matrix element uncertainties. Additionally, half-life and $m_{\beta\beta}$ sensitivities are estimated under ideal conditions also in the form of uncertainty bands, where only irreducible $2\nu\beta\beta$ and solar B-8 neutrino induced background remain.</description>

      <title>The Imaging Time-of-Propagation Detector at Belle II</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19090v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report on the construction, operation, and performance of the Time-of-Propagation detector with imaging used for the Belle II experiment running at the Super-KEKB $e^+e^-$ collider. This detector is located in the central barrel region and uses Cherenkov light to provide particle identification among hadrons. The Cherenkov light is radiated in highly polished bars of synthetic fused silica (quartz) and transported to the ends of the bars via total internal reflection. One bar end is instrumented with finely segmented micro-channel-plate photomultiplier tubes to record the light, while the other end has a mirror attached to reflect the photons back to the instrumented end. Both the propagation times and hit positions of the Cherenkov photons are measured; these depend on the Cherenkov angle and together provide good discrimination among charged pions, kaons, and protons with momenta up to around 4 GeV/$c$. To date, the detector has been used to record and analyze almost 600 fb$^{-1}$ of Belle II data.</description>

      <title>Adjusting optical cavity birefringence with wavelength tunable laser for axion searches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06770v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Axions have attracted attention as promising candidates for dark matter (DM). Although axions have been intensively searched for, they have not been observed yet. Recently, novel experiments to search for axion DM have been proposed that use optical cavities to amplify polarization rotation of laser light induced by the axion-photon interaction. One such experiment employs a ring cavity composed of four mirrors. However, its sensitivity to the axion-photon coupling $g_{a\gamma}$ in the low axion mass region is limited due to a reflection phase difference between s- and p-polarizations. In this paper, we propose a new method to improve the sensitivity using zero-phase shift mirrors and a wavelength tunable laser. Moreover, the laser makes it easier to scan the high axion mass region by tuning the reflection phase difference between s- and p-polarizations. We experimentally confirmed that the phase difference generated upon reflection on a zero phase shift mirror satisfied the requirement of $8.6 \times 10^{-3}~\mathrm{deg}$, which corresponds to the half width at half maximum (HWHM) of the cavity for p-polarization with the mirror fixed on a folded cavity and a wavelength tunable laser.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21415v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe an apparatus that efficiently produces $^{23}$Na Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) in a hybrid trap that combines a quadrupole magnetic field with a far-detuned optical dipole trap. Using a Bayesian optimization framework, we systematically optimize all BEC production parameters in modest sized batches of highly correlated parameters. Furthermore, we introduce a Lagrange multiplier-based technique to optimize the duration of different evaporation stages constrained to have a fixed total duration; this enables the progressive creation of increasingly rapid experimental sequences that still generate high quality BECs. Taken together, our techniques constitute a general approach for refining and accelerating sequence-based experimental protocols.</description>

      <title>First positronium imaging using $^{44}$Sc with the J-PET scanner: a case study on the NEMA-Image Quality phantom</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07230v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Positronium Lifetime Imaging (PLI), an emerging extension of conventional positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, offers a novel window for probing the submolecular properties of biological tissues by imaging the mean lifetime of the positronium atom. Currently, the method is under rapid development in terms of reconstruction and detection systems. Recently, the first in vivo PLI of the human brain was performed using the J-PET scanner utilizing the $^{68}$Ga isotope. However, this isotope has limitations due to its comparatively low prompt gamma yields, which is crucial for positronium lifetime measurement. Among alternative radionuclides, $^{44}$Sc stands out as a promising isotope for PLI, characterized by a clinically suitable half-life (4.04 hours) emitting 1157 keV prompt gamma in 100% cases after the emission of the positron. This study reports the first experimental demonstration of PLI with $^{44}$Sc, carried out on a NEMA-Image Quality (IQ) phantom using the Modular J-PET tomograph-the first plastic scintillators-based PET scanner.</description>

Abstract: The Fast Beam Condition Monitor (FBCM) is a standalone luminometer for the High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) program of the CMS Experiment at CERN. The detector is under development and features a new, radiation-hard, front-end application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) designed for beam monitoring applications. The achieved timing resolution of a few nanoseconds enables the measurement of both the luminosity and the beam-induced background. The ASIC, called FBCM23, features six channels with adjustable shaping times, enabling in-field fine-tuning. Each ASIC channel outputs a single binary asynchronous signal encoding time of arrival and time over threshold information. The FBCM is based on silicon-pad sensors, with two sensor designs presently being considered. This paper presents the results of tests of the FBCM detector prototype using both types of silicon sensors with hadron, muon, and electron beams. Irradiated FBCM23 ASICs and silicon-pad sensors were also tested to simulate the expected conditions near the end of the detector's lifetime in the HL-LHC radiation environment. Based on test results, direct bonding between the sensor and ASIC was chosen, and an optimal bias voltage and ASIC threshold for FBCM operation were proposed. The current design of the front-end test board was validated following the beam test and is now being used for the first front-end module, which is expected to be produced in summer 2025. These results represent a major step forward in validating the FBCM concept, first version of the firmware and establishing a reliable design path for the final detector.</description>
