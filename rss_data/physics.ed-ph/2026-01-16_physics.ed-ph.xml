      <title>Studying Impact and Intent of Design: Conjecture Mapping for Affect-Centered Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics education researchers have argued that authentic physics education includes computation as part of a physics student's training, and many parties have made efforts towards this goal. However, most research on this teaching modality has centered cognitive impacts rather than affective impacts, so little is known about the affective outcomes of holistically integrating computation into physics courses. To address that need, we present a case study of a multi-day activity within a computationally integrated modern physics laboratory course. Based on course observations and interviews with the professor of and a student in the course, we distinguish between the professor's intent behind the activity design and the impact on the student's physics computational literacy and physics identity with a novel modification of conjecture mapping that explicates how a student enacts the professor's expectations. In doing so, we highlight the methodological suitability of conjecture mapping for comparing the intent and impact of curricular design and explicate the specific misalignments that led to different affective outcomes than intended.</description>

      <title>aiPlato: A Novel AI Tutoring and Step-wise Feedback System for Physics Homework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This exploratory study examines the classroom deployment of aiPlato, an AI-enabled homework platform, in a large introductory physics course at the University of Texas at Arlington. Designed to support open-ended problem solving, aiPlato provides step-wise feedback and iterative guidance through tools such as "Evaluate My Work" and "AI Tutor Chat", while preserving opportunities for productive struggle. Over four optional extra-credit assignments, the platform captured detailed student interaction data, which were analyzed alongside course performance and end-of-semester survey responses. We examine how students engaged with different feedback tools, whether engagement patterns were associated with performance on the cumulative final exam, and how students perceived the platform's usability and learning value. Students who engaged more frequently with aiPlato tended to achieve higher final exam scores, with a mean difference corresponding to a standardized effect size of approximately 0.81 between high and low engagement groups after controlling for prior academic performance. Usage patterns and survey responses indicate that students primarily relied on iterative, formative feedback rather than solution-revealing assistance. As a quasi-experimental pilot study, these findings do not establish causality and may reflect self-selection effects. Nonetheless, the results demonstrate the feasibility of integrating AI-mediated, step-wise feedback into authentic physics homework and motivate future controlled studies of AI-assisted tutoring systems.</description>

      <title>Same Activity, Divergent Impacts: Representing Paths Towards Physics Computational Literacy and Physics Identity with Conjecture Mapping-Based Narrative Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrating computation into physics teaching is a curricular move that, at present, has been predominately studied for its cognitive impacts. However, if this modality of instruction shifts how students engage with physics, we argue there is room for students to redefine what it means to do physics and how they perceive themselves relative to the field. To investigate this, we situate a comparative case study in the context of a computationally integrated physics course. We study two students' experiences with a multi-day activity to understand how and why they came to affectively divergent self-perceptions. We propose a modified use of conjecture mapping to visualize the production of affective outcomes and connect narrative analysis to activity design. Our analysis highlights how different interpretations of and engagement with activity design reflect students' epistemic framing of code, which, in turn, drives engagement with scaffolding in manners that shape self-perception.</description>

      <title>Systemically Designed Degrees for Real-World Challenges: A case study on Physics curriculum design at Loughborough University</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a ground-up redesign of the undergraduate physics degree at Loughborough University, driven by the principle of authenticity in academic and industrial practice. Departing from conventional incremental reforms, we adopt a systems-engineering approach to programme-level curriculum design, treating the degree as an integrated system with verifiable performance. This methodology aligns stakeholder-derived requirements with vertically-integrated threads in theory, computation, laboratory practice, and professional skills. We demonstrate that this approach enables students to achieve levels of disciplinary and cross-disciplinary competence beyond those typically expected at undergraduate level. Outcomes are supported by graduate destinations, enhanced student performance, and positive external evaluations, including national accreditation. Our results suggest that rigorous, system-level curriculum design can yield transformational gains in both capability and confidence.</description>
