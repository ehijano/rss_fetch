      <title>Vibronic correlations in molecular strong field dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate ultrafast vibronic dynamics triggered by intense femtosecond infrared pulses in small molecules. Our study is based on numerical simulations performed with 2D model molecules, and analyzed in the perspective of the renown Lochfrass and Bond-Softening models. We give a new interpretation of the observed nuclear wave packet dynamics, with a focus on the phase of the bond oscillations. Our simulations also reveal intricate features in the field-induced nuclear motion that are not accounted for by existing models. Our analyses assign these features to strong dynamic correlations between the active electron and the nuclei, which significantly depend on the carrier envelope phase of the pulse, even for relatively ``long'' pulses, which should make them experimentally observable.</description>

      <title>Towards the superlubricity of polymer-steel interfaces with ionic liquids and carbon nanotubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frictional losses are responsible for significant energy waste in many practical applications, and superlubricity with a coefficient of friction lower than 0.01 is the goal of tribologists. In this paper, metal-on-polymer contact was analysed and close to superlubricity conditions for this material configuration were explored. A new lubricant has been proposed hinge on the phosphorus-based ionic liquid and carbon nanotubes as thickeners. Additionally, carbon nanotube mesh was doped with copper nanoparticles that allowed for the close to superlubricity state in a mild steel/polymer contact configuration under low normal load conditions. The adsorption of phosphorus onto metallic and polymer surfaces has been reported in EDS analysis. The formulation of the new lubricant allowed for stable dispersion with a carbon nanotube content as low as 0.1% wt. The carbon nanotubes and Cu nanoparticles have been analysed using TEM and SEM imaging. A tribological test in a block-on-ring system has been carried out. The wear of material, topography, and surface free energy have been analysed along with SEM/EDS images to explore the underlying mechanisms of friction and wear.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Conical Intersections Without Explicit Use of Non-Adiabatic Couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present two alternative methods for optimizing minimum energy conical intersection (MECI) molecular geometries without knowledge of the derivative coupling (DC). These methods are based on the utilization of Lagrange multipliers: i) one method uses an approximate calculation of the DC, while the other ii) do not require the DC. Both methods use the fact that information of the DC is contained in the Hessian of the squared energy difference. Tests done on a set of small molecular systems, in comparison with other methods, show the ability of the proposed methods to optimize MECIs. Finally, we apply the methods to the furimamide molecule, to optimize and characterize its S$_1$ /S$_2$ MECI, and to optimizing the S$_0$ /S$_1$ MECI of the silver trimer.</description>

      <title>Predicting long timescale kinetics under variable experimental conditions with Kinetica.jl</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting the degradation processes of molecules over long timescales is a key aspect of industrial materials design. However, it is made computationally challenging by the need to construct large networks of chemical reactions that are relevant to the experimental conditions that kinetic models must mirror, with every reaction requiring accurate kinetic data. Here we showcase Kinetica.jl, a new software package for constructing large-scale chemical reaction networks in a fully-automated fashion by exploring chemical reaction space with a kinetics-driven algorithm; coupled to efficient machine-learning models of activation energies for sampled elementary reactions, we show how this approach readily enables generation and kinetic characterization of networks containing $\sim10^{3}$ chemical species and $10^{4}$ - $10^{5}$ reactions. Symbolic-numeric modelling of the generated reaction networks is used to allow for flexible, efficient computation of kinetic profiles under experimentally-realizable conditions such as continuously-variable temperature regimes, enabling direct connection between bottom-up reaction networks and experimental observations. Highly efficient propagation of long-timescale kinetic profiles is required for automated reaction network refinement and is enabled here by a new discrete kinetic approximation. The resulting Kinetica.jl simulation package therefore enables automated generation, characterization, and long-timescale modelling of complex chemical reaction systems. We demonstrate this for hydrocarbon pyrolysis simulated over timescales of seconds, using transient temperature profiles representing those of tubular flow reactor experiments.</description>

      <title>Isotope effects in supercooled H$_2$O and D$_2$O and a corresponding-states-like rescaling of the temperature and pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Water shows anomalous properties that are enhanced upon supercooling. The unusual behavior is observed in both H$_2$O and D$_2$O, however with different temperature dependences for the two isotopes. It is often noted that comparing the properties of the isotopes at two different temperatures (i.e., a temperature shift) approximately accounts for many of the observations with a temperature shift of 7.2 K in the temperature of maximum density being the most well-known example. However, the physical justification for such a shift is unclear. Motivated by recent work demonstrating a corresponding-states-like rescaling for water properties in three classical water models that all exhibit a liquid-liquid transition and critical point (B. Uralcan, et al., J. Chem. Phys. 150, 064503 (2019)), the applicability of this approach for reconciling the differences in temperature- and pressure-dependent thermodynamic properties of H$_2$O and D$_2$O is investigated here. Utilizing previously published data and equations-of-state for H$_2$O and D$_2$O, we show that the available data and models for these isotopes are consistent with such a low temperature correspondence. These observations provide support for the hypothesis that a liquid-liquid critical point, which is predicted to occur at low temperatures and high pressures, is the origin of many of water's anomalies.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed generative model for drug-like molecule conformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a diffusion-based, generative model for conformer generation. Our model is focused on the reproduction of bonded structure and is constructed from the associated terms traditionally found in classical force fields to ensure a physically relevant representation. Techniques in deep learning are used to infer atom typing and geometric parameters from a training set. Conformer sampling is achieved by taking advantage of recent advancements in diffusion-based generation. By training on large, synthetic data sets of diverse, drug-like molecules optimized with the semiempirical GFN2-xTB method, high accuracy is achieved for bonded parameters, exceeding that of conventional, knowledge-based methods. Results are also compared to experimental structures from the Protein Databank (PDB) and Cambridge Structural Database (CSD).</description>

      <title>doped: Python toolkit for robust and repeatable charged defect supercell calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Defects are a universal feature of crystalline solids, dictating the key properties and performance of many functional materials. Given their crucial importance yet inherent difficulty in measuring experimentally, computational methods (such as DFT and ML/classical force-fields) are widely used to predict defect behaviour at the atomic level and the resultant impact on macroscopic properties. Here we report `doped`, a Python package for the generation, pre-/post-processing and analysis of defect supercell calculations. `doped` has been built to implement the defect simulation workflow in an efficient, user-friendly yet powerful and fully-flexible manner, with the goal of providing a robust general-purpose platform for conducting reproducible calculations of solid-state defect properties.</description>

      <title>What Can Quantum Information Theory Offer to Quantum Chemistry?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is the ultimate goal of this work to foster synergy between quantum chemistry and the flourishing field of quantum information theory. For this, we first translate quantum information concepts such as entanglement and correlation into the context of quantum chemical systems. In particular, we establish two conceptually distinct perspectives on `electron correlation' leading to a notion of orbital and particle correlation. We then demonstrate that particle correlation equals total orbital correlation minimized over all orbital bases. Accordingly, particle correlation resembles the minimal, thus intrinsic, complexity of many-electron wave functions while orbital correlation quantifies their complexity relative to a basis. We illustrate these concepts of intrinsic and extrinsic correlation complexity in molecular systems, which also manifests the crucial link between the two correlation pictures. Our results provide theoretical justification for the long-favored natural orbitals for simplifying electronic structures, and open new pathways for developing more efficient approaches towards the electron correlation problem.</description>

      <title>Simulation of a Diels-Alder Reaction on a Quantum Computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The simulation of chemical reactions is an anticipated application of quantum computers. Using a Diels-Alder reaction as a test case, in this study we explore the potential applications of quantum algorithms and hardware in investigating chemical reactions. Our specific goal is to calculate the activation barrier of a reaction between ethylene and cyclopentadiene forming a transition state. To achieve this goal, we use quantum algorithms for near-term quantum hardware (entanglement forging and quantum subspace expansion) and classical post-processing (many-body perturbation theory) in concert. We conduct simulations on IBM quantum hardware using up to 8 qubits, and compute accurate activation barriers in the reaction between cyclopentadiene and ethylene by accounting for both static and dynamic electronic correlation. This work illustrates a hybrid quantum-classical computational workflow to study chemical reactions on near-term quantum devices, showcasing the potential of quantum algorithms and hardware in accurately calculating activation barriers.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of the AMOEBA force field for simulating metal halide perovskites in the solid state and in solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we compare existing non-polarizable force fields developed to study the solid or solution phases of hybrid organic-inorganic halide perovskites with the AMOEBA polarizable force field. The aim is to test whether more computationally expensive polarizable force fields like AMOEBA offer better transferability between solution and solid phases, with the ultimate goal being the study of crystal nucleation, growth and other interfacial phenomena involving these ionic compounds. In the context of hybrid perovskites, AMOEBA force field parameters already exist for several elements in solution and we decided to leave them unchanged and to only parameterize the missing ones (Pb\textsuperscript{2+} and CH\textsubscript{3}NH\textsubscript{3}\textsuperscript{+} ions) in order to maximise transferability and avoid over-fitting to the specific examples studied here. Overall, we find that AMOEBA yields accurate hydration free energies (within 5\%) for typical ionic species while showing the correct ordering of stability for the different crystal polymorphs of CsPbI\textsubscript{3} and CH\textsubscript{3}NH\textsubscript{3}PbI\textsubscript{3}. While the existing parameters do not accurately reproduce all transition temperatures and lattice parameters, AMOEBA offers better transferability between solution and solid states than existing non-polarizable force fields.</description>

      <title>Capturing electronic correlations in electron-phonon interactions in molecular systems with the GW approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electron-phonon interactions are of great importance to a variety of physical phenomena, and their accurate description is an important goal for first-principles calculations. Isolated examples of materials and molecular systems have emerged where electron-phonon coupling is enhanced over density functional theory (DFT) when using the Green's-function-based ab initio GW method, which provides a more accurate description of electronic correlations. It is however unclear how general this enhancement is, and how employing high-end quantum chemistry methods, which further improve the description of electronic correlations, might further alter electron-phonon interactions over GW or DFT. Here, we address these questions by computing the renormalization of the highest occupied molecular orbital energies of Thiel's set of organic molecules by harmonic vibrations using DFT, GW and equation-of-motion coupled-cluster calculations. We find that GW can increase the magnitude of the electron-phonon coupling across this set of molecules by an average factor of 1.1-1.8 compared to DFT, while equation-of-motion coupled-cluster leads to an increase of 1.4-2. The electron-phonon coupling predicted with the ab initio GW method is generally in much closer agreement to coupled cluster values compared to DFT, establishing GW as an accurate way of computing electron-phonon phenomena in molecules and beyond at a much lower computational cost than higher-end quantum chemistry techniques.</description>

      <title>Performance assessment of the effective core potentials under the Fermionic neural network: first and second row elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid development of deep learning techniques has driven the emergence of a neural network-based variational Monte Carlo method (referred to as FermiNet), which has manifested high accuracy and strong predictive power in the electronic structure calculations of atoms, molecules as well as some periodic systems. Recently, the implementation of the effective core potential (ECP) scheme in it further facilitates more efficient calculations in practice. But there still lack a more comprehensive assessment on the ECP's performance under the FermiNet. In this work, we set sail to fill this gap by conducting extensive tests on the first two row elements regarding their atomic spectral and molecular properties. Our major finding is that in general the qualities of ECPs have been correctly reflected under the FermiNet, and a more recently built ECP, ccECP, seems to prevail on the overall performance. Meanwhile, a variation of the transferability between different ECPs has also been observed in the results of the hydrides. On the other hand, the high accuracy of the all-electron calculations is hindered by the absence of relativistic effects as one gets to the second row. Meanwhile the numerical instabilities are more often seen in the all-electron calculations, which could be another source of errors. Finally, with more in-depth discussions, we generate possible directions for developing and improving the FermiNet in the near future.</description>

      <title>Influence of cholesterol on hydrogen-bond dynamics of water molecules in lipid-bilayer systems at varying temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cholesterol (Chol) plays a crucial role in shaping the intricate physicochemical attributes of biomembranes, exerting considerable influence on water molecules proximal to the membrane interface. In this study, we conducted molecular dynamics simulations on the bilayers of two lipid species, dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) and palmitoyl sphingomyelin (PSM); they are distinct with respect to the structures of the hydrogen-bond (H-bond) acceptors. Our investigation focuses on the dynamic properties and H-bonds of water molecules in the lipid-membrane systems, with particular emphasis on the influence of Chol at varying temperatures. Notably, in the gel phase at 303 K, the presence of Chol extends the lifetimes of H-bonds of the oxygen atoms acting as H-bond acceptors within DPPC with water molecules by a factor of 1.5 to 2.5. In the liquid-crystalline phase at 323 K, on the other hand, H-bonding dynamics with lipid membranes remain largely unaffected by Chol. This observed shift in H-bonding states serves as a crucial key to unraveling the subtle control mechanisms governing water dynamics in lipid-membrane systems.</description>

      <title>Photocleavage of aliphatic C--C bonds in the interstellar medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultraviolet (UV) processing in the insterstellar medium (ISM) induces the dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons. Aliphatics, including alkanes, are present in different interstellar environments, being prevalently formed in evolved stars; thus, the dehydrogenation by UV photoprocessing of alkanes plays an important role in the chemistry of the ISM, leading to the formation of unsaturated hydrocarbons and eventually to aromatics, the latter ubiquitously detected in the ISM. Here, through combined experimental results and \textit{ab-initio} calculations, we show that UV absorption (mainly at the Ly-$\alpha$ emission line of hydrogen at 121.6 nm) promotes an alkane to an excited Rydberg state from where it evolves towards fragmentation inducing the formation of olefinic C=C bonds, which are necessary precursors of aromatic hydrocarbons. We show that photochemistry of aliphatics in the ISM does not primarily produce direct hydrogen elimination but preferential C-C photocleavage. Our results provide an efficient synthetic route for the formation of unsaturated aliphatics, including propene and dienes, and suggest that aromatics could be formed in dark clouds by a bottom-up mechanism involving molecular fragments produced by UV photoprocessing of aliphatics.</description>

Abstract: Droplets are essential for spatially controlling biomolecules in cells. To work properly, cells need to control the emergence and morphology of droplets. On the one hand, driven chemical reactions can affect droplets profoundly. For instance, reactions can control how droplets nucleate and how large they grow. On the other hand, droplets coexist with various organelles and other structures inside cells, which could affect their nucleation and morphology. To understand the interplay of these two aspects, we study a continuous field theory of active phase separation. Our numerical simulations reveal that reactions suppress nucleation while attractive walls enhance it. Intriguingly, these two effects are coupled, leading to shapes that deviate substantially from the spherical caps predicted for passive systems. These distortions result from anisotropic fluxes responding to the boundary conditions dictated by the Young-Dupr\'e equation. Interestingly, an electrostatic analogy of chemical reactions confirms these effects. We thus demonstrate how driven chemical reactions affect the emergence and morphology of droplets, which could be crucial for understanding biological cells and improving technical applications, e.g., in chemical engineering.</description>

Abstract: We realize arbitrary waveform-based control of spin-selective recombination reactions of radical pairs in the low magnetic field regime. To this end, we extend the Gradient Ascent Pulse Engineering (GRAPE) paradigm to allow for optimizing reaction yields. This overcomes drawbacks of previously suggested time-local optimization approaches for the reaction control of radical pairs, which were limited to high biasing fields. We demonstrate how efficient time-global optimization of the recombination yields can be realized by gradient based methods augmented by time-blocking, sparse sampling of the yield, and evaluation of the central single time-step propagators and their Fr\'echet derivatives using iterated Trotter-Suzuki splittings. Results are shown for both a toy model, previously used to demonstrate coherent control of radical pair reactions in the simpler high-field scenario, and furthermore for a realistic exciplex-forming donor-acceptor system comprising 16 nuclear spins. This raises prospects for the spin-control of actual radical pair systems in ambient magnetic fields, by suppressing or boosting radical reaction yields using purpose-specific radio-frequency waveforms, paving the way for reaction-yield-dependent quantum magnetometry and potentially applications of quantum control to biochemical radical pair reactions. We demonstrate the latter aspect for two radical pairs implicated in quantum biology.</description>

      <title>Molecular integral equations theory in the near critical region of CO2</title>

Abstract: Environmental concerns advocate for greener yet efficient solvents. Supercritical CO2 (scCO2) is a promising candidate due to its non-toxicity and potential for reusing CO2 emissions. It also offers a versatile range of properties, finely tunable by pressure adjustments. This adaptability is exploited in chemical industry processes (separation, extraction). Developing new green processes using scCO2 requires an efficient predictive tool for the solvation properties under different conditions. Existing parametric equations for solubility predictions depend on known experimental data, while molecular dynamics (MD) simulations remain expensive for studying various conditions. Both methods are unsuitable for novel technologies. The molecular density functional theory (MDFT) offer a promising alternative, combining the microscopic modeling with ultra-fast calculations. MDFT requires as input the bulk direct correlation functions, which can be exactly calculated from MD simulations or from approximate but fast molecular integral equations theories. The construction of an accurate molecular integral equations for scCO2 is thus essential for the development of a future MDFT. In this perspective, this paper presents a comparison of the exact direct correlation functions in scCO2 obtained from MD with the ones of the simplest molecular integral equations, the so-called hypernetted chain approximation (HNC). If HNC fails to get the correct thermodynamics, it succeeds to reproduce the short-range structure. These results will prepare the development of MDFT as a perfect tool for investigating a large range of solutes under various conditions within scCO2 .</description>
