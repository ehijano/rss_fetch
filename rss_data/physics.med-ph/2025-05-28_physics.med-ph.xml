      <title>Design and performance of a Toroidal RF Volume Coil with Intrinsic Electromagnetic Interference Rejection for low-field Portable Halbach-Based MRI Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: One of the intrinsic limitations of low-field MRI is low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), which can be further reduced by electromagnetic interference (EMI) due to the lack of a Faraday shielded room. To address this issue, we propose a novel RF coil design that is inherently less sensitive to EMI while maintaining high receive sensitivity. Methods: The proposed coil structure is based on an anapole (toroidal) design and consists of six rings, each containing four continuous wires wound around an elliptical 3D-printed former. The wire in the entire structure is uninterrupted. This coil is designed for use in systems with an axial B0 field direction. The performance of the proposed RF coil was evaluated on a Halbach array system designed for neuroimaging and operating at 47mT and compared with a widely used spiral head coil. Results: The noise level achieved by the proposed toroidal coil in combination with a belt wrapped around the subjects and grounded to the scanner was comparable to that of the widely used spiral head coil when combined with a grounding belt and passive aluminum shielding. The coil transmit and receive efficiency was comparable to the efficiency of the spiral head coil. Conclusion: The proposed RF coil inherently reduces the effect of EMI, potentially removing or reducing the need for passive shielding or external/internal sensors for EMI reduction in post-processing.</description>

      <title>On the Role of Demagnetizing Tensors in Arbitrary Orientations of General Ellipsoid: Implications for MRI Safety Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work explores the behaviour of demagnetizing tensors for general ellipsoids under arbitrary rotations in homogeneous magnetic fields. The work is motivated by the concerns in magnetic resonance imaging safety and their practical evaluation in clinical environments. Whereas demagnetizing tensor is a well-defined concept in the principal axes, its transformation under three-dimensional reorientation is often overlooked - a justifiable omission for solutions derived from Poisson equation, where the tensor can be directly rotated. However, this does not hold for common approximations, where such tensor is not explicitly defined. This work demonstrates the validity of directly rotating the orthogonal basis solutions, derived from Poissons equation, and uses the procedure to evaluate a practical approximation, based on orthogonal area-projections. The tensor rotation approach is also applied to generalize force and torque calculations for ellipsoids under three-dimensional re-orientation. The results show an exact match for translation force and torque when compared to the standard single axis rotation. Additionally, a unique connection to the well-known MRI magic angle is found as the point of convergence for prolate spheroid aspect ratios while solving the corresponding saturation field magnitudes. Finally, the evaluated approximate method was demonstrated to perform fairly across prolate and oblate spheroids. Similar approximations might extend to irregular shapes, but numerical validation would likely remain preferable due to the complexity of internal field distributions.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Macromolecular Proton Fraction Imaging using Pulsed Spin-Lock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: Recent studies have shown that spin-lock MRI can simplify quantitative magnetization transfer (MT) by eliminating its dependency on water pool parameters, removing the need for a T1 map in macromolecular proton fraction (MPF) quantification. However, its application is often limited by the requirement for long radiofrequency (RF) pulse durations, which are constrained by RF hardware capabilities despite remaining within specific absorption rate (SAR) safety limits.
  Methods: To address this challenge, we propose a novel method, MPF mapping using pulsed spin-lock (MPF-PSL). MPF-PSL employs a pulsed spin-lock train with intermittent free precession periods, enabling extended total spin-lock durations without exceeding hardware and specific absorption rate limits. A comprehensive analytical framework was developed to model the magnetization dynamics of the two-pool MT system under pulsed spin-lock, demonstrating that MPF-PSL achieves MT-specific quantification while minimizing confounding effects from the water pool. The proposed method is validated with Bloch-McConnell simulations, phantoms, and in vivo studies at 3T.
  Results: Both Bloch-McConnell simulations and phantom validation demonstrated that MPF-PSL exhibits robust insensitivity to water pool parameters while enabling high-SNR MPF quantification. In vivo validation studies confirmed the method's clinical utility in detecting collagen deposition in patients with liver fibrosis.
  Conclusion: MPF-PSL presents a practical solution for quantitative MT imaging, with strong potential for clinical applications.</description>

      <title>Rapid, High-resolution and Distortion-free $R_{2}^{*}$ Mapping of Fetal Brain using Multi-echo Radial FLASH and Model-based Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00256v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Purpose: To develop a rapid, high-resolution and distortion-free technique for simultaneous water-fat separation, $R_{2}^{*}$ and $B_{0}$ mapping of the fetal brain at 3T.
  Methods: A 2D multi-echo radial FLASH sequence with blip gradients is adapted for data acquisition during maternal free breathing. A calibrationless model-based reconstruction with sparsity constraints is developed to jointly estimate water, fat, $R_{2}^{*}$ and $B_{0}$ field maps directly from k-space. This approach was validated and compared to reference methods using numerical and NIST phantoms and data from nine fetuses between 26 and 36 weeks of gestation age.
  Results: Both numerical and experimental phantom studies confirm good accuracy and precision. In fetal studies, model-based reconstruction yields quantitative $R_{2}^{*}$ values in close agreement with those from a parallel imaging compressed sensing (PICS) technique using Graph Cut (intra-class correlation coefficient [ICC] = 0.9601), while providing enhanced image detail. Repeated scans confirm good reproducibility (ICC = 0.9213). Compared to multi-echo EPI, the proposed radial technique produces higher-resolution (1.1 $\times$ 1.1 $\times$ 3 mm$^{3}$ vs. 2-3 $\times$ 2-3 $\times$ 3 mm$^{3}$) $R_{2}^{*}$ maps with reduced distortion. Despite of differences in motion, resolution and distortion, $R_{2}^{*}$ values are comparable between the two acquisition strategies (ICC = 0.8049). Additionally, the proposed approach enables synthesis of high-resolution and distortion-free $R_{2}^{*}$-weighted images.
  Conclusion: This study demonstrates the feasibility of using multi-echo radial FLASH combined with calibrationless model-based reconstruction for motion-robust, distortion-free $R_{2}^{*}$ mapping of the fetal brain at 3T, achieving a nominal resolution of $1.1 \times 1.1 \times 3$ mm$^{3}$ within 2 seconds per slice.</description>

      <title>A Plug-and-Play Method for Guided Multi-contrast MRI Reconstruction based on Content/Style Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13477v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since multiple MRI contrasts of the same anatomy contain redundant information, one contrast can guide the reconstruction of an undersampled subsequent contrast. To this end, several end-to-end learning-based guided reconstruction methods have been proposed. However, a key challenge is the requirement of large paired training datasets comprising raw data and aligned reference images. We propose a modular two-stage approach addressing this issue, additionally providing an explanatory framework for the multi-contrast problem based on the shared and non-shared generative factors underlying two given contrasts. A content/style model of two-contrast image data is learned from a largely unpaired image-domain dataset and is subsequently applied as a plug-and-play operator in iterative reconstruction. The disentanglement of content and style allows explicit representation of contrast-independent and contrast-specific factors. Consequently, incorporating prior information into the reconstruction reduces to a simple replacement of the aliased content of the reconstruction iterate with high-quality content derived from the reference scan. Combining this component with a data consistency step and introducing a general corrective process for the content yields an iterative scheme. We name this novel approach PnP-CoSMo. Various aspects like interpretability and convergence are explored via simulations. Furthermore, its practicality is demonstrated on the NYU fastMRI DICOM dataset, showing improved generalizability compared to end-to-end methods, and on two in-house multi-coil raw datasets, offering up to 32.6% more acceleration over learning-based non-guided reconstruction for a given SSIM. In a small radiological task, PnP-CoSMo allowed 33.3% more acceleration over clinical reconstruction at diagnostic quality.</description>

      <title>Data Standards in Audiology: A Mixed-Methods Exploration of Community Perspectives and Implementation Considerations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04728v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Objective: The purpose of this study was to explore options for data standardisation in audiology and document the global audiology community's current knowledge and views of data standards, explore their needs and preferences, and develop recommendations for data standardisation as a result.
  Design: A mixed-methods approach, combining a structured survey with an in-depth exploration of themes by experts during a special session on "Big Data and Data Standards in Audiology" at the 2024 Virtual Conference of Computational Audiology.
  Study Sample: The survey sample consisted of 82 members of the global audiology community; five experts joined the panel discussion.
  Results: Survey results emphasized the need for data standardisation in audiology aimed at facilitating research and improving patient care. Knowledge of existing initiatives was low: 38% were aware of initiatives. Yet, 90% envisioned contributing to them moving forward. The panel discussion explored emerging standardisation initiatives in audiology (OMOP, openEHR, HIMSA's Noah standard), challenges (e.g., data quality and privacy), and opportunities (e.g., conversion between approaches and synergies with other medical fields).
  Conclusions: The community support identified in this study could be leveraged to further develop standardisation initiatives for audiology, ensuring alignment between initiatives and with other medical fields.</description>
