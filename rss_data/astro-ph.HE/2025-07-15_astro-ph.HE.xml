      <title>On the location of the compact infrared source in Cyg X-3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This note complements the article on X-ray and infrared variability of the X-ray binary Cyg X-3 (WR+c), published by me and my co-authors (ApJ, v.926, p. 123, 2022). In that paper, a compact IR source was discovered in the system, located in the vicinity of the X-ray source associated with the relativistic companion. In the current note I refine the possible location of the IR source based on simple qualitative considerations.</description>

      <title>Oscillations of hypothetical strange stars as an efficient source ultra-high-energy particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamical behavior of strange quark matter (SQM) objects, such as stars and planets, when subjected to radial oscillations induced by tidal interactions in stellar systems. Our study demonstrates that SQM objects can efficiently convert mechanical energy into hadronic energy due to the critical mass density at their surfaces of 4.7*10^{14} g/cm^3, below which SQM becomes unstable and decays into photons, hadrons, and leptons. We show that even small-amplitude radial oscillations, with a radius change of as little as 0.1%, can result in significant excitation energies near the surface of SQM stars. This excitation energy is rapidly converted into electromagnetic energy over short timescales approximately 1 ms, potentially leading to observable astrophysical phenomena. Higher amplitude oscillations may cause fragmentation or dissolution of SQM stars, which has important implications for the evolution of binary systems containing SQM objects and the emission of gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>Radiative Transfer Modeling of Stripped-Envelope Supernovae. I: A Grid for Ejecta Parameter Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present 1,800 multiwavelength Type Ib/c supernovae light curve models obtained by running the radiation transport code Sedona and varying the mass distribution, velocity profile, and abundance ejecta profiles of helium star progenitors. To create a flexible but physically-informed grid, we use autoencoders to construct a representation of ejecta profiles derived from stellar evolution models. We present simulated nearest-neighbor multiband light curves matches to SN 1994I, SN 2007gr, and iPTF13bvn to demonstrate that realistic light curves can be generated in our grid. We show that the ejecta velocity distribution, in particular, strongly influences the light curve, while variation in Ni-56 alone has a limited impact on the bolometric light curve, even in extreme and unphysical mixing schemes; however, mixing can modestly impact color evolution. Finally, we show that the Ni-56 mass, ejecta mass, and both the magnitude and structure of ejecta velocity distribution can be inferred from the multiband light curves, enabling improved inference over widely used semianalytical models.</description>

      <title>Self-Similar Cosmic-Ray Transport in High-Resolution Magnetohydrodynamic Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the propagation of cosmic rays (CRs) through a simulation of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence at unprecedented resolution of $10{,}240^3$. We drive turbulence that is subsonic and super-Alfv\'enic, characterized by $\delta B_{\rm rms}/B_0=2$. The high resolution enables an extended inertial range such that the Alfv\'en scale $l_A$, where $\delta B (l_A)\approx B_0$, is well resolved. This allows us to properly capture how the cascade transitions from large amplitudes on large scales to small amplitudes on small scales. We find that sharp bends in the magnetic field are key mediators of particle transport even on small scales via resonant curvature scattering. We further find that particle scattering in the turbulence shows strong hints of self-similarity: (1) the diffusion has weak energy dependence over almost two decades in particle energy and (2) the particles' random walk exhibits a broad power-law distribution of collision times such that the diffusion is dominated by the rarest, long-distance excursions. Our results suggest that large-amplitude MHD turbulence can provide efficient scattering over a wide range of CR energies and may help explain many CR observations above a $\sim$TeV: the flattening of the B/C spectrum, the hardening of CR primary spectra and the weak dependence of arrival anisotropy on CR energy.</description>

      <title>Accretion from a Shock-Inflated Companion: Spinning Down Neutron Stars to Hour-Long Periods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations have unveiled a population of pulsars with spin periods of a few minutes to hours that lie beyond the traditional ``death line.'' If they originate from neutron stars (NSs), the existence of such ultra-long period pulsars (ULPs) challenges our current understanding of NS evolution and emission. In this work, we propose a new channel for disk formation based on NSs born in close binaries with main-sequence companion stars. Using a hydrodynamic simulation of supernova-companion interactions, we show that a newborn NS may gravitationally capture gas as it moves through the complex density field shaped by the explosion. For a binary separation of $20\rm~R_\odot$ and a companion mass of $4\rm~M_\odot$, we find the occurrence fraction for disk formation around unbound NSs to be $\sim10\%$. By modeling the disk evolution and its interaction with the NS, we find a bimodal distribution in spin periods: canonical pulsars with $P\lesssim10\rm\,s$ are the ones who lack disks or whose magnetospheres never interacted with the disk, and ULPs with $10^3\lesssim P&lt;10^5\rm\,s$ are produced when the system undergoes a short-lived ``propeller'' phase during which the NS undergoes rapid spin-down. Such ULPs are formed under strong initial dipolar magnetic field strengths $B_0\gtrsim10^{14}\rm\,G$, with a formation rate of $10^{-4}\rm\,yr^{-1}$ in the Milky Way. We also find that a small population of pulsars with moderate magnetic field strengths ($10^{13}\lesssim~B_0\lesssim10^{14}\rm\,G$) and relatively slow initial periods ($P_0\gtrsim0.1\rm\,s$) evolve to $P\sim10^2\rm\,s$, filling the gap between the bimodal distribution. Thus, our model provides a unified explanation for pulsars beyond the ``death line.''</description>

      <title>Phenomenological Scaling Relations for SQM Stars with a Massive s-Quark in Gravitationally Strong Magnetic Fields under the Spherical Symmetry Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scaling relations with the bag constant parameter are investigated for Strange Quark Matter (SQM) stars in the presence of gravitationally strong magnetic fields minimally coupled with matter, considering both massless and massive strange quark scenarios. Assuming a simple model for such coupling under the approximation of spherical symmetry, a phenomenological scaling formula for the maximum mass of stars is derived as a function of the surface magnetic field and the strange quark mass. This formula is applicable for all formally admissible values of the free parameters, and strict scaling with the bag constant is retained only for a vanishing strange quark mass.
  As a byproduct of this study, the mathematical structure of the equation of state for the relativistic SQM model with a massive strange quark is revisited without approximations. It is observed that the contribution of the electron term to the energy density cannot be neglected in the theoretical limit of large strange quark masses. Consequently, the maximum mass of SQM stars increases with sufficiently large strange quark mass, contrasting with the behavior observed for low strange quark masses.</description>

      <title>Combined fit above 0.1 EeV to the cosmic-ray spectrum and composition measured with the Pierre Auger Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We fit the cosmic-ray spectrum measured with the Pierre Auger Observatory's surface detectors above an energy of $10^{17}$ eV, along with composition information inferred from the depth of shower maximum measured with its fluorescence detectors above an energy threshold of $10^{17.8}$ eV. We consider astrophysical scenarios with two distinct extragalactic source populations: one dominating the flux above a few EeV, and the other dominating at lower energies, with representative nuclei being injected at the sources with power-law spectra and rigidity-dependent cutoffs. The high-energy population exhibits a hard source injection spectrum and a relatively heavy composition, while the low-energy population exhibits a softer spectrum and a lighter composition. Extending the fit down to the low energies considered here shows the potential to test the energy region towards the Galactic to extragalactic transition with the data of the Pierre Auger Observatory. In particular, the Galactic contribution is expected to be still sizable at the lowest energies considered, and the extragalactic contribution needs to become suppressed for decreasing energies, an effect that could naturally result from a magnetic-horizon-induced suppression.</description>

      <title>Diffuse gamma-ray and neutrino emission from the Milky Way and the local knee in the cosmic ray spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The LHAASO observatory has recently measured details of the cosmic-ray (CR) spectrum in the knee region (1 -- 10 PeV) with unprecedented precision, including its average CR mass composition and the spectrum of the proton component. We use these precision measurements, combined with direct measurements of CRs by space-based detectors, to derive predictions for the spectrum of diffuse gamma-ray and neutrino emission from the interstellar medium under the assumption that the CR spectrum is universal throughout the Milky Way. We compare these predictions with the Fermi-LAT and LHAASO measurements of the diffuse gamma-ray flux from inner and outer Galactic Plane regions and with estimates of the neutrino flux based on the IceCube data for the same Galactic Plane regions. We notice that the model predictions exceed LHAASO gamma-ray measurements at energies above 100 TeV. This excess can be interpreted within a CR knee model assuming a "local PeV CR bubble''. Within this model, we infer the extension of the local PeV CR bubble of 1.5 +/- 0.3 kpc in the direction of the inner Galaxy and of 0.7+/-0.3 kpc toward the outer Galaxy.</description>

      <title>VegasAfterglow: A High-Performance Framework for Gamma-Ray Burst Afterglows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are the most luminous astrophysical transients, known to be associated with core collapse of massive stars or mergers of two compact objects such as two neutron stars. They are followed by multi-wavelength afterglow emission originating from the deceleration of the relativistic jets by the ambient medium. The study of after emission offers crucial insights into the physics of relativistic shocks, the properties of the circumburst environment, as well as the physical and geometrical structure of relativistic jets, as well as the viewing geometry of the observer. We present VegasAfterglow, a newly developed, high-performance C++ framework designed for modeling GRB afterglows with flexibility and computational efficiency as keynotes of design. The framework self-consistently solves forward and reverse shock dynamics and calculates synchrotron (including self-absorption or all spectral regimes) and inverse Compton radiation (including Klein-Nishina corrections); it can handle arbitrary user-defined ambient density profiles, central engine activity histories, viewing angles, and the jet structures of energy, Lorentz factor, and magnetization profiles. It supports both relativistic and non-relativistic regimes and includes lateral jet spreading effects. In this paper, we describe the numerical implementation of the framework and assess its computational performance. Our results demonstrate that VegasAfterglow is well-suited for interpreting current and future multi-wavelength observations in the era of multi-messenger astronomy.</description>

      <title>Ultra-High-Energy Transient Source Search using IceCube Neutrinos and Pierre Auger Photon Candidates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origins of ultra-high-energy particles remain one of the most profound mysteries in astrophysics. If nearby transient sources of ultra-high-energy particles exist, we might expect correlated emission of neutrinos and photons, arriving in close temporal and spatial coincidence. The IceCube Neutrino Observatory, located at the South Pole, is sensitive to neutrinos from TeV to EeV energies, while the Pierre Auger Observatory, in Argentina, detects cosmic rays and has the capability of observing ultra-high-energy photons using surface and fluorescence detectors. The ultra-high-energy photon candidates reported by the Auger Collaboration, though consistent with cosmic ray backgrounds, provide a compelling opportunity to search for correlated neutrino-photon events. In this contribution, we present the framework to search for ultra-high-energy transients by combining multi-flavour neutrino data from IceCube with photon candidates from the Auger Detector from 2011 to 2017. We will report the sensitivities that we expect to achieve from the search and the astrophysical implications of the possible outcomes.</description>

      <title>Disk Instability Model for Quasi-Periodic Eruptions: Investigating Period Dispersion and Peak Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) are a class of X-ray repeating burst phenomena discovered in recent years. Many models have been proposed to study this phenomenon, there remains significant debate regarding the physical origin of QPEs. In our previous work, we developed a disk instability model with a large-scale magnetic field and successfully reproduced the light curves and spectral characteristics of several QPE sources. We further investigate the model in this work, aiming to explain two key observational features: the dispersion in eruption periods and the peak temperatures during eruptions. The model reveals critical thresholds ($\dot{M}_{\rm crit}$, $\beta_{1,\rm crit}$) that separate systems into stable regimes with minimal period variations and unstable regimes where periods are highly sensitive to accretion rate and magnetic field parameter, while peak temperatures remain nearly constant across the parameter space. This framework successfully explains both the regular eruptions observed in sources like GSN 069 and the stochastic behavior in sources like eRO-QPE1, and simultaneously accounting for the observed temperature stability during long-term QPEs evolution.</description>

      <title>Search for Short Timescale Variability in PG1553+113 with LST-1 of CTAO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: PG 1553+113 is a high-frequency peaked BL Lac object (HBL), with redshift 0.433, detected with the current generation of IACTs (Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes) up to $\sim$ 1 TeV. Interestingly, the continuous $\gamma$-ray lightcurve collected by Fermi-LAT since 2008 showed a signature of a periodic modulation of $2.18 \pm 0.08$ years at energies above 100 MeV and 1 GeV. In addition, the source shows clear variabiliy down to day-scale in all bands. XMM-Newton data recently showed rapid variability in the X-ray band down to $2.4 \pm 0.7$ ks.
  Short-timescale (sub-hour) variabilities are a key observable to constrain the size of the photon-emitting region inside the blazar jet. The LST-1 (first protoype of the Large-Sized Telescope) of the CTAO (Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory) is located on Roque de los Muchachos in La Palma, Spain. With its high sensitivity at low energies (20-150 GeV), it provides a unique opportunity to investigate such phenomena. In 2023, the source had a very bright flare that triggered LST-1 and multi-wavelength data campaigns. In this study, we present the results of this observation campaign, in particular, the search for short-timescale variabilities.</description>

      <title>Constrain magnetar parameters by taking into account the evolutionary effects of radius and moment of inertia with \emph{Swift}/XRT data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A newly born millisecond magnetar has been proposed as one possible central engine of some gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) with X-ray plateau emission. In this work, we systematically analyzed the \emph{Swift}/XRT data of long GRBs with plateau emission that were detected before 2023 December, and estimated the magnetar parameters by considering the $R/I$ evolutionary effects, and investigated possible relationships among these parameters and their relation to the GRB jet and magnetar wind radiation. We found that neglecting the evolutionary effects of $R/I$ can lead to systematic overestimation or underestimation of magnetar parameters such as magnetic field strength ($B_p$), spin period ($P_0$), and ellipticity ($\epsilon$) from 20% to 50%. We also found that some tight correlations among different magnetar parameters, as well as between the GRB jet emission and the magnetar wind emission for our selected Equation of states (EoSs). The universal correlations suggest that a nascent magnetar with the faster $P_0$, lower $B_p$, and lower $\epsilon$ are more inclined to power more energetic GRB jet, and the ellipticity deformation and initial spin period of newborn magnetar are likely to originate from the magnetically-induced distortion and correspond to the equilibrium spin period as a result of interaction between the magnetar and its accretion disk, respectively. Finally, we found that the GW signals from the remnants of those GW-dominated GRBs with redshift measurements cannot reach aLIGO sensitivity threshold, and only two cases (GRBs 150323A and 170607A) can reach ET sensitivity threshold. Future GW observations could not only offer the first smoking gun that a protomagnetar can serve as the central engine of GRBs, but could also play a crucial role in precisely constraining the neutron EoS.</description>

      <title>A low mass, binary-stripped envelope for the Type IIb SN 2024abfo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Type IIb supernovae (SNe) are a transitional subclass of stripped-envelope SNe showing hydrogen lines in their spectra that gradually weaken and give way to helium lines reminiscent of SNe Ib, which is indicative of stripping through stellar winds or binary interaction. SN 2024abfo is the seventh SN IIb with a direct progenitor detection. We find that the position of the supernova in our ERIS adaptive optics imaging agrees with the progenitor position in archival HST imaging to within 19 mas. The progenitor SED is consistent with an A5 giant. Single star models predict an initial mass in the range 11 to 15 solar masses, while the most probable binary model is a 12+1.2 solar mass system with an initial period of 1.73 years. We also find significant evidence for variability of the progenitor candidate in the years prior to core-collapse. SN 2024abfo is the least luminous SN IIb with a direct progenitor detections. At late times the r-band light curve decays more slowly than the comparison SNe, which may be due to increased gamma-ray trapping. Similar to SN 2008ax, SN 2024abfo does not show a prominent double-peaked light curve. Our semi-analytic light curve modelling shows that this may be due to a very low mass of hydrogen in the outer envelope. Spectrally, SN 2024abfo is most similar to SN 2008ax at early times while at later times (80 days) it appears to show persistent Halpha absorption compared to the comparison sample. We prefer a binary system to explain the supernova and its progenitor, although we are unable to rule out single-star models. We recommend late-time observations to search for a binary companion and signatures of CSM-interaction. The absence of these features would support the hypothesis that SN 2024abfo resulted from a system which underwent a period of binary mass transfer well before (1000 yr) the explosion, resulting in a low-mass hydrogen-rich envelope.</description>

      <title>Charged Particle Oscillations around a Black Hole Surrounded by CDM Halos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: HF QPOs are among the most intriguing phenomena observed in LMXBs containing BHs or neutron stars. In this work, we investigate charged particles' dynamics in the nearby of a Schwarzschild-like BH embedded in a uniform magnetic field and surrounded on all sides by CDM. Thereby gaining deeper insight into the influence of magnetic and DM distributions on observable phenomena near compact objects. We first present a modified metric, which incorporates the effects of a CDM ...
  We compute the fundamental oscillation frequencies-radial, latitudinal, Keplerian, and Larmor-and demonstrate how their variation depends on the combined influence of CDM and magnetic field strength. The resulting frequency structure allows us to identify resonance radii associated with HF QPOs, particularly those in 3:2 ratios observed in microquasars. We assess several theoretical models for QPO generation, including the (ER), Relativistic Precession (RP), Tidal Disruption (TD), and Warped Disk (WD) models. A comparative fit of observational data from GRS 1915+105, H1743-322, XTE 1550-564, and GRO 1655-40 demonstrate that the TD and WD models provide the best match for HF QPOs in the presence of moderate magnetic flux ($B' = 0.1$), while the other models except ER fit better in weak-field scenarios.
  Our results highlight the importance of including both magnetic and dark matter (DM) effects in strong-field astrophysics and support the use of HF QPOs as sensitive probes of BH environments. This study opens new perspectives for exploring particle dynamics, accretion disk structure ...</description>

      <title>Impact of local foreground radiations on Very High Energy observations of extragalactic sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the framework of exploiting Very High Energy (VHE) gamma-ray observations of extragalactic sources to infer constraints on the intensity of cosmological background radiations, as well as on deviations from the standard model of particles and physical interactions (like violations of Lorentz invariance and axion-like particles -- LIV and ALPs), we discuss here possible contaminant effects due to the presence of radiations fields from local sources. We specifically model and analyze the foreground radiations produced inside the host galaxy of the VHE source and the cosmic environment itself hosting the source, as well as radiations produced in the Milky Way, along the VHE source's observational line-of-sights. Our analysis shows that such contaminant foregrounds may indeed impact on observations of only the very local Active Galactic Nuclei (e.g. Centaurus A), but not significantly those in the Virgo cluster (M87) and beyond.</description>

      <title>Evidence for protons accelerated and escaped from the Puppis A region using \textit{Fermi}-LAT observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supernova remnants (SNRs) interacting with molecular clouds are interesting laboratories to study the acceleration of cosmic rays and their propagation in the dense ambient medium. We analyze 14 years of Fermi-LAT observations of the supernova remnant Puppis A to investigate its asymmetric $\gamma$-ray morphology and spectral properties. This middle-aged remnant ($\sim$4 kyr) is evolving in an inhomogeneous environment, interacting with a dense molecular cloud in the northeast and a lower-density medium in the southwest. We find clear differences in both $\gamma$-ray luminosity and spectral energy distribution between these two regions. The emission from both sides is consistent with a hadronic origin. However, while the southwestern emission can be explained by standard Diffusive Shock Acceleration (DSA), the northeastern side may involve re-acceleration of pre-existing cosmic rays or acceleration via reflected shocks in the dense cloud environment. Additionally, we identify two significant $\gamma$-ray excesses outside the remnant, including a previously unreported source to the south. These features are likely produced by cosmic rays that have escaped Puppis A and are interacting with nearby dense molecular material. From this extended emission, we estimate the total energy in escaping cosmic rays to be $W_{CR} \sim 1.5 \times 10^{49}$ erg, providing important constraints on cosmic-ray propagation around the remnant.</description>

      <title>NuSTAR discovers a long type-I X-ray burst from the clocked burster GS 1826-24</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The source GS~1826-24 is a neutron star low mass X-ray binary known as the 'clocked burster' because of its extremely regular bursting behavior. We report on the detection of a long type-I X-ray burst from this source. We perform a detailed spectroscopic analysis of the long X-ray burst, lasting for $\sim 600$ s, seen in the NuSTAR observation carried out on 2022 September. The persistent emission is well described by an absorbed thermal Comptonization model (nthcomp), and the source exhibits a hard spectral state during this observation. The observed burst exhibits a rise time of $\sim 25$ s and a decay time of $\sim 282$ s. The time-resolved spectroscopy of the burst shows a significant departure from a pure thermal spectrum and is described with a model consisting of a varying-temperature blackbody plus an evolving persistent emission component. We observe a significant enhancement in the persistent emission during the burst. The enhancement of the pre-burst persistent flux is possibly due to Poynting-Robertson drag or coronal reprocessing. At the peak of the burst, the blackbody temperature and the blackbody emitting radius reached a maximum of $2.10\pm 0.07$ keV and $5.5\pm 2.1$ km, respectively. The peak flux ($F_{peak}$) during the burst is $\approx 2.4\times 10^{-8}$ ergs cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, which corresponds to a luminosity of $\approx 9.7\times 10^{37}$ ergs s$^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>The Accretion-Ejection Connection in the Black Hole X-ray Binary MAXI J1820$+$070</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The black hole X-ray binary MAXI J1820$+$070 began its first recorded outburst in March 2018, and remained an active radio, X-ray, and optical source for over four years. Due to the low distance to the source and its intrinsically high luminosity MAXI J1820$+$070 was observed extensively over this time period, resulting in high-cadence and quasi-simultaneous observations across the electromagnetic spectrum. These data sets provide the opportunity to probe the connection between accretion and the launch of jets in greater detail than for the majority of black hole X-ray binaries. In this work we present radio (Arcminute Microkelvin Imager Large Array, MeerKAT), X-ray (Swift), and optical (Las Cumbres Observatory) observations of MAXI J1820$+$070 throughout its entire outburst, including its initial hard state, subsequent soft state, and further hard-state-only re-brightenings (covering March 2018 to August 2022). Due to the regularity and temporal density of our observational data we are able to create a Radio - X-ray - Optical activity plane where we find a high degree of correlation between the three wave bands during the hard states, and observe hysteresis as MAXI J1820$+$070 enters and exits the soft state. Based on the morphology of the optical light curves we see evidence for optical jet contributions during the soft-to-hard state transition, as well as fading optical emission well before the hard to soft transition. We establish that the remarkably similar profiles of the re-brightening events are broadly consistent with modified disk instability models where irradiation from the inner accretion disk is included.</description>

      <title>The production of orbitally modulated UHE photons in LS 5039</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gamma-ray binaries present emission that is variable and can reach UHE. The processes behind the acceleration of the particles that produce this very energetic radiation are yet to be understood. We probe the properties of the particle accelerator and the UHE photon emitter in the gamma-ray binary LS 5039. From the properties of the binary system and the UHE radiation detected by HAWC, we used analytical tools to investigate how these properties constrain the emission and acceleration regions, namely the role of synchrotron losses, particle confinement, and the accelerated particle spectrum, and propose an acceleration scenario that can relax the derived constraints. The modest target densities for hadronic processes and the overall gamma-ray orbital variability favor inverse Compton scattering of ultraviolet photons from the massive companion star by highly relativistic electrons. The acceleration of the highest energy electrons implies a constraint on synchrotron cooling in the acceleration region, which can set an upper limit on its magnetic field. Moreover, the detected variability requires very strong particle confinement in both the acceleration and emission regions, which sets a lower limit on their magnetic fields that is barely consistent with the synchrotron cooling constraint from acceleration. Synchrotron losses may be higher in the emitting region if it is separated from the accelerator, but this requires a very hard particle injection spectrum. A scenario for LS 5039 of the kind proposed by Derishev and collaborators, in which an ultrarelativistic magnetized outflow accelerates leptons injected within the outflow by gammagamma absorption, provides a viable mechanism to accelerate very energetic electrons. This mechanism relaxes the acceleration and confinement requirements by reducing the impact of synchrotron cooling, and can generate the required particle spectrum.</description>

      <title>Identifying galactic binary systems of neutron stars and black holes with LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will detect ~ 100 galactic binary systems comprised of black holes (BHs) and neutron stars (NSs). Identifying the nature of the constituents of these binaries as BHs or NSs, and distinguishing them from $\sim 10^4$ detected double white dwarfs will be challenging. In the absence of any other information, the inferred values of the component masses can be used to classify the nature of these objects. However, short-period galactic binaries $\sim 10^7 - 10^3$ yr from coalescence produce a quasi-monochromatic signal which carries little information about their masses. We generate synthetic LISA data sets containing gravitational waves (GWs) from galactic binary BHs, binary NSs and BHNSs drawn from an astrophysically realistic population produced through the isolated binary evolution channel. We process the data with an end-to-end Bayesian inference pipeline to explore the accuracy with which the individual component masses can be measured. We find that for $\approx 10\% - 50\%$ of the detected systems LISA will be able to measure the individual component masses by measuring the orbital eccentricity, periapse precession frequency, and GW induced frequency derivative. Typical fractional mass errors are $\approx 1\% - 100\%$ (depending on the specific value of the source parameters), which will enable in many circumstances the classification of the objects as BHs or NSs. For these binaries, LISA will also be able to determine their 3-dimensional position in the Milky Way. The LISA-detected sample of these double compact objects will provide new information about the galactic population of BHs and NSs, the star formation history of the Milky Way and the astrophysical processes leading to the formation of these systems. However, for a significant fraction of the LISA-detected binaries the nature of their constituent objects may remain unclear.</description>

      <title>CRPropa 3.3: Toward a Unified Multi-Messenger Framework from GeV to ZeV Energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present CRPropa 3.3, the latest release of the publicly available Monte Carlo framework for simulating the propagation of high-energy particles in astrophysical environments. This version introduces significant extensions that enables multi-messenger studies across a broad energy range, from GeV to ZeV. New features include explicit time tracking, time-dependent advection fields, and support for position-dependent radiation backgrounds, for more realistic simulations of Galactic and extragalactic propagation. Nuclear cross sections have been updated and expanded up to lead (Z=82). We illustrate some of these new features, including acceleration at moving shocks and gamma-ray propagation in the interstellar radiation field. Together, these improvements establish CRPropa 3.3 as a comprehensive tool for modelling cosmic rays, gamma rays, and their secondaries in structured, time-dependent environments, setting the stage for next-generation multi-messenger astrophysics.</description>

      <title>Dark, deep, deconfining: Phase transitions in neutron stars as powerful probes of hidden sectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interiors of neutron stars enjoy ideal conditions for the conversion of hadrons to a strange quark phase, theorized to be the stablest form of matter. Though numerous astrophysical means to prompt such a deconfinement phase transition have been suggested, they may be pre-empted by a large energy barrier for nucleation of quark matter droplets. We will show that interactions of hidden sectors of particles with nucleons may surmount the barrier if it exceeds deca-GeV energies, and spark a phase transition. The neutron star would then, depending on the equation of state of QCD matter, convert to a black hole and/or set off a gamma-ray burst (GRB). Using the observed existence of ancient neutron stars and estimates of the GRB rate, we then set some of the strictest (albeit conditional) limits on dark matter scatters, annihilations, and decays that are tens of orders stronger than those from terrestrial searches. For smaller energy barriers, lower limits on nucleon decay lifetimes of the order of $10^{64}$~yr may be obtained</description>

      <title>Exploring ultra-high energy neutrino experiments through the lens of the transport equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a first-principles formalism, based on the transport equation in the line-of-sight approximation, to link the expected number of muons at neutrino telescopes to the flux of neutrinos at the Earth surface. We compute the distribution of muons inside Earth, arising from the up-scattering of neutrinos close to the detector, as well as from the decay of taus produced farther away. This framework allows one to account for systematic uncertainties, as well as to clarify the assumptions behind definitions commonly used in literature, such as the effective area. We apply this formalism to analyze the high-energy muon event recorded by KM3NeT, with a reconstructed energy of $ 120^{+110}_{-60} \, \mathrm{PeV}$ and an elevation angle of $\left(0.54\pm 2.4\right)^\circ$, in comparison with the non-observation of similar events by IceCube. We find a $3.1\,\sigma$ tension between the two experiments, assuming a diffuse neutrino source with a power-law energy dependence. Combining both datasets leads to a preference for a very low number of expected events at KM3NeT, in stark contrast to the observed data. The tension increases both in the case of a diffuse source peaking at the KM3NeT energy and of a steady point source, whereas a transient source may reduce the tension down to $1.6\,\sigma$. The formalism allows to treat potential beyond-the-Standard-Model sources of muons, and we speculate on this possibility to explain the tension.</description>

      <title>BASS. XLIX. Characterization of highly luminous and obscured AGNs: local X-ray and [NeV]$\lambda$3426 emission in comparison with the high-redshift Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a detailed analysis of the most luminous and obscured Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) detected in the ultra-hard X-ray band (14-195 keV) by Swift/BAT. Our sample comprises 21 X-ray luminous (log $L_X/{\rm erg\,s^{-1}}&gt;44.6$, 2-10 keV) AGNs at $z&lt;0.6$, optically classified as Seyfert 1.9-2. Using NuSTAR, XMM-Newton, Suzaku, and Chandra, we constrain AGN properties such as absorption column density $N_H$, photon index $\Gamma$, intrinsic $L_X$, covering factor, and iron K$\alpha$ equivalent width. For sources with black hole mass estimates (12/20), we find a weak correlation between $\Gamma$ and Eddington ratio ($\lambda_{Edd}$). Of these, six ($50\pm13\%$) lie in the $N_H$-$\lambda_{Edd}$ "forbidden region'' and exhibit a combined higher prevalence of $N_H$ variability and outflow signatures, suggesting a transitional phase where AGN feedback may be clearing the obscuring material. For the 13/21 sources with multi-epoch X-ray spectra, $82^{+6}_{-16}\%$ exhibit variability in either 2-10 keV flux ($73^{+9}_{-16}\%$) or line-of-sight $N_H$ ($33^{+15}_{-10}\%$). For the 20/21 sources with available near-UV/optical spectroscopy, we detect [NeV]$\lambda$3426 in 17 ($85^{+5}_{-11}\%$), confirming its reliability to probe AGN emission even in heavily obscured systems. When normalized to the same [OIII]$\lambda$5007 peak flux as $z = 2$-$9$ narrow-line AGNs identified with JWST, our sample exhibits significantly stronger [NeV]$\lambda$3426 emission, suggesting that high-redshift obscured AGNs may be intrinsically weaker in [NeV]$\lambda$3426 or that [NeV]$\lambda$3426 is more challenging to detect in those environments. The sources presented here serve as a benchmark for high-redshift analogs, showing the potential of [NeV]$\lambda$3426 to reveal obscured AGNs and the need for future missions to expand X-ray studies into the high-redshift Universe.</description>

Abstract: Gravitational waves emitted in the late inspiral of binary neutron stars are affected by their tidal deformation. We study the tidal dynamics in full general relativity through matched-asymptotic expansions and prove that the dynamical tidal response can be expanded in a complete set of modes. We further prove that the mode amplitudes satisfy an effective, forced harmonic oscillator equation, which generalizes the overlap-integral formulation of Newtonian gravity. Our relativistic treatment of dynamical tides will avoid systematic biases in future gravitational-wave parameter estimation.</description>

      <title>Information Field Theory based Event Reconstruction for Cosmic Ray Radio Detectors</title>

Abstract: Detection of extensive air showers with radio antennas is an appealing technique in cosmic ray physics. However, because of the high level of measurement noise, current reconstruction methods still leave room for improvement. Furthermore, reconstruction efforts typically focus only on a single aspect of the signal, such as the energy fluence or arrival time. Bayesian inference is then a natural choice for a holistic approach to reconstruction, yet, this problem would be ill-posed, since the electric field is a continuous quantity. Information Field Theory provides the solution for this by providing a statistical framework to deal with discretised fields in the continuum limit. We are currently developing models for this novel approach to reconstructing extensive air showers. The model described here is based on the best current understanding of the emission mechanisms: It uses parametrisations of the lateral signal strength distribution, charge-excess contribution and spectral shape. Shower-to-shower fluctuations and narrowband RFI are modelled using Gaussian processes. Combined with a detailed detector description, this model can infer not only the electric field, but also the shower geometry, electromagnetic energy and position of shower maximum. Another big achievement of this approach is its ability to naturally provide uncertainties for the reconstruction, which has been shown to be difficult in more traditional methods. With such an open framework and robust computational methods based in Information Field Theory, it will also be easy to incorporate new insights and additional data, such as timing distributions or particle detector data, in the future. This approach has a high potential to exploit the full information content of a complex detector with rigorous statistical methods, in a way that directly includes domain knowledge.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Monopoles: Theoretical Insights into the Cosmic Ray Conundrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultra-high energy (UHE) photons above 10^{18} eV serve as valuable probes of fundamental physics. While typically produced in interactions involving charged particles, they could also originate from exotic sources such as annihilations of magnetically charged monopole-antimonopole pairs or decays of highly accelerated monopoles (10^{21} eV). Detecting such photons would impose constraints on monopole properties. Despite strong theoretical motivations and extensive experimental searches, no monopoles have been observed to date. A possible explanation beyond high monopole masses arises from Staruszkiewicz's quantum theory of infrared electromagnetic fields. His argument, rooted in the positivity of the Hilbert space norm, suggests that isolated magnetic monopoles may not be physically realizable. If correct, this would imply that while monopoles remain mathematically well-defined within field theories, only magnetically neutral configurations could exist in nature.</description>

      <title>Recent Advances in Simulation-based Inference for Gravitational Wave Data Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detection of gravitational waves by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration has ushered in a new era of observational astronomy, emphasizing the need for rapid and detailed parameter estimation and population-level analyses. Traditional Bayesian inference methods, particularly Markov chain Monte Carlo, face significant computational challenges when dealing with the high-dimensional parameter spaces and complex noise characteristics inherent in gravitational wave data. This review examines the emerging role of simulation-based inference methods in gravitational wave astronomy, with a focus on approaches that leverage machine-learning techniques such as normalizing flows and neural posterior estimation. We provide a comprehensive overview of the theoretical foundations underlying various simulation-based inference methods, including neural posterior estimation, neural ratio estimation, neural likelihood estimation, flow matching, and consistency models. We explore the applications of these methods across diverse gravitational wave data processing scenarios, from single-source parameter estimation and overlapping signal analysis to testing general relativity and conducting population studies. Although these techniques demonstrate speed improvements over traditional methods in controlled studies, their model-dependent nature and sensitivity to prior assumptions are barriers to their widespread adoption. Their accuracy, which is similar to that of conventional methods, requires further validation across broader parameter spaces and noise conditions.</description>

      <title>Looking for Black Hole Morsels in Astrophysical Mergers via Hawking Radiation</title>

Abstract: Gravitational wave observation has provided numerous insights into the merger of astrophysical black holes. In contrast to other violent events (e.g. supernovae), they are, however, not expected to lead to significant emissions of photons and neutrinos. In this paper we discuss a scenario that would lead to characteristic observable gamma ray bursts, which would provide numerous hints to physics beyond General Relativity. Starting from the hypothesis that micro-black holes (called morsels) are formed during the merger process, we show that it is possible to observe their Hawking radiation, which takes the form of gamma ray bursts of a uniquely characteristic form: with energies in the TeV range, their temporal structure is unlike that stemming from any other astrophysical event. Notably, the time delay from the gravitational wave event is correlated to the mass distribution of the morsels. The integrated mass of the morsels, allowed by the unaccounted merger mass, leads to a Hawking radiation in photons that is above the sensitivity of atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes such as HESS, LHAASO and HAWC, and gamma ray space telescopes, such as Fermi-LAT. This renders the hypothesis of morsel creation experimentally testable, and we provide the first concrete bounds on the total mass of morsels formed in specific events.</description>

      <title>Gas-induced perturbations on the gravitational wave in-spiral of live post-Newtonian LISA massive black hole binaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17305v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of dynamically coupling gas torques with gravitational wave (GW) emission during the orbital evolution of an equal-mass massive black hole binary (MBHB). We perform hydrodynamical simulations of eccentric MBHBs with total mass $M=10^6~{\rm M}_\odot$ embedded in a prograde locally isothermal circumbinary disk (CBD). We evolve the binary from $55$ to $49$ Schwarzschild radii separations using up to 2.5 post-Newtonian (PN) corrections to the binary dynamics, which allow us to follow the GW-driven in-spiral. For the first time, we report the measurement of gas torques onto a live binary a few years before the merger, with and without concurrent GW radiation. We also report the gas-induced orbital dephasing $\delta \phi_{\rm orb}\sim-0.007$ rad over $278$ orbital cycles that is likely driven mainly by disc-induced precession and LISA should be able to detect it at redshift $z=1$. Our results show how GWs alone can be used to probe the astrophysical properties of CBDs and have important implications for multi-messenger strategies aimed at studying the environments of MBHBs.</description>

      <title>Investigating disc-corona interaction in axisymmetric accretion disc models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08108v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interaction between the accretion disc and its corona plays a critical role in the energy balance and emission mechanisms in astrophysical systems such as active galactic nuclei and X-ray binaries. However, the detailed physics of disc-corona interactions, including the mechanisms driving disc evaporation and the impact of accretion rate and viscosity, remain poorly understood. Our study aims to extend the well-known disc evaporation model to investigate the disc-corona interaction in a 2D axisymmetric, time-dependent hydrodynamic model, focusing on the effects of viscosity, accretion rate, and their influence on disc evaporation, luminosity, and corona formation. We develop a hydrodynamic model consisting of a thin accretion disc, a corona, and a vacuum region. Our model is implemented in Athena++, with the gas-vacuum interface tracking algorithm to handle the vacuum regions. We perform simulations incorporating turbulent viscosity, thermal conduction, Bremsstrahlung cooling, and artificial disc cooling, starting from an adiabatic state to explore the disc-corona interaction. We demonstrate the presence of acoustic shock heating. We find that viscosity dominates the intensity of disc evaporation, that the accretion rate primarily determines the disc truncation radius and the disc luminosity, and that there may be a positive correlation between the corona luminosity and the evaporation intensity. We find the warm gas required by the warm corona model. We also compare our results with observations and simulations, and estimate the $y$-parameters to explore the potential effects of Compton cooling as well as the potential effects of the warm corona.</description>

      <title>On the Role of Muons in Binary Neutron Star Mergers: First Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04420v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we present a set of binary neutron star (BNS) merger simulations including the net muon fraction as an additional degree-of-freedom in the equation of state (EoS) and hydrodynamics evolution using the numerical-relativity code BAM. Neutrino cooling is modeled via a neutrinos leakage scheme, including in-medium corrections to the opacities and emission rates of semi-leptonic charged-current reactions, although within the elastic approximation. We show that, for our particular choice of baseline baryonic EoS, the presence of muons delays the gravitational collapse of the remnant compared to the case where muons are neglected. Furthermore, when muons and muonic weak reactions are considered, no gravitational collapse occurs within our simulation time and muons are confined in the densest portions of the remnant, while the disk is effectively colder, less protonized and de-muonized. Accordingly, ejecta properties are affected, e.g., ejecta masses are systematically smaller for the muonic setups and exhibit a larger fraction of neutron-rich, small velocity material. Overall, our results suggest that the inclusion of muons and muon-flavored neutrino reactions in the context of BNS merger simulations should not be neglected, thus representing an important step towards more realistic modeling of such systems.</description>

      <title>Widen the Resonance: Probing a New Regime of Neutrino Self-Interactions with Astrophysical Neutrinos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07624v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutrino self-interactions beyond the standard model have profound implications in astrophysics and cosmology. In this work, we study an uncharted scenario in which one of the three neutrino species has a mass smaller than the temperature of the cosmic neutrino background. This results in a relativistic component that significantly broadens the absorption feature on the astrophysical neutrino spectra, in contrast to the sharply peaked absorption expected in the extensively studied scenarios assuming a fully nonrelativistic cosmic neutrino background. By solving the Boltzmann equations for neutrino absorption and regeneration, we demonstrate that this mechanism provides novel sensitivity to sub-keV mediator masses, well below the traditional $\sim 1$--100 MeV range. Future observations of the diffuse supernova neutrino background with Hyper-Kamiokande could probe coupling strengths down to $g \sim 10^{-8}$, surpassing existing constraints by orders of magnitude. These findings open new directions for discoveries and offer crucial insights into the interplay between neutrinos and the dark sector.</description>

      <title>Observational Constraints on Cool Gas Clouds in M82's Starburst-Driven Outflow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06934v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Star formation feedback can drive large-scale, multi-phase galactic outflows. The dynamical and thermodynamical interaction between the hot and cooler phases is a prime focus of both observational and theoretical work. Here, we analyze H$\alpha$-emitting structures in the extraplanar wind of the nearby starburst M82. We use high-resolution, narrow-band, observations from the Hubble Legacy Archive (Mutchler et al. 2007). Our analysis constrains the morphology, number density, and column density of the structures. We highlight conspicuous arc-like structures that differ significantly from the linear cometary clouds that emerge from galactic wind simulations and discuss their possible origins, such as bow shocks or instabilities driven by cosmic rays. The most prominent structures range in size from $\sim24 -110$ pc. Using the H$\alpha$ brightness and assumptions about the depth of the emitting structures, we estimate number densities of $\sim1-23$ cm$^{-3}$ assuming a unity volume filling factor, which are lower than previous constraints from spectroscopic nebular line studies. The derived column densities, $\sim10^{20}-10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$, along the path of the outflow are above theoretical thresholds for cool cloud survival in a hot supersonic background, but small enough that the structures could be accelerated by the hot wind momentum. Using diffuse X-ray emission maps from $\textit{Chandra}$, we also find that even on small ($\sim100$ pc) scales, the H$\alpha$ "leads" the X-rays, a behavior long noted in the literature on kiloparsec scales, and one we observe in the brightness profiles of the structures we analyze. This behavior, along with previous observational studies of ionization in the wind, may signal that shock ionization is responsible for the H$\alpha$ emission we observe.</description>

      <title>Wind-fed Supermassive Black Hole Accretion by the Nuclear Star Cluster: the Case of M31*</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04778v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The central supermassive black hole (SMBH) of the Andromeda galaxy, known as M31*, exhibits dim electromagnetic emission and is inferred to have an extremely low accretion rate for its remarkable mass ($\sim10^8~\rm~M_\odot$). In this work, we use three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations to explore a previously untested scenario, in which M31* is fed by the collective stellar mass-loss from its surrounding nuclear star cluster, manifested as a famous eccentric disk of predominantly old stellar populations. The stellar mass-loss is assumed to be dominated by the slow and cold winds from 100 asymptotic giant-branch stars, which follow well-constrained Keplerian orbits around M31* and together provide a mass injection rate of $\sim4\times10^{-5}\rm~M_\odot~yr^{-1}$. The simulations achieve a quasi-steady state on a Myr timescale, at which point a quasi-Keplerian, cool ($T\sim10^3-10^4~\rm K$) gas disk extending several parsecs is established. This disk is continuously supplied by the stellar winds and itself feeds the central SMBH. At the end of the simulations at 2 Myr, an accretion rate of $\sim2\times10^{-5}\rm~M_\odot~yr^{-1}$ is found but could vary by a factor of few depending on whether the subdominant gravity of the NSC or a moderate global inflow is included. The predicted X-ray luminosity of $\sim10^{36}~\rm erg~s^{-1}$, dominated by the hot ($T\sim10^7-10^8~\rm K$) plasma within 0.2 parsec of the SMBH, is well consistent with Chandra observations. We conclude that the feeding mechanism of M31* is successfully identified, which has important implications for the working of dormant SMBHs prevalent in the local universe.</description>
