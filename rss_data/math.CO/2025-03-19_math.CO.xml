      <title>Constructed tableaux and a new shifted Littlewood-Richardson rule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a new Littlewood-Richardson rule for the Schubert structure coefficients of isotropic Grassmannians, equivalently for the multiplication of $P$-Schur functions. Serrano (2010) previously gave a formula in terms of classes in his shifted plactic monoid. However, this formula is challenging to use because of the difficulty of characterizing shifted plactic classes. We give the first algebraic proof of this formula. We then use it to obtain a new rule that is easy to implement. Our rule is based on identifying a subtle analogue of Yamanouchi tableaux, which we characterize. We show that for some families of structure coefficients, our rule leads to an algorithm with exponentially better time complexity than the original rule of Stembridge (1989).</description>

      <title>Exploring the unleaved tree of numerical semigroups up to a given genus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new algorithm to explore or count the numerical semigroups of a given genus which uses the unleaved version of the tree of numerical semigroups. In the unleaved tree there are no leaves rather than the ones at depth equal to the genus in consideration. For exloring the unleaved tree we present a new encoding system of a numerical semigroup given by the gcd of its left elements and its shrinking, that is, the semigroup generated by its left elements divided by their gcd. We show a method to determine the right generators and strong generators of a semigroup by means of the gcd and the shrinking encoding, as well as a method to encode a semigroup from the encoding of its parent or of its predecessor sibling. With the new algorithm we obtained $n_{76}=29028294421710227$.</description>

      <title>A strengthening of a degree sequence condition for Hamiltonicity in tough graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalizing Chv\'atal's classic 1972 result, Ho\`ang proposed in 1995 the following conjecture, which strengthens Chv\'atal's result in terms of toughness: Let $t\ge 1$ be a positive integer and $G$ be a $t$-tough graph on $n \ge 3$ vertices with degree sequence $d_1, d_2, \dots, d_n$ in non-increasing order. Suppose for each $i\in [1, \lfloor\frac{n-1}{2} \rfloor]$, if $d_i \le i \text{ and } d_{n-i+t} &lt; n - i $ implies $d_j + d_{n-j+t} \ge n$ for all $j\in [i+1, \lfloor\frac{n-1}{2} \rfloor]$, then $G$ is Hamiltonian. Ho\`ang verified the conjecture for $t=1$. In this paper, we verfity the conjecture for all $t\ge 4$. Our proof relies on a toughness closure lemma for $t\ge 4$ that we previously established. Additionally, we show that the toughness closure lemma does not hold when $t=1$.</description>

      <title>Triplets of Mutually Unbiased Bases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We initiate a systematic study of triplets of mutually unbiased bases (MUBs). We show that in $\mathbb{C}^d$ each MUB-triplet is characterized by a $d\times d\times d$ object that we call a Hadamard cube. We describe the basic properties of Hadamard cubes, and show how an MUB-triplet can be reconstructed from such a cube, up to unitary equivalence.
  We also present an algebraic identity which is conjectured to hold for all MUB-triplets in dimension 6. If true, it would imply the long-standing conjecture of Zauner that the maximum number of MUBs in dimension 6 is three.</description>

      <title>Symmetric Tensor Matroids, Dual Rigidity Matroids, and the Maximality Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by a recent result of Brakensiek et al. that symmetric tensor matroids and rigidity matroids are linked by matroid duality, we define abstract symmetric tensor matroids as a dual concept to abstract rigidity matroids and establish their basic properties. We then exploit this duality to obtain an alternative characterisation of the generic $d$-dimensional rigidity on $K_n$ for $n-d\leq 6$ to that given by Grasseger et al. Our results imply that Graver's maximality conjecture holds for these matroids. We also consider the related family of $K_{1,t+1}$-matroids on $K_n$ and show that this family has a unique maximal element only when $t\leq 3$. This implies that the family of second quasi symmetric powers of the uniform matroid $U_{t,n}$ does not have a unique maximal matroid if $t\geq 4$ and $n$ is sufficiently large.</description>

      <title>Crystal skeletons: Combinatorics and axioms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crystal skeletons were introduced by Maas-Gari\'epy in 2023 by contracting quasi-crystal components in a crystal graph. On the representation theoretic level, crystal skeletons model the expansion of Schur functions into Gessel's quasisymmetric functions. Motivated by questions of Schur positivity, we provide a combinatorial description of crystal skeletons, and prove many new properties, including a conjecture by Maas-Gari\'epy that crystal skeletons generalize dual equivalence graphs. We then present a new axiomatic approach to crystal skeletons. We give three versions of the axioms based on $GL_n$-branching, $S_n$-branching, and local axioms in analogy to the local Stembridge axioms for crystals based on novel commutation relations.</description>

      <title>Simplicial complexes, stellar moves, and projective amalgamation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore connections between stellar moves on simplicial complexes (these are fundamental operations of combinatorial topology) and projective Fra{\"i}ss{\'e} limits (this is a model theoretic construction with topological applications).
  We identify a class of simplicial maps that arise from the stellar moves of welding and subdividing. We call these maps weld-division maps. The core of the paper is the proof that the category of weld-division maps fulfills the projective amalgamation property. This gives an example of an amalgamation class that substantially differs from known classes.
  The weld-division amalgamation class naturally gives rise to a projective Fra{\"i}ss{\'e} class. We compute the canonical limit of this projective Fra{\"i}ss{\'e} class and its canonical quotient space. This computation gives a combinatorial description of the geometric realization of a simplicial complex and an example of a combinatorially defined projective Fra{\"i}ss{\'e} class whose canonical quotient space has topological dimension strictly bigger than $1$.
  The method of proof of the amalgamation theorem is new. It is not geometric or topological, but rather it consists of combinatorial calculations performed on finite sequences of finite sets and functions among such sequences. Set theoretic nature of the entries of the sequences is crucial to the arguments.</description>

      <title>A semidefinite programming approach to cross $2$-intersecting families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $k\geq 2$ and $n\geq 3(k-1)$. Let $\mathcal{F}$ and $\mathcal{G}$ be families of $k$-element subsets of an $n$-element set. Suppose that $|F\cap G|\geq 2$ for all $F\in\mathcal{F}$ and $G\in\mathcal{G}$. We show that $|\mathcal{F}||\mathcal{G}|\leq\binom{n-2}{k-2}^2$, and determine the extremal configurations. This settles the last unsolved case of a recent result by Zhang and Wu (J. Combin. Theory Ser. B, 2025). We also obtain the corresponding result in the product measure setting. Our proof is done by solving semidefinite programming problems.</description>

      <title>DP color functions of hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we introduce the DP color function of a hypergraph, based on the DP coloring introduced by Bernshteyn and Kostochka, which is the minimum value where the minimum is taken over all its k-fold covers. It is an extension of its chromatic polynomial. we obtain an upper bound for the DP color functions of hypergraphs when hypergraphs are connected r-uniform hypergraphs for any r greater than one. The upper bound is attained if and only if the hypergraph is a r-uniform hypertree. We also show the cases of the DP color function equal to its chromatic polynomial. These conclusions coincide with the known results of graphs.</description>

      <title>Intersecting hypergraphs with large cover number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In their famous 1974 paper introducing the local lemma, Erd\H{o}s and Lov\'asz posed a question-later referred by Erd\H{o}s as one of his three favorite open problems: What is the minimum number of edges in an $r$-uniform, intersecting hypergraph with cover number $r$? This question was solved up to a constant factor in Kahn's remarkable 1994 paper. More recently, motivated by applications to Bollob\'as' ''power of many colours'' problem, Alon, Buci\'c, Christoph, and Krivelevich introduced a natural generalization by imposing a space constraint that limits the hypergraph to use only $n$ vertices. In this note we settle this question asymptotically, up to a logarithmic factor in $n/r$ in the exponent, for the entire range.</description>

      <title>Vertex degree sums for rainbow matchings in 3-uniform hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $n \in 3\mathbb{Z}$ be sufficiently large. Zhang, Zhao and Lu proved that if $H$ is a 3-uniform hypergraph with $n$ vertices and no isolated vertices, and if $deg(u)+deg(v) &gt; \frac{2}{3}n^2 - \frac{8}{3}n + 2$ for any two vertices $u$ and $v$ that are contained in some edge of $H$, then $ H $ admits a perfect matching. In this paper, we prove that the rainbow version of Zhang, Zhao and Lu's result is asymptotically true. More specifically, let $\delta &gt; 0$ and $ F_1, F_2, \dots, F_{n/3} $ be 3-uniform hypergraphs on a common set of $n$ vertices. For each $ i \in [n/3] $, suppose that $F_i$ has no isolated vertices and $deg_{F_i}(u)+deg_{F_i}(v) &gt; \left( \frac{2}{3} + \delta \right)n^2$ holds for any two vertices $u$ and $v$ that are contained in some edge of $F_i$. Then $ \{ F_1, F_2, \dots, F_{n/3} \} $ admits a rainbow matching. Note that this result is asymptotically tight.</description>

      <title>Cayley trees and increasing 1,2-trees: let's twist!</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An increasing 1,2-tree is a labeled graph formed by starting with a vertex and then repeatedly attaching a leaf to a vertex or a triangle to an edge, the labeling of the vertices corresponding to the order in which the vertices are added. Equivalently, increasing 1,2-trees are connected chordal graphs of treewidth at most 2 labeled with a reversed perfect elimination ordering. We prove that this family is equinumerous with Cayley trees, which are unconstrained labeled trees. In particular, the number of triangles in an increasing 1,2-tree corresponds to the number of twists. A twist (also called improper edge) is an edge whose endpoint closer to vertex 1 has a greater label than some vertex in the subtree rooted at the other endpoint of the edge. We provide three proofs of this result, the rst being based on similar recursive decompositions, the second on the resolution of generating functions, and the third describing a bijection. Finally, we propose ecient random generators for these two combinatorial families.</description>

      <title>Refined enumeration of planar Eulerian orientations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the enumeration of Eulerian orientations of 4-valent planar maps according to three parameters: the number of vertices, the number of alternating vertices (having in/out/in/out incident edges), and the number of clockwise oriented faces. This is a refinement of the six vertex model studied by Kostov, then Zinn-Justin and Elvey Price, where one only considers the first two parameters. Via a bijection of Ambjorn and Budd, our problem is equivalent to the enumeration of Eulerian partial orientations of general planar maps, counted by the number of edges, the number of undirected edges, and the number of vertices.
  We first derive from combinatorial arguments a system of functional equations characterising the associated trivariate series $Q(t,\omega,v)$. We then derive from this system a compact characterisation of this series. We use it to determine $Q(t,\omega,v)$ in three two-parameter cases. The first two cases correspond to setting the variable $\omega$ counting alternating vertices (or undirected edges after the AB bijection) to $0$ or $1$: when $\omega=0$ we count Eulerian orientations of general planar maps by edges and vertices, and when $\omega=1$ we count Eulerian orientations of quartic maps by vertices and clockwise faces. The final forms of these two series, namely $Q(t,0, v)$ and $Q(t,1,v)$, refine those obtained by the authors in an earlier paper for $v=1$. The third case that we solve, namely $v=1$ (but $\omega$ arbitrary), is the standard six-vertex model, for which we provide a new proof of the formula of Elvey Price and Zinn-Justin involving Jacobi theta functions.
  This new derivation remains purely in the world of formal power series, not relying on complex analysis. Our results also use a more direct approach to solving the functional equations, in contrast to the guess and check approaches used in previous work.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A congruence of the weak order is simple if its quotientope is a simple polytope. We provide an alternative elementary proof of the characterization of the simple congruences in terms of forbidden up and down arcs. For this, we provide a combinatorial description of the vertices of the corresponding quotientopes in terms of separating trees. This also yields a combinatorial description of all faces of the corresponding quotientopes. We finally explore algebraic aspects of separating trees, in particular their connections with quiver representation theory.</description>

      <title>Exceptional projections in finite fields: Fourier analytic bounds and incidence geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of bounding the number of exceptional projections (projections which are smaller than typical) of a subset of a vector space over a finite field onto subspaces. We establish bounds that depend on $L^p$ estimates for the Fourier transform, improving various known bounds for sets with sufficiently good Fourier analytic properties. The special case $p=2$ recovers a recent result of Bright and Gan (following Chen), which established the finite field analogue of Peres--Schlag's bounds from the continuous setting.
  We prove several auxiliary results of independent interest, including a character sum identity for subspaces (solving a problem of Chen), and an analogue of Plancherel's theorem for subspaces. These auxiliary results also have applications in affine incidence geometry, that is, the problem of estimating the number of incidences between a set of points and a set of affine $k$-planes. We present a novel and direct proof of a well-known result in this area that avoids the use of spectral graph theory, and we provide simple examples demonstrating that these estimates are sharp up to constants.</description>

      <title>Maximum Size $t$-Intersecting Families and Anticodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The maximum size of $t$-intersecting families is one of the most celebrated topics in combinatorics, and its size is known as the Erd\H{o}s-Ko-Rado theorem. Such intersecting families, also known as constant-weight anticodes in coding theory, were considered in a generalization of the well-known sphere-packing bound. In this work we consider the maximum size of $t$-intersecting families and their associated maximum size constant-weight anticodes over alphabet of size $q &gt;2$. It is proved that the structure of the maximum size constant-weight anticodes with the same length, weight, and diameter, depends on the alphabet size. This structure implies some hierarchy of constant-weight anticodes.</description>

      <title>Constructing the antimagic labelings for double stars union paths on three vertices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a graph on $m$ edges, a bijective function between the edge set of the graph and $\{1,2,\ldots,m\}$ is an antimagic labeling provided that when adding the labels of the edges incident to the same vertex, the sums are pairwise distinct. Hartsfield and Ringel conjectured that every connected graph has antimagic labeling. On the other hand, it is known that for any graph $G$, the disjoint union of $G$ and many $P_3$, a path on 3 vertices, is not antimagic. In this paper, we determined the exact number of $P_3$'s such that the disjoint union of a double star with the number of $P_3$'s is antimagic. In addition, we provide some examples of $(1,1)$-antimagic labelings. That is, the antimagic labelings have vertex sums 1 through the number of vertices of the graphs.</description>

      <title>On Log-Concave Operator Acting on Sequences and Series</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the properties of sequences and series under the action of the log-concave operator \(\mathcal{L}\). We explore the relationship between the convergence of a sequence \((a_k)\) and the convergence of sequences and series derived by applying \(\mathcal{L}\) iteratively. These results demonstrate the strong regularity properties of log-concave sequences and provide a framework for analyzing the convergence of sequences and series derived from the log-concave operator. The findings have implications for combinatorics, probability, optimization, and related fields, opening new avenues for further research on the behavior of log-concave sequences and their associated operators.</description>

      <title>Counting the number of elements in the nilradical of a parabolic subalgebra of $\mathfrak{gl}_n(\mathbb F_q)$ with a specified Jordan form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Lambda$ be a composition of $n$, and let $\mathfrak u_\Lambda(\mathbb F_q)$ denote the nilradical of the standard parabolic subalgebra of $\mathfrak{gl}_n(\mathbb F_q)$ associated with $\Lambda$. Using a parabolic variation of Borodin's division algorithm we prove that, up to an explicit polynomial factor in $q$, the number of elements in $\mathfrak u_\Lambda(\mathbb F_q)$ of Jordan type $\mu$ is equal to the coefficient of the monomial $\mathbf x^\Lambda$ in the specialization of the dual Macdonald polynomial $\mathrm Q_{\mu'}(\mathbf x;q^{-1},t)$ at $t=0$. Our proof is shorter and more direct than the one given by Karp and Thomas.
  We give three applications of the above theorem. First, we demonstrate that a recurrence relation of Kirillov for the number of strictly upper triangular matrices of Jordan type $\mu$ is a straightforward consequence of the above result combined with the Cauchy identity for Macdonald polynomials. Second, we give an explicit formula for the number of $X\in \mathfrak u_\Lambda(\mathbb F_q)$ that satisfy $X^2=0$. In the special case $\Lambda=(1^n)$, our formula is different from the one conjectured by Kirillov and Melnikov (which was proved by Ekhad and Zeilberger). We obtain a new proof of the Kirillov-Melnikov-Ekhad-Zeilberger formula using our latter result and a formula for two-rowed Macdonald polynomials by Jing and J\'{o}zefiak. Third, we compute the number of double cosets $\mathsf U_\Lambda(\mathbb F_q)\backslash\mathsf{GL}_n(\mathbb F_q)/\mathsf U_\Gamma(\mathbb F_q)$ where $\mathsf U_\Lambda$ and $\mathsf U_\Gamma$ denote unipotent radicals of the standard parabolics of $\mathsf{GL}_n(\mathbb F_q)$ associated to compositions $\Lambda$ and $\Gamma$ of $n$.</description>

      <title>Characterization of locally most split reliable graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A two-terminal graph is a graph equipped with two distinguished vertices, called terminals. Let $T_{n,m}$ be the set of all nonisomorphic connected simple two-terminal graphs on $n$ vertices and $m$ edges. Let $G$ be any two-terminal graph in $T_{n,m}$. For every number $p$ in $[0,1]$ we let each of the edges in $G$ be independently deleted with probability $1-p$. The split reliability $SR_{G}(p)$ is the probability that the resulting spanning subgraph has precisely $2$ connected components, each one including one terminal. The two-terminal graph $G$ is uniformly most split reliable if $SR_G(p)\geq SR_{H}(p)$ for each $H$ in $T_{n,m}$ and every $p$ in $[0,1]$. We say $G$ is locally most split reliable if there exists $\delta&gt;0$ such that $SR_G(p)\geq SR_{H}(p)$ for each $H$ in $T_{n,m}$ and every $p$ in $(1-\delta,1)$.
  Brown and McMullin showed that there exists uniformly most split reliable graphs in each class $T_{n,m}$ such that $m=n-1$, $m=\binom{n}{2}$, or $m=\binom{n}{2}-1$. The authors also proved that there is no uniformly most split reliable two-terminal graph in $T_{n,n}$ when $n\geq 6$ and specified in which classes $T_{n,m}$ such that $n\leq 7$ there exist uniformly most split reliable graphs. The existence or nonexistence of uniformly most split reliable graphs in the remaining cases is posed by Brown and McMullin as an open problem.
  In this work, the set $\mathcal{G}_{n,m}$ consisting of all locally most split reliable graphs is characterized in each nonempty class $T_{n,m}$. It is proved that a graph in $T_{n,m}$ is locally most split reliable if and only if its split reliability equals that of the balloon graph equipped with two terminals whose distance equals its diameter. Finally, it is proved that there is no uniformly most split reliable graph in $T_{n,m}$ when $n\geq 7$ and $n\leq m \leq \binom{n-3}{2}+3$.</description>

      <title>From de Bruijn graphs to variation graphs-relationships between pangenome models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pangenomes serve as a framework for joint analysis of genomes of related organisms. Several pangenome models were proposed, offering different functionalities, applications provided by available tools, their efficiency etc. Among them, two graph-based models are particularly widely used: variation graphs and de Bruijn graphs. In the current paper we propose an axiomatization of the desirable properties of a graph representation of a collection of strings. We show the relationship between variation graphs satisfying these criteria and de Bruijn graphs. This relationship can be used to efficiently build a variation graph representing a given set of genomes, transfer annotations between both models, compare the results of analyzes based on each model etc.</description>

      <title>On finite nilpotent groups with the same enhanced power graph</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The enhanced power graph of a group $G$ is the graph $P_e(G)$ whose vertex set is $G$, such that two distinct vertices $x$ and $y$, are adjacent if $\langle x, y\rangle$ is cyclic. In this paper, we analyze the structure of the enhanced power graph of a finite nilpotent group in terms of the enhanced power graphs of its Sylow subgroups. We establish that for two nilpotent groups, their enhanced power graphs are isomorphic if and only if the enhanced power graphs of their Sylow subgroups are isomorphic. Additionally, we identify specific nilpotent groups for which the enhanced power graphs uniquely characterize the group structure, meaning that if $P_e(G)\cong P_e(H)$ then $G \cong H$. Finally, we extend these results to power graphs and cyclic graphs.</description>

      <title>Dynkin Systems and the One-Point Geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note I demonstrate that the collection of Dynkin systems on finite sets assembles into a Connes-Consani $\mathbb{F}_1$-module, with the collection of partitions of finite sets as a sub-module. The underlying simplicial set of this $\mathbb{F}_1$-module is shown to be isomorphic to the delooping of the Krasner hyperfield $\mathbb{K}$, where $1+1=\{0,1\}$. The face and degeneracy maps of the underlying simplicial set of the $\mathbb{F}_1$-module of partitions correspond to merging partition blocks and introducing singleton blocks, respectively. I also show that the $\mathbb{F}_1$-module of partitions cannot correspond to a set with a binary operation (even partially defined or multivalued) under the ``Eilenberg-MacLane'' embedding. These results imply that the $n$-fold sum of the Dynkin $\mathbb{F}_1$-module with itself is isomorphic to the $\mathbb{F}_1$-module of the discrete projective geometry on $n$ points.</description>

Abstract: We prove that any digraph Brown functor -- i.e. a contravariant functor from the homotopy category of finite directed graphs to the category of abelian groups, satisfying the triviality axiom, the additivity axiom, and the Mayer-Vietoris axiom -- is representable.

      <description>arXiv:2503.15175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by partition regularity problems of homogeneous quadratic equations, we prove multiple recurrence and convergence results for multiplicative measure preserving actions with iterates given by rational sequences involving polynomials that factor into products of linear forms in two variables. We focus mainly on actions that are finitely generated, and the key tool in our analysis is a decomposition result for any bounded measurable function into a sum of two components, one that mimics concentration properties of pretentious multiplicative functions and another that mimics vanishing properties of aperiodic multiplicative functions. Crucial to part of our arguments are some new seminorms that are defined by a mixture of addition and multiplication of the iterates of the action, and we prove an inverse theorem that explicitly characterizes the factor of the system on which these seminorms vanish.</description>

Abstract: The odd length in Weyl groups is a new statistic analogous to the classical Coxeter length, and features combinatorial and parity conditions. We establish explicit closed product formulas for the sign-twisted generating functions of the odd length for parabolic quotients of Weyl groups of type $D$. As a consequence, we verify three conjectures of Brenti and Carnevale on evaluating closed forms for these generating functions. We then give an equivalent condition for the sign-twisted generating functions to be expressible as products of cyclotomic polynomials, settling a conjecture of Stembridge.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.02932v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Separable elements in Weyl groups are generalizations of the well-known class of separable permutations in symmetric groups. Gaetz and Gao showed that for any pair $(X,Y)$ of subsets of the symmetric group $\mathfrak{S}_n$, the multiplication map $X\times Y\rightarrow \mathfrak{S}_n$ is a splitting (i.e., a length-additive bijection) of $\mathfrak{S}_n$ if and only if $X$ is the generalized quotient of $Y$ and $Y$ is a principal lower order ideal in the right weak order generated by a separable element. They conjectured this result can be extended to all finite Weyl groups. In this paper, we classify all separable and minimal non-separable signed permutations in terms of forbidden patterns and confirm the conjecture of Gaetz and Gao for Weyl groups of type $B$.</description>

      <title>Ehrhart Bounds for Panhandle and Paving Matroids Through Enumeration of Chain Forests</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.01640v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Panhandle matroids are a specific family of lattice-path matroids corresponding to panhandle-shaped Ferrers diagrams. Their matroid polytopes are the subpolytopes carved from a hypersimplex to form matroid polytopes of paving matroids. It has been an active area of research to determine which families of matroid polytopes are Ehrhart positive. We prove Ehrhart positivity for panhandle matroid polytopes, thus confirming a conjecture of Hanely, Martin, McGinnis, Miyata, Nasr, Vindas-Mel\'endez, and Yin (2023). Another standing conjecture posed by Ferroni (2022) asserts that the coefficients of the Ehrhart polynomial of a connected matroid are bounded above by those of the corresponding uniform matroid. We prove Ferroni's conjecture for paving matroids -- a class conjectured to asymptotically contain all matroids. These results follow from purely enumerative statements, the main one being conjectured by Hanely et. al concerning the enumeration of a certain class of ordered chain forests. %Thus, the contents and proofs in this paper are mainly of enumerative combinatorics flavor, with the primary motivation coming from Ehrhart theory. Thus, the content and proofs in this paper reflect an enumerative combinatorics perspective, driven by considerations in Ehrhart theory.</description>

      <title>Bounds for the independence and chromatic numbers of locally sparse graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03054v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note we consider a more general version of local sparsity introduced recently by Anderson, Kuchukova, and the author. In particular, we say a graph $G = (V, E)$ is $(k, r)$-locally-sparse if for each vertex $v \in V(G)$, the subgraph induced by its neighborhood contains at most $k$ cliques of size $r$. For $r \geq 3$ and $\epsilon \in [0, 1]$, we show that an $n$-vertex $(\Delta^{\epsilon r}, r)$-locally-sparse graph $G$ of maximum degree $\Delta$ satisfies $\alpha(G) = (1-o(1))\dfrac{n}{\eta\Delta}$ and $\chi(G) = O\left(\eta\Delta\right)$, where $\eta :=\epsilon + \dfrac{r\log\log \Delta}{\log \Delta}$. For $\epsilon$ not too large, the hidden constant in the $O(\cdot)$ can be taken to be $1+o(1)$. Setting $\epsilon = 0$, we recover classical results on $K_{r+1}$-free graphs due to Shearer and Johansson, which were more recently improved by Davies, Kang, Pirot, and Sereni. We prove a stronger result on the independence number in terms of the occupancy fraction in the hard-core model, and establish a local version of the coloring result in the more general setting of correspondence coloring.</description>

Abstract: A map $c:V(G)\rightarrow\{1,\dots,k\}$ of a graph $G$ is a packing $k$-coloring if every two different vertices of the same color $i\in \{1,\dots,k\}$ are at distance more than $i$. The packing chromatic number $\chi_{\rho}(G)$ of $G$ is the smallest integer $k$ such that there exists a packing $k$-coloring. In this paper we introduce the notion of \textit{Grundy packing chromatic number}, analogous to the Grundy chromatic number of a graph. We first present a polynomial-time algorithm that is based on a greedy approach and gives a packing coloring of $G$. We then define the Grundy packing chromatic number $\Gamma_{\rho}(G)$ of a graph $G$ as the maximum value that this algorithm yields in a graph $G$. We present several properties of $\Gamma_{\rho}(G)$, provide results on the complexity of the problem as well as bounds and some exact results for $\Gamma_{\rho}(G)$.</description>

      <title>Critical behaviors of the Ramsey-Tur\'{a}n number of $K_3$ and $K_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04042v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1969, Erd\H{o}s and S\'{o}s initiated the study of the Ramsey-Tur\'{a}n type problems. Given integers $p, q\ge2$, a graph $G$ is $(K_p,K_q)$-free if there exists a red/blue edge coloring of $G$ such that it contains neither a red $K_p$ nor a blue $K_q$. For any $\delta&gt;0$, the Ramsey-Tur\'{a}n number $RT( {n,p,q,\delta n)} $ is the maximum number of edges in an $n$-vertex $(K_p,K_q)$-free graph with independence number at most $\delta n$. Let $\rho (p, q,\delta ) = \mathop {\lim }\limits_{n \to \infty } \frac{RT(n,p, q,\delta n)}{n^2}$. Kim, Kim and Liu (2019) showed $\rho(3,6,\delta)\ge \frac{5}{12}+\frac{\delta}{2}+2\delta^2$ from a skilful construction and conjectured the equality holds for sufficiently small $\delta&gt;0$. We make the first step to the conjecture by showing that $\rho(3,6,\delta)\le\frac{5}{{12}} + \frac{\delta }{2}+ 2.1025\delta ^2$ for sufficiently small $\delta&gt;0$.</description>

      <title>Construction and Conditions for Completely Independent Spanning Trees in Hypercubes and Regular Bipartite Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03379v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A set of \( k \) spanning trees in a graph \( G \) is called a set of \textit{completely independent spanning trees (CISTs)} if, for every pair of vertices \( x \) and \( y \), the paths connecting \( x \) and \( y \) across different trees do not share any vertices or edges, except for \( x \) and \( y \) themselves. Hasunuma conjectured that every \(2k\)-connected graph contains exactly \(k\) completely independent spanning trees (CISTs). However, P\'et\'erfalvi disproved this conjecture.
  When \( k = 2 \), the two CISTs are called a \textit{dual-CIST}. It has been shown that determining whether a graph can have \( k \) CISTs is an NP-complete problem, even when \( k = 2 \). In $2017$, Darties et al. raised the question of whether the $6-$dimensional hypercube \( Q_6 \) can have three completely independent spanning trees (CISTs). This paper provides an answer to that question.
  In this paper, we first present a necessary condition for \( k \)-regular, \( k \)-connected bipartite graphs to have \( \left\lfloor \frac{k}{2} \right\rfloor \) CISTs. We also investigate that the hypercube of dimension \( n \) cannot have \( \frac{n}{2} \) CISTs, which means Hasunuma's conjecture does not hold for the hypercube \( Q_n \) when \( n \) is an even integer \(2 &lt; n \leq 10^7 \), except when \(n = 2^r\) and \( n \in \{161038, 215326, 2568226, 3020626, 7866046, 9115426 \} \). This result also resolves a question posed by Darties et al.
  The construction of multiple CISTs on the underlying graph of a network has practical applications in ensuring the fault tolerance of data transmission. In this context, we also provide a construction for three completely independent spanning trees in the hypercube \(Q_n\) for \(n \geq 7\). Our results show that Hasunuma's conjecture holds for odd integer \(n = 7\) in \(Q_n\), but does not hold for even integer \(n = 6\).</description>

      <title>Quantum advantage in zero-error function computation with side information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01549v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of zero-error function computation with side information. Alice and Bob have correlated sources $X,Y$ with joint p.m.f. $p_{XY}(\cdot, \cdot)$. Bob wants to calculate $f(X,Y)$ with zero error. Alice encodes $m$-length blocks $(m \geq 1)$ of her observations to Bob over error-free channels, which can be classical or quantum. We consider two classical settings. (i) Alice communicates via a fixed length code (FLC), and (ii) Alice communicates via a variable length code (VLC). In the FLC scenario, the minimum communication rate depends on the asymptotic growth of the chromatic number of an appropriately defined $m$-instance ``confusion graph'' $G^{(m)}$. In the VLC scenario, the corresponding rate is characterized by the asymptotics of the chromatic entropy of $G^{(m)}$. %and has single-letter characterization in terms of K\"orner's graph entropy if $G^{(m)}$ is $m$-times graph OR product. In the quantum setting, we only consider fixed length codes; the corresponding rate depends on the asymptotic growth of the orthogonal rank of the complement of $G^{(m)}$. The behavior of the communication rates depends critically on $G^{(m)}$, which is shown to be sandwiched between $G^{\boxtimes m}$ ($m$-times strong product) and $G^{\lor m}$ ($m$-times OR product) respectively. Our work presents necessary and sufficient conditions on the function $f(\cdot, \cdot)$ and joint p.m.f. $p_{XY}(\cdot,\cdot)$ such that $G^{(m)}$ equals either $G^{\boxtimes m}$ or $G^{\lor m}$. Our work explores the multitude of possible behaviors of the quantum and classical (FLC/VLC) rates in the single-instance case and the asymptotic (in $m$) case for several classes of confusion graphs.</description>

      <title>Signed graphs in data sciences via communicability geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07493v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Signed graphs are an emergent way of representing data in a variety of contexts where antagonistic interactions exist. These include data from biological, ecological, and social systems. Here we propose the concept of communicability for signed graphs and explore in depth its mathematical properties. We also prove that the communicability induces a hyperspherical geometric embedding of the signed network, and derive communicability-based metrics that satisfy the axioms of a distance even in the presence of negative edges. We then apply these metrics to solve several problems in the data analysis of signed graphs within a unified framework. These include the partitioning of signed graphs, dimensionality reduction, finding hierarchies of alliances in signed networks, and quantifying the degree of polarization between the existing factions in social systems represented by these types of graphs.</description>

      <title>On the action of the symmetric group on the free LAnKe: a question of Friedmann, Hanlon, Stanley and Wachs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06979v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A LAnKe (also known as a Lie algebra of the $n$th kind, or a Filippov algebra) is a vector space equipped with a skew-symmetric $n$-linear form that satisfies the generalized Jacobi identity. The symmetric group $\mathfrak{S}_m$ acts on the multilinear part of the free LAnKe on $m=(n-1)k+1$ generators, where $k$ is the number of brackets, by permutation of the generators. The corresponding representation was studied by Friedmann, Hanlon, Stanley and Wachs, who asked whether for $n \ge k$, its irreducible decomposition contains no summand whose Young diagram has at most $k-1$ columns. The answer is affirmative if $k \le 3$. In this paper, we show that the answer is affirmative for all $k$. A proof has been given recently by Friedmann, Hanlon and Wachs. The two proofs are completely different.</description>

      <title>Sparse Hanson-Wright Inequalities with Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15652v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive new Hanson-Wright-type inequalities tailored to the quadratic forms of random vectors with sparse independent components. Specifically, we consider cases where the components of the random vector are sparse $\alpha$-subexponential random variables with $\alpha&gt;0$. When $\alpha=\infty$, these inequalities can be seen as quadratic generalizations of the classical Bernstein and Bennett inequalities for sparse bounded random vectors. To establish this quadratic generalization, we also develop new Bersntein-type and Bennett-type inequalities for linear forms of sparse $\alpha$-subexponential random variables that go beyond the bounded case $(\alpha=\infty)$. Our proof relies on a novel combinatorial method for estimating the moments of both random linear forms and quadratic forms.
  We present two key applications of these new sparse Hanson-Wright inequalities: (1) A local law and complete eigenvector delocalization for sparse $\alpha$-subexponential Hermitian random matrices, generalizing the result of He et al. (2019) beyond sparse Bernoulli random matrices. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first local law and complete delocalization result for sparse $\alpha$-subexponeitial random matrices down to the near-optimal sparsity $p\geq \frac{\mathrm{polylog}(n)}{n}$ when $\alpha\in (0,2)$ as well as for unbounded sparse sub-gaussian random matrices down to the optimal sparsity $p\gtrsim \frac{\log n}{n}.$ (2) Concentration of the Euclidean norm for the linear transformation of a sparse $\alpha$-subexponential random vector, improving on the results of G\"otze et al. (2021) for sparse sub-exponential random vectors.</description>

      <title>The action of the Morava stabilizer group on the coefficients of Morava E-theory at height 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04686v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We calculate an explicit closed formula for the action of the height 2 full Morava stabilizer group on the coefficient ring of height 2 Morava E-theory. In particular, this yields an explicit, surprisingly simple closed formula for the action of the automorphism group of a height 2 formal group law on its Lubin-Tate deformation ring. The formula is of a combinatorial nature, given by sums over certain labelled ordered rooted trees.</description>

      <title>Diophantine enumeration of Dynkin friezes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08800v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the Fontaine-Plamondon conjecture and show that there are precisely $4400$ and $26952$ positive integral $E_7$-friezes and $E_8$-friezes respectively, completing the enumerative classification of all positive integral friezes of Dynkin type. We also give new Diophantine proofs of the enumeration theorems for friezes of all other Dynkin types, which were previously proved using discrete geometry, algebraic combinatorics, and the theory of cluster algebras. In general, we count Dynkin friezes of rank $n$ by determining the positive integral points on certain $n$-dimensional affine varieties with infinitely many integral points.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12823v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this note is to rectify a typographical error in the statements of Theorems 5.5 and 5.6 of Sharma, Chauhan and Singh[3] and further analyze and discuss the significance of the results derived in Takieldin and Sol\'e [4]. In our opinion, several claims made by the authors in [4] are either factually incorrect or lack adequate substantiation, which may confuse the readers about the contributions of [1,3]. Our remarks on the work [4] intend to provide the clarity and inform about the true contributions and findings of our research.</description>
