      <title>Maximum Caliber Infers Effective Coupling and Response from Spiking Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The characterization of network and biophysical properties from neural spiking activity is an important goal in neuroscience. A framework that provides unbiased inference on causal synaptic interaction and single neural properties has been missing. Here we applied the stochastic dynamics extension of Maximum Entropy -- the Maximum Caliber Principle -- to infer the transition rates of network states. Effective synaptic coupling strength and neuronal response functions for various network motifs can then be computed. The inferred minimal model also enables leading-order reconstruction of inter-spike interval distribution. Our method is tested with numerical simulated spiking networks and applied to data from salamander retina.</description>

      <title>Input-driven circuit reconfiguration in critical recurrent neural networks.Marcelo O. Magnasco</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Changing a circuit dynamically, without actually changing the hardware itself, is called reconfiguration, and is of great importance due to its manifold technological applications. Circuit reconfiguration appears to be a feature of the cerebral cortex, and hence understanding the neuroarchitectural and dynamical features underlying self-reconfiguration may prove key to elucidate brain function. We present a very simple single-layer recurrent network, whose signal pathways can be reconfigured "on the fly" using only its inputs, with no changes to its synaptic weights. We use the low spatio-temporal frequencies of the input to landscape the ongoing activity, which in turn permits or denies the propagation of traveling waves. This mechanism uses the inherent properties of dynamically-critical systems, which we guarantee through unitary convolution kernels. We show this network solves the classical connectedness problem, by allowing signal propagation only along the regions to be evaluated for connectedness and forbidding it elsewhere.</description>

      <title>A generalized neural tangent kernel for surrogate gradient learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: State-of-the-art neural network training methods depend on the gradient of the network function. Therefore, they cannot be applied to networks whose activation functions do not have useful derivatives, such as binary and discrete-time spiking neural networks. To overcome this problem, the activation function's derivative is commonly substituted with a surrogate derivative, giving rise to surrogate gradient learning (SGL). This method works well in practice but lacks theoretical foundation. The neural tangent kernel (NTK) has proven successful in the analysis of gradient descent. Here, we provide a generalization of the NTK, which we call the surrogate gradient NTK, that enables the analysis of SGL. First, we study a naive extension of the NTK to activation functions with jumps, demonstrating that gradient descent for such activation functions is also ill-posed in the infinite-width limit. To address this problem, we generalize the NTK to gradient descent with surrogate derivatives, i.e., SGL. We carefully define this generalization and expand the existing key theorems on the NTK with mathematical rigor. Further, we illustrate our findings with numerical experiments. Finally, we numerically compare SGL in networks with sign activation function and finite width to kernel regression with the surrogate gradient NTK; the results confirm that the surrogate gradient NTK provides a good characterization of SGL.</description>

      <title>realSEUDO for real-time calcium imaging analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Closed-loop neuroscience experimentation, where recorded neural activity is used to modify the experiment on-the-fly, is critical for deducing causal connections and optimizing experimental time. A critical step in creating a closed-loop experiment is real-time inference of neural activity from streaming recordings. One challenging modality for real-time processing is multi-photon calcium imaging (CI). CI enables the recording of activity in large populations of neurons however, often requires batch processing of the video data to extract single-neuron activity from the fluorescence videos. We use the recently proposed robust time-trace estimator-Sparse Emulation of Unused Dictionary Objects (SEUDO) algorithm-as a basis for a new on-line processing algorithm that simultaneously identifies neurons in the fluorescence video and infers their time traces in a way that is robust to as-yet unidentified neurons. To achieve real-time SEUDO (realSEUDO), we optimize the core estimator via both algorithmic improvements and an fast C-based implementation, and create a new cell finding loop to enable realSEUDO to also identify new cells. We demonstrate comparable performance to offline algorithms (e.g., CNMF), and improved performance over the current on-line approach (OnACID) at speeds of 120 Hz on average.</description>

      <title>Predicting Parkinson's disease trajectory using clinical and functional MRI features: a reproduction and replication study</title>

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder with a poorly understood physiopathology and no established biomarkers for the diagnosis of early stages and for prediction of disease progression. Several neuroimaging biomarkers have been studied recently, but these are susceptible to several sources of variability. In this context, an evaluation of the robustness of such biomarkers is essential. This study is part of a larger project investigating the replicability of potential neuroimaging biomarkers of PD. Here, we attempt to reproduce (same data, same method) and replicate (different data or method) the models described in Nguyen et al., 2021 to predict individual's PD current state and progression using demographic, clinical and neuroimaging features (fALFF and ReHo extracted from resting-state fMRI). We use the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative dataset (PPMI, ppmi-info.org), as in Nguyen et al.,2021 and aim to reproduce the original cohort, imaging features and machine learning models as closely as possible using the information available in the paper and the code. We also investigated methodological variations in cohort selection, feature extraction pipelines and sets of input features. The success of the reproduction was assessed using different criteria. Notably, we obtained significantly better than chance performance using the analysis pipeline closest to that in the original study (R2 &gt; 0), which is consistent with its findings. The challenges encountered while reproducing and replicating the original work are likely explained by the complexity of neuroimaging studies, in particular in clinical settings. We provide recommendations to further facilitate the reproducibility of such studies in the future.</description>

      <title>Critical Learning Periods Emerge Even in Deep Linear Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.12221v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Critical learning periods are periods early in development where temporary sensory deficits can have a permanent effect on behavior and learned representations. Despite the radical differences between biological and artificial networks, critical learning periods have been empirically observed in both systems. This suggests that critical periods may be fundamental to learning and not an accident of biology. Yet, why exactly critical periods emerge in deep networks is still an open question, and in particular it is unclear whether the critical periods observed in both systems depend on particular architectural or optimization details. To isolate the key underlying factors, we focus on deep linear network models, and show that, surprisingly, such networks also display much of the behavior seen in biology and artificial networks, while being amenable to analytical treatment. We show that critical periods depend on the depth of the model and structure of the data distribution. We also show analytically and in simulations that the learning of features is tied to competition between sources. Finally, we extend our analysis to multi-task learning to show that pre-training on certain tasks can damage the transfer performance on new tasks, and show how this depends on the relationship between tasks and the duration of the pre-training stage. To the best of our knowledge, our work provides the first analytically tractable model that sheds light into why critical learning periods emerge in biological and artificial networks.</description>

      <title>How do correlations shape the landscape of information?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00737v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore a few common models on how correlations affect information. The main model considered is the Shannon mutual information $I(S:R_1,\cdots, R_i)$ over distributions with marginals $P_{S,R_i}$ fixed for each $i$, with the analogy in which $S$ is the stimulus and $R_i$'s are neurons. We work out basic models in details, using algebro-geometric tools to write down discriminants that separate distributions with distinct qualitative behaviours in the probability simplex into toric chambers and evaluate the volumes of them algebraically. As a byproduct, we provide direct translation between a decomposition of mutual information inspired by a series expansion and one from partial information decomposition (PID) problems, characterising the synergistic terms of the former. We hope this paper serves for communication between communities especially mathematics and theoretical neuroscience on the topic.
