      <title>What is glacier sliding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Glacier and ice-sheet motion is fundamental to glaciology. However, there is still no clear consensus for the optimal way to describe glacier and ice-sheet sliding. Typically, sliding is parameterised using a traction coefficient nominally linked to a given theory describing one or a limited set of sliding processes. However, this approach precludes the possibility of multiple simultaneous and spatio-temporally varying sliding modes with inaccuracies resulting in model error propagation as the system evolves away from the conditions under which it was optimised for. Here, revisiting early theoretical work, we describe glacier sliding as a scale- and setting-dependent 'inner flow' that arises from multiple overlapping sub-processes, bridging divides between hard and soft beds, rough and smooth beds, and stick-slip and continuous sliding as well as providing a consistent definition for form drag. The corresponding 'outer flow' then accounts for 'normal' ice deformation. We propose that the significance of 'Iken's bound' is then reduced if form drag dominates over subglacial cavitation in a given region, possibly explaining the persistent functionality of Weertman-type sliding in process-agnostic sliding studies over rough topography. Last, reviewing observation-based studies we suggest that a simple 'unified' sliding relationship controlled by a single tunable coefficient may not be a realistic prospect, but that a Weertman-type relationship with careful consideration of the power value is presently the 'least bad' option.</description>
