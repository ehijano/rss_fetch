      <title>Analytical insights from a model of opinion formation based on Persuasive Argument Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, numerous mathematical models of opinion formation have been developed, incorporating diverse interaction mechanisms such as imitation and majority rule. However, limited attention has been given to models grounded in persuasive arguments theory (PAT), which describes how individuals may alter their opinions through the exchange of arguments during discussions. Moreover, analytical investigations of PAT-based models remain sparse. In this study, we propose an analytical model rooted in PAT, demonstrating that a group of agents can exhibit two distinct collective dynamics: quasi-consensus and bipolarization. Specifically, we explore various scenarios characterized by the number of arguments and the degree of homophily, revealing that bipolarization arises within this framework only in the presence of homophily.</description>

      <title>Correlated Growth of Causal Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of causal structure in complex systems has gained increasing attention, with many recent studies exploring causal networks that capture cause-effect relationships across diverse fields. Despite increasing empirical evidence linking causal structures to network topological correlations, the mechanisms underlying the emergence of these correlations in causal networks remain poorly understood. In this Letter, we propose a general growth framework for causal networks, incorporating two key types of correlations: causal and dynamic. We analytically solve our model for degree correlation and validate the theoretical predictions against empirical data from four large-scale innovation networks. Our theory not only sheds light on the origins of topological correlations but also provides a general framework for understanding correlated growth across causal systems.</description>

      <title>Collective dynamics behind success</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the collective dynamics behind the success of ideas, products, behaviors, and social actors is critical for decision-making across diverse contexts, including hiring, funding, career choices, and the design of interventions for social change. Methodological advances and the increasing availability of big data now allow for a broader and deeper understanding of the key facets of success. Recent studies unveil regularities beneath the collective dynamics of success, pinpoint underlying mechanisms, and even enable predictions of success across diverse domains, including science, technology, business, and the arts. However, this research also uncovers troubling biases that challenge meritocratic views of success. This review synthesizes the growing, cross-disciplinary literature on the collective dynamics behind success and calls for further research on cultural influences, the origins of inequalities, the role of algorithms in perpetuating them, and experimental methods to further probe causal mechanisms behind success. Ultimately, these efforts may help to better align success with desired societal values.</description>

      <title>Complete aging in the noisy voter model enhances consensus formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of aging in the noisy voter model considering that the probability to change states decays algebraically with age $\tau$, defined as the time elapsed since adopting the current state. We study the complete aging scenario, which incorporates aging to both mechanisms of interaction: herding and idiosyncratic behavior, and compare it with the partial aging case, where aging affects only the herding mechanism. Analytical mean-field equations are derived, finding excellent agreement with agent-based simulations on a complete graph. We observe that complete aging enhances consensus formation, shifting the critical point to higher values compared to the partial aging case. However, when the aging probability decays asymptotically to zero for large $\tau$, a steady state is not always attained for complete aging.</description>

      <title>Shape and Performance of Fastest Paths over Networks with Interacting Selfish Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the evolution of the fastest paths in transportation networks under increasing congestion, modeled as a linear decrease in edge travel speed with density due to interactions among selfish agents. Moving from the common edge-based to a path-based analysis, we examine the fastest directed routes connecting random origin-destination pairs as traffic grows, characterizing their shape through effective length, maximum detour, and area under the curve, and their performance through a novel metric measuring how fast and how far an agent travels toward its destination. The entire network is characterized by analyzing the performance metric's distribution across uniformly distributed paths. The study covers both random planar networks with controlled characteristics and real urban networks of major cities. The low-density network regime, in which an initial smooth performance degradation is observed up to a critical traffic volume, is followed by the emergence of complex patterns of spatially heterogeneous slowdowns as traffic increases, rapidly leading to disjoint subnetworks. The failure of a few edges leads to a catastrophic decrease in the network performance. The fastest paths for all cities show a peak for detour and inness (and their variance) in the proximity of the critical traffic level, defined as the flex of the rejected path ratio curve. Inness generally shows a slight attraction by city centers on paths for light traffic, but this reverses to strong repulsion during congestion. We exploit path performance to uncover an asymmetric behavior of different regions of the networks when acting as origins or destinations. Finally, the Gini coefficient is used to study the unequal effects of path performance degradation with traffic.</description>

      <title>Decoding fairness: a reinforcement learning perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Behavioral experiments on the ultimatum game (UG) reveal that we humans prefer fair acts, which contradicts the prediction made in orthodox Economics. Existing explanations, however, are mostly attributed to exogenous factors within the imitation learning framework. Here, we adopt the reinforcement learning paradigm, where individuals make their moves aiming to maximize their accumulated rewards. Specifically, we apply Q-learning to UG, where each player is assigned two Q-tables to guide decisions for the roles of proposer and responder. In a two-player scenario, fairness emerges prominently when both experiences and future rewards are appreciated. In particular, the probability of successful deals increases with higher offers, which aligns with observations in behavioral experiments. Our mechanism analysis reveals that the system undergoes two phases, eventually stabilizing into fair or rational strategies. These results are robust when the rotating role assignment is replaced by a random or fixed manner, or the scenario is extended to a latticed population. Our findings thus conclude that the endogenous factor is sufficient to explain the emergence of fairness, exogenous factors are not needed.</description>

      <title>Physics-Guided Fair Graph Sampling for Water Temperature Prediction in River Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a novel graph neural networks (GNNs)-based method to predict stream water temperature and reduce model bias across locations of different income and education levels. Traditional physics-based models often have limited accuracy because they are necessarily approximations of reality. Recently, there has been an increasing interest of using GNNs in modeling complex water dynamics in stream networks. Despite their promise in improving the accuracy, GNNs can bring additional model bias through the aggregation process, where node features are updated by aggregating neighboring nodes. The bias can be especially pronounced when nodes with similar sensitive attributes are frequently connected. We introduce a new method that leverages physical knowledge to represent the node influence in GNNs, and then utilizes physics-based influence to refine the selection and weights over the neighbors. The objective is to facilitate equitable treatment over different sensitive groups in the graph aggregation, which helps reduce spatial bias over locations, especially for those in underprivileged groups. The results on the Delaware River Basin demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in preserving equitable performance across locations in different sensitive groups.</description>

      <title>The evolution of cooperation in spatial public goods game with tolerant punishment based on reputation threshold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reputation and punishment are significant guidelines for regulating individual behavior in human society, and those with a good reputation are more likely to be imitated by others. In addition, society imposes varying degrees of punishment for behaviors that harm the interests of groups with different reputations. However, conventional pairwise interaction rules and the punishment mechanism overlook this aspect. Building on this observation, this paper enhances a spatial public goods game in two key ways: 1) We set a reputation threshold and use punishment to regulate the defection behavior of players in low-reputation groups while allowing defection behavior in high-reputation game groups. 2) Differently from pairwise interaction rules, we combine reputation and payoff as the fitness of individuals to ensure that players with both high payoff and reputation have a higher chance of being imitated. Through simulations, we find that a higher reputation threshold, combined with a stringent punishment environment, can substantially enhance the level of cooperation within the population. This mechanism provides deeper insight into the widespread phenomenon of cooperation that emerges among individuals.</description>

      <title>A District-level Flood Severity Index for Flood Management in India</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01602v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: India is one of the worst affected countries in the world in terms of fatalities and economic damage due to natural disasters, particularly floods. For planning flood mitigating and relief measures, granular historical information on a pan-India basis is required, which has been missing. Through recent efforts, a few national scale datasets have been created, but they lack the requisite information on fatalities and damages, which has limited the ability to develop a flood severity index. This paper describes the development of the India Flood Inventory with Impacts (IFI-Impacts) database, which contains death and damage statistics, and combines population and historically flooded area information sourced from a national hydrologic-hydrodynamic modeling system. We also propose a novel District Flood Severity Index (DFSI), which accounts for the historical severity of floods in India based on the number of people they have affected and the spread and duration of such floods. Districts being the administrative units of the government, this novel index fulfills a major need and gap in currently available flood management tools. The dataset as well as the index is expected to significantly advance disaster preparedness towards floods in the country. DFSI can be improved further by collecting and incorporating additional variables, e.g., economic losses and by improving the reliability/robustness of the data of other variables. Based on DFSI, actions need to be addressed to mitigate flood damages, beginning with the districts with the high DFSI values.</description>

      <title>Large Language Model agents can coordinate beyond human scale</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02822v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as interacting agents, forming ``LLM societies''. Understanding whether these societies can self-organize and coordinate on norms without external influence is crucial to understand their risks and opportunities. Here we explore their opinion dynamics finding that it is governed by a majority force coefficient such that LLM societies can spontaneously reach consensus only up to a critical group size. This critical size grows exponentially with the language understanding capabilities of the models, exceeding the typical size of informal human groups for advanced LLMs. These results reveal emerging self-organization properties in LLM societies and provide insights for designing collaborative AI systems where coordination is either a goal or a risk.</description>

      <title>Perceived community alignment increases information sharing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.13796v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been proposed that information sharing, which is a ubiquitous and consequential behavior, plays a critical role in cultivating and maintaining a sense of shared reality. Across three studies, we tested this theory by investigating whether or not people are especially likely to share information that they believe will be interpreted similarly by others in their social circles. Using neuroimaging while members of the same community viewed brief film clips, we found that more similar neural responding of participants was associated with a greater likelihood to share content. We then tested this relationship using two behavioral studies and found (1) that people were particularly likely to share content that they believed others in their social circles would interpret similarly and (2) that perceived similarity with others leads to increased sharing likelihood. In concert, our findings support the idea that people are driven to share information to create and reinforce shared understanding, which is critical to social connection.</description>

      <title>Swap distance minimization beyond entropy minimization in word order variation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14192v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Here we consider the problem of all the possible orders of a linguistic structure formed by $n$ elements, for instance, subject, direct object and verb ($n=3$) or subject, direct object, indirect object and verb ($n=4$). We investigate if the frequency of the $n!$ possible orders is constrained by two principles. First, entropy minimization, a principle that has been suggested to shape natural communication systems at distinct levels of organization. Second, swap distance minimization, namely a preference for word orders that require fewer swaps of adjacent elements to be produced from a source order. Here we present average swap distance, a novel score for research on swap distance minimization, and investigate the theoretical distribution of that score for any $n$: its minimum and maximum values and its expected value in die rolling experiments or when the word order frequencies are shuffled. We investigate whether entropy and average swap distance are significantly small in distinct linguistic structures with $n=3$ or $n=4$ in agreement with the corresponding minimization principles. We find strong evidence of entropy minimization and swap distance minimization with respect to a die rolling experiment. The evidence of these two forces with respect to a Polya urn process is strong for $n=4$ but weaker for $n=3$. We still find evidence of swap distance minimization when word order frequencies are shuffled, indicating that swap distance minimization effects are beyond pressure to minimize word order entropy.</description>

      <title>Context-aware knowledge graph framework for traffic speed forecasting using graph neural network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17703v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Human mobility is intricately influenced by urban contexts spatially and temporally, constituting essential domain knowledge in understanding traffic systems. While existing traffic forecasting models primarily rely on raw traffic data and advanced deep learning techniques, incorporating contextual information remains underexplored due to insufficient integration frameworks and the complexity of urban contexts. This study proposes a novel context-aware knowledge graph (CKG) framework to enhance traffic speed forecasting by effectively modeling spatial and temporal contexts. Employing a relation-dependent integration strategy, the framework generates context-aware representations from the spatial and temporal units of CKG to capture spatio-temporal dependencies of urban contexts. A CKG-GNN model, combining the CKG, dual-view multi-head self-attention (MHSA), and graph neural network (GNN), is then designed to predict traffic speed utilizing these context-aware representations. Our experiments demonstrate that CKG's configuration significantly influences embedding performance, with ComplEx and KG2E emerging as optimal for embedding spatial and temporal units, respectively. The CKG-GNN model establishes a benchmark for 10-120 min predictions, achieving average MAE, MAPE, and RMSE of $3.46\pm0.01$, $14.76\pm0.09\%$, and $5.08\pm0.01$, respectively. Compared to the baseline DCRNN model, integrating the spatial unit improves the MAE by 0.04 and the temporal unit by 0.13, while integrating both units further reduces it by 0.18. The dual-view MHSA analysis reveals the crucial role of relation-dependent features from the context-based view and the model's ability to prioritize recent time slots in prediction from the sequence-based view. Overall, this study underscores the importance of merging context-aware knowledge graphs with graph neural networks to improve traffic forecasting.</description>
