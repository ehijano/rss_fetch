      <title>Improving Figures of Merit for Quantum Circuit Compilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing is an emerging technology that has seen significant software and hardware improvements in recent years. Executing a quantum program requires the compilation of its quantum circuit for a target Quantum Processing Unit (QPU). Various methods for qubit mapping, gate synthesis, and optimization of quantum circuits have been proposed and implemented in compilers. These compilers try to generate a quantum circuit that leads to the best execution quality - a criterion that is usually approximated by figures of merit such as the number of (two-qubit) gates, the circuit depth, expected fidelity, or estimated success probability. However, it is often unclear how well these figures of merit represent the actual execution quality on a QPU. In this work, we investigate the correlation between established figures of merit and actual execution quality on real machines - revealing that the correlation is weaker than anticipated and that more complex figures of merit are not necessarily more accurate. Motivated by this finding, we propose an improved figure of merit (based on a machine learning approach) that can be used to predict the expected execution quality of a quantum circuit for a chosen QPU without actually executing it. The employed machine learning model reveals the influence of various circuit features on generating high correlation scores. The proposed figure of merit demonstrates a strong correlation and outperforms all previous ones in a case study - achieving an average correlation improvement of 49%.</description>

      <title>QuFeX: Quantum feature extraction module for hybrid quantum-classical deep neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Quantum Feature Extraction (QuFeX), a novel quantum machine learning module. The proposed module enables feature extraction in a reduced-dimensional space, significantly decreasing the number of parallel evaluations required in typical quantum convolutional neural network architectures. Its design allows seamless integration into deep classical neural networks, making it particularly suitable for hybrid quantum-classical models. As an application of QuFeX, we propose Qu-Net -- a hybrid architecture which integrates QuFeX at the bottleneck of a U-Net architecture. The latter is widely used for image segmentation tasks such as medical imaging and autonomous driving. Our numerical analysis indicates that the Qu-Net can achieve superior segmentation performance compared to a U-Net baseline. These results highlight the potential of QuFeX to enhance deep neural networks by leveraging hybrid computational paradigms, providing a path towards a robust framework for real-world applications requiring precise feature extraction.</description>

      <title>Geometric Interpretation of Sensitivity to Structured Uncertainties in Spintronic Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a geometric model of the differential sensitivity of the fidelity error for state transfer in a spintronic network based on the relationship between a set of matrix operators. We show an explicit dependence of the differential sensitivity on the fidelity (error), and we further demonstrate that this dependence does not require a trade-off between the fidelity and sensitivity. Rather, we prove that for closed systems, ideal performance in the sense of perfect state transfer is both necessary and sufficient for optimal robustness in terms of vanishing sensitivity. We demonstrate the utility of this geometric interpretation of the sensitivity by applying the model to explain the sensitivity versus fidelity error data in two examples.</description>

      <title>Non-zero noise extrapolation: accurately simulating noisy quantum circuits with tensor networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the effects of noise on quantum computations is fundamental to the development of quantum hardware and quantum algorithms. Simulation tools are essential for quantitatively modelling these effects, yet unless artificial restrictions are placed on the circuit or noise model, accurately modelling noisy quantum computations is an extremely challenging task due to unfavourable scaling of required computational resources. Tensor network methods offer a viable solution for simulating computations that generate limited entanglement or that have noise models which yield low gate fidelities. However, in the most interesting regime of entangling circuits (with high gate fidelities) relevant for error correction and mitigation tensor network simulations often achieve poor accuracy.
  In this work we develop and numerically test a method for significantly improving the accuracy of tensor network simulations of noisy quantum circuits in the low-noise (i.e. high gate-fidelity) regime. Our method comes with the advantages that it (i) allows for the simulation of quantum circuits under generic types of noise model, (ii) is especially tailored to the low-noise regime, and (iii) retains the benefits of tensor network scaling, enabling efficient simulations of large numbers of qubits. We build upon the observations that adding extra noise to a quantum circuit makes it easier to simulate with tensor networks, and that the results can later be reliably extrapolated back to the low-noise regime of interest. These observations form the basis for a novel emulation technique that we call non-zero noise extrapolation, in analogy to the quantum error mitigation technique of zero-noise extrapolation.</description>

      <title>ASDF: A Compiler for Qwerty, a Basis-Oriented Quantum Programming Language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Qwerty is a high-level quantum programming language built on bases and functions rather than circuits. This new paradigm introduces new challenges in compilation, namely synthesizing circuits from basis translations and automatically specializing adjoint or predicated forms of functions. This paper presents ASDF, an open-source compiler for Qwerty that answers these challenges in compiling basis-oriented languages. Enabled with a novel high-level quantum IR implemented in the MLIR framework, our compiler produces OpenQASM 3 or QIR for either simulation or execution on hardware. Our compiler is evaluated by comparing the fault-tolerant resource requirements of generated circuits with other compilers, finding that ASDF produces circuits with comparable cost to prior circuit-oriented compilers.</description>

      <title>Escaping Barren Plateau: Co-Exploration of Quantum Circuit Parameters and Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Barren plateaus (BP), characterized by exponentially vanishing gradients that hinder the training of variational quantum circuits (VQC), present a pervasive and critical challenge in applying variational quantum algorithms to real-world applications. It is widely recognized that the BP problem becomes more pronounced with an increase in the number of parameters. This work demonstrates that the BP problem manifests at different scales depending on the specific application, highlighting the absence of a universal VQC ansatz capable of resolving the BP issue across all applications. Consequently, there is an imminent need for an automated tool to design and optimize VQC architectures tailored to specific applications. To close the gap, this paper takes Variational Quantum Eigensolvers (VQEs) as a vehicle, and we propose a novel quantum circuit parameter and architecture co-exploration framework, namely AntiBP. Experimental results demonstrate that AntiBP effectively avoids the BP issue for circuits that are not under-parameterized in noise-free environments. Furthermore, AntiBP significantly outperforms baseline VQEs in noisy environments.</description>

      <title>Aspects of Complexity in Quantum Evolutions on the Bloch Sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We enhance our quantitative comprehension of the complexity associated with both time-optimal and time sub-optimal quantum Hamiltonian evolutions that connect arbitrary source and target states on the Bloch sphere, as recently presented in Nucl. Phys. B1010, 116755 (2025). Initially, we examine each unitary Schrodinger quantum evolution selected through various metrics, such as path length, geodesic efficiency, speed efficiency, and the curvature coefficient of the corresponding quantum-mechanical trajectory that connects the source state to the target state on the Bloch sphere. Subsequently, we evaluate the selected evolutions using our proposed measure of complexity, as well as in relation to the concept of complexity length scale. The choice of both time-optimal and time sub-optimal evolutions, along with the selection of source and target states, enables us to conduct pertinent sanity checks that seek to validate the physical relevance of the framework supporting our proposed complexity measure. Our research suggests that, in general, efficient quantum evolutions possess a lower complexity than their inefficient counterparts. However, it is important to recognize that complexity is not solely determined by length; in fact, longer trajectories that are adequately curved may exhibit a complexity that is less than or equal to that of shorter trajectories with a lower curvature coefficient.</description>

      <title>The Economics of an Open-Source Quantum Computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open-source projects that aim to make their offerings public have competed against for-profit, proprietary companies in a number of domains. These open-source projects often arise in response to the offerings of proprietary companies in markets where products have already been commercialized. We assess what impact an open-source project might have when it enters the market for quantum computing - a market where the core technology is still being developed. We argue that an open-source quantum computer might alleviate market frictions that have impeded the development of a fault-tolerant quantum computer by providing the market with a possible mechanism for: 1.) benchmarking, 2.) the development of hardware agnostic technology, and 3.) improved liquidity on the supply side of the market for labor. Should these outcomes be realized, they may not only benefit the open-source project, but also the for-profit, proprietary companies operating in the ecosystem. In this respect, an open-source quantum project may play a more complementary role to the proprietary firms in the ecosystem, rather than a more competitive role. Our collective insights may have implications for other settings where an open-source project enters into a market where the core technology has yet to be commercialized.</description>

      <title>Non-unitary Variational Quantum Eigensolver with the Localized Active Space Method and Cost Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately describing strongly correlated systems with affordable quantum resources remains a central challenge for quantum chemistry applications on near and intermediate-term quantum computers. The localized active space self-consistent field (LASSCF) approximates the complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF) by generating active space-based wave functions within specific fragments while treating interfragment correlation with mean-field approach, hence is computationally less expensive. Hardware-efficient ansatzes (HEA) offer affordable and shallower circuits, yet they often fail to capture the necessary correlation. Previously, Jastrow-factor-inspired non-unitary qubit operators were proposed to use with HEA for variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) calculations (nuVQE), as they do not increase circuit depths and recover correlation beyond the mean-field level for Hartree-Fock initial states. Here, we explore running nuVQE with LASSCF as the initial state. The method, named LAS-nuVQE, is shown to recover interfragment correlations, reach chemical accuracy with a small number of gates (&lt;70) in both H4 and square cyclobutadiene. To further address the inherent symmetry-breaking in HEA, we implemented spin-constrained LAS-nuVQE to extend the capabilities of HEA further and show spin-pure results for square cyclobutadiene. We mitigate the increased measurement overhead of nuVQE via Pauli grouping and shot-frugal sampling, reducing measurement costs by up to two orders of magnitude compared to ungrouped operator, and show that one can achieve better accuracy with a small number of shots (10^3-4) per one expectation value calculation compared to noiseless simulations with one or two orders of magnitude more shots. Finally, wall clock time estimates show that, with our measurement mitigation protocols, nuVQE becomes a cheaper and more accurate alternative than VQE with HEA.</description>

      <title>Native Three-Body Interactions in a Superconducting Lattice Gauge Quantum Simulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While universal quantum computers remain under development, analog quantum simulators offer a powerful alternative for understanding complex systems in condensed matter, chemistry, and high-energy physics. One compelling application is the characterization of real-time lattice gauge theories (LGTs). LGTs are nonperturbative tools, utilizing discretized spacetime to describe gauge-invariant models. They hold immense potential for understanding fundamental physics but require enforcing local constraints analogous to electromagnetism's Gauss's Law. These constraints, which arise from gauge symmetries and dictate the form of the interaction between matter and gauge fields, are a significant challenge for simulators to enforce. Implementing these constraints at the hardware level in analog simulations is crucial. This requires realizing multibody interactions between matter and gauge-field elements, enabling them to evolve together while suppressing unwanted two-body interactions that violate the gauge symmetry. In this paper, we propose and implement a novel parametrically activated three-qubit interaction within a circuit quantum electrodynamics architecture. We experimentally demonstrate a minimal $U(1)$ spin-1/2 model with a time evolution that intrinsically satisfies Gauss's law in the system. This design serves as the foundational block for simulating LGTs on a superconducting photonic lattice.</description>

      <title>Linear extrapolation for the graph of function of single variable based on walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum walk was introduced as a quantum counterpart of the random walk and has been intensively studied since around 2000. Its applications include topological insulators, radioactive waste reduction, and quantum search. The first author in 2019 defined a time-series model based on the measure of the ``discrete-time" and ``discrete-space" quantum walk in one dimension. Inspired by his model, this paper proposes a new model for the graph of a function of a single variable determined by the measure which comes from the weak limit measure of a ``continuous-time or discrete-time" and ``discrete-space" walk. The measure corresponds to a ``continuous-time" and ``continuous-space" walk in one dimension. Moreover, we also presents a method of a linear extrapolation for the graph by our model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Grover algorithm is one of the most famous quantum algorithms. On the other hand, the absolute zeta function can be regarded as a zeta function over $\mathbb{F}_{1}$ defined by a function satisfying the absolute automorphy. In this study, we show the property of the Grover algorithm and present a relation between the Grover algorithm and the absolute zeta function. We focus on the period of the Grover algorithm, because if the period is finite, then we are able to get an absolute zeta function explicitly by Kurokawa's theorem. In addition, whenever the period is finite or not, an expansion of the absolute zeta function can be obtained by a direct computation.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Drug Discovery: Quantum Machine Learning for QSAR Prediction with Incomplete Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Qualitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) is important for drug discovery and offers valuable insights into the biological interactions of potential drug candidates. It has been demonstrated that QSAR can be accurately predicted by machine learning. However, data with poor quality and limited availability are always the most common and critical issues for medical-related applications for machine learning. In this manuscript, we aim to discuss the performance of classical and quantum classifiers in QSAR prediction and attempt to demonstrate the quantum advantages in the generalization power of the quantum classifier under conditions of limited data availability and a reduced number of features. By applying different data embedding methods followed by feature selection through principal component analysis (PCA), we find that the quantum classifier outperforms the classical one when a small number of features are selected and the number of training samples is limited. The generality of quantum advantages in other open datasets is also explored.</description>

      <title>Quantum computational advantage of noisy boson sampling with partially distinguishable photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Boson sampling stands out as a promising approach toward experimental demonstration of quantum computational advantage. However, the presence of physical noise in near-term experiments hinders the realization of the quantum computational advantage with boson sampling. Since physical noise in near-term boson sampling devices is inevitable, precise characterization of the boundary of noise rates where the classical intractability of boson sampling is maintained is crucial for quantum computational advantage using near-term devices. In this work, we identify the level of partial distinguishability noise that upholds the classical intractability of boson sampling. We find that boson sampling with on average $O(\log N)$ number of distinguishable photons out of $N$ input photons maintains the equivalent complexity to the ideal boson sampling case. By providing strong complexity theoretical evidence of the classical intractability of noisy boson sampling, we expect that our findings will enable one to ultimately demonstrate quantum computational advantage with noisy boson sampling experiments in the near future.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement asymmetry has emerged as a novel tool for characterizing symmetry breaking in quantum many-body systems. In this Letter, we investigate how symmetry is dynamically broken through the lens of entanglement asymmetry in two distinct scenarios: a non-symmetric random quantum circuit and a non-symmetric Hamiltonian quench, with a particular focus on U(1) symmetry. In the former case, the symmetry is first broken and then restored while in the latter case, symmetry remains broken in the subsystem at late times, aligning with the concept of quantum thermalization. Entanglement asymmetry growth exhibits unexpected overshooting behavior at early times in both contexts. We also consider dynamics of non-symmetric initial states under the symmetry-breaking evolution. Due to the competition of symmetry-breaking in both the initial state and Hamiltonian, the early-time entanglement asymmetry displays two qualitatively different behaviors. Furthermore, quantum Mpemba effects remain evident despite the presence of weak symmetry-breaking in both settings.</description>

      <title>Improving Quantum Optimization to Achieve Quadratic Time Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a promising candidate for achieving quantum advantage in combinatorial optimization. However, its variational framework presents a long-standing challenge in selecting circuit parameters. In this work, we prove that the energy expectation produced by QAOA can be expressed as a trigonometric function of the final-level mixer parameter. Leveraging this insight, we introduce Penta-O, a level-wise parameter-setting strategy that eliminates the classical outer loop, maintains minimal sampling overhead, and ensures non-decreasing performance. This method is broadly applicable to the generic quadratic unconstrained binary optimization formulated as the Ising model. For a $p$-level QAOA, Penta-O achieves an unprecedented quadratic time complexity of $\mathcal{O}(p^2)$ and a sampling overhead proportional to $5p+1$. Through experiments and simulations, we demonstrate that QAOA enhanced by Penta-O achieves near-optimal performance with exceptional circuit depth efficiency. Our work provides a versatile tool for advancing variational quantum algorithms.</description>

      <title>Quantum key distribution overcoming practical correlated intensity fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intensity correlations between neighboring pulses open a prevalent yet often overlooked security loophole in decoy-state quantum key distribution (QKD). As a solution, we present and experimentally demonstrate an intensity-correlation-tolerant QKD protocol that mitigates the negative effect that this phenomenon has on the secret key rate according to existing security analyses. Compared to previous approaches, our method significantly enhances the robustness against correlations, notably improving both the maximum transmission distances and the achievable secret key rates across different scenarios. By relaxing constraints on correlation parameters, our protocol enables practical devices to counter intensity correlations. We experimentally demonstrate this first practical solution that directly overcomes this security vulnerability, establish the feasibility and efficacy of our proposal, taking a major step towards loophole-free and high-performance QKD.</description>

      <title>(111) Si spin qubits constructed on L point of band structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: (001) Si spin qubits are being intensively studied because they have structures similar to that of CMOS devices currently being produced, and thus have the advantage of utilizing state-of-the-art miniaturization, integration, and variation-reduction-technologies. However, there are still issues, such as further improvement of relaxation and decoherence time, stabilization of valley-splitting control, and reduction of the variation caused by the roughness of the interface. In this study, new measures are proposed to address these three issues. Instead of confining an electron to the minimum energy point $X_0$ of the conduction band along the band structure $\Gamma-\Delta-X$ in (001) Si crystals, we propose confining an electron to the L point along $\Gamma-\Lambda-L$ in (111) Si crystals. At the $X_0$ point, the symmetry causes spin-orbit interaction to act on the electron, and the sixfold degeneracy is lifted into a fourfold and a twofold, and the valley-splitting of the twofold conflicts with the two-level system. In the symmetry of the $L$ point, substantial spin polarization disappears, facilitating the reduction of the spin-orbit interaction, and the fourfold degeneracy is lifted to threefold and single, and the single becomes ground state. The need to increase the magnitude of the valley-splitting is exempt, allowing the electron to be controlled away from the interface, which is expected to reduce the variation caused by the roughness of the interface. Data on the confinement of an electron to the $L$ point and the control of fourfold degeneracy are needed, and it is hoped that prototype silicon spin qubits constructed on (111) Si crystals will be developed and that the proposed device structure will help implement quantum computers based on Si devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate how the initial state of ultracold atoms in an optical lattice controls the emergence of ergodic dynamics as the underlying spectral structure is tuned into the quantum chaotic regime. Distinct initial states' chaos threshold values in terms of tunneling as compared to interaction strength are identified, as well as dynamical signatures of the chaos transition, on the level of experimentally accessible observables and time scales.</description>

      <title>Overcoming temperature limitations in laser cooling using dressed states and diamond vacancies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The established approach to laser cooling of solids relies on anti-Stokes fluorescence, for example from rare earth impurities in glass. Although successful, there is a minimum temperature to which such a process can cool set by the electronic level spacing in the impurity. We propose an alternative method which does not suffer from this limitation. Our approach relies on the formation of dressed states under strong laser driving, which generates a spectrum in which the gaps can be tuned to optimize the heat absorption. This allows for a cooling cycle which operates at any temperature with a power comparable to the maximum dictated by thermodynamic principles. While this cooling cycle will compete with heating due to non-radiative decay and other mechanisms, it could in principle allow laser cooling to temperatures which are unachievable with anti-Stokes fluorescence.</description>

      <title>Transfer matrix approach to quantum systems subject to certain Lindblad evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving for time evolution of a many particle system whose dynamics is governed by Lindblad equation is hard. We extend the use of transfer matrix approach to a class of Linblad equations that admit a closed hierarchy of two point correlators. An example that we treat is the XX spin chain, i.e., free fermions, subject to the local on-site dephasing, but can be extended to other Hermitian dissipators, e.g., non-local dephasing. We find a simple expression of the Green's function in the Laplace domain. The method can be used to get analytical results in the thermodynamic limit, for instance, to get the evolution of magnetization density and to explicitly see the cross over between the ballistic and diffusive behavior, or to show that the correlations between operators at distance $l$ decay with time as $1/t^{\lceil l/2 \rceil+1/2}$. It also provides a fast numerical method to determine the evolution of the density with a complexity scaling with the system size more favorably than in previous methods, easily allowing one to study systems with $\sim 10^6$ spins.</description>

      <title>Characterization and Optimization of Tunable Couplers via Adiabatic Control in Superconducting Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the pursuit of scalable superconducting quantum computing, tunable couplers have emerged as a pivotal component, offering the flexibility required for complex quantum operations of high performance. In most current architectures of superconducting quantum chips, such couplers are not equipped with dedicated readout circuits to reduce complexity in both design and operation. However, this strategy poses challenges in precise characterization, calibration, and control of the couplers. In this work, we develop a hardware-efficient and robust technique based on adiabatic control to address the above issue. The critical ingredient of this technique is adiabatic swap (aSWAP) operation between a tunable coupler and nearby qubits. Using this technique, we have characterized and calibrated tunable couplers in our chips and achieved straightforward and precise control over these couplers. For example, we have demonstrated the calibration and correction of the flux distortion of couplers. In addition, we have also expanded this technique to tune the dispersive shift between a frequency-fixed qubit and its readout resonator over a wide range.</description>

      <title>Characterizing phase transitions and criticality in non-Hermitian extensions of the XY model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we study non-Hermitian extensions of the paradigmatic spin-1/2 XY chain in a magnetic field. Using the mapping of the model to free fermion form, we provide analytical insights into the energy spectrum of the non-Hermitian model and establish an intrinsic connection between the quasienergies and topological invariants. We also use exact diagonalization as a supplementary method to examine the performance of biorthogonal-based expectation values. Our results confirm that the theoretical analysis is consistent with the numerical results, with the extended phase diagram determined via the analytical solution and the critical behavior of the fidelity and entanglement. The entanglement transition goes hand in hand with the non-Hermitian topological phase transition. Like the Hermitian case, we analyze the critical behavior using finite-size scaling. Our results show that non-Hermiticity can induce the system into a new universality class with unusual critical exponent. We also emphasize the ability of the Loschmidt echo to characterize potential phase transitions and introduce the average of the Loschmidt echo to describe phase transitions in non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the problem of reconstructing an unknown quantum state of a multipartite system from repeated measurements of local observables. In particular, via a system-theoretic observability analysis, we show that, even when the initial state is not uniquely determined for a static system, this can be reconstructed if we leverage the system's dynamics. The choice of dynamical generators and the effect of finite samples is discussed, along with an illustrative example.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Channel Distillation via Indefinite Causal Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum switch has been widely studied as a prototypical example of indefinite causal order in quantum information processing. However, the potential advantages of utilising more general forms of indefinite causal orders remain largely unexplored. We study higher-order switches, which involve concatenated applications of the quantum switch, and we demonstrate that they provide a strict advantage over the conventional quantum switch in the task of quantum channel distillation. Specifically, we show that higher-order quantum switches enable the probabilistic distillation of any qubit Pauli channel into the identity channel with nonzero probability. This capability contrasts with the conventional quantum switch, which allows only a limited set of Pauli channels to be distilled with nonzero probability. We observe that, counterintuitively, the distillation rate generally increases the noisier the channel is. We fully characterise the asymptotic distillation rates of higher-order superswitches for qubit Pauli channels. Finally, we prove a no-go result for multi-qubit generalisations.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal interactions induce frequency shifts in superradiant lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superradiant lasers, which consist of incoherently driven atoms coupled to a lossy cavity, are a promising source of coherent light due to their stable frequency and superior narrow linewidth. We show that when a fraction of the atoms is not driven, a shift in the lasing frequency and a broadening of the linewidth occur, limiting the performance of a superradiant laser. We explain this behavior by identifying nonreciprocal interactions between driven and undriven atoms, i.e., competing alignment and antialignment of their dipoles. Our results have implications for the realization of superradiant lasers, establishing the relevance of nonreciprocal phenomena for quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Can effective descriptions of bosonic systems be considered complete?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bosonic statistics give rise to remarkable phenomena, from the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect to Bose-Einstein condensation, with applications spanning fundamental science to quantum technologies. Modeling bosonic systems relies heavily on effective descriptions: typical examples include truncating their infinite-dimensional state space and restricting their dynamics to a simple class of Hamiltonians, such as polynomials of canonical operators, which are used to define quantum computing over bosonic modes. However, many natural bosonic Hamiltonians do not belong to this simple class, and some quantum effects harnessed by bosonic computers inherently require infinite-dimensional spaces, questioning the validity of such effective descriptions of bosonic systems. How can we trust results obtained with such simplifying assumptions to capture real effects?
  Driven by the increasing importance of bosonic systems for quantum technologies, we solve this outstanding problem by showing that these effective descriptions do in fact capture the relevant physics of bosonic systems. Our technical contribution is twofold: firstly, we prove that any physical, bosonic unitary evolution can be strongly approximated by a finite-dimensional unitary evolution; secondly, we show that any finite-dimensional unitary evolution can be generated exactly by a bosonic Hamiltonian that is a polynomial of canonical operators. Beyond their fundamental significance, our results have implications for classical and quantum simulations of bosonic systems, they provide universal methods for engineering bosonic quantum states and Hamiltonians, they show that polynomial Hamiltonians do generate universal gate sets for quantum computing over bosonic modes, and they lead to an infinite-dimensional Solovay--Kitaev theorem.</description>

      <title>Efficient Fermi-Hubbard model ground-state preparation by coupling to a classical reservoir in the instantaneous-response limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Preparing the ground state of the Fermi-Hubbard model is challenging, in part due to the exponentially large Hilbert space, which complicates efficiently finding a path from an initial state to the ground state using the variational principle. In this work, we propose an approach for ground state preparation of interacting models by involving a classical reservoir, simplified to the instantaneous-response limit, which can be described using a Hamiltonian formalism. The resulting time evolution operator consist of spin-adapted nearest-neighbor hopping and on-site interaction terms similar to those in the Hubbard model, without expanding the Hilbert space. We can engineer the coupling to rapidly drive the system from an initial product state to its interacting ground state by numerically minimizing the final state energy. This ansatz closely resembles the Hamiltonian variational ansatz, offering a fresh perspective on it.</description>

      <title>Quantum model reduction for continuous-time quantum filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of quantum stochastic models is widespread in dynamical reduction, simulation of open systems, feedback control and adaptive estimation. In many applications only part of the information contained in the filter's state is actually needed to reconstruct the target observable quantities; thus, filters of smaller dimensions could be in principle implemented to perform the same task.In this work, we propose a systematic method to find, when possible, reduced-order quantum filters that are capable of exactly reproducing the evolution of expectation values of interest. In contrast with existing reduction techniques, the reduced model we obtain is exact and in the form of a Belavkin filtering equation, ensuring physical interpretability.This is attained by leveraging tools from the theory of both minimal realization and non-commutative conditional expectations. The proposed procedure is tested on prototypical examples, laying the groundwork for applications in quantum trajectory simulation and quantum feedback control.</description>

      <title>The simplest 2D quantum walk detects chaoticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum walks have been actively studied from many perspectives, mainly from the statistical physics and quantum information points of view. We here determine the influence of basic chaotic features on the walker behavior. We consider an extremely simple model consisting of alternate one-dimensional walks along the two spatial coordinates of bidimensional closed domains (hard wall billiards). The chaotic or regular behavior that the shape of the boundary induces in the deterministic classical equations of motion and that translates into chaotic signatures for the quantized problem also results in sharp differences for the spectral statistics and morphology of the eigenfunctions of the quantum walker. Unexpectedly, two different quantum mechanical problems share the same kind of features related to the corresponding classical dynamics of one of them.</description>

Abstract: On-demand generation of single photons from solid-state quantum emitters is a key building block for future quantum networks, particularly quantum key distribution (QKD) systems, by enabling higher secure key rates (SKR) and lower quantum bit error rates (QBER). In this work, we demonstrate the B92 protocol based on single photons from defects in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). The results show a sifted key rate (SiKR) of 17.5 kbps with a QBER of 6.49 % at a dynamic polarization encoding rate of 40 MHz. Finite-key analysis yields a SKR of 7 kbps, as one of the highest SKR obtained for any room-temperature single photon source. Our results highlight the potential of hBN defects in advancing quantum communication technologies.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian Simulation via Stochastic Zassenhaus Expansions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the stochastic Zassenhaus expansions (SZEs), a class of ancilla-free quantum algorithms for Hamiltonian simulation. These algorithms map nested Zassenhaus formulas onto quantum gates and then employ randomized sampling to minimize circuit depths. Unlike Suzuki-Trotter product formulas, which grow exponentially long with approximation order, the nested commutator structures of SZEs enable high-order formulas for many systems of interest. For a 10-qubit transverse-field Ising model, we construct an 11th-order SZE with 42x fewer CNOTs than the standard 10th-order product formula. Further, we empirically demonstrate regimes where SZEs reduce simulation errors by many orders of magnitude compared to leading algorithms.</description>

      <title>Efficient Mitigation of Error Floors in Quantum Error Correction using Non-Binary Low-Density Parity-Check Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an efficient method to reduce error floors in quantum error correction using non-binary low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. We identify and classify cycle structures in the parity-check matrix where estimated noise becomes trapped, and develop tailored decoding methods for each cycle type. For Type-I cycles, we propose a method to make the difference between estimated and true noise degenerate. Type-II cycles are shown to be uncorrectable, while for Type-III cycles, we utilize the fact that cycles in non-binary LDPC codes do not necessarily correspond to codewords, allowing us to estimate the true noise. Our method significantly improves decoding performance and reduces error floors.</description>

      <title>Exponentially slow thermalization in 1D fragmented dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the thermalization dynamics of 1D systems with local constraints coupled to an infinite temperature bath at one boundary. The coupling to the bath eventually erases the effects of the constraints, causing the system to tend towards a maximally mixed state at long times. We show that for a large class of local constraints, the time at which thermalization occurs can be extremely long. In particular, we present evidence for the following conjecture: when the constrained dynamics displays strong Hilbert space fragmentation, the thermalization time diverges exponentially with system size. We show that this conjecture holds for a wide range of dynamical constraints, including dipole-conserving dynamics, the $tJ_z$ model, and a large class of group-based dynamics, and relate a general proof of our conjecture to a different conjecture about the existence of certain expander graphs.</description>

      <title>Quantum Many-Body Lattice C-R-T Symmetry: Fractionalization, Anomaly, and Symmetric Mass Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Charge conjugation (C), mirror reflection (R), and time reversal (T) symmetries, along with internal symmetries, are essential for massless Majorana and Dirac fermions. These symmetries are sufficient to rule out potential fermion bilinear mass terms, thereby establishing a gapless free fermion fixed point phase, pivotal for symmetric mass generation (SMG) transition. In this work, we systematically study the anomaly of C-R-T-internal symmetry in all spacetime dimensions by analyzing the projective representation (i.e. the fractionalization) of the C-R-T-internal symmetry group in the quantum many-body Hilbert space on the lattice. By discovering the fermion-flavor-number-dependent C-R-T-internal symmetry's anomaly structure, we demonstrate an alternative way to derive the minimal flavor number for SMG, which shows consistency with known results from K\"ahler-Dirac fermion or cobordism classification. Our findings reveal that, in general spatial dimensions, either 8 copies of staggered Majorana fermions or 4 copies of staggered Dirac fermions admit SMG. By directly searching for 4-fermion interactions that form commuting stabilizers respecting all symmetry constraints, we can prove the explicit SMG gapping retained a unique ground state in the codespace. Furthermore, we establish the correspondence between the symmetry operators of staggered fermions and free fermions, which is instrumental in facilitating the analysis of symmetry fractionalization at the field theory level.</description>

      <title>Random Quantum Circuits with Time-Reversal Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time-reversal (TR) symmetry is crucial for understanding a wide range of physical phenomena, and plays a key role in constraining fundamental particle interactions and in classifying phases of quantum matter. In this work, we introduce an ensemble of random quantum circuits that are representative of the dynamics of generic TR-invariant many-body quantum systems. We derive a general statistical mechanics model describing entanglement, many-body quantum chaos and quantum information dynamics in such TR-invariant circuits. As an example of application of our formalism, we study the universal properties of measurement-induced phase transitions (MIPT) in monitored TR-invariant systems, with measurements performed in a TR-invariant basis. We find that TR-invariance of the unitary part of the dynamics does not affect the universality class, unless measurement outcomes are post-selected to satisfy the global TR-invariance of each quantum trajectory. We confirm these predictions numerically, and find, for both generic and Clifford-based evolutions, novel critical exponents in the case of ``strong'', i.e. global TR-invariance where each quantum trajectory is TR-invariant.</description>

      <title>Quantum chaos at finite temperature in local spin Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the emergence of chaos in many-body quantum systems away from semi-classical limits, particularly in spatially local interacting spin Hamiltonians, has been a long-standing problem. In these intrinsically quantum regimes, quantum chaos has been primarily understood through the correspondence between the eigensystem statistics of midspectrum eigenstates and the universal statistics described by random matrix theory (RMT). However, this correspondence no longer holds for finite-temperature eigenstates. Here we show that the statistical properties of finite-temperature eigenstates of quantum chaotic Hamiltonians can be accurately described by pure random states constrained by a local charge, with the average charge density of the constrained random state ensemble playing the same role as the average energy density of the eigenstates. By properly normalizing the energy density using a single Hamiltonian-dependent parameter that quantifies the typical energy per degree of freedom, we find excellent agreement between the entanglement entropy statistics of eigenstates and that of constrained random states. Interestingly, in small pockets of Hamiltonian parameter phase space which we previously identified as `maximally chaotic' [PRX 14, 031014 (2024)], we find excellent agreement not only at the level of the first moment, including O(1) corrections, but also at the level of statistical fluctuations. These results show that notions of maximal chaos -- in terms of how much randomness eigenstates contain -- can still be defined at finite temperature in physical Hamiltonian models away from semi-classical and large-$N$ limits.</description>

      <title>Ground States of the Mean-Field Spin Glass with 3-Spin Couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use heuristic optimization methods in extensive computations to determine with low systematic error ground state configurations of the mean-field $p$-spin glass model with $p=3$. Here, all possible triplets in a system of $N$ Ising spins are connected with a bond. This model has been of recent interest, since it exhibits the ``overlap gap condition'', which should make it prohibitive to find ground states asymptotically with local search methods when compared, for instance, with the $p=2$ case better-known as the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model (SK). Indeed, it proves more costly to find good approximations for $p=3$ than for SK, even for our heuristic. Compared to SK, the ground-state behavior for $p=3$ is quite distinct also in other ways. For SK, finite-size corrections for large system sizes $N\to\infty$ of both, the ensemble average over ground state energy densities and the width of their distribution, vary anomalously with non-integer exponents. In the $p=3$ case here, the energy density and its distribution appear to scale with $\ln N/N$ and $1/N$ corrections, respectively. The distribution itself is consistent with a Gumbel form. Even more stark is the contrast for the bond-diluted case, where SK has shown previously a notable variation of the anomalous corrections exponent with the bond density, while for $p=3$ no such variation is found here. Hence, for the 3-spin model, all measured corrections scale the same as for the random energy model (REM), corresponding to $p=\infty$. This would suggest that all $p$-spin models with $p\geq3$ exhibit the same ground-state corrections as in REM.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Technology Landscape through Topic Modeling, Expert Involvement, and Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a method for exploring advancements in a specific technological domain. It combines topic modeling, expert input, and reinforcement learning (RL). The proposed approach has three key steps: (1) generate aspect-based topic models using expert-weighted keywords to emphasize critical aspects, (2) analyze similarities and entropy changes by comparing topic distributions across iterative models, and (3) refine topic selection using reinforcement learning (RL) with a modified reward function that integrates changes in topic divergence and similarity across iterations. The method is tested on quantum communication documents with a focus on advances in cryptography and security protocols. The results show the method's effectiveness and can identify, rank, and track trends that match expert input. The framework provides a robust tool for exploring evolving technological landscapes.</description>

      <title>Effects of valley splitting on resonant-tunneling readout of spin qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effect of valley splitting on the readout of qubit states is theoretically investigated in a three-quantum-dot (QD) system. A single unit of the three-QD system consists of qubit-QDs and a channel-QD that is connected to a conventional transistor. The nonlinear source--drain current characteristics under resonant-tunneling effects are used to distinguish different qubit states. Using nonequilibrium Green functions, the current formula for the three-QD system is derived when each QD has two valley energy levels. Two valley states in each QD are considered to be affected by variations in the fabrication process. We found that when valley splitting is smaller than Zeeman splitting, the current nonlinearity can improve the readout, provided that the nonuniformity of the valley energy levels is small. Conversely, when the valley splitting is larger than the Zeeman splitting, the nonuniformity degraded the readout. In both cases, we showed that there are regions where the measurement time $t_{\rm meas}$ is much less than the decoherence time $t_{\rm dec}$ such that $t_{\rm dec}/t_{\rm meas}&gt;100$. This suggests that less than 1\% measurement error is anticipated, which opens up the possibility for implementing surface codes even in the presence of valley splitting.</description>

      <title>Read out the fermion parity of a potential artificial Kitaev chain utilizing a transmon qubit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial Kitaev chains have emerged as a promising platform for realizing topological quantum computing. Once the chains are formed and the Majorana zero modes are braided/fused, reading out the parity of the chains is essential for further verifying the non-Abelian property of the Majorana zero modes. Here we demonstrate the feasibility of using a superconducting transmon qubit, which incorporates an end of a four-site quantum dot-superconductor chain based on a Ge/Si nanowire, to directly detect the singlet/doublet state, and thus the parity of the entire chain. We also demonstrate that for multiple-dot chains there are two types of 0-{\pi} transitions between different charging states: the parity-flip 0-{\pi} transition and the parity-preserved 0-{\pi} transition. Furthermore, we show that the inter-dot coupling, hence the strengths of cross Andreev reflection and elastic cotunneling of electrons, can be adjusted by local electrostatic gating in chains fabricated on Ge/Si core-shell nanowires. Our exploration would be helpful for the ultimate realization of topological quantum computing based on artificial Kitaev chains.</description>

Abstract: This study proposes an explicit construction method for classical and quantum quasi-cyclic low-density parity-check (QC-LDPC) codes with a girth of 12. The proposed method designs parity-check matrices that maximize the girth while maintaining an orthogonal structure suitable for quantum error correction. By utilizing algebraic techniques, short cycles are eliminated, which improves error correction performance. Additionally, this method is extended to non-binary LDPC codes and spatially-coupled LDPC codes, demonstrating that both the girth and orthogonality can be preserved. The results of this study enable the design of high-performance quantum error correction codes without the need for random search.</description>

      <title>v-representability and Hohenberg-Kohn theorem for non-interacting Schr\"odinger operators with distributional potentials in the one-dimensional torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that the ground-state density of any non-interacting Schr\"odinger operator on the one-dimensional torus with potentials in a certain class of distributions is strictly positive. This result together with recent results from [Sutter el al (2024), J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 57 475202] provides a complete characterization of the set of non-interacting v-representable densities on the torus. Moreover, we prove that, for said class of non-interacting Schr\"odinger operators with distributional potentials, the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem holds, i.e., the external potential is uniquely determined by the ground-state density. In particular, the density-to-potential Kohn-Sham map is single-valued, and the non-interacting Lieb functional is differentiable at every point in this space of $v$-representable densities. These results contribute to establishing a solid mathematical foundation for the Kohn-Sham scheme in this simplified setting.</description>

      <title>Giant end-tunneling effect in two distinct Luttinger liquids coexisting in one quantum wire</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Luttinger liquids occupy a special place in physics as the most understood case of essentially quantum many-body systems. The experimental mission of measuring its main prediction, power laws in observable quantities, has already produced a body of exponents in different semiconductor and metallic structures. Here, we combine tunneling spectroscopy with density-dependent transport measurements in the same quantum wires over more than two orders of magnitude in temperature to very low temperatures down to $\sim$40 mK. This reveals that, when the second 1D subband becomes populated, the temperature dependence splits into two ranges with different exponents in the power-law dependence of the conductance, both dominated by the finite-size effect of the end-tunneling process. This result demonstrates the importance of measuring the Luttinger parameters as well as the number of modes independently through spectroscopy in addition to the transport exponent in the characterization of Luttinger liquids. This opens a new pathway to unambiguous interpretation of the exponents observed in quantum wires.</description>

      <title>Meson thermalization with a hot medium in the open Schwinger model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum field theories treated as open quantum systems provide a crucial framework for studying realistic experimental scenarios, such as quarkonia traversing the quark-gluon plasma produced at the Large Hadron Collider. In such cases, capturing the complex thermalization process requires a detailed understanding of how particles evolve and interact with a hot medium. Considering the open lattice Schwinger model and using tensor network algorithms, we investigate the thermalization dynamics of mesonic particles in a hot medium, such as the Schwinger boson or the electric flux string. We simulate systems with up to 100 lattice sites, achieving accurate preservation of the electric field parity symmetry, demonstrating the algorithm's robustness and scalability. Our results reveal that the thermalization time increases with stronger dissipation from the environment, increasing environment temperature, higher background electric field and heavier fermion masses. Further, we study the quantum mutual information between the two halves of the flux string connecting a meson's constituent particles and analyze its relation to relevant dynamical observables.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the Casimir force between superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Casimir force follows from quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field and yields a nonlinear attractive force between closely spaced conductive objects. Its magnitude depends on the conductivity of the objects up to optical frequencies. Measuring the Casimir force in superconductors should allow to isolate frequency-specific contributions to the Casimir effect, as frequencies below the superconducting gap energy are expected to contribute differently than those above it. There is significant interest in this contribution as it is suspected to contribute to an unexplained discrepancy between predictions and measurements of the Casimir force, which questions the basic principles on which estimates of the magnitude are based. Here, we observe the Casimir force between superconducting objects for the first time, through the nonlinear dynamics it imparts to a superconducting drum resonator in a microwave optomechanical system. There is excellent agreement between the experiment and the Casimir force magnitude computed for this device across three orders of magnitude of displacement. Furthermore, the Casimir nonlinearity is intense enough that, with a modified design, this device type should operate in the single-phonon nonlinear regime. Accessing this regime has been a long-standing goal that would greatly facilitate quantum operations of mechanical resonators.</description>

      <title>Topological $X$-states in a quantum impurity model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological qubits are inherently resistant to noise and errors. However, experimental demonstrations have been elusive as their realization and control is highly complex. In the present work, we demonstrate the emergence of topological $X$-states in the long-time response of a locally perturbed quantum impurity model. The emergence of the double-qubit state is heralded by the lack of decay of the response function as well as the out-of-time order correlator signifying the trapping of excitations, and hence information in local edge modes.</description>

      <title>Entropy Gain and Information Loss by Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.10364</link>
      <description>arXiv:1908.10364v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When the quantum entropy (QE) of a system increases due to measurements, it leads to the loss of certain information, part of which may be recoverable. We define Information Loss (IL) as a function of the density matrix through quantum entropy to effectively represent this relationship between gain and loss. For example, if the quantum entropy of a system increases from zero to 2ln2, its information loss rises from zero to 75 percent. We demonstrate that when a pure, unbiased m-qubit state collapses into a maximally mixed state, it acquires the highest possible gain in entropy and the maximal loss of information. We analyze the QE and IL of single qubits, entangled photon pairs in Bell tests, multi-qubit systems such as in quantum teleportation, GHZ and W states, as well as the two-qubit Werner mixed states, focusing on their dependence on parameters like polarization bias. We notice that the data exchange between the two observers in Bell tests can recover some of the lost quantum information even years later, indicating that the associated quantum entropy can be removed years later, which implies a possible explanation linked to quantum non-locality. We show that measuring the Bell, GHZ, and marginally entangled Werner state yields the same minimal entropy gain (ln2) and an equal minimal information loss (50 percent).</description>

      <title>Quantum thermoelectric transmission functions with minimal current fluctuations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2106.10205v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thermodynamic uncertainty relations (TURs) represent a benchmark result in nonequilibrium physics that allows to place fundamental lower bounds on the noise-to-signal ratio (precision) of currents in nanoscale devices. Originally formulated for classical time-homogeneous Markov processes, these relations, were shown to be violated in thermoelectric engines and photovoltaic devices supporting quantum-coherent transport. However, the extent to which these violations may occur still represents a missing piece of the puzzle. In this work, we provide such answer in a definitive way within the general Landauer-B\"uttiker formalism for noninteracting systems, beyond any perturbative regime, e.g., linear response. In particular, using analytical constrained-optimization techniques, we rigorously demonstrate that the transmission function which maximizes the reliability of thermoelectric devices (i.e., which minimizes the fluctuations of its steady-state currents) for fixed average power and efficiency is a collection of boxcar functions. This allows us to show that TURs can be violated by arbitrarily large amounts, depending on the temperature and chemical potential gradients, thus providing guidelines to the design of optimal devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.00089v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this research article, we survey existing quantum physics-related games and, based on this survey, propose a definition for the concept of quantum games. We define a quantum game as any type of rule-based game that either employs the principles of quantum physics or references quantum phenomena or the theory of quantum physics through any of three proposed dimensions: the perceivable dimension of quantum physics, the dimension of quantum technologies, and the dimension of scientific purposes, such as citizen science or education. We also discuss the concept of quantum computer games, which are games on quantum computers, as well as definitions for the concept of science games. Various games explore quantum physics and quantum computing through digital, analogue, and hybrid means, with various incentives driving their development. As interest in games as educational tools for supporting quantum literacy grows, understanding the diverse landscape of quantum games becomes increasingly important. We propose that the three dimensions of quantum games identified in this article be used for designing, analysing, and defining the phenomenon of quantum games.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.05149v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a new way to quantify information flow in quantum systems, especially for parameterized quantum circuits. We use a graph representation of the circuits and propose a new distance metric using the mutual information between gate nodes. We then present an optimization procedure for variational algorithms using paths based on the distance measure. We explore the features of the algorithm by means of the variational quantum eigensolver, in which we compute the ground state energies of the Heisenberg model. In addition, we employ the method to solve a binary classification problem using variational quantum classification. From numerical simulations, we show that our method can be successfully used for optimizing the parameterized quantum circuits primarily used in near-term algorithms. We further note that information-flow based paths can be used to improve convergence of existing stochastic gradient based methods.</description>

Abstract: We examine the satisfaction of Bell criteria for single realizations of quantum systems. This is possible via the joint noisy measurement of all observables involved in the Bell test.We readily find that every outcome violates Bell bounds for local hidden variables models. This agrees with the idea that to reveal nonclassical effects a necessary condition is that the measuring scheme itself must be nonclassical.</description>

Abstract: One promising application of near-term quantum devices is to prepare trial wavefunctions using short circuits for solving different problems via variational algorithms. For this purpose, we introduce a new circuit design that combines graph-based diagonalization circuits with arbitrary single-qubit rotation gates to get Hamiltonian-based graph states ans\"atze (H-GSA). We test the accuracy of the proposed ansatz in estimating ground state energies of various molecules of size up to 12-qubits. Additionally, we compare the gate count and parameter number complexity of the proposed ansatz against previously proposed schemes and find an order magnitude reduction in gate count complexity with slight increase in the number of parameters. Our work represents a significant step towards constructing compact quantum circuits with good trainability and convergence properties and applications in solving chemistry and physics problems.</description>

      <title>Forecasting long-time dynamics in quantum many-body systems by dynamic mode decomposition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19947v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reliable numerical computation of quantum dynamics is a fundamental challenge when the long-ranged quantum entanglement plays essential roles as in the cases governed by quantum criticality in strongly correlated systems. Here we apply a method that utilizes reliable short-time data of physical quantities to accurately forecast long-time behavior of the strongly entangled systems. We straightforwardly employ the simple dynamic mode decomposition (DMD), which is commonly used in fluid dynamics. Despite the simplicity of the method, the effectiveness and applicability of the DMD in quantum many-body systems such as the Ising model in the transverse field at the critical point are demonstrated, even when the time evolution at long time exhibits complicated features such as a volume-law entanglement entropy and consequential power-law decays of correlations characteristic of systems with long-ranged quantum entanglements unlike fluid dynamics. The present method, though simple, enables accurate forecasts amazingly at time as long as nearly an order of magnitude longer than that of the short-time training data. Effects of noise on the accuracy of the forecast are also investigated, because they are important especially when dealing with the experimental data. We find that a few percentages of noise do not affect the prediction accuracy destructively.</description>

      <title>Color code decoder with improved scaling for correcting circuit-level noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07482v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-dimensional color codes are a promising candidate for fault-tolerant quantum computing, as they have high encoding rates, transversal implementation of logical Clifford gates, and resource-efficient magic state preparation schemes. However, decoding color codes presents a significant challenge due to their structure, where elementary errors violate three checks instead of just two (a key feature in surface code decoding), and the complexity of extracting syndrome is greater. We introduce an efficient color-code decoder that tackles these issues by combining two matching decoders for each color, generalized to handle circuit-level noise by employing detector error models. We provide comprehensive analyses of the decoder, covering its threshold and sub-threshold scaling both for bit-flip noise with ideal measurements and for circuit-level noise. Our simulations reveal that this decoding strategy nearly reaches the best possible scaling of logical failure ($p_\mathrm{fail} \sim p^{d/2}$) for both noise models, where $p$ is the noise strength, in the regime of interest for fault-tolerant quantum computing. While its noise thresholds are comparable with other matching-based decoders for color codes ($8.2\%$ for bit-flip noise and $0.46\%$ for circuit-level noise), the scaling of logical failure rates below threshold significantly outperforms the best matching-based decoders.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13297v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs), as an exclusive feature of a non-Hermitian system, support coalescing states to be alternative stable state beyond the ground state. In this work, we explore the influence of non-Hermitian impurities on the dynamic formation of condensate states in one-, two-, and three-dimensional extended Bose-Hubbard systems with strong on-site interaction. Based on the solution for the hardcore limit, we show exactly that condensate modes with off-diagonal long-range order (ODLRO) can exist when certain system parameters satisfy specific matching conditions. Under open boundary conditions, the condensate states become coalescing states when the non-Hermitian $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric boundary gives rise to the EPs. The fundamental mechanism behind this phenomenon is uncovered through analyzing the scattering dynamics of many-particle wavepackets at the non-Hermitian boundaries. The EP dynamics facilitate the dynamic generation of condensate states with non-zero momentum. To further substantiate the theoretical findings, numerical simulations are conducted. This study not only unveils the potential condensation of interacting bosons but also offers an approach for the engineering of condensate states.</description>

      <title>Spin coupling is all you need: Encoding strong electron correlation in molecules on quantum computers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18878v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The performance of quantum algorithms for eigenvalue problems, such as computing Hamiltonian spectra, depends strongly on the overlap of the initial wavefunction and the target eigenvector. In a basis of Slater determinants, the representation of energy eigenstates of systems with $N$ strongly correlated electrons requires a number of determinants that scales exponentially with $N$. On classical processors, this restricts simulations to systems where $N$ is small. Here, we show that quantum computers can efficiently simulate strongly correlated molecular systems by directly encoding the dominant entanglement structure in the form of spin-coupled initial states. This avoids resorting to expensive classical or quantum state preparation heuristics and instead exploits symmetries in the wavefunction. We provide quantum circuits for deterministic preparation of a family of spin eigenfunctions with ${N \choose N/2}$ Slater determinants with depth $\mathcal{O}(N)$ and $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ local gates. Their use as highly entangled initial states in quantum algorithms reduces the total runtime of quantum phase estimation and related fault-tolerant methods by orders of magnitude. Furthermore, we assess the application of spin-coupled wavefunctions as initial states for several heuristic quantum algorithms, namely the variational quantum eigensolver, adiabatic state preparation, and different versions of quantum subspace diagonalization (QSD) including QSD based on real-time-evolved states. We also propose a novel QSD algorithm that exploits states obtained through adaptive quantum eigensolvers. For all algorithms, we demonstrate that using spin-coupled initial states drastically reduces the quantum resources required to simulate strongly correlated ground and excited states. Our work provides a crucial component for enabling scalable quantum simulation of classically challenging electronic systems.</description>

Abstract: Spins and oscillators are foundational to much of physics and applied sciences. For quantum information, a spin 1/2 exemplifies the most basic unit, a qubit. High angular momentum spins (HAMSs) and harmonic oscillators provide multi-level manifolds (e.g., qudits) which have the potential for hardware-efficient protected encodings of quantum information and simulation of many-body quantum systems. In this work, we demonstrate a new quantum control protocol that conceptually merges these disparate hardware platforms. Namely, we show how to modify a harmonic oscillator on-demand to implement a continuous range of generators associated to resonant driving of a harmonic qudit, which we can interpret as accomplishing linear and nonlinear control over a harmonic HAMS degree of freedom. The spin-like dynamics are verified by demonstration of linear spin coherent (SU(2)) rotations, nonlinear spin control, and comparison to other manifolds like simply-truncated oscillators. Our scheme allows the first universal control of such a harmonic qudit encoding: we use linear operations to accomplish four logical gates, and further show that nonlinear harmonicity-preserving operations complete the logical gate set. Our results show how motion on a closed Hilbert space can be useful for quantum information processing and opens the door to superconducting circuit simulations of higher angular momentum quantum magnetism.</description>

Abstract: A classical particle in a confining potential gives rise to a Hamiltonian conservative dynamical system with an uncountably infinite continuous energy spectra, whereas the corresponding quantum particle exhibits countably infinite discrete energy levels. We consider a class of nonlinear self-sustained oscillators describing a classical active particle in a harmonic potential. These nonlinear oscillators emerge in the low-memory regime of both state-dependent time-delay systems as well as in non-Markovian stroboscopic models of walking droplets. Using averaging techniques, we prove the existence of a countably infinite number of asymptotically stable quantized orbits, i.e. megastability, for this class of self-excited systems. The set of periodic orbits consists of a sequence of nested limit-cycle attractors with quasilinear increasing amplitude and alternating stability, yielding smooth basins of attraction. By using the Lyapunov energy function, we estimate the energy spectra of this megastable set of orbits, and perform numerical simulations to confirm the mathematical analysis. Our formalism can be extended to self-excited particles in general confining potentials, resulting in different energy-frequency relations for these dynamical analogs of quantization.</description>

Abstract: We explore the utility of quantum spin squeezing in quantum magnetometry, focusing on three-level (qutrit) Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) centers within diamond, utilizing a standard Ramsey interferometry pulse protocol. Our investigation incorporates the effects of dephasing and relaxation on NV centers' dynamics during Ramsey measurements, modeled via the Lindblad quantum master equation. We conduct a comparative analysis between the metrological capabilities of a single NV center and a pair of NV centers, considering Quantum Fisher Information both with and without spin squeezing. The quantum correlations between NV centers are assessed through the evaluation of the Kitagawa-Ueda spin squeezing parameter within a two-level manifold. Additionally, parallel calculations are conducted using a two-level model (qubit) for NV centers. Our findings reveal that leveraging qutrits and spin squeezing yields enhanced magnetometric precision, albeit constrained by dephasing effects. Nevertheless, even in the absence of dynamical decoupling methods to mitigate environmental noise, strategic timing of squeezing and free evolution can sustain the advantages of qutrit-based magnetometry.</description>

      <title>Predicting properties of quantum systems by regression on a quantum computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08847v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum computers can be considered as a natural means for performing machine learning tasks for inherently quantum labeled data. Many quantum machine learning techniques have been developed for solving classification problems, such as distinguishing between phases of matter or quantum processes. Similarly, one can consider a more general problem of regression, when the aim is to predict continuous labels quantifying properties of quantum states, such as purity or entanglement. In this work, we propose a method for predicting such properties. The method is based on the notion of parametrized quantum circuits, and it seeks to find an observable the expectation of which gives the prediction of the property of interest with a low variance. We numerically test our approach in learning to predict (i) the parameter of a parametrized channel given its output state, (ii) entanglement of two-qubit states, and (iii) the parameter of a parametrized Hamiltonian given its ground state. The results show that the proposed method is able to find observables such that they provide highly accurate predictions of the considered properties, and in some cases even saturate the Cramer-Rao bound, which characterizes the prediction error. We also compare our method with the Bayesian approach, and find that the latter prefers to minimize the prediction variance, having therefore a larger bias.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01754v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Polarization mode dispersion (PMD) in optical fibers poses a major challenge for maintaining the fidelity of quantum states for quantum communications. In this work, a comprehensive model linking the probability of quantum measurement errors (infidelity) to PMD is developed and validated by experimental measurements of differential group delay and quantum bit error rate (QBER). Our research proposes effective methods to mitigate PMD effects for broadband entangled photons and evaluates the impact of higher-order PMD effects. The model provides an experimentally verified framework for the optimization of commercial quantum key distribution systems in deployed fiber optic lines.</description>

      <title>Dynamical resource theory of incompatibility preservability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06315v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The uncertainty principle is one of quantum theory's most foundational features. It underpins a quantum phenomenon called measurement incompatibility -- two physical observables of a single quantum system may not always be measured simultaneously. Apart from being fundamentally important, measurement incompatibility is also a powerful resource in the broad quantum science and technologies, with wide applications to cryptography, communication, random number generation, and device-independent tasks. Since every physical system is unavoidably subject to noise, an important, yet still open, question is how to characterise the ability of noisy quantum dynamics to preserve measurement incompatibility. This work fills this gap by providing the first resource theory of this ability, termed incompatibility preservability. We quantify incompatibility preservability by a robustness measure. Then, we introduce an operational task, entanglement-assisted filter game, to completely characterise both the robustness measure and the conversion of incompatibility preservability. Our results provide a general framework to describe how noisy dynamics affect the uncertainty principle's signature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08383v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Krylov subspace methods in quantum dynamics identify the minimal subspace in which a process unfolds. To date, their use is restricted to time evolutions governed by time-independent generators. We introduce a generalization valid for driven quantum systems governed by a time-dependent Hamiltonian that maps the evolution to a diffusion problem in a one-dimensional lattice with nearest-neighbor hopping probabilities that are inhomogeneous and time dependent. This representation is used to establish a novel class of fundamental limits to the quantum speed of evolution and operator growth. We also discuss generalizations of the algorithm, adapted to discretized time evolutions and periodic Hamiltonians, with applications to many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Estimating QSVT angles for matrix inversion with large condition numbers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15453v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum Singular Value Transformation (QSVT) is a state-of-the-art, near-optimal quantum algorithm that can be used for matrix inversion. The QSVT circuit is parameterized by a sequence of angles that must be pre-calculated classically, with the number of angles increasing as the matrix condition number grows. Computing QSVT angles for ill-conditioned problems is a numerically challenging task. We propose a numerical technique for estimating QSVT angles for large condition numbers. This technique allows one to avoid expensive numerical computations of QSVT angles and to emulate QSVT circuits for solving ill-conditioned problems.</description>

      <title>A Roadmap for Simulating Chemical Dynamics on a Parametrically Driven Bosonic Quantum Device</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13114v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chemical reactions are commonly described by the reactive flux transferring population from reactants to products across a double-well free energy barrier. Dynamics often involves barrier recrossing and quantum effects like tunneling, zero-point energy motion and interference, which traditional rate theories, such as transition-state theory, do not consider. In this study, we investigate the feasibility of simulating reaction dynamics using a parametrically driven bosonic superconducting Kerr-cat device. This approach provides control over parameters defining the double-well free energy profile, as well as external factors like temperature and the coupling strength between the reaction coordinate and the thermal bath of non-reactive degrees of freedom. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this protocol by showing that the dynamics of proton transfer reactions in prototypical benchmark model systems, such as hydrogen bonded dimers of malonaldehyde and DNA base pairs, could be accurately simulated on currently accessible Kerr-cat devices.</description>

      <title>Recovery of Quantum Correlations using Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02818v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum sources with strong correlations are essential but delicate resources in quantum information science and engineering. Decoherence and loss are the primary factors that degrade nonclassical quantum correlations, with scattering playing a role in both processes. In this work, we present a method that leverages Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), a machine learning technique known for its effectiveness in time-series prediction, to mitigate the detrimental impact of scattering in quantum systems. Our setup involves generating two-mode squeezed light via four-wave mixing in warm rubidium vapor, with one mode subjected to a scatterer to disrupt quantum correlations. Mutual information and intensity-difference squeezing between the two modes are used as metrics for quantum correlations. We demonstrate a 74.7~\% recovery of mutual information and 87.7~\% recovery of two-mode squeezing, despite significant photon loss that would otherwise eliminate quantum correlations. This approach marks a significant step toward recovering quantum correlations from random disruptions without the need for hardware modifications, paving the way for practical applications of quantum protocols.</description>

      <title>Distributed Quantum Hypothesis Testing under Zero-rate Communication Constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08937v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The trade-offs between error probabilities in quantum hypothesis testing are by now well-understood in the centralized setting, but much less is known for distributed settings. Here, we study a distributed binary hypothesis testing problem to infer a bipartite quantum state shared between two remote parties, where one of these parties communicates to the tester at zero-rate, while the other party communicates to the tester at zero-rate or higher. As our main contribution, we derive an efficiently computable single-letter formula for the Stein's exponent of this problem, when the state under the alternative is product. For the general case, we show that the Stein's exponent when (at least) one of the parties communicates classically at zero-rate is given by a multi-letter expression involving max-min optimization of regularized measured relative entropy. While this becomes single-letter for the fully classical case, we further prove that this already does not happen in the same way for classical-quantum states in general. As a key tool for proving the converse direction of our results, we develop a quantum version of the blowing-up lemma which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18543v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In quantum information processing, a tension between two different tasks occurs: while qubits' states can be preserved by isolating them, quantum gates can be realized only through qubit-qubit interactions. In arrays of qubits, weak coupling leads to states being spatially localized and strong coupling to delocalized states. Here, we study the average energy level spacing and the relative entropy of the distribution of the level spacings (Kullback-Leibler divergence from Poisson and Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble) to analyze the crossover between localized and delocalized (chaotic) regimes in linear arrays of superconducting qubits. We consider both transmons as well as capacitively shunted flux qubits, which enables us to tune the qubit anharmonicity. Arrays with uniform anharmonicity, comprising only transmons or flux qubits, display remarkably similar dependencies of level statistics on the coupling strength. In systems with alternating anharmonicity, the localized regime is found to be more resilient to the increase in qubit-qubit coupling strength in comparison to arrays with a single qubit type. This result supports designing devices that incorporate different qubit types to achieve higher performances.</description>

Abstract: This paper explores communication over a two-sender, two-receiver classical interference channel, enhanced by the availability of entanglement resources between transmitters. The central contributions are an inner and outer bound on the capacity region for a general interference channel with entangled transmitters. It addresses the persistent challenge of the lack of a general capacity formula, even in the purely classical case, and highlights the striking similarities in achievable rate expressions when assessing quantum advantages. Through a concrete example, it is shown that entanglement can significantly boost performance in certain types of channels.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a characterization of a two-qubit processor in a 6-quantum dot array in SiGe, from the perspective of its quantum information processing capabilities. The analysis includes randomized benchmarking of single- and two-qubit gates, SPAM characterization, and Bell's state tomography; all basic functionality required for universal quantum computation. In light of our efforts to combine spin qubits with integrated cryogenic electronics, we evaluate the qubits' performance metrics at 300mK and 740mK. The latter temperature lies within the realistic thermal budget for integrated cryogenic electronics, making it particularly relevant for assessing qubit performance in practical scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07372v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a scalable, robust approach to creating quantum programs of arbitrary size and complexity. The approach is based on the true abstraction of the problem. The quantum program is expressed in terms of a high-level model together with constraints and objectives on the final program. Advanced synthesis algorithms transform the model into a low-level quantum program that meets the user's specification and is directed at a stipulated hardware. This separation of description from implementation is essential for scale. The technology adapts electronic design automation methods to quantum computing, finding feasible implementations in a virtually unlimited functional space. The results show clear superiority over the compilation and transpilation methods used today. We expect that this technological approach will take over and prevail as quantum software become more demanding, complex, and essential.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12705v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The escalating complexity of urban transportation systems, exacerbated by factors such as traffic congestion, diverse transportation modalities, and shifting commuter preferences, necessitates the development of more sophisticated analytical frameworks. Traditional computational approaches often struggle with the voluminous datasets generated by real-time sensor networks, and they generally lack the precision needed for accurate traffic prediction and efficient system optimization. This research integrates quantum computing techniques to enhance Vehicle Road Cooperation Systems (VRCS). By leveraging quantum algorithms, specifically $UU^{\dagger}$ and variational $UU^{\dagger}$, in conjunction with quantum image encoding methods such as Flexible Representation of Quantum Images (FRQI) and Novel Enhanced Quantum Representation (NEQR), we propose an optimized Quantum Neural Network (QNN). This QNN features adjustments in its entangled layer structure and training duration to better handle the complexities of traffic data processing. Empirical evaluations on two traffic datasets show that our model achieves superior classification accuracies of 97.42% and 84.08% and demonstrates remarkable robustness in various noise conditions. This study underscores the potential of quantum-enhanced 6G solutions in streamlining complex transportation systems, highlighting the pivotal role of quantum technologies in advancing intelligent transportation solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16023v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When estimating an unknown phase rotation of a continuous-variable system with homodyne detection, the optimal probe state strongly depends on the value of the estimated parameter. In this article, we identify the optimal pure single-mode Gaussian probe states depending on the knowledge of the estimated phase parameter before the measurement. We find that for a large prior uncertainty, the optimal probe states are close to coherent states, a result in line with findings from noisy parameter estimation. But with increasingly precise estimates of the parameter it becomes beneficial to put more of the available energy into the squeezing of the probe state. Surprisingly, there is a clear jump, where the optimal probe state changes abruptly to a squeezed vacuum state, which maximizes the Fisher information for this estimation task. We use our results to study repeated measurements and compare different methods to adapt the probe state based on the changing knowledge of the parameter according to the previous findings.</description>

Abstract: We investigate state designs for continuous-variable quantum systems using the aid of lattice-like quantum states. These are code states of Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) codes. We show that for an n-mode system, the set of all GKP states forms a rigged continuous-variable state 2-design. We use these lattice state designs to construct a continuous variable shadow tomography protocol, derive sample complexity bounds for both global- and local GKP shadows under reasonable physical assumptions, and provide the physical gadgets needed to implement this protocol.</description>

      <title>Quantum Error Correction near the Coding Theoretical Bound</title>

Abstract: Recent advancements in quantum computing have led to the realization of systems comprising tens of reliable logical qubits, constructed from thousands of noisy physical qubits. However, many of the critical applications that quantum computers aim to solve require quantum computations involving millions or more logical qubits. This necessitates highly efficient quantum error correction capable of handling large numbers of logical qubits. Classical error correction theory is well-developed, with low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes achieving performance limits by encoding large classical bits. Despite more than two decades of effort, no efficiently decodable quantum error-correcting code that approaches the hashing bound, which is a fundamental lower bound on quantum capacity, had been discovered. Here, we present quantum error-correcting codes constructed from classical LDPC codes that approach the hashing bound while maintaining linear computational complexity in the number of physical qubits. This result establishes a pathway toward realizing large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computers. By integrating our quantum error correction scheme with devices capable of managing vast numbers of qubits, the prospect of solving critical real-world problems through quantum computation is brought significantly closer.</description>

      <title>Modes, states and superselection rules in quantum optics and quantum information</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03943v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A convenient way to represent quantum optical states is through the quadrature basis of single-modes of the field. This framework provides intuitive definitions for quasi-classical states, their phase-space representations, and a robust toolbox for quantum state manipulation using universal gates. In this widely adopted representation of quantum optics, most pure states consist of coherent superpositions of photon-number states. However, this approach neglects the particle-number superselection rule - which prohibits coherence between states of differing photon numbers - and implicitly assumes a common phase reference - even though global phases are unmeasurable in quantum optics. We adopt a representation of quantum optical states that respects the superselection rule and revisit key tools and results in quantum optics and information encoding within quantum optics. In the introduced framework, general pure states are described using two orthogonal modes in the Fock basis. We show that this approach preserves the intuitive aspects of the traditional quadrature representation while unifying insights from quantum optics with those from symmetric spin-like and angular momentum systems. Moreover, the superselection rule-compliant representation provides a consistent definition of non-purity and coherence for optical modes and states. It offers a clearer and general perspective on quantum universality, non-classicality, and the (im)possibility of efficient classical simulation across various quantum information encoding schemes involving quantum optical modes and states.</description>

      <title>State Transfer in Latent-Symmetric Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12185v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The transport of quantum states is a crucial aspect of information processing systems, facilitating operations such as quantum key distribution and inter-component communication within quantum computers. Most quantum networks rely on symmetries to achieve an efficient state transfer. A straightforward way to design such networks is to use spatial symmetries, which severely limits the design space. Our work takes a novel approach to designing photonic networks that do not exhibit any conventional spatial symmetries, yet nevertheless support an efficient transfer of quantum states. Paradoxically, while a perfect transfer efficiency is technically unattainable in these networks, a fidelity arbitrarily close to unity is always reached within a finite time of evolution. Key to this approach are so-called latent, or 'hidden', symmetries, which are embodied in the spectral properties of the network. Latent symmetries substantially expand the design space of quantum networks and hold significant potential for applications in quantum cryptography and secure state transfer. We experimentally realize such a nine-site latent-symmetric network and successfully observe state transfer between two sites with a measured fidelity of 75%. Furthermore, by launching a two-photon state, we show that quantum interference is preserved by the network. This demonstrates that the latent symmetries enable efficient quantum state transfer, while offering greater flexibility in designing quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Topological Phases with Average Symmetries: the Decohered, the Disordered, and the Intrinsic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.16399v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Global symmetries greatly enrich the landscape of topological quantum phases, playing an essential role from topological insulators to fractional quantum Hall effect. Topological phases in mixed quantum states, originating from \textit{decoherence} in open quantum systems or \textit{disorders} in imperfect crystalline solids, have recently garnered significant interest. Unlike pure states, mixed quantum states can exhibit \textit{average symmetries} -- symmetries that keep the total ensemble invariant but not on each individual state. In this work, we present a systematic classification and characterization of average symmetry-protected topological (ASPT) phases applicable to generic symmetry groups, encompassing both average and exact symmetries, for bosonic and fermionic systems. Moreover, we formulate the theory of average symmetry-enriched topological (ASET) orders in disordered bosonic systems. Our systematic approach helps clarify nuanced issues in previous literature and uncovers compelling new physics. Notably, we discover that (1) the definition and classification of ASPT phases in decohered and disordered systems exhibit subtle differences; (2) despite these differences, ASPT phases in both settings can be classified and characterized under a unified framework of defect decoration and spectral sequence; (3) this systematic classification uncovers a plethora of ASPT phases that are \textit{intrinsically mixed}, implying they can exclusively manifest in decohered or disordered systems where part of the symmetry is average; (4) similarly for ASET, we find intrinsically disordered phases exhibiting exotic anyon behaviors -- the ground states of such phases necessarily contain localized anyons, with gapless (yet still localized) excitation spectral.</description>

      <title>Multifractality of many-body non-Hermitian skin effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08304v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect, anomalous localization of an extensive number of eigenstates induced by nonreciprocal dissipation, plays a pivotal role in non-Hermitian topology and significantly influences the open quantum dynamics. However, its genuinely quantum characterization in many-body systems has yet to be developed. Here, we elucidate that the skin effect manifests itself as multifractality in the many-body Hilbert space. This multifractality does not accompany the single-particle skin effect and hence is intrinsic to the many-body skin effect. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the many-body skin effect coexists with spectral statistics of random matrices, in contrast to multifractality associated with the many-body localization, which necessitates the absence of ergodicity. We also illustrate multifractality caused by the Liouvillian skin effect in Markovian open quantum systems. Our work establishes a defining characterization of the non-Hermitian skin effect and uncovers a fundamental relationship between multifractality and ergodicity in open quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Symmetries in the many-body problems, a method to find its analytical solution, and Helium atom spectrum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15019v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work it is shown that there are symmetries beyond the Euclidean group $E\left(3\right)$ in 3-body problem, and by extension in many-body problem, with inverse squared distance inter particle force. The symmetries in 3-body problem form a group: $SO\left(4\times3,2\times3\right)/\left(C\left(3\times2\right)\right)$, where $C\left(n\right)$ is the planar translation group in n dimensions, which forms its Spectrum-Generating group. Some of these quantities commute with the Hamiltonian. The existence of these conserved quantities was verified by calculating energy spectrum of the Helium atom. This method can also be used to find symmetries in many-body problem, and to calculate energy levels, and wave-functions of more complicated systems, which include every possible atomic and molecular systems in chemistry.</description>

      <title>Cons-training tensor networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09005v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we introduce a novel family of tensor networks, termed \textit{constrained matrix product states} (MPS), designed to incorporate exactly arbitrary discrete linear constraints, including inequalities, into sparse block structures. These tensor networks are particularly tailored for modeling distributions with support strictly over the feasible space, offering benefits such as reducing the search space in optimization problems, alleviating overfitting, improving training efficiency, and decreasing model size. Central to our approach is the concept of a quantum region, an extension of quantum numbers traditionally used in U(1) symmetric tensor networks, adapted to capture any linear constraint, including the unconstrained scenario. We further develop a novel canonical form for these new MPS, which allow for the merging and factorization of tensor blocks according to quantum region fusion rules and permit optimal truncation schemes. Utilizing this canonical form, we apply an unsupervised training strategy to optimize arbitrary objective functions subject to discrete linear constraints. Our method's efficacy is demonstrated by solving the quadratic knapsack problem, achieving superior performance compared to a leading nonlinear integer programming solver. Additionally, we analyze the complexity and scalability of our approach, demonstrating its potential in addressing complex constrained combinatorial optimization problems.</description>

      <title>A novel design update framework for topology optimization with quantum annealing: Application to truss and continuum structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18833v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel design update strategy for topology optimization, as an iterative optimization. The key contribution lies in incorporating a design updater concept with quantum annealing, applicable to both truss and continuum structures. To align with density-based approaches in topology optimization, these updaters are formulated through a multiplicative relationship to represent the design material and serve as design variables. Specifically, structural analysis is conducted on a classical computer using the finite element method, while quantum annealing is utilized for topology updates. The primary objective of the framework is to minimize compliance under a volume constraint. An encoding formulation for the design variables is derived, and the penalty method along with a slack variable is employed to transform the inequality volume constraint. Subsequently, the optimization problem for determining the updater is formulated as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) model. To demonstrate its performance, the developed design framework is tested on different computing platforms to perform design optimization for truss structures, as well as 2D and 3D continuum structures. Numerical results indicate that the proposed framework successfully finds optimal topologies similar to benchmark results. Furthermore, the results show the advantage of reduced time in finding an optimal design using quantum annealing compared to simulated annealing.</description>

      <title>Relational dynamics and Page-Wootters formalism in group field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03432v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Group field theory posits that spacetime is emergent and is hence defined without any background notion of space or time; dynamical questions are formulated in relational terms, in particular using (scalar) matter degrees of freedom as time. Unlike in canonical quantisation of gravitational systems, there is no obvious notion of coordinate transformations or constraints, and established quantisation methods cannot be directly applied. As a result, different canonical formalisms for group field theory have been discussed in the literature. We address these issues using a parametrised version of group field theory, in which all (geometry and matter) degrees of freedom evolve in a fiducial parameter. There is a constraint associated to the freedom of reparametrisation and the Dirac quantisation programme can be implemented. Using the "trinity of relational dynamics", we show that the resulting "clock-neutral" theory is entirely equivalent to a deparametrised canonical group field theory, interpreted in terms of the Page-Wootters formalism. Our results not only show that the deparametrised quantisation is fully covariant and can be seen as encoding the dynamics of joint quantum matter and geometry degrees of freedom, they also appear to be the first application of the Page-Wootters formalism directly to non-perturbative quantum gravity. We show extensions to a setting in which many independent gauge symmetries are introduced, which connects to the "multi-fingered time" idea in quantum gravity and provides a somewhat novel extension of the Page-Wootters formalism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06640v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Among interesting applications of cold atoms, quantum simulations attract a lot of attention. In this context, rare-earth ultracold atoms are particularly appealing for such simulators due to their numerous Fano-Feshbach resonances and magnetic dipole moments in the ground state. Creating a quantum gas microscope requires a large optical access that may be achieved using transport of atoms between separate vacuum volumes. We demonstrate that in case of the transport of magnetic atoms the magnetic field can be directly measured and adjusted to reduce additional losses after the transport therefore increasing the efficiency of subsequent evaporation cooling. This approach allows to transfer over 85% of the atoms from the main chamber to the scientific chamber, located 38 cm away with moderate laser power of 26 W without atomic polarization decay.</description>

      <title>SentiQNF: A Novel Approach to Sentiment Analysis Using Quantum Algorithms and Neuro-Fuzzy Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12731v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sentiment analysis is an essential component of natural language processing, used to analyze sentiments, attitudes, and emotional tones in various contexts. It provides valuable insights into public opinion, customer feedback, and user experiences. Researchers have developed various classical machine learning and neuro-fuzzy approaches to address the exponential growth of data and the complexity of language structures in sentiment analysis. However, these approaches often fail to determine the optimal number of clusters, interpret results accurately, handle noise or outliers efficiently, and scale effectively to high-dimensional data. Additionally, they are frequently insensitive to input variations. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid approach for sentiment analysis called the Quantum Fuzzy Neural Network (QFNN), which leverages quantum properties and incorporates a fuzzy layer to overcome the limitations of classical sentiment analysis algorithms. In this study, we test the proposed approach on two Twitter datasets: the Coronavirus Tweets Dataset (CVTD) and the General Sentimental Tweets Dataset (GSTD), and compare it with classical and hybrid algorithms. The results demonstrate that QFNN outperforms all classical, quantum, and hybrid algorithms, achieving 100% and 90% accuracy in the case of CVTD and GSTD, respectively. Furthermore, QFNN demonstrates its robustness against six different noise models, providing the potential to tackle the computational complexity associated with sentiment analysis on a large scale in a noisy environment. The proposed approach expedites sentiment data processing and precisely analyses different forms of textual data, thereby enhancing sentiment classification and insights associated with sentiment analysis.</description>
