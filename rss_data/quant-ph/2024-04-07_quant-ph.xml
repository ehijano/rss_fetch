      <title>Metropolitan-scale heralded entanglement of solid-state qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key challenge towards future quantum internet technology is connecting quantum processors at metropolitan scale. Here, we report on heralded entanglement between two independently operated quantum network nodes separated by 10km. The two nodes hosting diamond spin qubits are linked with a midpoint station via 25km of deployed optical fiber. We minimize the effects of fiber photon loss by quantum frequency conversion of the qubit-native photons to the telecom L-band and by embedding the link in an extensible phase-stabilized architecture enabling the use of the loss-resilient single-photon entangling protocol. By capitalizing on the full heralding capabilities of the network link in combination with real-time feedback logic on the long-lived qubits, we demonstrate the delivery of a predefined entangled state on the nodes irrespective of the heralding detection pattern. Addressing key scaling challenges and being compatible with different qubit systems, our architecture establishes a generic platform for exploring metropolitan-scale quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Conformal geometry from entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a physical system with conformal symmetry, observables depend on cross-ratios, measures of distance invariant under global conformal transformations (conformal geometry for short). We identify a quantum information-theoretic mechanism by which the conformal geometry emerges at the gapless edge of a 2+1D quantum many-body system with a bulk energy gap. We introduce a novel pair of information-theoretic quantities $(\mathfrak{c}_{\mathrm{tot}}, \eta)$ that can be defined locally on the edge from the wavefunction of the many-body system, without prior knowledge of any distance measure. We posit that, for a topological groundstate, the quantity $\mathfrak{c}_{\mathrm{tot}}$ is stationary under arbitrary variations of the quantum state, and study the logical consequences. We show that stationarity, modulo an entanglement-based assumption about the bulk, implies (i) $\mathfrak{c}_{\mathrm{tot}}$ is a non-negative constant that can be interpreted as the total central charge of the edge theory. (ii) $\eta$ is a cross-ratio, obeying the full set of mathematical consistency rules, which further indicates the existence of a distance measure of the edge with global conformal invariance. Thus, the conformal geometry emerges from a simple assumption on groundstate entanglement.
  We show that stationarity of $\mathfrak{c}_{\mathrm{tot}}$ is equivalent to a vector fixed-point equation involving $\eta$, making our assumption locally checkable. We also derive similar results for 1+1D systems under a suitable set of assumptions.</description>

      <title>Waveguide QED at the onset of spin-spin correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally explore the competition between light-mediated and direct matter-matter interactions in waveguide quantum electrodynamics. For this, we couple a superconducting line to a model magnetic material, made of organic free radical DPPH molecules with a spin $S=1/2$ and a $g_{S}$ factor very close to that of a free electron. The microwave transmission has been measured in a wide range of temperatures ($0.013$ K $\leq T \leq 2$ K), magnetic fields ($0\leq B \leq 0.5$ T) and frequencies ($0 \leq \omega/2 \pi \leq 14$ GHz). We find that molecules belonging to the crystal sublattice B form one-dimensional spin chains. Temperature then controls intrinsic spin correlations along the chain in a continuous and monotonic way. In the paramagnetic region ($T &gt; 0.7$ K), the microwave transmission shows evidences for the collective coupling of quasi-identical spins to the propagating photons, with coupling strengths that reach values close to the dissipation rates. As $T$ decreases, the growth of intrinsic spin correlations, combined with the anisotropy in the spin-spin exchange constants, break down the collective spin-photon coupling. In this regime, the temperature dependence of the spin resonance visibility reflects the change in the nature of the dominant spin excitations, from single spin flips to bosonic magnons, which is brought about by the magnetic correlation growth.</description>

      <title>Pymablock: an algorithm and a package for quasi-degenerate perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A common technique in the study of complex quantum-mechanical systems is to reduce the number of degrees of freedom in the Hamiltonian by using quasi-degenerate perturbation theory. While the Schrieffer--Wolff transformation achieves this and constructs an effective Hamiltonian, its scaling is suboptimal, and implementing it efficiently is both challenging and error-prone. We introduce an algorithm for constructing an equivalent effective Hamiltonian as well as a Python package, Pymablock, that implements it. Our algorithm combines an optimal asymptotic scaling with a range of other improvements. The package supports numerical and analytical calculations of any order and it is designed to be interoperable with any other packages for specifying the Hamiltonian. We demonstrate how the package handles constructing a k.p model, analyses a superconducting qubit, and computes the low-energy spectrum of a large tight-binding model. We also compare its performance with reference calculations and demonstrate its efficiency.</description>

      <title>Scaling of quantum Fisher information for quantum exceptional point sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, significant progress has been made in utilizing the divergence of spectrum response rate at the exceptional point (EP) for sensing in classical systems, while the use and characterization of quantum EPs for sensing have been largely unexplored. For a quantum EP sensor, an important issue is the relation between the order of the quantum EP and the scaling of quantum Fisher information (QFI), an essential quantity for characterizing quantum sensors. Here we investigate multi-mode quadratic bosonic systems, which exhibit higher-order EP dynamics, but possess Hermitian Hamiltonians without Langevin noise, thus can be utilized for quantum sensing. We derive an exact analytic formula for the QFI, from which we establish a scaling relation between the QFI and the order of the EP. We apply the formula to study a three-mode EP sensor and a multi-mode bosonic Kitaev chain and show that the EP physics can significantly enhance the sensing sensitivity. Our work establishes the connection between two important fields: non-Hermitian EP dynamics and quantum sensing, and may find important applications in quantum information and quantum non-Hermitian physics.</description>

      <title>Quantum Algorithm For Solving Nonlinear Algebraic Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear equations are challenging to solve due to their inherently nonlinear nature. As analytical solutions typically do not exist, numerical methods have been developed to tackle their solutions. In this article, we give a quantum algorithm for solving a system of nonlinear algebraic equations, in which each equation is a multivariate polynomial of known coefficients. Building upon the classical Newton method and some recent works on quantum algorithm plus block encoding from the quantum singular value transformation, we show how to invert the Jacobian matrix to execute Newton's iterative method for solving nonlinear equations, where each contributing equation is a homogeneous polynomial of an even degree. A detailed analysis are then carried out to reveal that our method achieves polylogarithmic time in relative to the number of variables. Furthermore, the number of required qubits is logarithmic in the number of variables. In particular, we also show that our method can be modified with little effort to deal with polynomial of various types, thus implying the generality of our approach. Some examples coming from physical context, such as Gross-Pitaevski equation and Lotka-Volterra equations, involving nonlinear partial differential equations are provided to motivate the potential application, with a description on how to extend our algorithm with even less effort in such a scenario. Our work thus marks a further important step towards quantum advantage in nonlinear science, enabled by the framework of quantum singular value transformation.</description>

      <title>Agnostic Tomography of Stabilizer Product States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define a quantum learning task called agnostic tomography, where given copies of an arbitrary state $\rho$ and a class of quantum states $\mathcal{C}$, the goal is to output a succinct description of a state that approximates $\rho$ at least as well as any state in $\mathcal{C}$ (up to some small error $\varepsilon$). This task generalizes ordinary quantum tomography of states in $\mathcal{C}$ and is more challenging because the learning algorithm must be robust to perturbations of $\rho$.
  We give an efficient agnostic tomography algorithm for the class $\mathcal{C}$ of $n$-qubit stabilizer product states. Assuming $\rho$ has fidelity at least $\tau$ with a stabilizer product state, the algorithm runs in time $n^{O(1 + \log(1/\tau))} / \varepsilon^2$. This runtime is quasipolynomial in all parameters, and polynomial if $\tau$ is a constant.</description>

      <title>Quantum Digital Simulation of Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics: Insights from Superconducting and Trapped Ion Quantum Testbeds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A leading application of quantum computers is the efficient simulation of large unitary quantum systems. Extending this advantage to the study of open Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics (CQED) systems could enable the use of quantum computers in the exploration and design of many-body quantum optical devices. Such devices have promising applications in optical quantum communication, simulation, and computing. In this work, we present an early exploration of the potential for quantum computers to efficiently investigate open CQED physics. Our simulations make use of a recent quantum algorithm that maps the dynamics of a singly excited open Tavis-Cummings model containing $N$ atoms coupled to a lossy cavity. We report the results of executing this algorithm on two noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers, a superconducting processor and a trapped ion processor, to simulate the population dynamics of an open CQED system featuring $N = 3$ atoms. By applying technology-specific transpilation and error mitigation techniques, we minimize the impact of gate errors, noise, and decoherence in each hardware platform, obtaining results which agree closely with the exact solution of the system. These results provide confidence that future simulation algorithms, combined with emerging large-scale quantum processors, can be a powerful tool for studying cavity quantum electrodynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum algorithms have shown successful results in solving noisy linear problems with quantum samples in which cryptographic hard problems are relevant. In this paper the previous results are investigated in detail, leading to new quantum and classical algorithms under the same assumptions as in the earlier works. To be specific, we present a polynomial-time quantum algorithm for solving the ring learning with errors problem with quantum samples which was deemed to be infeasible in [12], as well as polynomial-time classical algorithms that are more efficient than the corresponding quantum algorithms in solving the short integer solution problem with quantum samples and the learning with errors problem with size-reduced quantum samples.</description>

      <title>Artificial Relaxation in NMR Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Environmental noises cause the relaxation of quantum systems and decrease the precision of operations. Apprehending the relaxation mechanism via environmental noises is essential for building quantum technologies. Relaxations can be considered a process of information dissipation from the system into an environment with infinite degrees of freedom (DoF). According to this idea, a model of artificial relaxation has been proposed and demonstrated in NMR experiments. Although this model successfully understood the central idea of relaxation, we observed recursive behavior, which is non-ideal to describe relaxation, because of few DoF of the ``artificial environment''. In this paper, we extend the approach of the artificial environment and discuss, theoretically and experimentally, how many DoF of the environment are necessary for realizing ideal relaxation behavior. Our approach will help us thoroughly understand the concept of relaxation.</description>

      <title>Universal time scalings of sensitivity in Markovian quantum metrology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assuming a Markovian time evolution of a quantum sensing system, we provide a general characterization of the optimal sensitivity scalings with time, under the most general quantum control protocols. We allow the estimated parameter to influence both the Hamiltonian as well as the dissipative part of the quantum master equation. We focus on the asymptotic-time as well as the short-time sensitivity scalings, and investigate the relevant time scales on which the transition between the two regimes appears. This allows us to characterize, via simple algebraic conditions (in terms of the Hamiltonian, the jump operators as well as their parameter derivatives), the four classes of metrological models that represent: quadratic-linear, quadratic-quadratic, linear-linear and linear-quadratic time scalings. We also provide universal numerical methods to obtain quantitative bounds on sensitivity that are the tightest that exist in the literature.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectral loopholes in the 1000-2100 nm range have been the focus of attention of quantum hacking research aimed at searching and elimination of vulnerabilities in quantum key distribution systems. In this work, we concentrate on shorter wavelengths ranged from 400 nm up to 800 nm and experimentally study spectra of insertion losses for a number of fiber optical components to assess potentials for their implementation as countermeasures. We show that efficiency of the elements commonly used as countermeasures against hacking attacks in the telecom range can be significantly impaired in the visible range. It is found that the vulnerabilities detected in this range play an increasingly important role for hacking strategies such as the induced-photorefraction attack whose efficiency improves when the wavelength decreases.</description>

      <title>Effect on spectral purity due to on-chip temporal manipulation of the pump</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic Integrated Circuits (PIC)s are a promising contender for quantum information technologies. The spectral purity of photons is one of the key attributes of PIC photon-pair sources. The dual-pulse pump manipulation technique [1] showed &gt;99% purity in ring-resonator photon-pair sources. Here, we have developed a PIC to shape a pulse into dual, triple and quadruple pulses and investigated the effect of these pump pulse configurations on the purity. Our results show that more complex configurations over dual-pulse do not result in comparatively higher purity but allow accurate control over choosing arbitrary values of the purity.</description>

      <title>Revealing the Boundary between Quantum Mechanics and Classical Model by EPR-Steering Inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In quantum information, the Werner state is a benchmark to test the boundary between quantum mechanics and classical models. There have been three well-known critical values for the two-qubit Werner state, i.e., $V_{\rm c}^{\rm E}=1/3$ characterizing the boundary between entanglement and separable model, $V_{\rm c}^{\rm B}\approx 0.6595$ characterizing the boundary between Bell's nonlocality and the local-hidden-variable (LHV) model, while $V_{\rm c}^{\rm S}=1/2$ characterizing the boundary between Einstein-Podolsky- Rosen (EPR) steering and the local-hidden-state (LHS) model. So far, the problem of $V_{\rm c}^{\rm E}=1/3$ has been completely solved by an inequality involving in the positive-partial-transpose criterion, while how to reveal the other two critical values by the inequality approach are still open. In this work, we focus on EPR steering, which is a form of quantum nonlocality intermediate between entanglement and Bell's nonlocality. By proposing the optimal $N$-setting linear EPR-steering inequalities, we have successfully obtained the desired value $V_{\rm c}^{\rm S}=1/2$ for the two-qubit Werner state, thus resolving the long-standing problem.</description>

      <title>Crosstalk-mitigated microelectronic control for optically-active spins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To exploit the sub-nanometre dimensions of qubits for large-scale quantum information processing, corresponding control architectures require both energy and space efficiency, with the on-chip footprint of unit-cell electronics ideally micron-scale. However, the spin coherence of qubits in close packing is severely deteriorated by microwave crosstalk from neighbouring control sites. Here, we present a crosstalk-mitigation scheme using foundry microelectronics, to address solid-state spins at sub-100 um spacing without the need for qubit-detuning. Using nitrogen-vacancy centres in nanodiamonds as qubit prototypes, we first demonstrate 10 MHz Rabi oscillation at milliwatts of microwave power. Implementing the active cancellation, we then prove that the crosstalk field from neighbouring lattice sites can be reduced to undetectable levels. We finally extend the scheme to show increased qubit control, tripling the spin coherence under crosstalk mitigation. Compatible with integrated optics, our results present a step towards scalable control across quantum platforms using silicon microelectronics.</description>

      <title>Clock offset recovery with sublinear complexity enables synchronization on low-level hardware for quantum key distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce iQSync, a clock offset recovery method designed for implementation on low-level hardware, such as FPGAs or microcontrollers, for quantum key distribution (QKD). iQSync requires minimal memory, only a simple instruction set (e.g. no floating-point operations), and can be evaluated with sublinear time complexity, typically involving no more than a few thousand iterations of a simple loop. Furthermore, iQSync allows for a precise clock offset recovery within few seconds, even for large offsets, and is well suited for scenarios with high channel loss and low signal-to-noise ratio, irrespective of the prepare-and-measure QKD protocol used.

      <title>Almost zero transfer in continuous-time quantum walks on weighted tree graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the probability flux on the central vertex in continuous-time quantum walks on weighted tree graphs. In a weighted graph, each edge has a weight we call hopping. This hopping sets the jump rate of the particle between the vertices connected by the edge. Here, the edges of the central vertex (root) have a hopping parameter $J$ larger than those of the other edges. For star graphs, this hopping gives only how often the walker visits the central vertex over time. However, for weighted spider graphs $S_{n,2}$ and $S_{n,3}$, the probability on the central vertex drops with $J^2$ for walks starting from a state of any superposition of leaf vertices. We map Cayley trees $C_{3,2}$ and $C_{3,3}$ into these spider graphs and observe the same dependency. Our results suggest this is a general feature of such walks on weighted trees and a way of probing decoherence effects in an open quantum system context.</description>

      <title>Geodesics for mixed quantum states via their geometric mean operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the geodesic between two mixed states of arbitrary dimension by means of their geometric mean operator. We utilize the fiber bundle approach by which the distance between two mixed state density operators $\rho_1$ and $\rho_2$ in the base space $M$ is given by the shortest distance in the (Hilbert Schmidt) bundle space $E$ of their purifications. The latter is well-known to be given by the Bures distance along the horizontal lift in $E$ of the geodesic between the $\rho_1$ and $\rho_2$ in $M$. The horizontal lift is that unique curve in $E$ that orthogonally traverses the fibers $F\subset E$ above the curve in $M$, and projects down onto it. We briefly review this formalism and show how it can be used to construct the intermediate mixed quantum states $\rho(s)$ along the base space geodesic parameterized by affine parameter $s$ between the initial $\rho_1$ and final $\rho_2$ states. We emphasize the role played by geometric mean operator $M(s) = \rho_1^{-1/2}\, \sqrt{\rho_1^{1/2}\rho(s)\rho_1^{1/2}}\,\rho_1^{-1/2}$, where the Uhlmann root fidelity between $\rho_1$ and $\rho(s)$ is given by $\sqrt{F}(\rho_1,\rho(s)) = Tr[M(s)\,\rho_1] = Tr[\sqrt{\rho_1^{1/2}\rho(s)\rho_1^{1/2}}]$, and $\rho(s) = M(s)\,\rho_1\,M(s)$. We give examples for the geodesic between the maximally mixed state and a pure state in arbitrary dimensions, as well as for the geodesic between Werner states $\rho(p) = (1-p) I/N + p\,|\Psi\rangle\langle \Psi|$ with $|\Psi\rangle = \{|GHZ\rangle, |W\rangle\}$ in dimension $N=2^3$. For the latter, we compare expressions in the limit $p\to1$ to the infinite number of possible geodesics between the orthogonal pure states $|GHZ\rangle$ and $|W\rangle$. Lastly, we compute the analytic form for the density matrices along the geodesic that connects two arbitrary endpoint qubit density matrices within the Bloch ball for dimension $N=2$.</description>

      <title>Thermal Area Law in Long-Range Interacting Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The area law of the bipartite information measure characterizes one of the most fundamental aspects of quantum many-body physics. In thermal equilibrium, the area law for the mutual information universally holds at arbitrary temperatures as long as the systems have short-range interactions. In systems with power-law decaying interactions, $r^{-\alpha}$ ($r$: distance), conditions for the thermal area law are elusive. In this work, we aim to clarify the optimal condition $\alpha&gt; \alpha_c$ such that the thermal area law universally holds. A standard approach to considering the conditions is to focus on the magnitude of the boundary interaction between two subsystems. However, we find here that the thermal area law is more robust than this conventional argument suggests. We show the optimal threshold for the thermal area law by $\alpha_c= (D+1)/2$ ($D$: the spatial dimension of the lattice), assuming a power-law decay of the clustering for the bipartite correlations. Remarkably, this condition encompasses even the thermodynamically unstable regimes $\alpha &lt; D$. We verify this condition numerically, finding that it is qualitatively accurate for both integrable and non-integrable systems. Unconditional proof of the thermal area law is possible by developing the power-law clustering theorem for $\alpha &gt; D$ above a threshold temperature. Furthermore, the numerical calculation for the logarithmic negativity shows that the same criterion $\alpha &gt; (D+1)/2$ applies to the thermal area law for quantum entanglement.</description>

      <title>Discriminating chaotic and integrable regimes in quenched field Floquet system using saturation of Out-of-time-order correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamic region of out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs) is a valuable discriminator of chaos in classical and semiclassical systems, as it captures the characteristic exponential growth. However, in spin systems, it does not reliably quantify chaos, exhibiting similar behavior in both integrable and chaotic systems. Instead, we leverage the saturation behavior of OTOCs as a means to differentiate between chaotic and integrable regimes. We use integrable and nonintegrable quenched field Floquet systems to describe this discriminator. In the integrable system, the saturation region of OTOCs exhibits oscillatory behavior, whereas, in the chaotic system, it shows exact saturation i.e., system gets thermalized. To gain a clearer understanding of the oscillations, we calculate the inverse participation ratio (IPR) for the normalized Fourier spectrum of OTOC. In order to further substantiate our findings, we propose the nearest-neighbor spacing distribution (NNSD) of time-dependent unitary operators. This distribution effectively differentiates chaotic and regular regions, corroborating the outcomes derived from the saturation behavior of OTOC.</description>

      <title>Review on Quantum Walk Computing: Theory, Implementation, and Application</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical random walk formalism shows a significant role across a wide range of applications. As its quantum counterpart, the quantum walk is proposed as an important theoretical model for quantum computing. By exploiting the quantum effects such as superposition, interference and entanglement, quantum walks and their variety have been extensively studied for achieving beyond classical computing power, and they have been broadly used in designing quantum algorithms in fields ranging from algebraic and optimization problems, graph and network analysis, to quantum Hamiltonian and biochemical process simulations, and even further quantum walk models have proven their capabilities for universal quantum computation. Compared to the conventional quantum circuit models, quantum walks show a feasible path for implementing application-specific quantum computing in particularly the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era. Recently remarkable progress has been achieved in implementing a wide variety of quantum walks and quantum walk applications, demonstrating the great potential of quantum walks. In this review, we provide a thorough summary of quantum walks and quantum walk computing, including aspects of quantum walk theories and characteristics, advances in their physical implementations and the flourishingly developed quantum walk computing applications. We also discuss the challenges facing quantum walk computing, toward realizing a practical quantum computer in the near future.</description>

      <title>Structured free-space optical fields for transverse and longitudinal control of electron matter waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling free-electron momentum states is of high interest in electron microscopy to achieve momentum and energy resolved probing and manipulation of physical systems. Free-electron and light interactions have emerged as a powerful technique to accomplish this. Here, we demonstrate both longitudinal and transverse phase control of a slow electron wavepacket by extending the Kapitza-Dirac effect to spatially-structured pulsed laser beams. This extension enables both inelastic and elastic stimulated Compton scattering. The interaction reveals the formation of distinct electron transverse momentum orders, each demonstrating a comb-like electron energy spectrum. By exerting complete control over light parameters, including wavelength, field intensity, pulse duration, and spatial mode order, as well as their combinations, it is possible to coherently control the population of these electron energy-momentum states that are separated by a few meV energy and multiple photon momentum orders. This free-space electron-light interaction phenomenon possesses the capability to coherently control the energy and momentum of electron beams in electron microscopes. Moreover, it has the potential to facilitate the selective probing of various material excitations, including plasmons, excitons, and phonons, and performing Talbot-Lau matter-wave interferometry with transversely shaped electron beams.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A method combining the Lagrange-mesh and the complex Kohn variational methods is developed for computing the $\mathcal{S}$ matrix of a 2$+$1 elastic scattering in the frame of three-body Coulomb systems. Resonance parameters can be obtained from values of the $\mathcal{S}$ matrix at several scattering energies. The method is illustrated with the $S$-wave low-energy scattering of an electron onto hydrogen. The computed phase shifts are at least as accurate as the literature results, and the resonance parameters are more accurate than the best literature results by several orders of magnitude. Both the infinite and finite proton mass cases are considered.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of state synthesis in the DQC1 (One Clean Qubit) model of quantum computation, which provides a single pure qubit and $n$ maximally mixed qubits, and after applying any quantum circuit some subset of the qubits are measured or discarded. In the case of discarding, we show that it is impossible to prepare additional pure qubits, and that it is impossible to prepare very low-temperature Gibbs states on additional qubits. In the case of measurements, we show that the probability of synthesizing $m$ additional qubits is bounded by $2^{1-m}$, and that the probability of preparing low-temperature Gibbs states is bounded by $2^{2-m}$. As a consequence, we give a lower-bound the runtime of a recently studied class of repeated interaction quantum algorithms. The techniques used study states and circuits at the level of entries of their respective density and unitary matrices.</description>

Abstract: Quantum memory devices with high storage efficiency and bandwidth are essential elements for future quantum networks. Solid-state quantum memories can provide broadband storage, but they primarily suffer from low storage efficiency. We use passive optimization and machine learning techniques to demonstrate nearly a 6-fold enhancement in quantum memory efficiency. In this regime, we demonstrate coherent and single-photon-level storage with a high signal-to-noise ratio. The optimization technique presented here can be applied to most solid-state quantum memories to significantly improve the storage efficiency without compromising the memory bandwidth.</description>

      <title>Phonon Induced Contrast in Matter Wave Interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Utilizing the Stern-Gerlach apparatus to create matter-wave superposition states is a long-sought-after goal, not only due to its potential applications in the quantum realm but also because of its fundamental implications for studying the quantum properties of gravity. The main challenge in creating a macroscopic quantum interferometer arises from the loss of coherence, primarily through two channels. One channel involves strong coupling with the environment for macroscopic matter, leading to decoherence. The other channel relates to the precision of wave packet overlap, which can occur due to external and internal fluctuations of various sources. The latter introduces a unique challenge for larger-scale masses by perturbing the centre of mass motion of the macroscopic object. Here, we study a particular challenge, namely, the issue of internal degrees of freedom, specifically phonon fluctuations and contrast reduction. This work will investigate the contrast reduction caused by spin-magnetic field and diamagnetic interactions at the phonon occupation level in the quantum gravity-induced entanglement of masses (QGEM) protocol configuration.</description>

      <title>Multipartite edge modes and tensor networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Holographic tensor networks model AdS/CFT, but so far they have been limited by involving only systems that are very different from gravity. Unfortunately, we cannot straightforwardly discretize gravity to incorporate it, because that would break diffeomorphism invariance. In this note, we explore a resolution. In low dimensions gravity can be written as a topological gauge theory, which can be discretized without breaking gauge-invariance. However, new problems arise. Foremost, we now need a qualitatively new kind of "area operator," which has no relation to the number of links along the cut and is instead topological. Secondly, the inclusion of matter becomes trickier. We successfully construct a tensor network both including matter and with this new type of area. Notably, while this area is still related to the entanglement in "edge mode" degrees of freedom, the edge modes are no longer bipartite entangled pairs. Instead they are highly multipartite. Along the way, we calculate the entropy of novel subalgebras in a particular topological gauge theory. We also show that the multipartite nature of the edge modes gives rise to non-commuting area operators, a property that other tensor networks do not exhibit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the non-equilibrium dynamics of the dissipative quantum East model via numerical tensor networks. We use matrix product states to represent evolution under quantum-jump unravellings for sizes beyond those accessible to exact diagonalisation. This allows us to demonstrate that dynamical heterogeneity accompanies slow relaxation, in analogy with what is seen in classical glassy systems. Furthermore, using variational matrix product operators we: (i) compute the spectral gap of the Lindbladian, and show that glassiness is enhanced in the presence of weak quantum fluctuations compared to the pure classical case, and (ii) obtain the dynamical large deviations by calculating the leading eigenvector of the tilted Lindbladian, and find clear evidence for a first-order active-inactive dynamical phase transition. We also show how to directly sample the rare quantum trajectories associated to the large deviations.</description>

      <title>Resonance energies and linewidths of Rydberg excitons in Cu$_2$O quantum wells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rydberg excitons are the solid-state analog of Rydberg atoms and can, e.g., for cuprous oxide, easily reach a large size in the region of $\mu$m for principal quantum numbers up to $n=25$. The fabrication of quantum well-like structures in the crystal leads to quantum confinement effects and opens the possibility to study a crossover from three-dimensional to two-dimensional excitons. For small widths of the quantum well (QW) there are several well separated Rydberg series between various scattering thresholds leading to the occurrence of electron-hole resonances with finite lifetimes above the lowest threshold. By application of the stabilization method to the parametric dependencies of the real-valued eigenvalues of the original three-dimensional Schr\"{o}dinger equation we calculate the resonance energies and linewidths for Rydberg excitons in QWs in regimes where a perturbative treatment is impossible. The positions and finite linewidths of resonances at energies above the third threshold are compared with the complex resonance energies obtained within the framework of the complex-coordinate-rotation technique. The excellent agreement between the results demonstrates the validity of both methods for intermediate sizes of the QW-like structures, and thus for arbitrary widths.</description>

      <title>Phenomenology of a Rydberg impurity in an ideal Bose Einstein condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the absorption spectrum of a Rydberg impurity immersed in and interacting with an ideal Bose-Einstein condensate. Here, the impurity-bath interaction can greatly exceed the mean interparticle distance; this discrepancy in length scales challenges the assumptions underlying the universal aspects of impurity atoms in dilute bosonic environments. Our analysis finds three distinct parameter regimes, each characterized by a unique spectral response. In the low-density regime, we find that the Rydberg impurity is dressed by the surrounding bath similarly to the known Bose polaron. Transitioning to intermediate densities, the impurity response, given by sharp quasiparticle peaks, fragments into an intricate pattern bearing the hallmarks of a diverse molecular structure. Finally, at high density, a universal Gaussian response emerges as the statistical nature of the bath dominates its quantum dynamics. We complement this analysis with a study of an ionic impurity, which behaves equivalently. Our exploration offers insights into the interplay between interaction range, density, and many-body behavior in impurity systems.</description>

      <title>Algebraic localization-delocalization phase transition in moving potential wells on a lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The localization and scattering properties of potential wells or barriers uniformly moving on a lattice are strongly dependent on the drift velocity owing to violation of the Galilean invariance of the discrete Schr\"odinger equation. Here a type of localization-delocalization phase transition of algebraic type is unravelled, which does not require any kind of disorder and arises when a power-law potential well drifts fast on a lattice. While for an algebraic exponent $\alpha$ lower than the critical value $\alpha_c=1$ dynamical delocalization is observed, for $\alpha&gt; \alpha_c$ asymptotic localization, corresponding to an asymptotic frozen dynamics, is instead realized. At the critical phase transition point $\alpha_=\alpha_c=1$ an oscillatory dynamics is found, corresponding to Bloch oscillations. An experimentally-accessible photonic platform for the observation of the predicted algebraic phase transition, based on light dynamics in synthetic mesh lattices, is suggested.</description>

Abstract: High-order harmonic generation driven by intense extreme ultraviolet (EUV) fields merges quantum optics and attosecond science, giving rise to an appealing route for the generation of coherent EUV and soft X-ray light for high-resolution imaging and spectroscopies. We theoretically investigate ultrafast resonant dynamics during the interaction of He atoms with strong extreme ultraviolet pulses. At high driving intensities, we identify record fast attosecond Rabi oscillations imprinting observable signatures in the high harmonic spectrum. At field strengths suppressing the Coulomb potential barrier for all the bounded states, we demonstrate the survival of the attosecond two-level dynamics for several Rabi cycles. Consequently, this intense EUV laser-atom interaction reveals a new strong-field scenario where the resonant coupling of two-level bound-bound transitions prevails, contrasting with the dominance of bound-continuum transitions in the conventional strong-field infrared regimes. These findings set an interesting perspective for extreme attosecond nonlinear optics with intense short-wavelength fields.</description>

      <title>Queue-aware Network Control Algorithm with a High Quantum Computing Readiness-Evaluated in Discrete-time Flow Simulator for Fat-Pipe Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emerging technology of quantum computing has the potential to change the way how problems will be solved in the future. This work presents a centralized network control algorithm executable on already existing quantum computer which are based on the principle of quantum annealing like the D-Wave Advantage. We introduce a resource reoccupation algorithm for traffic engineering in wide-area networks. The proposed optimization algorithm changes traffic steering and resource allocation in case of overloaded transceivers. Settings of active components like fiber amplifiers and transceivers are not changed for the reason of stability. This algorithm is beneficial in situations when the network traffic is fluctuating in time scales of seconds or spontaneous bursts occur. Further, we developed a discrete-time flow simulator to study the algorithm's performance in wide-area networks. Our network simulator considers backlog and loss modeling of buffered transmission lines. Concurring flows are handled equally in case of a backlog.
  This work provides an ILP-based network configuring algorithm that is applicable on quantum annealing computers. We showcase, that traffic losses can be reduced significantly by a factor of 2 if a resource reoccupation algorithm is applied in a network with bursty traffic. As resources are used more efficiently by reoccupation in heavy load situations, overprovisioning of networks can be reduced. Thus, this new form of network operation leads toward a zero-margin network. We show that our newly introduced network simulator enables analyses of short-time effects like buffering within fat-pipe networks. As the calculation of network configurations in real-sized networks is typically time-consuming, quantum computing can enable the proposed network configuration algorithm for application in real-sized wide-area networks.</description>

      <title>Robust incoherent perfect absorption</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A coherent perfect absorber is capable of completely absorbing input waves. However, the coherent perfect absorption severely depends on the superposition of the input waves, and the perfect absorption is sensitive to the disorder of the absorber. Thus, a robust incoherent perfect absorption, being insensitive to the superposition of input waves and the system disorder, is desirable for practical applications. Here, we demonstrate that the linearly independent destructive interference at the port connections removes the constraint on the coherent input. We propose an approach using the interplay between the loss and localization to form the incoherent perfect absorption. The resonant incidence from either port is completely absorbed. Furthermore, we utilize the lattice configuration supporting the flat band to demonstrate the disorder-immune incoherent perfect absorption. Our findings provide insight into the fundamentals and applications for the perfect absorption of light, microwaves, sound, mechanical waves, and beyond.</description>

      <title>Competing topological phases in a non-Hermitian time-reversal symmetry-broken Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang (BHZ) model, which serves as a cornerstone in the study of the quantum spin Hall insulators, showcases robust spin-filtered helical edge states in a nanoribbon geometry. In the presence of an in-plane magnetic field, these (first-order) helical states gap out to be replaced by second-order corner states under suitable open-boundary conditions. Here, we show that the inclusion of a spin-dependent non-Hermitian balanced gain/loss potential induces a competition between these first and second-order topological phases. Surprisingly, the previously dormant first-order helical edge states in the nanoribbon resurface as the non-Hermitian effect intensifies, effectively neutralizing the role played by the magnetic field. By employing the projected spin spectra and the spin Chern number, we conclusively explain the resurgence of the first-order topological properties in the time-reversal symmetry-broken BHZ model in presence of non-Hermiticity. Finally, the biorthogonal spin-resolved Berry phase, exhibiting a non-trivial winding, definitively establishes the topological nature of these revived edge states, emphasizing the dominance of non-Hermiticity over the magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Zeno physics of the Ising chain with symmetry-breaking boundary dephasing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In few-qubit systems, the quantum Zeno effect arises when measurement occurs sufficiently frequently that the spins are unable to relax between measurements. This can compete with Hamiltonian terms, resulting in interesting relaxation processes which depend non-monotonically on the ratio of measurement rate to coherent oscillations. While Zeno physics for a single qubit is well-understood, an interesting open question is how the Zeno effect is modified by coupling the measured spin to a non-trivial bulk. In this work, we study the effect of coupling a one-dimensional transverse field Ising to a Zeno spin which lives at the boundary. We find that sharp singularities occur in the boundary relaxation dynamics, which can be tied to the emergence or destruction of edge modes that can be found analytically. Finally, we provide numerical evidence that the dynamical singularities are stable in the presence of integrability-breaking interactions.</description>

      <title>Incoherent polariton dynamics and nonlinearities in organic light-emitting diodes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) have redefined lighting with their environment-friendliness and flexibility. However, only 25 % of the electronic states of fluorescent molecules can emit light upon electrical excitation, limiting the overall efficiency of OLEDs. Strong light-matter coupling, achieved by confining light within OLEDs using mirrors, generates polaritons - hybrid light-matter states - that could activate the remaining 75 % electronic states. Here, we show how different processes in such polariton OLEDs can be expected to change using a phenomenological quantum master equation model. We are especially interested in reverse inter-system crossing happening directly from the dark triplet states to the emitting lower polariton. We derive a simple expression for the enhancement factor of polaritonic RISC in the linear regime. In addition, we explore the extension of our model to higher dimensions and study some potential effects of strong coupling on nonlinear processes such as triplet-triplet annihilation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1005.2358v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce quantum versions of the $\chi^2$-divergence, provide a detailed analysis of their properties, and apply them in the investigation of mixing times of quantum Markov processes. An approach similar to the one presented in [1-3] for classical Markov chains is taken to bound the trace-distance from the steady state of a quantum processes. A strict spectral bound to the convergence rate can be given for time-discrete as well as for time-continuous quantum Markov processes. Furthermore the contractive behavior of the $\chi^2$-divergence under the action of a completely positive map is investigated and contrasted to the contraction of the trace norm. In this context we analyse different versions of quantum detailed balance and, finally, give a geometric conductance bound to the convergence rate for unital quantum Markov processes.</description>

Abstract: We study the problem of approximating a quantum channel by one with as few Kraus operators as possible (in the sense that, for any input state, the output states of the two channels should be close to one another). Our main result is that any quantum channel mapping states on some input Hilbert space $\mathrm{A}$ to states on some output Hilbert space $\mathrm{B}$ can be compressed into one with order $d\log d$ Kraus operators, where $d=\max(|\mathrm{A}|,|\mathrm{B}|)$, hence much less than $|\mathrm{A}||\mathrm{B}|$. In the case where the channel's outputs are all very mixed, this can be improved to order $d$. We discuss the optimality of this result as well as some consequences.</description>

      <title>Efficient Quantum Network Communication using Optimized Entanglement-Swapping Trees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2112.11002v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum network communication is challenging, as the No-cloning theorem in quantum regime makes many classical techniques inapplicable. For long-distance communication, the only viable communication approach is teleportation of quantum states, which requires a prior distribution of entangled pairs (EPs) of qubits. Establishment of EPs across remote nodes can incur significant latency due to the low probability of success of the underlying physical processes.
  The focus of our work is to develop efficient techniques that minimize EP generation latency. Prior works have focused on selecting entanglement paths; in contrast, we select entanglement swapping trees--a more accurate representation of the entanglement generation structure. We develop a dynamic programming algorithm to select an optimal swapping-tree for a single pair of nodes, under the given capacity and fidelity constraints. For the general setting, we develop an efficient iterative algorithm to compute a set of swapping trees. We present simulation results which show that our solutions outperform the prior approaches by an order of magnitude and are viable for long-distance entanglement generation.</description>

      <title>Classical analogue of quantum superdense coding and communication advantage of a single quantum system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2202.06796v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze utility of communication channels in absence of any short of quantum or classical correlation shared between the sender and the receiver. To this aim, we propose a class of two-party communication games, and show that the games cannot be won given a noiseless $1$-bit classical channel from the sender to the receiver. Interestingly, the goal can be perfectly achieved if the channel is assisted with classical shared randomness. This resembles an advantage similar to the quantum superdense coding phenomenon where pre-shared entanglement can enhance the communication utility of a perfect quantum communication line. Quite surprisingly, we show that a qubit communication without any assistance of classical shared randomness can achieve the goal, and hence establishes a novel quantum advantage in the simplest communication scenario. In pursuit of a deeper origin of this advantage, we show that an advantageous quantum strategy must invoke quantum interference both at the encoding step by the sender and at the decoding step by the receiver. We also study communication utility of a class of non-classical toy systems described by symmetric polygonal state spaces. We come up with communication tasks that can be achieved neither with $1$-bit of classical communication nor by communicating a polygon system, whereas $1$-qubit communication yields a perfect strategy, establishing quantum advantage over them. To this end, we show that the quantum advantages are robust against imperfect encodings-decodings, making the protocols implementable with presently available quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Time Dependent Hamiltonian Simulation Using Discrete Clock Constructions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.11353v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Compared with time independent Hamiltonians, the dynamics of generic quantum Hamiltonians $H(t)$ are complicated by the presence of time ordering in the evolution operator. In the context of digital quantum simulation, this difficulty prevents a direct adaptation of time independent simulation algorithms for time dependent simulation. However, there exists a framework within the theory of dynamical systems which eliminates time ordering by adding a "clock" degree of freedom. In this work, we provide a computational framework, based on this reduction, for encoding time dependent dynamics as time independent systems. As a result, we make two advances in digital Hamiltonian simulation. First, we create a time dependent simulation algorithm based on performing qubitization on the augmented clock system, and in doing so, provide the first qubitization-based approach to time dependent Hamiltonians that goes beyond Trotterization of the ordered exponential. Second, we define a natural generalization of multiproduct formulas for time-ordered exponentials, then propose and analyze an algorithm based on these formulas. Unlike other algorithms of similar accuracy, the multiproduct approach achieves commutator scaling, meaning that this method outperforms existing methods for physically-local time dependent Hamiltonians. Our work reduces the disparity between time dependent and time independent simulation and indicates a step towards optimal quantum simulation of time dependent Hamiltonians.</description>

It is demonstrated how quantum optimization can play a role in real industrial applications in the manufacturing sector. Using the quantum annealer provided by D-Wave Systems, we analyze the performance of the quantum and quantum-classical hybrid solvers and compare them to deterministic- and random-algorithm classical benchmark solvers. The continued evolution of the quantum technology, indicating an expectation for even greater relevance in the future is discussed and the revolutionary potential it could have in the manufacturing sector is highlighted.</description>

Abstract: The Unruh-DeWitt particle detector model has found success in demonstrating quantum information channels with non-zero channel capacity between qubits and quantum fields. These detector models provide the necessary framework for experimentally realizable Unruh-DeWitt Quantum Computers with near-perfect channel capacity. We propose spin qubits with gate-controlled coupling to Luttinger liquids as a laboratory setting for Unruh-DeWitt detectors and general design constraints that underpin their feasibility in this and other settings. We also present several experimental scenarios including graphene ribbons, edges states in the quantum spin Hall phase of HgTe quantum wells, and the recently discovered quantum anomalous Hall phase in transition metal dichalcogenides. Theoretically, through bosonization, we show that Unruh-DeWitt detectors can carry out Quantum Computations and when they can make perfect quantum communication channels between qubits via the Luttinger liquid. Our results point the way toward an all-to-all connected solid state quantum computer and the experimental study of quantum information in quantum fields via condensed matter physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.16551v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Excited-state quantum phase transitions (ESQPTs) strongly influence the spectral properties of collective many-body quantum systems, changing degeneracy patterns in different quantum phases. Level degeneracies, in turn, affect the system's dynamics. We analyze the degeneracy dependence on the size of two-level boson models with a $u(n+1)$ dynamical algebra, where $n$ is the number of collective degrees of freedom. Below the ESQPT critical energy of these models, the energy gap between neighboring levels that belong to different symmetry sectors gets close to zero as the system size increases. We report and explain why this gap goes to zero exponentially for systems with one collective degree of freedom, but algebraically in models with more than one degree of freedom. As a consequence, we show that the infinite-time average of out-of-time-order correlators is an ESQPT order parameter in finite systems with $n=1$, but in systems with $n&gt;1$, this average only works as an order parameter in the mean-field limit.</description>

Abstract: We report the first hybrid matter-photon implementation of verifiable blind quantum computing. We use a trapped-ion quantum server and a client-side photonic detection system networked via a fibre-optic quantum link. The availability of memory qubits and deterministic entangling gates enables interactive protocols without post-selection - key requirements for any scalable blind server, which previous realisations could not provide. We quantify the privacy at &lt;~0.03 leaked classical bits per qubit. This experiment demonstrates a path to fully verified quantum computing in the cloud.</description>

      <title>Efficient Learning of Quantum States Prepared With Few Non-Clifford Gates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.13409v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a pair of algorithms that efficiently learn a quantum state prepared by Clifford gates and $O(\log n)$ non-Clifford gates. Specifically, for an $n$-qubit state $|\psi\rangle$ prepared with at most $t$ non-Clifford gates, our algorithms use $\mathsf{poly}(n,2^t,1/\varepsilon)$ time and copies of $|\psi\rangle$ to learn $|\psi\rangle$ to trace distance at most $\varepsilon$.
  The first algorithm for this task is more efficient, but requires entangled measurements across two copies of $|\psi\rangle$. The second algorithm uses only single-copy measurements at the cost of polynomial factors in runtime and sample complexity. Our algorithms more generally learn any state with sufficiently large stabilizer dimension, where a quantum state has stabilizer dimension $k$ if it is stabilized by an abelian group of $2^k$ Pauli operators. We also develop an efficient property testing algorithm for stabilizer dimension, which may be of independent interest.</description>

Abstract: Digital-analog quantum computing (DAQC) offers a promising approach to addressing the challenges of building a practical quantum computer. By efficiently allocating resources between digital and analog quantum circuits, DAQC paves the way for achieving optimal performance. We propose an algorithm designed to enhance the performance of quantum annealing. This method employs a quantum gate to estimate the goodness of the final annealing state and find the ground state of combinatorial optimization problems. We explore two strategies for integrating the quantum annealing circuit into the DAQC framework: (1) for state preparation, and (2) for embedding within the quantum gate. While the former strategy does not yield performance improvements, we discover that the latter enhances performance within a specific range of annealing time. Algorithms demonstrating enhanced performance utilize the imaginary part of the inner product of two states from different quantum annealing settings. This measure reflects not only the energy of the classical cost function but also the trajectory of the quantum dynamics. This study provides an example of how processing quantum data using a quantum circuit can outperform classical data processing, which discards quantum information.</description>

Abstract: Hybrid quantum-classical computing in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era with variational algorithms can exhibit barren plateau issues, causing difficult convergence of gradient-based optimization techniques. In this paper, we discuss "post-variational strategies", which shift tunable parameters from the quantum computer to the classical computer, opting for ensemble strategies when optimizing quantum models. We discuss various strategies and design principles for constructing individual quantum circuits, where the resulting ensembles can be optimized with convex programming. Further, we discuss architectural designs of post-variational quantum neural networks and analyze the propagation of estimation errors throughout such neural networks. Finally, we show that empirically, post-variational quantum neural networks using our architectural designs can potentially provide better results than variational algorithms and performance comparable to that of two-layer neural networks.</description>

      <title>Pulse optimization for high-precision motional-mode characterization in trapped-ion quantum computers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.15841v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-fidelity operation of quantum computers requires precise knowledge of the physical system through characterization. For motion-mediated entanglement generation in trapped ions, it is crucial to have precise knowledge of the motional-mode parameters such as the mode frequencies and the Lamb-Dicke parameters. Unfortunately, the state-of-the-art mode-characterization schemes do not easily render the mode parameters in a sufficiently scalable and accurate fashion, due to the unwanted excitation of adjacent modes in the frequency space when targeting a single mode, an effect known as the \textit{cross-mode coupling}. Here, we develop an alternative scheme that leverages the degrees of freedom in pulse design for the characterization experiment such that the effects of the cross-mode coupling is actively silenced. Further, we devise stabilization methods to accurately characterize the Lamb-Dicke parameters even when the mode frequencies are not precisely known due to experimental drifts or characterization inaccuracies. We extensively benchmark our scheme in simulations of a three-ion chain and discuss the parameter regimes in which the shaped pulses significantly outperform the traditional square pulses.</description>

      <title>Efficient Learning of Quantum States Prepared With Few Non-Clifford Gates II: Single-Copy Measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.07175v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent work has shown that $n$-qubit quantum states output by circuits with at most $t$ single-qubit non-Clifford gates can be learned to trace distance $\epsilon$ using $\mathsf{poly}(n,2^t,1/\epsilon)$ time and samples. All prior algorithms achieving this runtime use entangled measurements across two copies of the input state. In this work, we give a similarly efficient algorithm that learns the same class of states using only single-copy measurements.</description>

      <title>Unravelling Metastable Markovian Open Quantum Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.14107v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyse the dynamics of metastable Markovian open quantum systems by unravelling their average dynamics into stochastic trajectories. We use quantum reset processes as examples to illustrate metastable phenomenology, including a simple three-state model whose metastability is of classical type, and a two-qubit model that features a metastable decoherence free subspace. In the three-state model, the trajectories exhibit classical metastable phenomenology: fast relaxation into distinct phases and slow transitions between them. This extends the existing correspondence between classical and quantum metastability. It enables the computation of committors for the quantum phases, and the mechanisms of rare transitions between them. For the two-qubit model, the decoherence-free subspace appears in the unravelled trajectories as a slow manifold on which the quantum state has a continuous slow evolution. This provides a classical (non-metastable) analogue of this quantum effect. We discuss the general implications of these results, and we highlight the useful role of quantum reset processes for analysis of quantum trajectories in metastable systems.</description>

      <title>Product states optimize quantum $p$-spin models for large $p$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.11709v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating the maximal energy of quantum $p$-local spin glass random Hamiltonians, the quantum analogues of widely studied classical spin glass models. Denoting by $E^*(p)$ the (appropriately normalized) maximal energy in the limit of a large number of qubits $n$, we show that $E^*(p)$ approaches $\sqrt{2\log 6}$ as $p$ increases. This value is interpreted as the maximal energy of a much simpler so-called Random Energy Model, widely studied in the setting of classical spin glasses.
  Our most notable and (arguably) surprising result proves the existence of near-maximal energy states which are product states, and thus not entangled. Specifically, we prove that with high probability as $n\to\infty$, for any $E&lt;E^*(p)$ there exists a product state with energy $\geq E$ at sufficiently large constant $p$. Even more surprisingly, this remains true even when restricting to tensor products of Pauli eigenstates. Our approximations go beyond what is known from monogamy-of-entanglement style arguments -- the best of which, in this normalization, achieve approximation error growing with $n$. Our results not only challenge prevailing beliefs in physics that extremely low-temperature states of random local Hamiltonians should exhibit non-negligible entanglement, but they also imply that classical algorithms can be just as effective as quantum algorithms in optimizing Hamiltonians with large locality -- though performing such optimization is still likely a hard problem.
  Our results are robust with respect to the choice of the randomness (disorder) and apply to the case of sparse random Hamiltonian using Lindeberg's interpolation method. The proof of the main result is obtained by estimating the expected trace of the associated partition function, and then matching its asymptotics with the extremal energy of product states using the second moment method.</description>

Abstract: We propose iSWAP-type quantum gates based on geometric phases purely associated with paths on the Schmidt sphere [Phys. Rev. A 62, 022109 (2000)]. These geometric Schmidt gates can entangle qubit pairs to an arbitrary degree; in particular, they can create maximally entangled states from product states by an appropriate choice of base point on the Schmidt sphere. We identify Hamiltonians that generate pure paths on the Schmidt sphere by reverse engineering and demonstrate explicitly that the resulting Hamiltonians can be implemented in systems of transmon qubits. The geometric Schmidt gates are characterized by vanishing dynamical phases and are complementary to geometric single-qubit gates that take place on the Bloch sphere.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Machine Learning Models for Quantum Error Correction</title>

Abstract: Quantum Error Correction (QEC) is one of the fundamental problems in quantum computer systems, which aims to detect and correct errors in the data qubits within quantum computers. Due to the presence of unreliable data qubits in existing quantum computers, implementing quantum error correction is a critical step when establishing a stable quantum computer system. Recently, machine learning (ML)-based approaches have been proposed to address this challenge. However, they lack a thorough understanding of quantum error correction. To bridge this research gap, we provide a new perspective to understand machine learning-based QEC in this paper. We find that syndromes in the ancilla qubits result from errors on connected data qubits, and distant ancilla qubits can provide auxiliary information to rule out some incorrect predictions for the data qubits. Therefore, to detect errors in data qubits, we must consider the information present in the long-range ancilla qubits. To the best of our knowledge, machine learning is less explored in the dependency relationship of QEC. To fill the blank, we curate a machine learning benchmark to assess the capacity to capture long-range dependencies for quantum error correction. To provide a comprehensive evaluation, we evaluate seven state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms spanning diverse neural network architectures, such as convolutional neural networks, graph neural networks, and graph transformers. Our exhaustive experiments reveal an enlightening trend: By enlarging the receptive field to exploit information from distant ancilla qubits, the accuracy of QEC significantly improves. For instance, U-Net can improve CNN by a margin of about 50%. Finally, we provide a comprehensive analysis that could inspire future research in this field.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional coherent spectrum of high-spin models via a quantum computing approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14035v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present and benchmark a quantum computing approach to calculate the two-dimensional coherent spectrum (2DCS) of high-spin models. Our approach is based on simulating their real-time dynamics in the presence of several magnetic field pulses, which are spaced in time. We utilize the adaptive variational quantum dynamics simulation (AVQDS) algorithm for the study due to its compact circuits, which enables simulations over sufficiently long times to achieve the required resolution in frequency space. Specifically, we consider an antiferromagnetic quantum spin model that incorporates Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions and single-ion anisotropy. The obtained 2DCS spectra exhibit distinct peaks at multiples of the magnon frequency, arising from transitions between different eigenstates of the unperturbed Hamiltonian. By comparing the one-dimensional coherent spectrum with 2DCS, we demonstrate that 2DCS provides a higher resolution of the energy spectrum. We further investigate how the quantum resources scale with the magnitude of the spin using two different binary encodings of the high-spin operators: the standard binary encoding and the Gray code. At low magnetic fields both encodings require comparable quantum resources, but at larger field strengths the Gray code is advantageous. Lastly, we compare the numerical 2DCS with experimental results on a rare-earth orthoferrite system. The observed strength of the magnonic high-harmonic generation signals in the 2DCS of the quantum high-spin model aligns well with the experimental data, showing significant improvement over the corresponding mean-field results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01810v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As quantum circuits become more integrated and complex, additional error sources that were previously insignificant start to emerge. Consequently, the fidelity of quantum gates benchmarked under pristine conditions falls short of predicting their performance in realistic circuits. To overcome this problem, we must improve their robustness against pertinent error models besides isolated fidelity. Here we report the experimental realization of robust quantum gates in superconducting quantum circuits based on a geometric framework for diagnosing and correcting various gate errors. Using quantum process tomography and randomized benchmarking, we demonstrate robust single-qubit gates against quasi-static noise and spatially-correlated noise in a broad range of strengths, which are common sources of coherent errors in large-scale quantum circuit. We also apply our method to non-static noises and to realize robust two-qubit gates. Our work provides a versatile toolbox for achieving noise-resilient complex quantum circuits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18647v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A non-local quantum computation (NLQC) replaces an interaction between two quantum systems with a single simultaneous round of communication and shared entanglement. We study two classes of NLQC, $f$-routing and $f$-BB84, which are of relevance to classical information theoretic cryptography and quantum position-verification. We give the first non-trivial lower bounds on entanglement in both settings, but are restricted to lower bounding protocols with perfect correctness. Within this setting, we give a lower bound on the Schmidt rank of any entangled state that completes these tasks for a given function $f(x,y)$ in terms of the rank of a matrix $g(x,y)$ whose entries are zero when $f(x,y)=0$, and strictly positive otherwise. This also leads to a lower bound on the Schmidt rank in terms of the non-deterministic quantum communication complexity of $f(x,y)$. Because of a relationship between $f$-routing and the conditional disclosure of secrets (CDS) primitive studied in information theoretic cryptography, we obtain a new technique for lower bounding the randomness complexity of CDS.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.19079v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interferometric phase estimation is an essential tool for precise measurements of quantities such as displacement, velocity and material properties. The lower bound on measurement uncertainty achievable with classical resources is set by the shot-noise limit (SNL) that scales asymptotically as $1/\sqrt{N}$, where $N$ is the number of resources used. The experiment of [S. Daryanoosh et al., Nat. Commun. ${\bf 9}$, 4606 (2018)] showed how to achieve the ultimate precision limit, the exact Heisenberg limit (HL), in ab-initio phase estimation with $N=3$ photon-passes, using an entangled biphoton state in combination with particular measurement techniques. The advantage of the HL over the SNL increases with the number of resources used. Here we present, and implement experimentally, a scheme for generation of the optimal $N=7$ triphoton state. We study experimentally and theoretically the generated state quality and its potential for phase estimation. We show that the expected usefulness of the prepared triphoton state for HL phase estimation is significantly degraded by even quite small experimental imperfections, such as optical mode mismatch and unwanted higher-order multi-photon terms in the states produced in parametric down-conversion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02396v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) code is an exciting route to fault-tolerant quantum computing since Gaussian resources and GKP Pauli-eigenstate preparation are sufficient to achieve universal quantum computing. In this work, we provide a practical proposal to perform Clifford gates and state read-out in GKP codes implemented with active error correction in superconducting circuits. We present a method of performing Clifford circuits without physically implementing any single-qubit gates, reducing the potential for them to spread errors in the system. In superconducting circuits, all the required two-qubit gates can be implemented with a single piece of hardware. We analyze the error-spreading properties of GKP Clifford gates and describe how a modification in the decoder following the implementation of each gate can reduce the gate infidelity by multiple orders of magnitude. Moreover, we develop a simple analytical technique to estimate the effect of loss and dephasing on GKP codes that matches well with numerics. Finally, we consider the effect of homodyne measurement inefficiencies on logical state read-out and present a scheme that implements a measurement with a $0.1\%$ error rate in $630$ ns assuming an efficiency of just~$75\%$.</description>

Abstract: Squeezing is a crucial resource for quantum information processing and quantum sensing. In levitated nanomechanics, squeezed states of motion can be generated via temporal control of the trapping frequency of a massive particle. However, the amount of achievable squeezing typically suffers from detrimental environmental effects. We analyze the performance of a scheme that, by embedding careful time-control of trapping potentials and fully accounting for the most relevant sources of noise -- including measurement backaction -- achieves significant levels of mechanical squeezing. The feasibility of our proposal, which is close to experimental state-of-the-art, makes it a valuable tool for quantum state engineering.</description>

      <title>Efficient, indistinguishable telecom C-band photons using a tapered nanobeam</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01562v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Telecom C-band single photons exhibit the lowest attenuation in optical fibers, enabling long-haul quantum-secured communication. However, efficient coupling with optical fibers is crucial for these single photons to be effective carriers in long-distance transmission. In this work, we demonstrate an efficient fiber-coupled single photon source at the telecom C-band using InAs/InP quantum dots coupled to a tapered nanobeam. The tapered nanobeam structure facilitates directional emission that is mode-matched to a lensed fiber, resulting in a collection efficiency of up to 65% from the nanobeam to a single-mode fiber. Using this approach, we demonstrate single photon count rates of 575 $\pm$ 5 Kcps and a single photon purity of $g^2$ (0) = 0.015 $\pm$ 0.003. Additionally, we demonstrate Hong-Ou Mandel interference from the emitted photons with a visibility of 0.84 $\pm$ 0.06. From these measurements, we determine a photon coherence time of 450 $\pm$ 20 ps, a factor of just 8.3 away from the lifetime limit. This work represents an important step towards the development of telecom C-band single-photon sources emitting bright, pure, and indistinguishable photons, which are necessary to realize fiber-based long-distance quantum networks</description>

Abstract: The James-Stein estimator is a biased estimator -- for a finite number of samples its expected value is not the true mean. The maximum-likelihood estimator (MLE), is unbiased and asymptotically optimal. Yet, when estimating the mean of $3$ or more normally-distributed random variables, the James-Stein estimator has a smaller total (expected) error than the MLE. We introduce the James-Stein estimator to the field of quantum metrology, from both the frequentist and Bayesian perspectives. We characterise the effect of quantum phenomena on the James-Stein estimator through the lens of quantum Gaussian sensing, the task of estimating the mean of an unknown multivariate quantum Gaussian state. We find that noiseless entanglement or coherence improves performance of the James-Stein estimator, but diminishes its advantage over the MLE. In the presence of noise, the James-Stein advantage is restored. Quantum effects can also boost the James-Stein advantage. We demonstrate this by investigating multivariate postselective metrology (generalised weak-value amplification), a strategy that uses quantum effects to measure parameters with imperfect detectors. Simply by post-processing measured data differently, our techniques reduce errors in quantum experiments.</description>

      <title>SCIM MILQ: An HPC Quantum Scheduler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03512v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the increasing sophistication and capability of quantum hardware, its integration, and employment in high performance computing (HPC) infrastructure becomes relevant. This opens largely unexplored access models and scheduling questions in such quantum-classical computing environments, going beyond the current cloud access model. SCIM MILQ is a scheduler for quantum tasks in HPC infrastructure. It combines well-established scheduling techniques with methods unique to quantum computing, such as circuit cutting. SCIM MILQ can schedule tasks while minimizing the makespan, i.e., the time that elapses from the start of work to the end, improving on average by 25%. Additionally, it reduces the noise in the circuit by up to 10%, increasing the outcome's reliability. We compare it against an existing baseline and show its viability in an HPC environment.</description>

      <title>Overcoming temperature limits in the optical cooling of solids using light-dressed states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.14693v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Laser cooling of solids currently has a temperature floor of 50 - 100 K. We propose a method that could overcome this using defects, such as diamond color centers, with narrow electronic manifolds and bright optical transitions. It exploits the dressed states formed in strong fields which extend the set of phonon transitions and have tunable energies. This allows an enhancement of the cooling power and diminishes the effect of inhomogeneous broadening. We demonstrate these effects theoretically for the silicon-vacancy and the germanium-vacancy, and discuss the role of background absorption, phonon-assisted emission, and non-radiative decay.</description>

      <title>Conditions on detecting tripartite entangled state in psychophysical experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.07446v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the sensitivity of the human visual system to quantum entangled light. We examine the possibility of human subjects perceiving multipartite entangled state through psychophysical experiments. Our focus begins with a bipartite entangled state to make a comparative study with the literature by taking into account additive noise for false positive on bipartite entanglement perception by humans. After that, we limit our similar investigation to a tripartite entangled state for simplicity in higher dimensions. To model the photodetection by humans, we employ the probability of seeing determined for coherently amplified photons in Fock number states, including an additive noise. Our results indicate that detecting bipartite and tripartite entanglement with the human eye is possible for a certain range of additive noise levels and visual thresholds. Finally, we discuss several alternative amplification methods.</description>

      <title>Phase Diagram and Crossover Phases of Topologically Ordered Graphene Zigzag Nanoribbons: Role of Localization Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.04352v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We computed the phase diagram of the zigzag graphene nanoribbons as a function of on-site repulsion, doping, and disorder strength. The topologically ordered phase undergoes topological phase transitions into crossover phases, which are new disordered phases with a nonuniversal topological entanglement entropy with significant variance. The topological order is destroyed by competition between localization effects and on-site repulsion. We found that strong on-site repulsion and/or doping weakens the nonlocal correlations between the opposite zigzag edges. In one of the crossover phases, both $\frac{e^-}{2}$ fractional charges and spin-charge separation were absent; however, charge-transfer correlations between the zigzag edges were possible. Another crossover phase contains $\frac{e^-}{2}$ fractional charges, but no charge transfer correlations. In low-doped zigzag ribbons the interplay between electron localization and on-site repulsion contributes to the spatial separation of quasi-degenerate gap-edge states and protects the charge fractionalization against quantum fluctuations. In all these effects, mixed chiral gap-edge states play an important role. The properties of nontopological strongly disordered and strongly repulsive phases are also observed. Each phase of the phase diagram has a different zigzag-edge structure. Additionally, we investigated the tunneling of solitonic fractional charges under an applied voltage between the zigzag edges of undoped topologically ordered zigzag ribbons, and found that it may lead to a zero-bias tunneling anomaly.</description>

      <title>An invariant measure of chiral quantum transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11266v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the invariant measure of the transport correlator for a chiral Hamiltonian and analyze its properties. The Jacobian of the invariant measure is a function of random phases. Then we distinguish the invariant measure before and after the phase integration. In the former case we found quantum diffusion of fermions and a uniform zero mode that is associated with particle conservation. After the phase integration the transport correlator reveals two types of evolution processes, namely classical diffusion and back-folded random walks. Which one dominates the other depends on the details of the underlying chiral Hamiltonian and may lead either to classical diffusion or to the suppression of diffusion.</description>

      <title>Tensor Networks for Explainable Machine Learning in Cybersecurity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00867v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we show how tensor networks help in developing explainability of machine learning algorithms. Specifically, we develop an unsupervised clustering algorithm based on Matrix Product States (MPS) and apply it in the context of a real use-case of adversary-generated threat intelligence. Our investigation proves that MPS rival traditional deep learning models such as autoencoders and GANs in terms of performance, while providing much richer model interpretability. Our approach naturally facilitates the extraction of feature-wise probabilities, Von Neumann Entropy, and mutual information, offering a compelling narrative for classification of anomalies and fostering an unprecedented level of transparency and interpretability, something fundamental to understand the rationale behind artificial intelligence decisions.</description>

      <title>From Architectures to Applications: A Review of Neural Quantum States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09402v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to the exponential growth of the Hilbert space dimension with system size, the simulation of quantum many-body systems has remained a persistent challenge until today. Here, we review a relatively new class of variational states for the simulation of such systems, namely neural quantum states (NQS), which overcome the exponential scaling by compressing the state in terms of the network parameters rather than storing all exponentially many coefficients needed for an exact parameterization of the state. We introduce the commonly used NQS architectures and their various applications for the simulation of ground and excited states, finite temperature and open system states as well as NQS approaches to simulate the dynamics of quantum states. Furthermore, we discuss NQS in the context of quantum state tomography.</description>
