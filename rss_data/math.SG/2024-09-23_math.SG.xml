      <title>Equivariant cohomology of a complexity-one four-manifold is determined by combinatorial data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.05647</link>
      <description>arXiv:1912.05647v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For Hamiltonian circle actions on compact, connected, four-dimensional manifolds, we give a generators and relations description for the even part of the equivariant cohomology, as an algebra over the equivariant cohomology of a point. This description depends on combinatorial data encoded in the decorated graph of the manifold. We then give an explicit combinatorial description of all weak algebra isomorphisms. We use this description to prove that the even parts of the equivariant cohomology algebras are weakly isomorphic and the odd groups have the same ranks if and only if the labeled graphs obtained from the decorated graphs by forgetting the height and area labels are isomorphic.
  As a consequence, we give an example of an isomorphism of equivariant cohomology algebras that cannot be induced by an equivariant diffeomorphism of manifolds preserving a compatible almost complex structure. We also provide a soft proof that there are finitely many maximal Hamiltonian circle actions on a fixed compact, connected, four-dimensional symplectic manifold.</description>

      <title>Algebraic capacities as tropical polynomials over the reduced $c_1$-positive symplectic cone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.12607v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a series of work [Wor22], [Wor21] and [CW20], algebraic capacities were introduced in an algebraic manner for polarized algebraic surfaces and applied to the symplectic embedding problems. In this paper, we give a reformulation of algebraic capacities in terms of only a tamed pair of symplectic form and almost complex structure. We show that they actually only depend on the cohomology class of the symplectic form for a rational manifold. Since it is not known that any symplectic form on a rational manifold is K\"{a}hler, this novel formulation potentially is more general on a rational manifold. Additionally, for manifolds with $b^+=1$, we derive asymptotic results that are parallel to the context of ECH(Embedded Contact Homology) and algebraic settings. When assuming $c_1\cdot [\omega]&gt;0$ on rational manifolds, we further introduce a sequence of tropical polynomials which will succinctly describe those capacities viewed as functions over the domain parametrizing such symplectic forms. As an application, we give a purely symplectic proof of the correspondence between algebraic capacities and ECH capacities for smooth toric surfaces.</description>

      <title>Hypertoric varieties, $W$-Hilbert schemes, and Coulomb branches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.08125v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study transverse equivariant Hilbert schemes of affine hypertoric varieties equipped with a symplectic action of a Weyl group. In particular, we show that the Coulomb branches of Braverman, Finkelberg, and Nakajima can be obtained either as such Hilbert schemes or Hamiltonian reductions thereof. Furthermore, we propose that the Coulomb branches for representations of non-cotangent type are also obtained in this way. We also investigate the putative complete hyperk\"ahler metrics on these objects. We describe their twistor spaces and, in the case when the symplectic quotient construction of the hypertoric variety is $W$-equivariant (which includes Coulomb branches of cotangent type), we show that the hyperk\"ahler metric can be described as the natural $L^2$-metric on a moduli space of solutions to modified Nahm's equations on an interval with poles at both ends and a discontinuity in the middle, with the latter described by a new object: a hyperspherical variety canonically associated to a hypertoric variety.</description>
