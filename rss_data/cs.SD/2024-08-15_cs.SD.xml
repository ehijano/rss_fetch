      <title>A Theory-Based Explainable Deep Learning Architecture for Music Emotion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper paper develops a theory-based, explainable deep learning convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier to predict the time-varying emotional response to music. We design novel CNN filters that leverage the frequency harmonics structure from acoustic physics known to impact the perception of musical features. Our theory-based model is more parsimonious, but provides comparable predictive performance to atheoretical deep learning models, while performing better than models using handcrafted features. Our model can be complemented with handcrafted features, but the performance improvement is marginal. Importantly, the harmonics-based structure placed on the CNN filters provides better explainability for how the model predicts emotional response (valence and arousal), because emotion is closely related to consonance--a perceptual feature defined by the alignment of harmonics. Finally, we illustrate the utility of our model with an application involving digital advertising. Motivated by YouTube mid-roll ads, we conduct a lab experiment in which we exogenously insert ads at different times within videos. We find that ads placed in emotionally similar contexts increase ad engagement (lower skip rates, higher brand recall rates). Ad insertion based on emotional similarity metrics predicted by our theory-based, explainable model produces comparable or better engagement relative to atheoretical models.</description>

      <title>A New Dataset, Notation Software, and Representation for Computational Schenkerian Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Schenkerian Analysis (SchA) is a uniquely expressive method of music analysis, combining elements of melody, harmony, counterpoint, and form to describe the hierarchical structure supporting a work of music. However, despite its powerful analytical utility and potential to improve music understanding and generation, SchA has rarely been utilized by the computer music community. This is in large part due to the paucity of available high-quality data in a computer-readable format. With a larger corpus of Schenkerian data, it may be possible to infuse machine learning models with a deeper understanding of musical structure, thus leading to more "human" results. To encourage further research in Schenkerian analysis and its potential benefits for music informatics and generation, this paper presents three main contributions: 1) a new and growing dataset of SchAs, the largest in human- and computer-readable formats to date (&gt;140 excerpts), 2) a novel software for visualization and collection of SchA data, and 3) a novel, flexible representation of SchA as a heterogeneous-edge graph data structure.</description>

      <title>Play Me Something Icy: Practical Challenges, Explainability and the Semantic Gap in Generative AI Music</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This pictorial aims to critically consider the nature of text-to-audio and text-to-music generative tools in the context of explainable AI. As a group of experimental musicians and researchers, we are enthusiastic about the creative potential of these tools and have sought to understand and evaluate them from perspectives of prompt creation, control, usability, understandability, explainability of the AI process, and overall aesthetic effectiveness of the results. One of the challenges we have identified that is not explicitly addressed by these tools is the inherent semantic gap in using text-based tools to describe something as abstract as music. Other gaps include explainability vs. useability, and user control and input vs. the human creative process. The aim of this pictorial is to raise questions for discussion and make a few general suggestions on the kinds of improvements we would like to see in generative AI music tools.</description>

      <title>DPSNN: Spiking Neural Network for Low-Latency Streaming Speech Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speech enhancement (SE) improves communication in noisy environments, affecting areas such as automatic speech recognition, hearing aids, and telecommunications. With these domains typically being power-constrained and event-based while requiring low latency, neuromorphic algorithms in the form of spiking neural networks (SNNs) have great potential. Yet, current effective SNN solutions require a contextual sampling window imposing substantial latency, typically around 32ms, too long for many applications. Inspired by Dual-Path Spiking Neural Networks (DPSNNs) in classical neural networks, we develop a two-phase time-domain streaming SNN framework -- the Dual-Path Spiking Neural Network (DPSNN). In the DPSNN, the first phase uses Spiking Convolutional Neural Networks (SCNNs) to capture global contextual information, while the second phase uses Spiking Recurrent Neural Networks (SRNNs) to focus on frequency-related features. In addition, the regularizer suppresses activation to further enhance energy efficiency of our DPSNNs. Evaluating on the VCTK and Intel DNS Datasets, we demonstrate that our approach achieves the very low latency (approximately 5ms) required for applications like hearing aids, while demonstrating excellent signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), perceptual quality, and energy efficiency.</description>

      <title>Optimising MFCC parameters for the automatic detection of respiratory diseases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Voice signals originating from the respiratory tract are utilized as valuable acoustic biomarkers for the diagnosis and assessment of respiratory diseases. Among the employed acoustic features, Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) is widely used for automatic analysis, with MFCC extraction commonly relying on default parameters. However, no comprehensive study has systematically investigated the impact of MFCC extraction parameters on respiratory disease diagnosis. In this study, we address this gap by examining the effects of key parameters, namely the number of coefficients, frame length, and hop length between frames, on respiratory condition examination. Our investigation uses four datasets: the Cambridge COVID-19 Sound database, the Coswara dataset, the Saarbrucken Voice Disorders (SVD) database, and a TACTICAS dataset. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) is employed as the classifier, given its widespread adoption and efficacy. Our findings indicate that the accuracy of MFCC decreases as hop length increases, and the optimal number of coefficients is observed to be approximately 30. The performance of MFCC varies with frame length across the datasets: for the COVID-19 datasets (Cambridge COVID-19 Sound database and Coswara dataset), performance declines with longer frame lengths, while for the SVD dataset, performance improves with increasing frame length (from 50 ms to 500 ms). Furthermore, we investigate the optimized combination of these parameters and observe substantial enhancements in accuracy. Compared to the worst combination, the SVM model achieves an accuracy of 81.1%, 80.6%, and 71.7%, with improvements of 19.6%, 16.10%, and 14.90% for the Cambridge COVID-19 Sound database, the Coswara dataset, and the SVD dataset respectively.</description>

      <title>PeriodWave: Multi-Period Flow Matching for High-Fidelity Waveform Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, universal waveform generation tasks have been investigated conditioned on various out-of-distribution scenarios. Although GAN-based methods have shown their strength in fast waveform generation, they are vulnerable to train-inference mismatch scenarios such as two-stage text-to-speech. Meanwhile, diffusion-based models have shown their powerful generative performance in other domains; however, they stay out of the limelight due to slow inference speed in waveform generation tasks. Above all, there is no generator architecture that can explicitly disentangle the natural periodic features of high-resolution waveform signals. In this paper, we propose PeriodWave, a novel universal waveform generation model. First, we introduce a period-aware flow matching estimator that can capture the periodic features of the waveform signal when estimating the vector fields. Additionally, we utilize a multi-period estimator that avoids overlaps to capture different periodic features of waveform signals. Although increasing the number of periods can improve the performance significantly, this requires more computational costs. To reduce this issue, we also propose a single period-conditional universal estimator that can feed-forward parallel by period-wise batch inference. Additionally, we utilize discrete wavelet transform to losslessly disentangle the frequency information of waveform signals for high-frequency modeling, and introduce FreeU to reduce the high-frequency noise for waveform generation. The experimental results demonstrated that our model outperforms the previous models both in Mel-spectrogram reconstruction and text-to-speech tasks.

      <title>Speech vs. Transcript: Does It Matter for Human Annotators in Speech Summarization?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reference summaries for abstractive speech summarization require human annotation, which can be performed by listening to an audio recording or by reading textual transcripts of the recording. In this paper, we examine whether summaries based on annotators listening to the recordings differ from those based on annotators reading transcripts. Using existing intrinsic evaluation based on human evaluation, automatic metrics, LLM-based evaluation, and a retrieval-based reference-free method. We find that summaries are indeed different based on the source modality, and that speech-based summaries are more factually consistent and information-selective than transcript-based summaries. Meanwhile, transcript-based summaries are impacted by recognition errors in the source, and expert-written summaries are more informative and reliable. We make all the collected data and analysis code public(https://github.com/cmu-mlsp/interview_humanssum) to facilitate the reproduction of our work and advance research in this area.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Blind Joint Dereverberation and Room Acoustics Estimation with Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an unsupervised method for single-channel blind dereverberation and room impulse response (RIR) estimation, called BUDDy. The algorithm is rooted in Bayesian posterior sampling: it combines a likelihood model enforcing fidelity to the reverberant measurement, and an anechoic speech prior implemented by an unconditional diffusion model. We design a parametric filter representing the RIR, with exponential decay for each frequency subband. Room acoustics estimation and speech dereverberation are jointly carried out, as the filter parameters are iteratively estimated and the speech utterance refined along the reverse diffusion trajectory. In a blind scenario where the room impulse response is unknown, BUDDy successfully performs speech dereverberation in various acoustic scenarios, significantly outperforming other blind unsupervised baselines. Unlike supervised methods, which often struggle to generalize, BUDDy seamlessly adapts to different acoustic conditions. This paper extends our previous work by offering new experimental results and insights into the algorithm's performance and versatility. We first investigate the robustness of informed dereverberation methods to RIR estimation errors, to motivate the joint acoustic estimation and dereverberation paradigm. Then, we demonstrate the adaptability of our method to high-resolution singing voice dereverberation, study its performance in RIR estimation, and conduct subjective evaluation experiments to validate the perceptual quality of the results, among other contributions. Audio samples and code can be found online.</description>

      <title>Joint Learning of Emotions in Music and Generalized Sounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02009v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we aim to determine if generalized sounds and music can share a common emotional space, improving predictions of emotion in terms of arousal and valence. We propose the use of multiple datasets as a multi-domain learning technique. Our approach involves creating a common space encompassing features that characterize both generalized sounds and music, as they can evoke emotions in a similar manner. To achieve this, we utilized two publicly available datasets, namely IADS-E and PMEmo, following a standardized experimental protocol. We employed a wide variety of features that capture diverse aspects of the audio structure including key parameters of spectrum, energy, and voicing. Subsequently, we performed joint learning on the common feature space, leveraging heterogeneous model architectures. Interestingly, this synergistic scheme outperforms the state-of-the-art in both sound and music emotion prediction. The code enabling full replication of the presented experimental pipeline is available at https://github.com/LIMUNIMI/MusicSoundEmotions.</description>

      <title>Content and Style Aware Audio-Driven Facial Animation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07005v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Audio-driven 3D facial animation has several virtual humans applications for content creation and editing. While several existing methods provide solutions for speech-driven animation, precise control over content (what) and style (how) of the final performance is still challenging. We propose a novel approach that takes as input an audio, and the corresponding text to extract temporally-aligned content and disentangled style representations, in order to provide controls over 3D facial animation. Our method is trained in two stages, that evolves from audio prominent styles (how it sounds) to visual prominent styles (how it looks). We leverage a high-resource audio dataset in stage I to learn styles that control speech generation in a self-supervised learning framework, and then fine-tune this model with low-resource audio/3D mesh pairs in stage II to control 3D vertex generation. We employ a non-autoregressive seq2seq formulation to model sentence-level dependencies, and better mouth articulations. Our method provides flexibility that the style of a reference audio and the content of a source audio can be combined to enable audio style transfer. Similarly, the content can be modified, e.g. muting or swapping words, that enables style-preserving content editing.</description>

      <title>WavLLM: Towards Robust and Adaptive Speech Large Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00656v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized the field of natural language processing, progressively broadening their scope to multimodal perception and generation. However, effectively integrating listening capabilities into LLMs poses significant challenges, particularly with respect to generalizing across varied contexts and executing complex auditory tasks. In this work, we introduce WavLLM, a robust and adaptive speech large language model with dual encoders, and a prompt-aware LoRA weight adapter, optimized by a two-stage curriculum learning approach. Leveraging dual encoders, we decouple different types of speech information, utilizing a Whisper encoder to process the semantic content of speech, and a WavLM encoder to capture the unique characteristics of the speaker's identity. Within the curriculum learning framework, WavLLM first builds its foundational capabilities by optimizing on mixed elementary single tasks, followed by advanced multi-task training on more complex tasks such as combinations of the elementary tasks. To enhance the flexibility and adherence to different tasks and instructions, a prompt-aware LoRA weight adapter is introduced in the second advanced multi-task training stage. We validate the proposed model on universal speech benchmarks including tasks such as ASR, ST, SV, ER, and also apply it to specialized datasets like Gaokao English listening comprehension set for SQA, and speech Chain-of-Thought (CoT) evaluation set. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance across a range of speech tasks on the same model size, exhibiting robust generalization capabilities in executing complex tasks using CoT approach. Furthermore, our model successfully completes Gaokao tasks without specialized training. The codes, models, audio, and Gaokao evaluation set can be accessed at \url{aka.ms/wavllm}.</description>

Abstract: As the interest in large language models grows, the importance of accuracy in automatic speech recognition has become more pronounced. This is particularly true for lectures that include specialized terminology, where the success rate of traditional ASR models tends to be low, posing a challenging problem. A method to improve ASR performance for specialized terminology using the word frequency difference approach has been proposed. Through experiments and data analysis, we investigated whether this proposal effectively addressed this issue. In addition, we introduced the power law as the theoretical foundation for the relative frequency methodology mentioned in this approach.</description>

      <title>Integrating Representational Gestures into Automatically Generated Embodied Explanations and its Effects on Understanding and Interaction Quality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12544v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In human interaction, gestures serve various functions such as marking speech rhythm, highlighting key elements, and supplementing information. These gestures are also observed in explanatory contexts. However, the impact of gestures on explanations provided by virtual agents remains underexplored. A user study was carried out to investigate how different types of gestures influence perceived interaction quality and listener understanding. This study addresses the effect of gestures in explanation by developing an embodied virtual explainer integrating both beat gestures and iconic gestures to enhance its automatically generated verbal explanations. Our model combines beat gestures generated by a learned speech-driven synthesis module with manually captured iconic gestures, supporting the agent's verbal expressions about the board game Quarto! as an explanation scenario. Findings indicate that neither the use of iconic gestures alone nor their combination with beat gestures outperforms the baseline or beat-only conditions in terms of understanding. Nonetheless, compared to prior research, the embodied agent significantly enhances understanding.</description>

      <title>Robust online reconstruction of continuous-time signals from a lean spike train ensemble code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05950v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sensory stimuli in animals are encoded into spike trains by neurons, offering advantages such as sparsity, energy efficiency, and high temporal resolution. This paper presents a signal processing framework that deterministically encodes continuous-time signals into biologically feasible spike trains, and addresses the questions about representable signal classes and reconstruction bounds. The framework considers encoding of a signal through spike trains generated by an ensemble of neurons using a convolve-then-threshold mechanism with various convolution kernels. A closed-form solution to the inverse problem, from spike trains to signal reconstruction, is derived in the Hilbert space of shifted kernel functions, ensuring sparse representation of a generalized Finite Rate of Innovation (FRI) class of signals. Additionally, inspired by real-time processing in biological systems, an efficient iterative version of the optimal reconstruction is formulated that considers only a finite window of past spikes, ensuring robustness of the technique to ill-conditioned encoding; convergence guarantees of the windowed reconstruction to the optimal solution are then provided. Experiments on a large audio dataset demonstrate excellent reconstruction accuracy at spike rates as low as one-fifth of the Nyquist rate, while showing clear competitive advantage in comparison to state-of-the-art sparse coding techniques in the low spike rate regime.</description>

Abstract: Existing methods on audio-visual deepfake detection mainly focus on high-level features for modeling inconsistencies between audio and visual data. As a result, these approaches usually overlook finer audio-visual artifacts, which are inherent to deepfakes. Herein, we propose the introduction of fine-grained mechanisms for detecting subtle artifacts in both spatial and temporal domains. First, we introduce a local audio-visual model capable of capturing small spatial regions that are prone to inconsistencies with audio. For that purpose, a fine-grained mechanism based on a spatially-local distance coupled with an attention module is adopted. Second, we introduce a temporally-local pseudo-fake augmentation to include samples incorporating subtle temporal inconsistencies in our training set. Experiments on the DFDC and the FakeAVCeleb datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in terms of generalization as compared to the state-of-the-art under both in-dataset and cross-dataset settings.</description>
