      <title>Quantum Interference in Two-Atom Resonant X-ray Scattering of an Intense Attosecond Pulse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate resonant x-ray scattering from two non-interacting Ne+ ions driven by an intense attosecond pulse using a non-relativistic, QED-based time-dependent framework. Our model includes Rabi oscillations, photoionization, Auger decay, and quantum interference among elastic scattering and resonance fluorescence pathways. We analyze how the total scattering signal depends on pulse intensity, atomic configuration, and initial electronic state. We find that the total resonant scattering yield exceeds its non-resonant counterpart; the angular dependence of the signal qualitatively resembles a two-atom structure factor; and the visibility of interference fringes is sensitive to pulse area and the initial electronic state. Only a subset of final states reached via resonance fluorescence exhibits interference, determined by the indistinguishability of photon emission pathways. Fringe visibility is maximized in the linear scattering regime, where ionization is minimal and resonance fluorescence pathways can be largely indistinguishable. These results highlight optimal conditions for applying ultrafast resonant x-ray scattering to single-particle imaging.</description>

      <title>Towards a Global Search for New Physics with Isotope Shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Isotope shifts have emerged as a sensitive probe of new bosons that couple to electrons and neutrons, and of nuclear structure. The recent Hz- or even sub-Hz-level isotope shift measurements across different elements call for a global assessment of all available data. In this work, we present the fit framework kifit that for the first time enables a combined analysis of isotope shift data from several elements, taking into account correlations. We provide a thorough comparison of analytical methods and the fit to analyse linear and nonlinear King plots and quantify their uncertainties. Finally, we provide recommendations for future measurements that could enhance the sensitivity to new physics and offer new insights into nuclear structure.</description>

      <title>Circular RABBITT goes under threshold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We utilize the process of Reconstruction of Attosecond Beating By Interference of Two-photon Transitions (RABBITT) driven by circularly polarized radiation to map under-threshold discrete excitations in noble gas atoms. Great advantage of circular polarization is that it allows to reach selectively various angular components of the photoelectron wavepacket and to resolve two-photon ionization amplitudes including their phases. By doing so, we picture resonant two-photon ionization in an unprecedented detail not seen previously. In particular, we break, with high confidence, the Fano propensity rule formulated for two-photon ionization by Busto et al [Phys. Rev. Lett. 123, 133201 (2018)]. We also demonstrate a great utility of the Coulomb Green's function approach proposed by Krylovetsky et al [Sov. Phys. { JETP 92, 37 (2001)] more than two decades ago.</description>

      <title>Cryogenic Optical Lattice Clock with $1.7\times 10^{-20}$ Blackbody Radiation Stark Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05304v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Controlling the Stark perturbation from ambient thermal radiation is key to advancing the performance of many atomic frequency standards, including state-of-the-art optical lattice clocks (OLCs). We demonstrate a cryogenic OLC that utilizes a dynamically actuated radiation shield to control the perturbation at $1.7\times10^{-20}$ fractional frequency, a factor of $\sim$40 beyond the best OLC to date. Our shield furnishes the atoms with a near-ideal cryogenic blackbody radiation (BBR) environment by rejecting external thermal radiation at the part-per-million level during clock spectroscopy, overcoming a key limitation with previous cryogenic BBR control solutions in OLCs. While the lowest BBR shift uncertainty is realized with cryogenic operation, we further exploit the radiation control that the shield offers over a wide range of temperatures to directly measure and verify the leading BBR Stark dynamic correction coefficient for ytterbium. This independent measurement reduces the literature-combined uncertainty of this coefficient by 30%, thus benefiting state-of-the-art Yb OLCs operated at room temperature. We verify the static BBR coefficient for Yb at the low $10^{-18}$ level.</description>

      <title>Quantum annealing eigensolver as a NISQ era tool for probing strong correlation effects in quantum chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20464v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum-classical hybrid variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm is arguably the most popular noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era approach to quantum chemistry. We consider the underexplored quantum annealing eigensolver (QAE) algorithm as a worthy alternative. We use a combination of numerical calculations for a system where strong correlation effects dominate, and conclusions drawn from our preliminary scaling analysis for QAE and VQE to make the case for QAE as a NISQ era contender to VQE for quantum chemistry. For the former, we pick the representative example of computing avoided crossings in the H4 molecule in a rectangular geometry, and demonstrate that we obtain results to within about 1.2% of the full configuration interaction value on the D-Wave Advantage system 4.1 hardware. We carry out analyses on the effect of the number of shots, anneal time, and the choice of Lagrange multiplier on our obtained results. Following our numerical results, we carry out a detailed yet preliminary analysis of the scaling behaviours of both the QAE and the VQE algorithms to assess the competency of the former for NISQ era chemistry.</description>

      <title>Non-orbital particle trapping in binary black holes through dynamic stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17841v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an interdisciplinary comparison between binary black hole systems and Radio Frequency (RF) Paul Traps, modeling the gravitational binary system as a rotating saddle near its center. This analogy connects these seemingly unrelated systems through the concept of dynamic stability. The rotating saddle potential is analytically tractable, allowing us to prove the existence of bounded charged particle trajectories under certain conditions. By focusing on stellar-mass black holes with a weak electric charge-a feature consistent with specific astrophysical conditions that leaves the spacetime metric largely unaffected but can influence nearby particle interactions-we can neglect complicating factors such as magnetic fields from large accretion disks of heavier black holes or stellar winds. Our simulation results demonstrate that charged particles can exhibit stable, non-orbital trajectories near the center of a binary system with charged stellar-mass black holes, providing unique three-dimensional trapping primarily through gravity. This system is distinctive in the literature for its non-orbital trapping mechanism. While theoretically intriguing, this trapping relies on specific conditions, including nearly identical black hole masses. These types of non-orbital trapping mechanisms could potentially allow for longer-lived plasma configurations, enhancing our ability to detect electromagnetic signatures from these systems. The significance of this work lies in the novel comparison between a laboratory-scale quantum system and a larger astrophysical one, opening new avenues for exploring parallels between microscopic and cosmic phenomena across fourteen orders of magnitude in distance.</description>

      <title>Resonances and continued-fraction Green's functions in non-Hermitian Bose-Hubbard-like quantum models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05850v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With resonances treated as eigenstates of a non-Hermitian quantum Hamiltonian, the task of localization of the complex energy eigenvalues is considered. The paper is devoted to the reduced version of this task in which one only computes the real quantities called singular values. It is shown that in such an approach (and under suitable constraints including the tridiagonality of the Hamiltdonian) the singular values can be sought as poles of an auxiliary Green's function expressible in terms of a doublet of matrix continued fractions. A family of multi-bosonic Bose-Hubbard-like complex Hamiltonians is recalled for illustration purposes.</description>

      <title>Theory of itinerant collisional spin dynamics in nondegenerate molecular gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21896v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the fully itinerant dynamics of ultracold but nondegenerate polar molecules with a spin-$1/2$ degree of freedom encoded into two of their electric field dressed rotational states. Center of mass molecular motion is constrained to two-dimensions via tight confinement with a one-dimensional optical lattice, but remains mostly unconstrained within the plane. The pseudospins can become entangled through ultracold dipolar collisions, for which the locality of interactions is greatly relaxed by free molecular motion. At the level of single-molecule observables, collision-induced entanglement manifests as spin decoherence, for which our theoretical calculations serve well to describe recent Ramsey contrast measurements of quasi-2D confined KRb molecules at JILA [A. Carroll et al., Science 388 6745 (2025)]. In presenting a more detailed theoretical analysis of the KRb experiment, we highlight a key finding that molecular loss enhanced by particle exchange symmetry can lead to a suppression of collective spin decoherence, a mechanism with refer to as ``loss-induced quantum autoselection". We then show that by utilizing bialkali species with sufficiently large dipole moments, loss can be near completely suppressed in all collision channels via electric field tunable confinement-induced collisional shielding. The afforded collisional stability permits fully coherent spin mixing dynamics, natively realizing unitary circuit dynamics with random all-to-all connectivity and U(1) charge conservation. This work establishes a bridge between the domains of ultracold molecular collisions and many-body spin physics, ultimately proposing the use of nondegenerate bulk molecular gases as a controllable platform for nonequilibrium explorations of itinerant quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Atomic and Molecular Waveform Processing with Attosecond Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03482v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Advancing the temporal resolution in computations, signal generation and modulation, and measurements is of paramount importance for pushing the boundaries of science and technology. Optical resonators have recently demonstrated the ability to perform computational operations at frequencies beyond the gigahertz range, surpassing the speed of conventional electronic devices. However, increasing the resonator length extends the operation time but decreases the temporal resolution, with current state-of-the-art systems achieving only picosecond resolution. Here we show that atoms and molecules belong to the class of widely-used passive resonators that operate without gain, such as subwavelength particles, electric circuits, and slabs, but with long operation times and, importantly, attosecond resolution. Our analysis reveals that when resonantly exciting atoms and molecules, the resulting scattered field is the integral of the incoming field envelope, with improvement factors in temporal resolution of a million and billion compared with optical resonators and electronic devices, respectively. We demonstrate our results theoretically for atoms and compare it with the standard slab resonator. Remarkably, our approach applies to all transition types including electronic, vibrational, rotational, and spin, with the same temporal resolution preserved across all frequencies. Our research paves the way for a new generation of devices operating on attosecond timescales and opens new avenues in fields such as computation, ultrafast phenomena, high-rate data transmission, encryption, and quantum technology.</description>
