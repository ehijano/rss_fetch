      <title>Equitability and explosive synchronisation in multiplex and higher-order networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cluster synchronisation is a key phenomenon observed in networks of coupled dynamical units. Its presence has been linked to symmetry and, more generally, to equability of the underlying network pattern of interactions between identical dynamical units. In this article, we clarify once and for all the relation between equitability and cluster synchronisation on a very general dynamical system which allows multi-layer and higher-order interactions. Namely, we show that equitability is a necessary, and sufficient, condition for the existence of independent cluster synchronised solutions. As an important consequence, our results explain the ubiquity of explosive synchronisation, as opposed to cluster synchronisation, in multi-layer and higher-order networks: equitability imposes additional constraints that must be simultaneously satisfied on the same set of nodes. Our results have important implications for the design of complex dynamical systems of coupled dynamical units with arbitrary cluster synchronisation patterns and coupling functions.</description>

      <title>Effect of diversity distribution symmetry on global oscillations of networks of excitable units</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the role of the degree of symmetry of the diversity distribution in shaping the collective dynamics of networks of coupled excitable units modeled by FitzHugh-Nagumo equations. While previous studies have focused primarily on the ratio between the numbers of individually oscillatory and excitable units, we show that the symmetry of the diversity distribution plays a fundamental role in the emergence of global network oscillations. By exploring various symmetric and asymmetric distributions and simulating network dynamics across various topologies, we demonstrate that symmetric distributions promote resonant collective oscillations even in the absence of oscillatory units. We propose two quantitative metrics, the normalized center of mass and the symmetry balance score, to assess the degree of symmetry and predict the presence or absence of global oscillations. By studying a minimal two-unit system and its effective pseudo-potential, we show that symmetry enables the formation of a landscape characterized by a cyclic valley supporting limit cycles, whereas asymmetry collapses the system into a single non-oscillatory equilibrium. These results provide a general mechanism by which network symmetry drives emergent synchronization in heterogeneous excitable systems.</description>

      <title>Properties of Quasi-synchronization Time of High-dimensional Hegselmann-Krause Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The behavior of one-dimensional Hegselmann-Krause (HK) dynamics driven by noise has been extensively studied. Previous research has indicated that within no matter the bounded or the unbounded space of one dimension, the HK dynamics attain quasi-synchronization (synchronization in noisy case) in finite time. However, it remains unclear whether this phenomenon holds in high-dimensional space. This paper investigates the random time for quasi-synchronization of multi-dimensional HK model and reveals that the boundedness and dimensions of the space determine different outcomes. To be specific, if the space is bounded, quasi-synchronization can be attained almost surely for all dimensions within a finite time, whereas in unbounded space, quasi-synchronization can only be achieved in low-dimensional cases (one and two). Furthermore, different integrability of the random time of various cases is proved.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal-coupling-based control of coherence resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22909v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that nonlocal coupling enables control of the collective stochastic dynamics in the regime of coherence resonance. The control scheme based on the nonlocal interaction properties is presented by means of numerical simulation on an example of coupled FitzHugh-Nagumo oscillators. In particular, increasing the coupling radius is shown to enhance or to suppress the effect of coherence resonance which is reflected in the evolution of the dependence of the correlation time and the deviation of interspike intervals on the noise intensity. Nonlocal coupling is considered as an intermediate option between local and global coupling topologies which are also discussed in the context of the coherence resonance control.</description>

      <title>Emergent functions of noise-driven spontaneous activity: Homeostatic maintenance of criticality and memory consolidation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10946v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unlike digital computers, the brain exhibits spontaneous activity even during complete rest, despite the evolutionary pressure for energy efficiency. Inspired by the critical brain hypothesis, which proposes that the brain operates optimally near a critical point of phase transition in the dynamics of neural networks to improve computational efficiency, we postulate that spontaneous activity plays a homeostatic role in the development and maintenance of criticality. Criticality in the brain is associated with the balance between excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs (EI balance), which is essential for maintaining neural computation performance. Here, we hypothesize that both criticality and EI balance are stabilized by appropriate noise levels and spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) windows. Using spiking neural network (SNN) simulations and in vitro experiments with dissociated neuronal cultures, we demonstrated that while repetitive stimuli transiently disrupt both criticality and EI balance, spontaneous activity can develop and maintain these properties and prolong the fading memory of past stimuli. Our findings suggest that the brain may achieve self-optimization and memory consolidation as emergent functions of noise-driven spontaneous activity. This noise-harnessing mechanism provides insights for designing energy-efficient neural networks, and may explain the critical function of sleep in maintaining homeostasis and consolidating memory.</description>

      <title>An energy landscape-based theoretical framework for understanding the emergence of functions in a living system under the dynamical component interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20418v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a living system composed of interacting components such as molecules, cells, and tissues, each component often adaptively changes its internal states in response to interactions with its surrounding components. For example, individual tissues exhibit component-level adaptive behavior, such as growth and remodeling, in response to their mechanical interactions, resulting in the emergence of functions of a multi-tissue system. Along with the adaptive behavior of the components, their interactions exhibit dynamical changes, which strongly influence the emergence of system functions. To understand how the emergence of system functions occurs from such dynamical interactions due to component-level adaptive behavior, this study proposes a theoretical framework that formulates the dynamics of interactions among components due to the adaptive behavior of individual components. For modeling the adaptive internal state changes, we assign an energy landscape and its associated energy rate landscape for each component, leading to the generalized gradient flow model of adaptive behavior. Then, we represent interaction dynamics based on temporal changes in these energy and energy rate landscapes by formulating temporal changes in the environmental states of each component due to the adaptive behavior of individual components. Through case studies using simplified models of mechanically interacting tissues under morphological changes, our theoretical framework demonstrates that temporal changes in applied forces due to morphological changes of individual tissues determine the emergence of system functions. These findings highlight that expressing interaction dynamics based on temporal changes in energy and energy rate landscapes offers a powerful theoretical framework for understanding how system functions emerge from component-level adaptive behavior.</description>

      <title>Goal assembly as a formalism of evolvable design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11504v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the age of artificial intelligence and biotechnology, a unified understanding of technology and biology is critically needed but still lacking. A cornerstone of such unification is evolvable design. I present a formalism, called goal assembly, that unifies three key characteristics of evolvable, biology-like design: (i) hierarchical integration of small competencies into larger competencies; (ii) highly non-uniform (power-law or log-normal distributed) representation of phenotypes by genotypes; and (iii) evolution of hierarchical modularity. It does so by making the hierarchy of physical goal states corresponding to substructures explicit, focusing on their composition across scales. In particular, higher-level goal variables approximate achievable joint goal states of interacting lower-level goal variables. Mechanisms of evolvability include goal state gradient backpropagation across scales, hierarchical decision making among alternative goal states, and structural recombination of modules. In learning theory terms, goal assembly proposes architectural inductive biases of emergent engineering systems operating at a complexity regime where goals arise as necessary abstractions. Beyond asking what goals are and how they are achieved, goal assembly suggests we can almost independently talk about their compositionality.</description>

      <title>Preserving spreading dynamics and information flow in complex network reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18641v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Effectively preserving both the structural and dynamical properties during the reduction of complex networks remains a significant research topic. Existing network reduction methods based on renormalization group or sampling often face challenges such as high computational complexity and the loss of critical dynamic attributes. This paper proposes an efficient network reduction framework based on subgraph extraction, which accurately preserves epidemic spreading dynamics and information flow through a coordinated optimization strategy of node removal and edge pruning. Specifically, a node removal algorithm driven by enhanced degree centrality is introduced to preferentially remove low-centrality nodes, thereby constructing a smaller-scale subnetwork. Subsequently, an edge pruning algorithm is designed to regulate the edge density of the subnetwork, ensuring that its average degree remains approximately consistent with that of the original network. Experimental results on Erd\"os-R\'enyi random graphs, Barab\'asi-Albert scale-free networks, and real-world social contact networks from various domains demonstrate that this proposed method can reduce the size of networks with heterogeneous structures by more than 85\%, while preserving their epidemic dynamics and information flow. More importantly, our method almost always achieves the highest accuracy compared to state-of-the-art techniques. These findings provide valuable insights for predicting the dynamical behavior of large-scale real-world networks, and also reveal that a large number of nodes and edges in real-world networks play redundant roles in information transmission.</description>
