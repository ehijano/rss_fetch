      <title>Nuclear Matrix Elements for Neutrinoless Double-Beta Decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutrinoless double-beta decay ($0\nu\beta\beta$) is a rare hypothesised process that, if discovered, would establish that the neutrino is Majorana, that is, it is its own antiparticle. Interpretation of experimental results relies on knowledge of nuclear matrix elements, whose large model uncertainty is the limiting factor in comparing measured (bounds on) half-lives to the neutrino mass. Nuclear effective field theory and lattice QCD have the potential to compute these matrix elements with better control over uncertainties, enhancing the discovery potential of next-generation $0\nu\beta\beta$ experiments. This work will survey various lattice QCD double-beta decay calculations and discuss their implications.</description>

      <title>Three-hadron dynamics from lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three-hadron spectroscopy is a key frontier in our understanding of the hadron spectrum. In recent years, significant formal and numerical advances have paved the way for studying three-hadron processes directly from lattice QCD, with outstanding applications including the Roper resonance and the doubly charmed tetraquark. This requires theoretical frameworks that relate finite-volume energies to infinite-volume three-particle scattering amplitudes. In this contribution, I discuss recent progress in formulating such frameworks for generic three-hadron systems, and present numerical results for three-meson systems at maximal isospin with physical quark masses, as well as our recent investigation of the three-body dynamics of the doubly charmed tetraquark, $T_{\rm cc}$.</description>

      <title>Selected topics on the QCD phase diagram at finite temperature and density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We will report recent progress on the QCD phase diagram at finite temperature and density. In particular, we discuss the universal scaling of the chiral transition in the limit of two massless quarks and one strange quark. We also discuss influence of other control parameter as chemical potentials, external magnetic field strength and number of quark flavors on the chiral transition. From calculations of Taylor expansion coefficients of the pressure w.r.t the baryon chemical potential and at imaginary chemical potential, we discuss estimates of the QCD critical point. Those estimates make use of the universal scaling ansatz of the Lee-Yang edge singularity.</description>

      <title>Exact Diagonalization, Matrix Product States and Conformal Perturbation Theory Study of a 3D Ising Fuzzy Sphere Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerical studies of phase transitions in statistical and quantum lattice models provide crucial insights into the corresponding Conformal Field Theories (CFTs). In higher dimensions, comparing finite-volume numerical results to infinite-volume CFT data is facilitated by choosing the sphere $S^{d-1}$ as the spatial manifold. Recently, the fuzzy sphere regulator in Ref. [Zhu et al, Phys. Rev. X 13 021009 (2023)] has enabled such studies with exact rotational invariance, yielding impressive agreement with known 3D Ising CFT predictions, as well as new results. However, systematic improvements and a deeper understanding of finite-size corrections remain essential. In this work, we revisit the fuzzy sphere regulator, focusing on the original Ising model, with two main goals. First, we assess the robustness of this approach using Conformal Perturbation Theory (CPT), to which we provide a detailed guidebook. We demonstrate how CPT provides a unified framework for determining the critical point, the speed of light, and residual deviations from CFT predictions. Applying this framework, we study finite-size corrections and clarify the role of tuning the model in minimizing these effects. Second, we develop a novel method for extracting Operator Product Expansion (OPE) coefficients from fuzzy sphere data. This method leverages the sensitivity of energy levels to detuning from criticality, providing new insights into level mixing and avoided crossings in finite systems. Our work also includes validation of CPT in a 1+1D Ising model away from the integrable limit.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of charmed hadrons across chiral crossover from lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01300v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use up to fourth-order charm fluctuations and their correlations with net baryon number, electric charge, and strangeness fluctuations, calculated within the framework of lattice QCD, to study the continuum partial pressure contributions of charmed baryons and mesons. We show that, at and below the chiral crossover temperature, these partial pressures receive enhanced contributions from experimentally unobserved charmed hadrons predicted by the Quark Model. Additionally, we demonstrate that at the chiral crossover, the Hadron Resonance Gas description breaks down, signaling the modification of open charm hadrons and thereby implying the onset of charm deconfinement. We present evidence for the survival of low-lying non-radial $1S$ and $1P$ hadron-like excitations above the chiral crossover, which hints at the sequential melting of charmed hadrons. Finally, we investigate the continuum partial pressure contribution of charm quark-like excitation that emerges at the chiral crossover and calculate its temperature-dependent in-medium mass.</description>

      <title>Toward QCD on Quantum Computer: Orbifold Lattice Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12045v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an orbifold lattice formulation of QCD suitable for quantum simulations. We show explicitly how to encode gauge degrees of freedom into qubits using noncompact variables, and how to write down a simple truncated Hamiltonian in the coordinate basis. We show that SU(3) gauge group variables and quarks in the fundamental representation can be implemented straightforwardly on qubits, for arbitrary truncation of the gauge manifold.</description>

      <title>Quantum computing of chirality imbalance in SU(2) gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18869v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We implement a variational quantum algorithm to investigate the chiral condensate in a 1+1 dimensional SU(2) non-Abelian gauge theory. The algorithm is evaluated using a proposed Monte Carlo sampling method, which allows the extension to large qubit systems. The obtained results through quantum simulations on classical and actual quantum hardware are in good agreement with exact diagonalization of the lattice Hamiltonian, revealing the phenomena of chiral symmetry breaking and restoration as functions of both temperature and chemical potential. Our findings underscore the potential of near-term quantum computing for exploring QCD systems at finite temperature and density in non-Abelian gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo study on Heisenberg model with local dipolar interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15874v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Aharony and Fisher showed that non-local dipolar effects in magnetism destabilize the Heisenberg fixed point in real ferromagnets, leading to a new fixed point, called the dipolar fixed point. The non-perturbative nature of the new fixed point, however, has not been uncovered for many decades. Inspired by the recent understanding that the dipolar fixed point is scale-invariant but not conformal invariant, we perform the Monte Carlo simulation of the local Heisenberg-dipolar model on the lattice of $40^3$ by introducing the local cost function parameterized by a parameter $\lambda$ and study its critical exponents, which should become identical to the dipolar fixed point of Aharony and Fisher in the infinite coupling limit $\lambda = \infty$. We find that the critical exponents become noticeably different from those of the Heisenberg fixed point for a finite coupling constant $\lambda=8$ (e.g. $\nu=0.601(2)(^{+0}_{-2})$ in the local Heisenberg-dipolar model while $\nu=0.712(1)(^{+3}_{-0})$ in the Heisenberg model), and the spin correlation function has a feature that it becomes divergence-free, implying the lack of conformal invariance.</description>
