      <title>Floer homotopy theory for monotone Lagrangians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We circumvent one of the roadblocks in associating Floer homotopy types to monotone Lagrangians, namely the curvature phenomena occurring in high dimensions. Given $N \ge 3$ and $R$ a connective $\mathbb E_1$-ring spectrum, there is a notion of an $N$-truncated, $R$-oriented flow category, to which we associate a module prospectrum over the Postnikov truncation $\tau_{\le N - 3}R$. This endows ordinary Floer cohomology with an action of the Steenrod algebra over $\tau_{\le N-3}R$, and also induces certain generalized cohomology theories. We give sufficient conditions for a closed embedded monotone Lagrangian to admit such well-defined invariants for $N = N_\mu$ the minimal Maslov number, and $R = MU$ complex bordism. Finally, we formulate Oh-Pozniak type spectral sequences for these invariants, and show that in the case of $\mathbb{RP}^n \subset \mathbb{CP}^n$ they provide further restrictions on the topology of clean intersections with a Hamiltonian isotopy, not detected by ordinary Floer (co)homology.</description>

      <title>On the geometry of complex Poisson bivectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the geometry of complex Poisson bivectors over smooth manifolds. We show that under mild regularity conditions any complex Poisson bivector has associated a complex presymplectic foliation. After that, we use techniques of Dirac geometry to provide a more concise description of this complex presymplectic foliation. Moreover, we introduce two new classes of structures: quasi-real Poisson and quasi-real Dirac structures. In the last part, we focus on the normal form of complex Poisson bivectors. Under certain regularity, we provide a normal form theorem for complex Poisson structures along certain kinds of submanifolds.</description>

      <title>Moment-like maps and real algebraic functions with prescribed preimages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss a problem on singularity theory of differentiable (smooth) or real algebraic maps which is different from knowing existence and has been difficult: constructing explcit real algebraic functions.
  We discuss construction of real algebraic functions with exactly one singular value, the singular points being of definite type, and prescribed preimages of single points. We discuss generalizations of the canonical projection of the unit sphere around the pole and the Morse-Bott functions around the boundaries of the images with preimages diffeomorphic to the torus.
  This has been discussed in the differentiable (smooth) category since the pioneering study of Sharko in 2006, followed by Masumoto-Saeki, Michalak and so on: the author has first considered the cases respecting the topologies of the preimages of the points where these studies had not done this essentially. Related real algebraic studies have been started by the author essentially in 2020's and the studies are developing, mainly due to the author.</description>

      <title>Finite energy foliations in the restricted three-body problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is about using pseudo-holomorphic curves to study the circular planar restricted three-body problem. The main result states that for mass ratios sufficiently close to $\frac{1}{2}$ and energies slightly above the first Lagrange value, the flow on the regularized component $\mathbb R P^3 \# \mathbb R P^3$ of the energy surface admits a finite energy foliation with three binding orbits, namely two retrograde orbits around the primaries and the Lyapunov orbit in the neck region about the first Lagrange point. This foliation explains the numerically observed homoclinic orbits to the Lyapunov orbits. The critical energy surface is proved to satisfy the strict convexity condition in regularizing elliptic coordinates. This allows for the application of a general abstract result for Reeb vector fields on holed lens spaces, concerning the existence of finite energy foliations with prescribed binding orbits. As a by-product of the convex analysis, Birkhoff's retrograde orbit conjecture is proved for mass ratios sufficiently close to $\frac{1}{2}$ and all energies below the first Lagrange value. This conjecture states that the retrograde orbit bounds a disk-like global surface of section on each regularized component $\mathbb R P^3$ of the energy surface.</description>

      <title>Contact loci of semihomogeneous singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two of the main open problems in the theory of contact loci are the arc-Floer conjecture, which states that the compactly supported cohomology of the restricted $m$-contact locus and the fixed-point Floer cohomology of the $m$-th iterate of the Milnor monodromy are isomorphic up to a shift; and the embedded Nash problem, which asks for a description of the irreducible components of the unrestricted $m$-contact locus in terms of an embedded resolution of singularities. In this paper we study the geometry of contact loci of semihomogeneous singularities, and use our results to give an affirmative answer to the arc-Floer conjecture (under some conditions on the dimension and the degree) and a complete solution to the embedded Nash problem.</description>

      <title>Functoriality of toric coherent-constructible correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21483v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A morphism from a diagonalizable group $G$ to the torus of a toric variety $X$ induces an action of $G$ on $X$. We prove the category of ind-coherent sheaves on the quotient stack is equivalent to the category of sheaves on a cover of a real torus with singular supports contained in the FLTZ skeleton, extending Kuwagaki's nonequivariant coherent-constructible correspondence arXiv:1610.03214. We also investigate the functoriality of such correspondence for toric morphisms and inclusions of orbit closures.</description>

      <title>Consecutive collision orbits in the restricted three-body problem above the first critical energy value</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01735v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the planar circular restricted three-body problem for energy levels slightly above the first critical value. We first observe that the energy hypersurfaces in the Birkhoff regularization corresponding to these energy levels are of contact type. Then, using a version of Rabinowitz Floer homology, we establish the existence of either a periodic symmetric collision orbit or infinitely many symmetric consecutive collision orbits. Furthermore, by an analytic continuation argument, for generic mass ratios and energy levels, we prove that there is no periodic symmetric collision orbit with odd number of collisions. This in turn implies the existence of at least two symmetric consecutive collision orbits.</description>

      <title>Bordered contact invariants and half Giroux torsion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14050v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that there exist infinitely many closed contact 3-manifolds containing half Giroux torsion along a separating torus whose contact invariants do not vanish. This provides counterexamples to Ghiggini's conjecture and suggests that separating half Giroux torsion may not obstruct symplectic fillability. The main tools are the bordered contact invariants recently developed by the authors and the innermost contact structures on knot complements. We also show that there exists a closed contact 3-manifold containing convex torsion along a separating torus with non-vanishing contact invariant, which implies that $2\pi$ is the minimal amount of twisting necessary to ensure vanishing of the contact invariant.</description>
