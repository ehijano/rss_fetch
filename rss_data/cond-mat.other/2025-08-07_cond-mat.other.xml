      <title>Quantum chemistry for solids made simple with the Clifford formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a general theory to treat periodic solids with quantum-chemistry methods. It relies on two main developments: 1) the modeling of a solid as a Clifford torus which is a torus that is both periodic and flat and 2) the introduction of a periodic gaussian basis set that is compatible with the topology of the Clifford torus. We illustrate our approach by calculating the ground-state energy of a periodic chain of hydrogen atoms within both Hartree-Fock and coupled cluster theory. We demonstrate that our approach yields the correct ground-state energy in the thermodynamic limit by comparing it to the ground-state energy of a ring of hydrogen atoms in the same limit. Since equivalent ring-like calculations for three-dimensional solids are impossible, our approach is an excellent alternative to perform quantum-chemistry calculations of solids. Our Clifford formalism can be seamlessly combined with current implementations of quantum-chemistry methods designed for atoms and molecules to make them applicable to solids.</description>

      <title>Generalising the Central Dogma as a cross-hierarchical principle of biology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Central Dogma of molecular biology, as originally proposed by Crick, asserts that information passed into protein cannot flow back out. This principle has been interpreted as underpinning modern understandings of heredity and evolution, implying the unidirectionality of information flow from nucleic acids to proteins. Here, we propose a generalisation of the Central Dogma as a division of labour between the transmission and expression of information: the transmitter (nucleic acids) perpetuates information across generations, whereas the expressor (protein) enacts this information to facilitate the transmitter's function without itself perpetuating information. We argue that this generalisation offers two benefits. First, it provides a unifying perspective for comparing the Central Dogma to analogous divisions of labour observed at vastly different biological scales, including multicellular organisms, eukaryotic cells, organelles, and bacteria. Second, it offers a theoretical framework to explain the Central Dogma as an outcome of evolution. Specifically, we review a mathematical model suggesting that the Central Dogma originates through spontaneous symmetry breaking driven by evolutionary conflicts between different levels of selection. By reframing the Central Dogma as an informational relationship between components of a system, this generalisation underscores its broader relevance across the biological hierarchy and sheds light on its evolutionary origin.</description>

      <title>Chern-Simons type cross-correlations and geometric Born effective charge of phonons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interplay between different degrees of freedom in condensed matter systems engenders a rich variety of emergent phenomena. In particular, fermions with non-trivial quantum geometry can generate Chern-Simons (CS)-like terms in effective field theories for different gauge fields. For phonons, such terms can result in chiral phonon splitting. Here, we propose that the local Berry curvature can influence the spectra and dynamics of optical phonons, even in materials with zero Chern number, which we demonstrate with a gapped Dirac model. We identify a previously overlooked CS like cross-correlation between electromagnetic and pseudo-gauge fields in 2+1 dimensions which depends on valley Chern number. It facilitates a direct coupling between phonons and photons by inducing a geometric Born effective charge. This opens up a new route for coherent Raman phonon excitation and quantum geometry probes.</description>

      <title>Reentrant topology and reverse pumping in a quasiperiodic flux ladder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological phases of matter are known to be unstable against strong onsite disorder in one dimension. In this work, however, we propose that in the case of a topological ladder, an onsite quasiperiodic disorder under proper conditions, first destroys the initial topological phase and subsequently, induces another topological phase through a gap-closing point. Remarkably, by allowing a staggered flux piercing through the plaquettes of the ladder, the gapless point bifurcates into two gapless critical lines, resulting in a trivial gapped phase sandwiched between the two topological phases. This results in a scenario where the system first undergoes a transition from one topological phase to a trivial phase and then to the other topological phase as a function of the quasiperiodic disorder strength. Such disorder induced re-entrant topological phase transition reveals a phenomenon of direction reversal in the topological transport, which we identify through Thouless charge pumping.</description>

      <title>Moisture-driven CO2 direct air capture and delivery for cultivating cyanobacteria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A moisture-driven air capture system was developed and demonstrated for cultivating cyanobacteria and microalgae at the flask (50 mL), bench (12 L) and small pilot (840 L) scale. Purolite A501 anion exchange resin beads were found to be biocompatible and rapidly deliver air-captured CO2 when immersed directly in an alkaline cultivation medium containing cyanobacteria or microalgae. Flask-scale cultivation trials showed A501 could sustain rapid growth (190 mg/L/d) of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 strain engineered to produce laurate. A bench-scale system installed in a laminar flow hood was able to deliver 2 g CO2/d into abiotic alkaline cultivation medium and 0.5 g/d in the presence of Synechocystis to support vigorous growth (39 mg/L/d) limited by the CO2 delivered by the sorbent. A small pilot-scale system installed in a 4.2 m2 outdoor raceway pond in Mesa, Arizona was able to deliver 100 g CO2/d into abiotic alkaline cultivation medium. Exopolysaccharides and other products excreted by Synechocystis 6803 covered the sorbent beads, reducing their capacity to 25%, which could be partially restored to 70% capacity using a wash protocol, but the CO2 delivery kinetics remained 3-4 fold slower. Analysis of the sorbent beads used as part of four separate outdoor cultivation trials with over 300 days of outdoor wet and dry cycling over four seasons showed significant mechanical fracturing. Infrared spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analysis showed a significant loss of NR4+ functional groups necessary for CO2 capture correlated with extended use. Under the assumption that abiotic performance eventually can be retained by delivering CO2 into the media recycle stream in a way that avoids biofouling, technoeconomic and life cycle analyses show the viability of a small first-of-a-kind biorefinery producing 500 barrels per day of biofuel.</description>

      <title>Broadband Dipole Absorption in Dispersive Photonic Time Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photonic media modulated periodically in time, termed photonic time crystals (PTCs), have attracted considerable attention for their ability to open momentum bandgaps hosting amplifying modes. These momentum gaps, however, generally appear only at the system's parametric resonance condition which constrain many features derived from amplification to a narrow frequency band. Moreover, they are accompanied by exceptional points (EPs) that render their analysis more intricate. Here, we show that a careful consideration of dispersion and absorption can overcome these issues. By investigating the dissipated power of a point-dipole embedded in a dispersive and absorptive PTC, we unveil that temporal modulation enables the conversion of dipole emission into dipole absorption within a broadband frequency window free of EPs. We demonstrate that this effect is general and occurs from weak modulation strengths to low modulation frequencies, and can be achieved for various material platforms. Moreover, we show the possibility of both broadband inhibition and large increase of dissipated power, depending on the modulated parameter.</description>
