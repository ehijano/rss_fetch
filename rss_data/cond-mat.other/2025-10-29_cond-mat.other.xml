      <title>Strong quantum interaction between excitons bound by cavity photon exchange</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically predict the interaction between polaritonic excitations arising from the coupling of a cavity photon mode with bound to continuum intersubband transitions in a doped quantum well. The resulting exciton bound by photon exchange, recently demonstrated experimentally, exhibits a binding energy that can be continuously tuned by varying the cavity frequency. We show that polariton-polariton interactions, originating from both Coulomb interactions and Pauli blocking, can be dramatically enhanced by reducing the exciton binding energy, thereby increasing the effective Bohr radius along the growth direction. This regime is reminiscent of Rydberg atoms, where weak binding leads to strong quantum interactions. Our predictions indicate that this physics can give rise to giant quantum optical nonlinearities in the mid and far infrared, a spectral region that remains largely unexplored in quantum optics and offers exciting opportunities for both fundamental studies and applications.</description>

      <title>A Scalable Superconducting Circuit Framework for Emulating Physics in Hyperbolic Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Theoretical studies and experiments in the last six years have revealed the potential for novel behaviours and functionalities in device physics through the synthetic engineering of negatively-curved spaces. For instance, recent developments in hyperbolic band theory have unveiled the emergence of higher-dimensional eigenstates -- features fundamentally absent in conventional Euclidean systems. At the same time, superconducting quantum circuits have emerged as a leading platform for quantum analogue emulations and digital simulations in scalable architectures. Here, we introduce a scalable superconducting circuit framework for the analogue quantum emulation of tight-binding models on hyperbolic and kagome-like lattices. Using this approach, we experimentally realize three distinct lattices, including, for the first time to our knowledge, a hyperbolic lattice whose unit cell resides on a genus-3 Riemann surface. Our method encodes the hyperbolic metric directly into capacitive couplings between high-quality superconducting resonators, enabling tenable reproduction of spectral and localization properties while overcoming major scalability and spectral resolution limitations of previous designs. These results set the stage for large-scale experimental studies of hyperbolic materials in condensed matter physics and lay the groundwork for realizing hyperbolic quantum processors, with potential implications for both fundamental physics and quantum computing</description>

      <title>Observation of Hexagonal Close-Packed Water Ice at Extreme Pressures and Temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The determination of the phase diagram of water ice under extreme conditions remains a fundamental challenge in high-pressure physics. While theoretical predictions have long suggested the existence of compact phases, such as face-centered cubic (fcc) and hexagonal close-packed (hcp) structures, yet only the fcc phase has been experimentally confirmed. Here, we report the first direct observation of a hcp ice phase using synchrotron x-ray diffraction in laser-heated diamond anvil cells. Between 80 and 200 GPa, we observe the coexistence of fcc and hcp ice, arising from stacking disorder in the fcc oxygen layers, similar to phenomena seen in compressed noble gases. Above 200 GPa, the hcp phase becomes dominant and is recovered at 300 K, indicating its increased thermodynamic stability at ultrahigh pressures. These findings not only expand our understanding of water's complex behavior under extreme conditions but also may play a crucial role in the interiors of giant icy planets.</description>

      <title>Regularised density-potential inversion for periodic systems: application to exact exchange in one dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A detailed convex analysis-based formulation of density-functional theory for periodic systems in arbitrary dimensions is presented. The electron-electron interaction is taken to be of Yukawa type, harmonising with underlying function spaces for densities and wave functions. Moreau--Yosida regularisation of the underlying non-interacting density functionals is then considered, allowing us to recast the Hohenberg--Kohn mapping in a form that is insensitive to perturbations (non-expansiveness) and lends itself to numerical implementation. The general theory is exemplified with a numerical Hartree--Fock implementation for one-dimensional systems. We discuss in particular the challenge of self-consistent field optimisation in calculations related to the regularised noninteracting Hohenberg--Kohn map. The implementation is used to demonstrate that it is practically feasible to recover local Kohn--Sham potentials reproducing the effects of exact exchange within this scheme, which provides a proof-of-principle for recovering the exchange-correlation potential at more accurate levels of theory. Error analysis is performed for the regularised inverse Kohn--Sham algorithm by quantifying, both theoretically and numerically, how perturbations of the input ground-state density propagate through the regularised density-to-potential map.</description>

      <title>Analytical Model of Resonant Quantum Excitation Transport in Molecular Chains at finite Temperatures: Application of Integral Transforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00663v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the potential impact of intramolecular excitations on the active regions of biomolecular chains, which may play a role in physiological processes within living cells. We assumed that an excitation localized in a specific chain segment can modify its physical properties (e.g., local charge distribution or electric dipole moments), thereby altering its role in biochemical processes. As a consequence, the biochemical functionality of the molecular chain may be altered, or even disrupted. Moreover, quantum resonance effects may cause an excitation induced at one structural element to delocalize and appear at a distant site, potentially affecting the functionality of regions located far from the site where the excitation was initially induced.
  To investigate this phenomenon, we developed and analyzed a theoretical model in which a single excitation is induced in a particular structural element of a finite molecular chain in thermal equilibrium with its environment. The interaction between the excitation and the thermal oscillations of the chain was taken into account. Differential equations for the correlation functions were derived and solved analytically using integral transformations, providing information on the probability of finding the excitation at each site of the chain. The results show that both the probability of finding the excitation at distant sites and its residence time depend on the chain's physical characteristics, temperature, and initial excitation location.</description>

      <title>Probing non-equilibrium topological order on a quantum processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18461v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Out-of-equilibrium phases in many-body systems constitute a new paradigm in quantum matter - they exhibit dynamical properties that may otherwise be forbidden by equilibrium thermodynamics. Among these non-equilibrium phases are periodically driven (Floquet) systems [1-5], which are generically difficult to simulate classically because of their high entanglement. Here we realize a Floquet topologically ordered state theoretically proposed in ref. [6], on an array of superconducting qubits. We image the characteristic dynamics of its chiral edge modes and characterize its emergent anyonic excitations. Devising an interferometric algorithm allows us to introduce and measure a bulk topological invariant to probe the dynamical transmutation of anyons for system sizes up to 58 qubits. Our work demonstrates that quantum processors can provide key insights into the thus-far largely unexplored landscape of highly entangled non-equilibrium phases of matter.</description>

      <title>Adaptive quantum dynamics with the time-dependent variational Monte Carlo method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08575v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce an extension of the time-dependent variational Monte Carlo (tVMC) method that adaptively controls the expressivity of the variational quantum state during the simulation of the dynamics. This adaptive tVMC (atVMC) approach is specifically designed to enhance numerical stability when overparameterized variational ans\"atze lead to ill-conditioned equations of motion. Building on the concept of the local-in-time error (LITE), a measure of the deviation between variational and exact evolution, we introduce a procedure to quantify each parameter's contribution to reducing the LITE, using only quantities already computed in standard tVMC simulations. These relevance estimates guide the selective evolution of only the most significant parameters at each time step, while maintaining a prescribed level of accuracy. We benchmark the algorithm on quantum quenches in the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model using both spin-Jastrow and restricted Boltzmann machine wave functions, with an emphasis on overparameterized regimes. The adaptive scheme significantly improves numerical stability and reduces the need for strong regularization, enabling reliable simulations with highly expressive variational ans\"atze.</description>

      <title>Krylov exponents and power spectra for maximal quantum chaos: an EFT approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05444v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine the effective field theory (EFT) of maximal chaos through the lens of Krylov complexity and the Universal Operator Growth Hypothesis. We test the relationship between two measures of quantum chaos: out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs) and Krylov complexity. In the EFT, a shift symmetry of the hydrodynamic modes enforces the maximal Lyapunov exponent in OTOCs, $\lambda_L = 2\pi T$, while simultaneously constraining thermal two-point autocorrelators. We solve these constraints on the autocorrelator, and calculate the Lanczos coefficients and Krylov exponents for several examples, finding both $\lambda_K = \lambda_L$ and $\lambda_K = \lambda_L/2$. This demonstrates that, within the EFT, the shift symmetry alone is insufficient to enforce maximal Krylov exponents even when the Lyapunov exponent is maximal. In particular, this result suggests a tension with the conjectured bound $\lambda_L \leq \lambda_K \leq 2\pi T$. Finally, we identify autocorrelator solutions whose power spectra closely resemble the so-called thermal product formula seen in holographic systems.</description>
