      <title>Quantifying quantum coherence and the deviation from the total probability formula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel approach to quantify quantum coherence which, contrary to the previous ones, does not rely on resource theory but rather on ontological considerations. In this framework, coherence is understood as the ability for a quantum system's statistics to deviate from the total probability formula. After motivating the importance of the total probability formula in quantum foundations, we propose a new set of axioms that a measure of coherence should satisfy, and show that it defines a class of measures different from the main previous proposal. Finally, we prove a general result about the dependence of the l2-coherence norm on the basis of interest, and show that it is well approximated by the square root of the purity in most bases.</description>

      <title>Optimal systems, conservation laws, and invariance analysis of the (2 + 1) extended Boiti-Leon-Manna-Pempinelli equation via the lie symmetry approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lie symmetry analysis has been applied to the extended Boiti-Leon-Manna-Pempinelli (eBLMP) equation. This system illustrates the exchange of information between two waves with distinct dispersion characteristics. The optimal system of the corresponding Lie algebra has been constructed. The equation considered has been reduced into a simpler form for the computation of analytical solutions. The novelty of this research is the optimal system of subalgebras in one dimension using the adjoint action approach. To analyze and understand the eBLMP more clearly, graphs have been plotted. We have also found conservation laws</description>

      <title>Stop using Landau gauge for Tight-binding Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To analyze the electronic band structure of a two-dimensional (2D) crystal under a commensurate perpendicular magnetic field, tight-binding (TB) Hamiltonians are typically constructed using a magnetic unit cell (MUC), which is composed of several unit cells (UC) to satisfy flux quantization. However, when the vector potential is constrained to the Landau gauge, an additional constraint is imposed on the hopping trajectories, further enlarging the TB Hamiltonian and preventing incommensurate atomic rearrangements. In this paper, we demonstrate that this constraint persists, albeit in a weaker form, for any linear vector potential ($\mathbf{A}(\mathbf{r})$ linear in $\mathbf{r}$). This restriction can only be fully lifted by using a nonlinear vector potential. With a general nonlinear vector potential, a TB Hamiltonian can be constructed that matches the minimal size dictated by flux quantization, even when incommensurate atomic rearrangements occur within the MUC, such as moir\'e reconstructions. For example, as the twist angle $\theta$ of twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) approaches zero, the size of the TB Hamiltonian scales as $1/\theta^4$ when using linear vector potentials (including the Landau gauge). In contrast, with a nonlinear vector potential, the size scales more favorably, as $1/\theta^2$, making small-angle TBG models more tractable with TB.</description>

      <title>The Feyn-Structure of Yangian Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Yangian-type differential operators are shown to constrain Feynman integrals beyond the restriction to integrable graphs. In particular, we prove that all position-space Feynman diagrams at tree level feature a Yangian level-one momentum symmetry as long as their external coordinates are distinct. This symmetry is traced back to a set of more elementary bilocal operators, which annihilate the integrals. In dual momentum space, the considered Feynman graphs represent multi-loop integrals without `loops of loops', generalizing for instance the family of so-called train track or train track network diagrams. The extension of these results to integrals with massive propagators on the boundary of the Feynman graph is established. When specializing to the dual conformal case, where propagator powers sum up to the spacetime dimension at each position-space vertex, the symmetry extends to the full dual conformal Yangian. Hence, our findings represent a generalization of the statements on the Yangian symmetry of Feynman integrals beyond integrability and reveal its origin lying in a set of more elementary bilocal annihilators. Previous applications of the Yangian suggest to employ the resulting differential equations for bootstrapping multi-loop integrals beyond the dual conformal case. The considered bilocal constraints on Feynman integrals resemble the definition of conformal partial waves via Casimir operators, but are based on a different algebraic structure.</description>

      <title>Operator algebra and algorithmic construction of boundaries and defects in (2+1)D topological Pauli stabilizer codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a computational algorithm for constructing all boundaries and defects of topological generalized Pauli stabilizer codes in two spatial dimensions. Utilizing the operator algebra formalism, we establish a one-to-one correspondence between the topological data-such as anyon types, fusion rules, topological spins, and braiding statistics-of (2+1)D bulk stabilizer codes and (1+1)D boundary anomalous subsystem codes. To make the operator algebra computationally accessible, we adapt Laurent polynomials and convert the tasks into matrix operations, e.g., the Hermite normal form for obtaining boundary anyons and the Smith normal form for determining fusion rules. This approach enables computers to automatically generate all possible gapped boundaries and defects for topological Pauli stabilizer codes through boundary anyon condensation and topological order completion. This streamlines the analysis of surface codes and associated logical operations for fault-tolerant quantum computation. Our algorithm applies to $Z_d$ qudits, including both prime and nonprime $d$, thus enabling the exploration of topological quantum codes beyond toric codes. We have applied the algorithm and explicitly demonstrated the lattice constructions of 2 boundaries and 6 defects in the $Z_2$ toric code, 3 boundaries and 22 defects in the $Z_4$ toric code, 1 boundary and 2 defects in the double semion code, 1 boundary and 22 defects in the six-semion code, 6 boundaries and 270 defects in the color code, and 6 defects in the anomalous three-fermion code. In addition, we investigate the boundaries of two specific bivariate bicycle codes within a family of low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. We demonstrate that their topological orders are equivalent to 8 and 10 copies of $Z_2$ toric codes, with anyons restricted to move by 12 and 1023 lattice sites in the square lattice, respectively.</description>

      <title>On Pauli pairs and Fourier uniqueness problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the concept of Pauli pairs and a discrete counterpart to it. In particular, we make substantial progress on the question of when a discrete Pauli pair is automatically a classical Pauli pair.
  Effectively, if one of the functions has space and frequency Gaussian decay, and one has that $|f| = |g|$ and $|\widehat{f}| = |\widehat{g}|$ on two sets which accumulate like suitable small multiples of $\sqrt{n}$ at infinity, then $|f| \equiv |g|$ and $|\widehat{f}| = |\widehat{g}|.$ Furthermore, we show that if one drops either the assumption that one of the functions has space-frequency decay or that the discrete sets accumulate at a high rate, then the desired property no longer holds.
  Our techniques are inspired by and directly connected to several recent results in the realm of Fourier uniqueness problems, and our results may be seen as a nonlinear generalization of those. As a consequence of said techniques, we are able to prove a sharp discrete version of Hardy's uncertainty principle.</description>

      <title>Unifying error-correcting code/Narain CFT correspondences via lattices over integers of cyclotomic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We identify Narain conformal field theories (CFTs) that correspond to code lattices for quantum error-correcting codes (QECC) over integers of cyclotomic fields $Q(\zeta_p)$ $(\zeta_p=e^{\frac{2\pi i}p})$ for general prime $p\geq 3$. This code-lattice construction is a generalization of more familiar ones such as Construction A${}_C$ for ternary codes and (after the generalization stated below) Construction A for binary codes, containing them as special cases. This code-lattice construction is redescribed in terms of root and weight lattices of Lie algebras, which allows to construct lattices for codes over rings $Z_q$ with non-prime $q$. Corresponding Narain CFTs are found for codes embedded into quotient rings of root and weight lattices of $ADE$ series, except $E_8$ and $D_k$ with $k$ even. In a sense, this provides a unified description of the relationship between various QECCs over $F_p$ (or $Z_q$) and Narain CFTs.</description>

      <title>Deformation Quantization via Categorical Factorization Homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops an approach to categorical deformation quantization via factorization homology. We show that a quantization of the local coefficients for factorization homology is equivalent to consistent quantizations of its value on manifolds. To formulate our results we introduce the concepts of shifted almost Poisson and BD categories. Our main example is the character stack of flat principal bundles for a reductive algebraic group $G$, where we show that applying the general framework to the Drinfeld category reproduces deformations previously introduced by Li-Bland and \v{S}evera. As a direct consequence, we can conclude a precise relation between their quantization and those introduced by Alekseev, Grosse, and Schomerus. To arrive at our results we compute factorization homology with values in a ribbon category enriched over complete $\mathbb{C}[[\hbar]]$-modules. More generally, we define enriched skein categories which compute factorization homology for ribbon categories enriched over a general closed symmetric monoidal category $\mathcal{V}$.</description>

      <title>A Hodge Theory for Entanglement Cohomology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore and extend the application of homological algebra to describe quantum entanglement, initiated in arXiv:1901.02011, focusing on the Hodge-theoretic structure of entanglement cohomology in finite-dimensional quantum systems. We construct analogues of the Hodge star operator, inner product, codifferential, and Laplacian for entanglement $k$-forms. We also prove that such $k$-forms obey versions of the Hodge isomorphism theorem and Hodge decomposition, and that they exhibit Hodge duality. As a corollary, we conclude that the dimensions of the $k$-th and $(n-k)$-th cohomologies coincide for entanglement in $n$-partite pure states, which explains a symmetry property ("Poincare duality") of the associated Poincare polynomials.</description>

      <title>Poincare field theory for massive particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is ambitious pretension formulated by Weinberg \cite{W} that {\it any relativistic quantum theory will look at sufficiently low energy like a quantum field theory.} It is based on the observation that for formulation of quantum field theory {\it ... much better starting point is Wigner's definition of particles as representations of inhomogeneous Lorentz group} \cite{Wi, BW}.
  To achieve that Ref.\cite{W} starts with particles and get to the field equations later. Here we propose a complementary approach and directly introduce field equations as Casimir eigenvalue problem. Note that Casimir invariants commute with all group elements and therefore commute between each other. So, they have common eigenvalues (for Poincare group mass and spin ) and common eigenstates (here irreducible representation of Poincare group).
  We use derivatives as standard representation for momenta $P_a \to i \partial_a$ and introduce representation for arbitrary spin operator $ S_{a b} $ with the help of recurrence relations. To solve eigenvalue problem for Casimir operators we will go to the formulation with standard momentum, where differential equations turn to algebraic ones. Then for arbitrary field $\Psi^A $ we construct projection operators on particular spins. The irreducible representations, have a role of equations of motion.
  For fermions we can go to linear form of equations of motion and obtain Dirac equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a new proof of the splitting theorems from Lorentzian geometry, in which simplicity is gained by sacrificing linearity of the d'Alembertian to recover ellipticity. We exploit a negative homogeneity (non-uniformly) elliptic $p$-d'Alembert operator for this purpose. This allows us to bring the Eschenburg, Galloway, and Newman Lorentzian splitting theorems into a framework closer to the Cheeger-Gromoll splitting theorem from Riemannian geometry.</description>

      <title>Area measures and branched polymers in supercritical Liouville quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Liouville quantum gravity (LQG) in the supercritical (a.k.a. strongly coupled) phase, which has background charge $Q \in (0,2)$ and central charge $\mathbf{c}_{\mathrm{L}} = 1+6Q^2 \in (1,25)$. Recent works have shown how to define LQG in this phase as a planar random geometry associated with a variant of the Gaussian free field, which exhibits "infinite spikes." In contrast, a number of results from physics, dating back to the 1980s, suggest that supercritical LQG surfaces should behave like "branched polymers": i.e., they should look like the continuum random tree. We prove a result which reconciles these two descriptions of supercritical LQG. More precisely, we show that for a family of random planar maps with boundary in the universality class of supercritical LQG, if we condition on the (small probability) event that the planar map is finite, then the scaling limit is the continuum random tree. We also show that there does not exist any locally finite measure associated with supercritical LQG which is locally determined by the field and satisfies the LQG coordinate change formula. Our proofs are based on a branching process description of supercritical LQG which comes from its coupling with CLE$_4$ (Ang and Gwynne, arXiv:2308.11832).</description>

      <title>Phase vs coin vs position disorder as a probe for the resilience and revival of single particle entanglement in cyclic quantum walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum states exhibiting single-particle entanglement (SPE) can encode and process quantum information more robustly than their multi-particle analogs. Understanding the vulnerability and resilience of SPE to disorder is therefore crucial. This letter investigates phase, coin, and position disorder via discrete-time quantum walks on odd and even cyclic graphs to study their effect on SPE. The reduction in SPE is insignificant for low levels of phase or coin disorder, showing the resilience of SPE to minor perturbations. However, SPE is seen to be more vulnerable to position disorder. We analytically prove that maximally entangled single-particle states (MESPS) at time step $t=1$ are impervious to phase disorder regardless of the choice of the initial state. Further, MESPS at timestep $t=1$ is also wholly immune to coin disorder for phase-symmetric initial states. Position disorder breaks odd-even parity and distorts the physical time cone of the quantum walker, unlike phase or coin disorder. SPE saturates towards a fixed value for position disorder, irrespective of the disorder strength at large timestep $t$. Furthermore, SPE can be enhanced with moderate to significant phase or coin disorder strengths at specific time steps. Interestingly, disorder can revive single-particle entanglement from absolute zero in some instances, too. These results are crucial in understanding single-particle entanglement evolution and dynamics in a lab setting.</description>

      <title>The bulk one-arm exponent for the CLE$_{\kappa'}$ percolations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The conformal loop ensemble (CLE) is a conformally invariant random collection of loops. In the non-simple regime $\kappa'\in (4,8)$, it describes the scaling limit of the critical Fortuin-Kasteleyn (FK) percolations. CLE percolations were introduced by Miller-Sheffield-Werner (2017). The CLE$_{\kappa'}$ percolations describe the scaling limit of a natural variant of the FK percolation called the fuzzy Potts model, which has an additional percolation parameter $r$. Based on CLE percolations and assuming that the convergence of the FK percolation to CLE, K{\"o}hler-Schindler and Lehmkuehler (2022) derived all the arm exponents for the fuzzy Potts model except the bulk one-arm exponent. In this paper, we exactly solve this exponent, which prescribes the dimension of the clusters in CLE$_{\kappa'}$ percolations. As a special case, the bichromatic one-arm exponent for the critical 3-state Potts model should be $4/135$. To the best of our knowledge, this natural exponent was not predicted in physics. Our derivation relies on the iterative construction of CLE percolations from the boundary conformal loop ensemble (BCLE), and the coupling between Liouville quantum gravity and SLE curves. The source of the exact solvability comes from the structure constants of boundary Liouville conformal field theory. A key technical step is to prove a conformal welding result for the target-invariant radial SLE curves. As intermediate steps in our derivation, we obtain several exact results for BCLE in both the simple and non-simple regimes, which extend results of Ang-Sun-Yu-Zhuang (2024) on the touching probability of non-simple CLE. This also provides an alternative derivation of the relation between the BCLE parameter $\rho$ and the additional percolation parameter $r$ in CLE percolations, which was originally due to Miller-Sheffield-Werner (2021, 2022).</description>

      <title>Dynamical Stability of the Laplace Resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyse the stability of the de Sitter equilibria in multi-resonant planetary systems. The de Sitter equilibrium is the dynamical state of the Laplace resonance in which all resonant arguments are librating. The sequence of equilibria exists all along the possible states balancing resonance offsets and forced eccentricities. Possible additional new-de Sitter equilibria may exist when at least one of the forced eccentricities is large (the paradigmatic case is Gliese-876). In the present work, these families of equilibria are traced up to crossing exact commensurability, where approximate first-order solutions diverge. Explicit exact location of the equilibria are determined allowing us to verify the Lyapunov stability of the standard de Sitter equilibrium and of the stable branches of the additional ones.</description>

      <title>More Nonlinearities? Electromagnetic and Gravitational Mode Mixing in NSBH Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the possibility of electromagnetic fields leaving imprints on gravitational wave (GW) signals from Neutron Star-Black hole (NSBH) mergers, specifically in the context of extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs). Using black hole perturbation theory (BHPT) in the context of a minimally coupled Einstein-Maxwell system, we demonstrate that electromagnetic quasi normal modes(QNMs) can excite gravitational QNMs with frequencies that are linear or quadratic in the electromagnetic QNMs, at first level of mixing. Moreover, We then study the electromagnetism-gravity coupling by approximating the Regge-Wheeler and Zerilli potentials with Dirac delta functions. In this example, we examine gravitational perturbations induced by the electromagnetic field of an ideal dipole radially free fall towards the blackhole, building on calculations from a companion paper [1]. Our results show that both linear and quadratic electromagnetic QNMs appear in gravitational perturbations. In addition, linear gravitational QNMs are also excited due to the electromagnetic source, with their amplitudes depending on the details of the electromagnetic and gravitational potentials, analogous to gravitational mode mixing analysis. Furthermore, at late stages, gravitational perturbations might exhibit polynomial tails induced by electromagnetic perturbations. This article sets the stage for future numerical investigations aimed at identifying such modes in various scenarios.</description>

      <title>A new matrix representation of the Maxwell equations based on the Riemann-Silberstein-Weber vector for a linear inhomogeneous medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.09907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.09907v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive a new eight dimensional matrix representation of the Maxwell equations for a linear homogeneous medium and extend it to the case of a linear inhomogneous medium. This derivation starts ab initio with the Maxwell equations and uses arguments based on the algebra of the Pauli matrices. This process leads automatically to the matrix representation based on the Riemann-Silberstein-Weber (RSW) vector. The new representation for the homogeneous medium is a direct sum of four Pauli matrix blocks. This aspect of the new representation should make it suitable for studying the propagation of electromagnetic waves in a linear inhomogeneous medium adopting the techniques of quantum mechanics treating the inhomogeneity as a perturbation. The new representation is used to rederive the Mukunda-Simon-Sudarshan matrix substitution rule for transition from the Helmholtz scalar wave optics to the Maxwell vector wave optics.</description>

      <title>Anti-de Sitterian "massive" elementary systems and their Minkowskian and Newton-Hooke contraction limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.06690v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We elaborate the definition and properties of "massive" elementary systems in the $(1+3)$-dimensional Anti-de Sitter (AdS$_4$) spacetime, on both classical and quantum levels. We fully exploit the symmetry group {isomorphic to} Sp$(4,R)$, that is, the two-fold covering of SO$_0(2,3)$ (Sp$(4,\mathbb R) \sim$ SO$_0(2,3)\times \mathbb Z_2$), recognized as the relativity/kinematical group of motions in AdS$_4$ spacetime. In particular, we discuss that the group coset Sp$(4,\mathbb R)/\mathrm{S}\big(\mathrm{U}(1)\times \mathrm{SU}(2)\big)$, as one of the Cartan classical domains, can be interpreted as a phase space for the set of free motions of a test massive particle on AdS$_4$ spacetime; technically, in order to facilitate the computations, the whole process is carried out in terms of complex quaternions. The (projective) unitary irreducible representations (UIRs) of the Sp$(4,R)$ group, describing the quantum version of such motions, are found in the discrete series of the Sp$(4,\mathbb R)$ UIRs. We also describe the null-curvature (Poincar\'{e}) and non-relativistic (Newton-Hooke) contraction limits of such systems, on both classical and quantum levels. On this basis, we unveil the dual nature of "massive" elementary systems living in AdS$_4$ spacetime, as each being a combination of a Minkowskian-like elementary system {with positive proper mass}, with an isotropic harmonic oscillator arising from the AdS$_4$ curvature and viewed as a Newton-Hooke elementary system. This matter-vibration duality will take its whole importance in the quantum regime (in the context of the validity of the equipartition theorem) in view of its possible r\^{o}le in the explanation of the current existence of dark matter.</description>

      <title>Shuffle algebras, lattice paths and Macdonald functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.06138v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider partition functions on the $N\times N$ square lattice with the local Boltzmann weights given by the $R$-matrix of the $U_{t}(\widehat{sl}(n+1|m))$ quantum algebra. We identify boundary states such that the square lattice can be viewed on a conic surface. The partition function $Z_N$ on this lattice computes the weighted sum over all possible closed coloured lattice paths with $n+m$ different colours: $n$ ``bosonic'' colours and $m$ ``fermionic'' colours. Each bosonic (fermionic) path of colour $i$ contributes a factor of $z_i$ ($w_i$) to the weight of the configuration. We show the following. (i) $Z_N$ is a symmetric function in the spectral parameters $x_1\dots x_N$ and generates basis elements of the commutative trigonometric Feigin--Odesskii shuffle algebra. The generating function of $Z_N$ admits a shuffle-exponential formula analogous to the Macdonald Cauchy kernel. (ii) $Z_N$ is a symmetric function in two alphabets $(z_1\dots z_n)$ and $(w_1\dots w_m)$. When $x_1\dots x_N$ are set to be equal to the box content of a skew Young diagram $\mu/\nu$ with $N$ boxes the partition function $Z_N$ reproduces the skew Macdonald function $P_{\mu/\nu}\left[w-z\right]$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09839v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a version of the solid-on-solid model on the Cayley tree of order two in which vertices carry spins of value $0,1$ or $2$ and the pairwise interaction of neighboring vertices is given by their spin difference to the power $p&gt;0$. We exhibit all translation-invariant splitting Gibbs measures (TISGMs) of the model and demonstrate the existence of up to seven such measures, depending on the parameters. We further establish general conditions for extremality and non-extremality of TISGMs in the set of all Gibbs measures and use them to examine selected TISGMs for a small and a large $p$.
  Notably, our analysis reveals that extremality properties are similar for large $p$ compared to the case $p=1$, a case that has been explored already in previous work. However, for the small $p$, certain measures that were consistently non-extremal for $p=1$ do exhibit transitions between extremality and non-extremality.</description>

      <title>Control of Probability Flow in Markov Chain Monte Carlo -- Nonreversibility and Lifting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.0258</link>
      <description>arXiv:1207.0258v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method is widely used in various fields as a powerful numerical integration technique for systems with many degrees of freedom. In MCMC methods, probabilistic state transitions can be considered as a random walk in state space, and random walks allow for sampling from complex distributions. However, paradoxically, it is necessary to carefully suppress the randomness of the random walk to improve computational efficiency. By breaking detailed balance, we can create a probability flow in the state space and perform more efficient sampling along this flow. Motivated by this idea, practical and efficient nonreversible MCMC methods have been developed over the past ten years. In particular, the lifting technique, which introduces probability flows in an extended state space, has been applied to various systems and has proven more efficient than conventional reversible updates. We review and discuss several practical approaches to implementing nonreversible MCMC methods, including the shift method in the cumulative distribution and the directed-worm algorithm.</description>

      <title>Fused K-operators and the $q$-Onsager algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.00781v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study universal solutions to reflection equations with a spectral parameter, so-called K-operators, within a general framework of universal K-matrices - an extended version of the approach introduced by Appel-Vlaar. Here, the input data is a quasi-triangular Hopf algebra $H$, its comodule algebra $B$ and a pair of consistent twists. In our setting, the universal K-matrix is an element of $B\otimes H$ satisfying certain axioms, and we consider the case $H$ is the quantum loop algebra for $sl_2$, and $B={\cal A}_q$ is the alternating central extension of the $q$-Onsager algebra. Considering tensor products of evaluation representations of $H$ in "non-semisimple" cases, the new set of axioms allows us to introduce and study fused K-operators of spin-$j$; in particular, to prove that for all $j\in\frac{1}{2}\mathbb{N}$ they satisfy the spectral-parameter dependent reflection equation. We provide their explicit expression in terms of elements of the algebra ${\cal A}_q$ for small values of spin-$j$. The precise relation between the fused K-operators of spin-$j$ and evaluations of a universal K-matrix for ${\cal A}_q$ is conjectured based on supporting evidences. Independently, we study K-operator solutions of the twisted intertwining relations associated with the comodule algebra ${\cal A}_q$, and expand them in the Poincar\'e-Birkhoff-Witt basis of ${\cal A}_q$. With a reasonably general ansatz, we found a unique solution for first few values of $j$ which agrees with the fused K-operators, as expected. We conjecture that in general such solutions are uniquely determined and match with the expressions of the fused K-operators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.13197v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the asymptotic geometry of Hermitian non-K\"ahler Ricci-flat metrics with finite $\int|Rm|^2$ at infinity. Specifically, we prove:
  1. Any such metric is asymptotic to an ALE, ALF-A, AF, skewed special Kasner, ALH* model at infinity.
  2. Any Hermitian non-K\"ahler gravitational instanton with non-Euclidean volume growth is one of the following: the Kerr family, the Chen-Teo family, the Taub-bolt space, the reversed Taub-NUT space. This particularly confirms a conjecture by Aksteiner-Andersson. It includes the well-known Kerr family from general relativity.
  3. All Hermitian non-K\"ahler gravitational instantons can be compactified to log del Pezzo surfaces. This explains a curious relation to compact Hermitian non-K\"ahler Einstein 4-manifolds.
  For a 4-dimensional Ricci-flat metric, being Hermitian non-K\"ahler is equivalent to being non-trivially conformally K\"ahler.</description>

      <title>From quantum difference equation to Dubrovin connection of affine type A quiver varieties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02473v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This is the continuation of the article \cite{Z23}. In this article we will give a detailed analysis of the quantum difference equation of the equivariant $K$-theory of the affine type $A$ quiver varieties. We will give a good representation of the quantum difference operator $\mathbf{M}_{\mathcal{L}}(z)$ such that the monodromy operator $\mathbf{B}_{\mathbf{m}}(z)$in the formula can be written in the $U_{q}(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$-form or in the $U_{q}(\hat{\mathfrak{gl}}_1)$-form. We also give the detailed analysis of the connection matrix for the quantum difference equation in the nodal limit $p\rightarrow0$. Using these two results, we prove that the degeneration limit of the quantum difference equation is the Dubrovin connection for the quantum cohomology of the affine type $A$ quiver varieties, and the monodromy representation for the Dubrovin connection is generated by the monodromy operators $\mathbf{B}_{\mathbf{m}}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08344v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the exterior solution for a static, spherically symmetric source in Weyl conformal gravity in terms of the Newman--Penrose formalism. We first show that both the static, uncharged black hole solution of Mannheim and Kazanas and the static, charged Reissner--Nordstr\"{o}m-like solution can be found more easily in this formalism than in the traditional coordinate-basis approach, where the metric tensor components are taken as the basic variables. Second, we show that the Newman-Penrose formalism offers a particularly convenient framework that is well suited for the discussion of conformal gravity solutions corresponding to Petrov ''type-D'' spacetimes. This is illustrated with a two-parameter class of wormhole solutions that includes the Ellis--Bronnikov wormhole solution of Einstein's gravity as a limiting case. Other salient issues, such as the gauge equivalence of solutions and the inclusion of the electromagnetic field are also discussed.</description>

Abstract: We study the spectrum of meson masses in large $N_c$ QCD$_2$ governed by celebrated 't Hooft's integral equation. We generalize analytical methods proposed by Fateev, Lukyanov and Zamolodchikov to the case of arbitrary, but equal quark masses $m_1=m_2.$ Our results include analytical expressions for spectral sums and systematic large-$n$ expansion. We also study the spectral sums in the chiral limit and the heavy quark limit and find a complete agreement with known results.</description>

      <title>Non-Universality from Conserved Superoperators in Unitary Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11407</link>

Abstract: An important result in the theory of quantum control is the "universality" of $2$-local unitary gates, i.e. the fact that any global unitary evolution of a system of $L$ qudits can be implemented by composition of $2$-local unitary gates. Surprisingly, recent results have shown that universality can break down in the presence of symmetries: in general, not all globally symmetric unitaries can be constructed using $k$-local symmetric unitary gates. This also restricts the dynamics that can be implemented by symmetric local Hamiltonians. In this paper, we show that obstructions to universality in such settings can in general be understood in terms of superoperator symmetries associated with unitary evolution by restricted sets of gates. These superoperator symmetries lead to block decompositions of the operator Hilbert space, which dictate the connectivity of operator space, and hence the structure of the dynamical Lie algebra. We demonstrate this explicitly in several examples by systematically deriving the superoperator symmetries from the gate structure using the framework of commutant algebras, which has been used to systematically derive symmetries in other quantum many-body systems. We clearly delineate two different types of non-universality, which stem from different structures of the superoperator symmetries, and discuss its signatures in physical observables. In all, our work establishes a comprehensive framework to explore the universality of unitary circuits and derive physical consequences of its absence.</description>

      <title>$\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$ Gauge Theory, Hyperbolic Geometry and Virasoro Coadjoint Orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01302v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has long been known that the moduli space of hyperbolic metrics on the disc can be identified with the Virasoro coadjoint orbit $\mathrm{Diff}^+(S^1) / \mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$. The interest in this relationship has recently been revived in the study of two-dimensional JT gravity and it raises the natural question if all Virasoro orbits $\mathcal{O}$ arise as moduli spaces of hyperbolic metrics. In this article, we give an affirmative answer to this question using $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$ gauge theory on a cylinder $S$: to any $L\in\mathcal{O}$ we assign a flat $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$ gauge field $A_L = (g_L)^{-1} dg_L$, and we explain how the global properties and singularities of the hyperbolic geometry are encoded in the monodromies and winding numbers of $g_L$, and how they depend on the Virasoro orbit. In particular, we show that the somewhat mysterious geometries associated with Virasoro orbits with no constant representative $L$ arise from large gauge transformations acting on standard (constant $L$ ) funnel or cuspidal geometries, shedding some light on their potential physical significance: e.g. they describe new topological sectors of two-dimensional gravity, characterised by twisted boundary conditions. Using a gauge theoretic gluing construction, we also obtain a complete dictionary between Virasoro coadjoint orbits and moduli spaces of hyperbolic metrics with specified boundary projective structure.</description>

      <title>Quantum Knots that Never Come Untied</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07470v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lord Kelvin proposed that atoms form hydrodynamic vortex knots. However, they typically untie through reconnections, i. e., local cut-and-slice events, unlike stable vortex unknots such as smoke rings. The same holds in superfluids--quantum fluids with zero viscosity--where vortices have quantized circulation, making them topologically stable. For over 150 years, hydrodynamically stable vortex knots have been sought both experimentally and theoretically. Here, we present the first demonstration of hydrodynamically stable vortex knots and links in experimentally realizable Bose-Einstein condensates of ultracold atomic gases and confirm it through dynamic simulations. Our method creates stable knotted vortex structures in systems where reconnections are prohibited, with potential relevance to neutron star interiors. Additionally, we anticipate our mathematical framework could have applications in quantum computation, quantum turbulence, and DNA dynamics, particularly where reconnections are restricted.</description>

      <title>A Unified Framework for Forward and Inverse Problems in Subsurface Imaging using Latent Space Translations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11247v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In subsurface imaging, learning the mapping from velocity maps to seismic waveforms (forward problem) and waveforms to velocity (inverse problem) is important for several applications. While traditional techniques for solving forward and inverse problems are computationally prohibitive, there is a growing interest in leveraging recent advances in deep learning to learn the mapping between velocity maps and seismic waveform images directly from data. Despite the variety of architectures explored in previous works, several open questions still remain unanswered such as the effect of latent space sizes, the importance of manifold learning, the complexity of translation models, and the value of jointly solving forward and inverse problems. We propose a unified framework to systematically characterize prior research in this area termed the Generalized Forward-Inverse (GFI) framework, building on the assumption of manifolds and latent space translations. We show that GFI encompasses previous works in deep learning for subsurface imaging, which can be viewed as specific instantiations of GFI. We also propose two new model architectures within the framework of GFI: Latent U-Net and Invertible X-Net, leveraging the power of U-Nets for domain translation and the ability of IU-Nets to simultaneously learn forward and inverse translations, respectively. We show that our proposed models achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance for forward and inverse problems on a wide range of synthetic datasets, and also investigate their zero-shot effectiveness on two real-world-like datasets.</description>
