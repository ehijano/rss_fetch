      <title>Scalable Bayesian Optimization for High-Dimensional Coarse-Grained Model Parameterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coarse-grained (CG) force field models are extensively utilised in material simulations due to their scalability. Traditionally, these models are parameterized using hybrid strategies that integrate top-down and bottom-up approaches; however, this combination restricts the capacity to jointly optimize all parameters. While Bayesian Optimization (BO) has been explored as an alternative search strategy for identifying optimal parameters, its application has traditionally been limited to low-dimensional problems. This has contributed to the perception that BO is unsuitable for more realistic CG models, which often involve a large number of parameters. In this study, we challenge this assumption by successfully extending BO to optimize a high-dimensional CG model. Specifically, we show that a 41-parameter CG model of Pebax-1657, a copolymer composed of alternating polyamide and polyether segments, can be effectively parameterized using BO, resulting in a model that accurately reproduces key physical properties of its atomistic counterpart. Our optimization framework simultaneously targets density, radius of gyration, and glass transition temperature. It achieves convergence in fewer than 600 iterations, resulting in a CG model that shows consistent improvements across all three properties.</description>

      <title>Wafer-scale Synthesis of Mithrene and its Application in 2D Heterostructure UV Photodetectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silver phenylselenide (AgSePh), known as mithrene, is a two-dimensional (2D) organic-inorganic chalcogenide (MOC) semiconductor with a wide direct band gap, narrow blue emission and in-plane anisotropy. However, its application in next-generation optoelectronics is limited by crystal size and orientation, as well as challenges in large-area growth. Here, we introduce a controlled tarnishing step on the silver surface prior to the solid-vapor-phase chemical transformation into AgSePh thin films. Mithrene thin films were prepared through thermally assisted conversion (TAC) at 100{\deg}C, incorporating a pre-tarnishing water (H${_2}$O) vapor pulse and propylamine (PrNH${_2}$) as a coordinating ligand to modulate Ag${^+}$ ion reactivity and facilitate the conversion of Ph${_2}$Se${_2}$ into an active intermediate. The AgSePh thin films were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS). The pre-tarnishing process, combined with organic ligands, resulted in large crystals exceeding 1 ${\mu}$m and improved homogeneous in-plane orientation, while also enabling the selective, wafer-scale synthesis of mithrene on 100 mm wafers. Furthermore, the films were integrated on planar graphene field-effect phototransistors (GFETs) and demonstrated photoresponsivity beyond 100 A/W at 450 nm, highlighting mithrene's potential for blue light-detection applications.</description>

      <title>Characterization of WSe$_2$ films using reflection Kikuchi diffraction in the scanning electron microscope and multivariate statistical analyses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of thin films and 2D materials, including transition metal dichalcogenides such as WSe$_2$ offers opportunities to leverage their properties in advanced sensors, quantum technologies, and device to optimize functional performance. In this work, we characterize thin WSe$_2$ samples with variable thicknesses using scanning electron microscope (SEM)-based techniques focused on analysis of backscattered electron signal and Kikuchi diffraction patterns. These data were collected via a pixelated electron-counting direct electron detector positioned below the pole piece primarily configured for reflection Kikuchi diffraction (RKD), and a similar detector placed in the more conventional electron backscatter diffraction geometry. In addition to conventional pattern analysis for orientation microscopy, multivariate statistical methods (MSA) based on principal component analysis were applied to analyze diffraction patterns and differentiate thickness variations and crystal orientations within the thin films through data clustering. These results were compared with atomic force microscopy to validate thickness measurements. Our findings indicate that RKD combined with MSA is highly effective for characterizing 2D materials, enabling simultaneous assessment of thickness and crystallographic orientation. Systematic acceleration voltage variations in RKD experiments and comparisons with EBSD data suggest that the thickness dependency arises from inelastic scattering of diffracted electrons, which affects pattern contrast in the thin film regime. Collection and analysis of patterns obtained from monolayer, bilayer and tri-layer of WSe$_2$ are also demonstrated. This work reinforces the utility of SEM-based techniques, such as RKD, as valuable tools for the materials characterization toolkit, particularly for thin films and 2D materials.</description>

      <title>Accelerated discovery and design of Fe-Co-Zr magnets with tunable magnetic anisotropy through machine learning and parallel computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rare earth (RE)-free permanent magnets, as alternative substitutes for RE-containing magnets for sustainable energy technologies and modern electronics, have attracted considerable interest. We performed a comprehensive search for new hard magnetic materials in the ternary Fe-Co-Zr space by leveraging a scalable, machine learning-assisted materials discovery framework running on GPU-enabled exascale computing resources. This framework integrates crystal graph convolutional neural network (CGCNN) machine learning (ML) method with first-principles calculations to efficiently navigate the vast composition-structure space. The efficiency and accuracy of the ML approach enable us to reveal 9 new thermodynamically stable ternary Fe-Co-Zr compounds and 81 promising low-energy metastable phases with their formation energies within 0.1 eV/atom above the convex hull. The predicted compounds span a wide range of crystal symmetries and magnetic behaviors, providing a rich platform for tuning functional properties. Based on the analysis of site-specific magnetic properties, we show that the Fe6Co17Zr6 compound obtained from our ML discovery can be further optimized by chemical doping. Chemical substitutions lead to a ternary Fe5Co18Zr6 phase with a strong anisotropy of K1 = 1.1 MJ/m3, and a stable quaternary magnetic Fe5Co16Zr6Mn4 compound.</description>

      <title>Alter-Piezoresponse in Two-Dimensional Lieb-Lattice Altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnetism, featuring alternating spin structures in reciprocal space, has sparked growing interest. Here, we predict novel real-space alternative piezomagnetic and piezoelectric responses in an emerging altermagnetic family of Lieb lattices, specifically transition-metal chalcogenides M2WS4 (M = Mn, Fe, Co). The unique S4T crystal-spin symmetry leads to distinct magnetic and electric responses depending on the direction of applied stress. When subjected to axial stress, they exhibit a giant piezomagnetic response, which is about one to two orders of magnitude larger than that of most piezomagnetic materials, while the residual C2 symmetry suppresses the piezoelectric effect. In contrast, diagonal stress induces an imbalance of oppositely aligned electric dipole moments and a significant piezoelectric response, while in-plane mirror symmetry inhibits the piezomagnetic effect. This alternative piezoresponse offers an unprecedented opportunity to precisely control electric and magnetic properties independently, opening new avenues for altermagnetic materials in high-fidelity multifunctional memory and sensor applications.</description>

      <title>Determining Exciton Binding Energy and Reduced Effective Mass in Metal Tri-Halide Perovskites from Optical and Impedance Spectroscopy Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate determination of the exciton binding energy and reduced effective mass in halide perovskites is of utmost importance for the selective design of optoelectronic devices. Although these properties are currently determined by several spectroscopic techniques, complementary theoretical models are often required to bridge macroscopic and microscopic properties. Here, we present a novel method to determine these quantities while fully accounting for polarization effects due to carrier interactions with longitudinal optical phonons. Our approach estimates the exciton-polaron binding energy from optical absorption measurements using a recently developed Elliott based Band Fluctuations model. The reduced effective mass is obtained via the Pollmann-Buttner exciton-polaron model, which is based on the Frohlich polaron framework, where the strength of the electron-phonon interaction arises from changes in the dielectric properties. The procedure is applied to the family of perovskites ABX3 (A = MA, FA, Cs; B = Pb; X = I, Br, Cl), showing excellent agreement with high field magnetoabsorption and other optical-resolved techniques. The results suggest that the Pollmann-Buttner model offers a robust and novel approach for determining the reduced effective mass in metal tri-halide perovskites and other polar materials exhibiting free exciton bands.</description>

      <title>Unconventional superlattice ordering in intercalated transition metal dichalcogenide V$_{1/3}$NbS$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay between symmetry and topology in magnetic materials makes it possible to engineer exotic phases and technologically useful properties. A key requirement for these pursuits is achieving control over local crystallographic and magnetic structure, usually through sample morphology (such as synthesis of bulk crystals versus thin-films) and application of magnetic or electric fields. Here we show that V$_{1/3}$NbS$_2$ can be crystallized in two ordered superlattices, distinguished by the periodicity of out-of-plane magnetic intercalants. Whereas one of these structures is metallic and displays the hallmarks of altermagnetism, the other superlattice, which has not been isolated before in this family of intercalation compounds, is a semimetallic noncollinear antiferromagnet that may enable access to topologically nontrivial properties. This observation of an unconventional superlattice structure establishes a powerful route for tailoring the tremendous array of magnetic and electronic behaviors hosted in related materials.</description>

      <title>Observation of Dual Spin Reorientation Transitions in Polycrystalline CeCr$_x$Fe$_{1-x}$O$_3$(x=0.33 and 0.67)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the magnetic behavior of polycrystalline CeCr$_x$Fe$_{1-x}$O$_3$ (x = 0, 0.33, 0.67, and 1) synthesized via solid state reaction. Rare earth orthoferrite and orthochromite materials are well known for exhibiting spin reorientation transitions. Cr$^{3+}$ doping in CeFeO$_3$ results in the unusual occurrence of two spin reorientation transitions, ${\Gamma}_4$(G$_x$, A$_y$, F$_z$) $\rightarrow$ ${\Gamma}_1$(A$_x$, G$_y$, C$_z$) near 230 K and ${\Gamma}_4$(G$_x$, A$_y$, F$_z$) $\rightarrow$ ${\Gamma}_2$(F$_x$, C$_y$, G$_z$) near 100 K. In addition, two N\'eel transitions are identified. The results indicate that CeCr$_x$Fe$_{1-x}$O$_3$ offers a rich collection of magnetic behaviors with application potential for spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Detecting secondary-phase in bainite microstructure through deep-learning based single-shot approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relating properties and processing conditions to multiphase microstructures begins with identifying the constituent phases. In bainite, distinguishing the secondary phases is an arduous task, owing to their intricate morphology. In this work, deep-learning techniques deployed as object-detection algorithms are extended to realise martensite-austenite (MA) islands in bainite microstructures, which noticeably affect their mechanical properties. Having explored different techniques, an extensively trained regression-based algorithm is developed to identify the MA islands. This approach effectively detects the secondary phases in a single-shot framework without altering the micrograph dimensions. The identified technique enables scalable, automated detection of secondary phase in bainitic steels. This extension of the detection algorithm is suitably prefaced by an analysis exposing the inadequacy of conventional classification approaches in relating the processing conditions and composition to the bainite microstructures with secondary phases.</description>

      <title>Strain-Induced Non-alter Compensated Magnet and Its Application to Magnetic Tunnel Junction Device Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent proposal of altermagnetism has drawn widespread attention to antiferromagnet (AFM) exhibiting spin splitting, extending beyond the realm of sign-alternating spin splitting in momentum space protected solely by rotational symmetry. Herrin, we propose a shear-strain strategy that enables significant modulation of d-wave altermagnets into an non-alter compensated magnets. A comprehensive analysis combining the magnetic moment compensation characteristics of opposite spin sublattices with the distribution of spin-resolved conduction channels in momentum space under the [001] crystal orientation reveals that shear strain breaks the rotational symmetry of alternatmagnets. To explore the application potential of non-alter compensated magnets, we designe RuO2/TiO2/RuO2 magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJ) with three crystallographic orientations ((001), (110), (100)) and investigated their transport properties under shear strain. This non-alter electronic structure not only enhances the tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) in spin-split paths of intrinsic RuO2 (226% to 431%) but also enables substantial TMR in spin-degenerate paths (from 0-88%)). Our work provides guidelines for broadening magnetic materials and device platforms.</description>

      <title>Dislocation Engineering: A New Key to Enhancing Ceramic Performances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dislocations are line defects in crystalline solids and often exert a significant influence on the mechanical properties of metals. Recently, there has been a growing interest in using dislocations in ceramics to enhance materials performance. However, dislocation engineering has frequently been deemed uncommon in ceramics owing to the brittle nature of ceramics. Contradicting this conventional view, various approaches have been used to introduce dislocations into ceramic materials without crack formation, thereby paving the way for controlled ceramics performance. However, the influence of dislocations on functional properties is equally complicated owing to the intricate structure of ceramic materials. Furthermore, despite numerous experiments and simulations investigating dislocation-controlled properties in ceramics, comprehensive reviews summarizing the effects of dislocations on ceramics are still lacking. This review focuses on some representative dislocation-controlled properties of ceramic materials, including mechanical and some key functional properties, such as transport, ferroelectricity, thermal conductivity, and superconducting properties. A brief integration of dislocations in ceramic is anticipated to offer new insights for the advancement of dislocation engineering across various disciplines.</description>

      <title>Size-Dependent Tensile Behavior of Nanocrystalline HfNbTaTiZr High-Entropy Alloy: Roles of Solid-Solution and Short-Range Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the size-dependent mechanical behavior of the HfNbTaTiZr refractory high-entropy alloy (RHEA) under uniaxial tension, with a focus on the effects of random solid-solution (RSS) and chemical short-range order (CSRO). A machine learning framework is developed to accelerate the parameterization of interatomic force fields (FFs), enabling molecular dynamics simulations of three nanocrystalline models: (i) a meta-atom (MA) mode representing the RHEA as a hypothetical sing-element system with averaged properties, (ii) a quinary RSS model with randomly distributed constituent atoms, and (iii) a Monte Carlo (MC) model with internal CSRO. The results reveal that RSS enhances strength, while CSRO reduces flow stress level but improves strain hardening and failure resistance. A transition from Hall-Petch (HP) strengthening to inverse Hall-Petch (IHP) softening is observed, with CSRO suppressing this transition. The underlying plastic mechanisms (i.e., dislocation slip, deformation twinning, phase transformation and grain boundary movements) are analyzed from both nanostructural and energetic perspectives. Theoretical models are established to describe the size-dependent yield strength and predict the critical grain size. Additionally, the contributions of different plastic mechanisms to the overall stress response are separately quantified. These findings provide new insights into the design and performance optimization of RHEAs through nanostructural engineering.</description>

      <title>Symmetry, microscopy and spectroscopy signatures of altermagnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnetism is a collinear compensated magnetically-ordered phase with a d, g or i-wave anisotropy and alternating spin polarization of the electronic structure in the position and momentum space. Its recent discovery was in part motivated by the research of compensated magnets towards highly scalable spintronic technologies. Simultaneously, altermagnetism shares the anisotropic higher-partial-wave nature of ordering with unconventional superfluid phases which have been at the forefront of research for the past several decades. These examples illustrate the interest in altermagnetism from a broad range of science and technology perspectives. After summarizing the diverse research context, we turn the focus of this review to the symmetry, microscopy and spectroscopy signatures of altermagnetism. We start from the description of spontaneously broken and retained symmetries which delineate the compensated altermagnetic ordering as a distinct magnetic phase. Next we focus on microscopic signatures and ordering mechanism of the altermagnetic phase. We highlight crystal-structure realizations of a characteristic ferroic order of anisotropic higher-partial-wave components of atomic-scale spin densities in altermagnets, ranging from weakly-interacting metals to strongly correlated insulators. The symmetry and microscopy signatures of altermagnetism are directly reflected in spin-dependent electronic spectra and responses. We review salient band-structure features originating from the altermagnetic ordering, and from its interplay with spin-orbit coupling and topological phenomena. Throughout the review we compare altermagnetism to traditional ferromagnetism and Neel antiferromagntism, and to the currently intensely explored magnetic phases with non-collinear symmetry-protected compensated spin orders. We accompany the theoretical discussions by references to relevant experiments.</description>

Abstract: The ability to finely tune optoelectronic properties in semiconductors is crucial for the development of advanced technologies, ranging from photodetectors to photovoltaics. In this work, we propose a novel strategy to achieve such tunability by utilizing electric fields to excite low-energy polar optical phonon modes, which strongly couple to electronic states in anharmonic semiconductors. We conducted a high-throughput screening of over $10,000$ materials, focusing on centrosymmetric compounds with imaginary polar phonon modes and suitable band gaps, and identified $310$ promising candidates with potential for enhanced optoelectronic tunability. From this set, three perovskite-like compounds --Ag$_3$SBr, BaTiO$_3$, and PbHfO$_3$-- were selected for in-depth investigation based on their contrasting band-gap behavior with temperature. Using first-principles calculations, \textit{ab initio} molecular dynamics simulations, tight-binding models, and anharmonic Fr\"ohlich theory, we analyzed the underlying physical mechanisms. Our results show that polar phonon distortions can induce substantial band-gap modulations at ambient conditions, including reductions of up to $70\%$ in Ag$_3$SBr and increases of nearly $23\%$ in BaTiO$_3$, relative to values calculated at zero temperature, while PbHfO$_3$ exhibits minimal change. These contrasting responses arise from distinct electron-phonon coupling mechanisms and orbital hybridization at the band edges. This work establishes key design principles for harnessing polar lattice dynamics to engineer tunable optoelectronic properties, paving the way for adaptive technologies such as wavelength-selective optical devices and solar absorbers.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic properties of CrMnFeCoNi high entropy alloy at elevated electronic temperatures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Cantor alloy (equiatomic CrMnFeCoNi) is a high-entropy alloy with unique physical properties and radiation resistance. To model its response to intense laser pulses, the parameters of the electronic ensemble are required. In this work, the electronic heat capacity, thermal conductivity, and electron-phonon coupling strength at elevated electronic temperatures are evaluated using a combined approach that incorporates tight-binding molecular dynamics and the Boltzmann equation. The damage threshold fluence is estimated for a wide range of photon energies, from XUV to hard X-rays. It is found that at the electronic temperatures ~24,000 K (absorbed dose ~6 eV/atom), the Cantor alloy experiences nonthermal melting due to modification of the interatomic potential induced by electronic excitation, even without the increase of the atomic temperature. This effect must be included in reliable models of CrMnFeCoNi ablation under ultrafast laser irradiation.</description>

      <title>Topotactic phase transformation in correlated vanadium dioxide through oxygen vacancy ordering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling the insulator-metal transition (IMT) in correlated oxide system through oxygen vacancy ordering opens up a new paradigm for exploring exotic structural transformation and physical functionality. Oxygen vacancy serves as a powerful tuning knob for adjusting the IMT property in VO2, though driving topochemical reduction to V2O3 remains challenging due to structural incompatibility and competing phase instability. Here we unveil consecutive oxygen-vacancy-driven VO2-VO2-x-V2O3 topotactic phase transformation route with enticing facet-dependent anisotropy, engendering tunable IMT properties over an extended temperature range. Remarkably, topochemically reduced V2O3 inherits the crystallographic characteristics from parent VO2, enabling emergent lattice framework and IMT behavior inaccessible via direct epitaxial growth. Analogous electron doping arising from hydrogenation and oxygen vacancy contributes cooperatively to drive the Mott phase transition in VO2 through band-filling control. Our work not only unveils sequential topotactic phase transformations in VO2 through oxygen vacancy ordering but also provides fundamentally new insights for defect-mediated Mott transitions.</description>

      <title>Multiple Photon Field-induced Topological States in Bulk HgTe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong light-matter interactions can be exploited to modify properties of quantum materials both in and out of thermal equilibrium. Recent studies suggest electromagnetic fields in photonic structures can hybridize with condensed matter systems, resulting in photon field-dressed collective quantum states such as charge density waves, superconductivity, and ferroelectricity. Here, we show that photon fields in photonic structures, including optical cavities and waveguides, induce emergent topological phases in solids through polarization-mediated symmetry-breaking mechanisms. Using state-of-the-art quantum electrodynamic density functional theory (QEDFT) calculations, we demonstrate that strong light-matter coupling can reconfigure both the electronic and ionic structures of HgTe, driving the system into Weyl, nodal-line, or topological insulator phases. These phases depend on the relative orientation of the sample in the photonic structures, as well as the coupling strength. Unlike previously reported laser-driven phenomena with ultrashort lifetimes, the photon field-induced symmetry breaking arises from steady-state photon-matter hybridization, enabling multiple robust topological states to emerge. Our study demonstrates that vacuum fluctuations in photonic structures can be used to engineer material properties and realize rich topological phenomena in quantum materials on demand.</description>

      <title>First-Principles Insights into Excitonic and Electron-Phonon Effects in van der Waals Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the successful synthesis of isolated ZrS2 and HfS2 transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayers and inspired by their nearly identical lattice constants, we construct and investigate a vertical ZrS2/HfS2 van der Waals (vdW) heterostructure. Using first-principles calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) and many-body perturbation theory (MBPT), we explore its electronic, optical, and excitonic properties, with particular emphasis on excitonic effects and their temperature dependence. Based on the GW method, the ZrS2/HfS2 vdW heterostructure exhibits an indirect band gap of 2.60 eV with a Type-I band alignment. The optical gap of the heterostructure is found to be 2.64 eV, with an exciton binding energy of 0.71 eV, both reduced compared to those in the isolated monolayers. Moreover, we investigate the temperature-dependent optoelectronic behavior of the heterostructure, considering electron-phonon coupling. A zero-point renormalization of 0.04 eV in the direct band gap is observed. While the direct band gap decreases monotonically with temperature from 0 K to 400 K, the indirect band gap displays a non-monotonic trend. As a result, the absorption spectrum undergoes a meaningful redshift with increasing temperature. At room temperature, the optical gap of the heterostructure is reduced to 2.51 eV and the exciton binding energy to 0.63 eV. Our findings highlight the important role of electron-phonon interaction in the optoelectronic response of ZrS2/HfS2 vdW heterostructure, supporting its use in high-performance optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Soft Coulomb Gap Limits the Performance of Organic Thermoelectrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although consensus exists that the thermoelectric properties of doped organic semiconductors result from a complex interplay between a large number of mutually dependent factors, there is no consensus on which of these are dominant, or even on how to best describe the charge and energy transport. This holds particularly in the intermediate doping regime where the optimal performance is typically observed at the roll-off in the Seebeck coefficient - conductivity (S-{\sigma} correlation, fundamentally limiting the rational advancement of organic thermoelectric materials. Here, we combine experiments on a board set of conjugated polymers with kinetic Monte Carlo simulations across varying doping levels to uncover a general transport framework. We demonstrate that the optimal thermoelectric power factor (PF_max) consistently occurs at the transition between conventional variable-range hopping (VRH) and VRH in a density of states in which a soft Coulomb gap forms at the Fermi level, as described by Efros and Shklovskii (ES-VRH). This suggests the use of high dielectric constant materials or the promotion of charge delocalization as an avenue to shift the roll-off of the S-{\sigma}} curve, which constrains PF_max, to higher doping levels and accordingly higher PF.</description>

      <title>Topological Electronic and phononic chiral edge states in SiTc Crystal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological materials hosting multifold fermions and bosons have emerged as a rich platform for exploring unconventional quasiparticles and transport phenomena. In this work, we investigate the chiral crystal SiTc using first-principles density functional theory and symmetry-based analysis to explore its topological electronic and phononic properties. Our study identifies multiple high-fold degeneracies and topological nodes in both the electronic band structure and phonon dispersion. We have analyzed the impact of spin-orbit coupling on the evolution of band crossing and identified Weyl points and their associated chiralities. Surface electronic states, Fermi arcs, Berry curvature distributions, and intrinsic spin Hall conductivity are computed to probe the topological response. On the phononic side, we uncover topologically nontrivial bosonic modes and corresponding longest possible Fermi arc features. These results establish SiTc as a promising candidate that simultaneously hosts topological fermionic and bosonic excitations, offering new opportunities for investigating the interplay between electronic and phononic topology.</description>

      <title>Kerr microscopy study of magnetic domains and their dynamics in bulk Ni-Mn-Ga austenite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The observation of magnetic domains on austenite Ni-Mn-Ga bulk samples has been a big challenge for many years. Using advanced Kerr microscopy, with automatic compensation of the sample motion and monochromatic LED light we were able to observe magnetic domains and follow their evolution with magnetic field on the _100_ faces of an austenite bulk single crystal. After mechanical polishing variable fine stress-induced domains patterns were observed at different locations. The surface coercivity visualized by the Kerr loop was two orders higher than the bulk coercivity from magnetometry measurement. After additional electropolishing, wide 180 domains were observed with a width of about 50 micrometers and the Kerr loop coercivity decreased to the level determined from the magnetometry. Surprisingly, the magnetic domains were observed only along one of two _100_ cubic axes lying in the surface plane.</description>

      <title>Precise quantum-geometric electronic properties from first principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The calculation of quantum-geometric properties of Bloch electrons -- Berry curvature, quantum metric, orbital magnetic moment and effective mass -- was implemented in a pseudopotential plane-wave code. The starting point was the first derivative of the periodic part of the wavefunction psi_k with respect to the wavevector k. This was evaluated with perturbation theory by solving a Sternheimer equation, with special care taken to deal with degenerate levels. Comparison of effective masses obtained from perturbation theory for silicon and gallium arsenide with carefully-converged numerical second derivatives of band energies confirms the high precision of the method. Calculations of quantum-geometric quantities for gapped graphene were performed by adding a bespoke symmetry-breaking potential to first-principles graphene. As the two bands near the opened gap are reasonably isolated, the results could be compared with those obtained from an analytical two-band model, allowing to assess the strengths and limitations of such widely-used models. The final application was trigonal tellurium, where quantum-geometric quantities flip sign with chirality.</description>

      <title>Development and validation of an electron temperature-dependent interaction potential for silicon and copper for the use in atomistic simulations of laser ablation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laser pulses with a duration of the order of femtoseconds lead to a strong excitation, heating and potentially to ablation of the irradiated material. During the time of strong excitation, the interaction of the atoms and thus the material dynamics can be strongly altered. To take this effect into account, an ip was developed for copper that takes the excitation of the electrons into account up to an electron temperature of 1.2 eV. Furthermore, several ways to identify non-thermal effects in Density Functional Theory calculations and how to incorporate and validate them in molecular dynamics simulations are presented. Explicitly, the free energy curves, elastic constants and phonon spectra are compared. Additionally, it is shown that the change of the melting temperature with the degree of excitation is consistent with all of these properties. Moreover, the behaviour of copper upon excitation is compared to silicon by using a similar potential that was previously developed by a different author.</description>

      <title>Photonic obstructed atomic insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological quantum chemistry (TQC) classifies the topological phases by real-space invariant in which obstructed atomic insulators belong to the trivial case but sometimes show the feature of higher-order topological insulator. Here, for a two-dimensional magnetic photonic obstructed atomic insulator, we show that the emergence of corner states is associate with the Wyckoff positions. In such a square lattice with four +M elements and four -M elements, corner states appears when the superlattice exposes 2b Wyckoff positions. And the corner states will decrease when the number of exposed 2b Wyckoff positions decreases and disappear when 2b Wyckoff positions no longer stand at the edge. By arranging all magnetic rod into one magnetization direction, we find that time-reversal symmetry is not important for corner states. Our finding indicates that the real-space distribution of atoms determines the feature of higher-order topological insulators for obstructed atomic insulator in TQC.</description>

      <title>The Effects of Cobalt Doping on the Skyrmion Hosting Material Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$ has fascinating magnetic phases that can be easily manipulated through chemical doping. In this work, we report on the synthesis and characterization of Co-doped Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$ and its influence on both the atomic and magnetic structure. Polycrystalline (Cu$_{1_-x}$Co$_x$)$_2$OSeO$_3$ samples with 0 &lt; x &lt; 0.1 were synthesized and the presence of Co was confirmed via elemental analysis. Using synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction, and high-resolution neutron powder diffraction, the incorporation of Co$^{2+}$ into the Cu2 sites was confirmed. Co-doping led to an expansion to the unit cell but shows no apparent changes in bond lengths and angles in the crystal structure. Magnetization measurements showed that the incorporation of Co$^{2+}$ into the Cu2 site led to significant changes to the magnetic ordering of the material. Including an increase to the critical fields, the lowering of the critical temperature of the helimagnetic phase, and both a lowering and expansion of the skyrmion pocket temperatures. Lastly, small-angle neutron scattering was used to probe the magnetic structures hosted by the material. It was found that upon doping, the skyrmion lattice nucleates at lower temperatures as well as stabilized over a large temperature range. The observed results highlight the effects of incorporating a magnetic ion into the crystal structure and how it affects the internal magnetic structures.</description>

      <title>Density functional theory study of effect of NO annealing on electronic structures and carrier scattering properties of 4H-SiC(0001)/SiO$_2$ interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effect of the nitrided layer introduced by NO annealing on the electronic structure and carrier scattering property of the 4H-SiC(0001)/SiO$_2$ interface is investigated by the density functional theory calculation using the interface models where the areal N atom density corresponds to that in practical devices. The areal N atom density is one third of the areal C atom density in practical devices. It is found that the nitrided layer screens the unfavorable Coulomb interaction of O atoms in the SiO$_2$. However, the electrons flowing under the nitrided layer are significantly scattered by the fluctuation of potential due to the low areal N atom density. These results imply that the areal N atom density should be increased so that the fluctuation of potential is suppressed.</description>

      <title>High-Performance Ultra-Wide-Bandgap CaSnO3 Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing demand for high-voltage and high-power electronic applications has intensified the search for novel ultrawide bandgap (UWB) semiconductors. Alkaline earth stannates possess wide band gaps and exhibit the highest room-temperature electron mobilities among all perovskite oxides. Among this family, Calcium stannate (CaSnO3) has the largest band gap of ~4.7 eV, holding great promise for high-power applications. However, the demonstration of CaSnO3 power electronic devices is so far limited. In this work, high-performance metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) devices based on La-doped CaSnO3 are demonstrated for the first time. The MOSFETs exhibit an on/off ratio exceeding 10^8, along with field-effect mobility of 8.4 cm2 V-1 s-1 and on-state current of 30 mA mm-1. The high performance of the CaSnO3 MOSFET devices can be ascribed to the excellent metal-to-semiconductor contact resistance of 0.73 k{\Omega}{\mu}m. The devices also show great potential for harsh environment operations, as high-temperature operations up to 400 K have been demonstrated. An off-state breakdown voltage of 1660 V is achieved, with a breakdown field of ~8.3 MV cm-1 among the highest reported for all UWB semiconductors. This work represents significant progress toward realizing the practical application of CaSnO3 in future high-voltage power electronic technologies.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of hydrogen absorption and hypervalent metal hydride formation in lanthanum using cryogenic ball milling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rare earth superhydrides exhibit high temperature superconductivity but are difficult to characterize and use in applications due to their high formation and stability pressures, which are typically in excess of 100 GPa. We studied how modification of the rare earth precursor improves hydrogen reactivity and hydrogen uptake for forming such metal hydrides at lower pressures. An elemental lanthanum precursor was milled at liquid nitrogen temperatures for different time intervals. After exposure to gaseous hydrogen at 380 C and 100 bar, we found a systematic enhancement of hydrogen absorption with increasing ball milling time for forming the LaHx, x=2-3 phase. Exposing the precursor to pressures up to 60 GPa with an ammonia borane (BNH6) hydrogen source resulted in a hypervalent LaH4 phase. This LaH4 phase is associated with the suppression of a rhombohedral distortion of the Fm3-m cubic structure after cryomilling the precursor.</description>

      <title>Half-metallicity and anomalous Slater-Pauling behaviour in half-Heusler CrMnSb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study provides a first-principles insight into half-Heusler CrMnSb to understand its deviation from the conventional Slater-Pauling semiconducting behavior. CrMnSb, having a valence electron count of 18, has been proposed to exhibit compensated ferrimagnetic character instead of the expected nonmagnetic semiconducting ground state. As half-Heusler systems with a valence electron count of 18 are not known to exhibit magnetic ordering, we have investigated the electronic and magnetic properties of CrMnSb using a combination of density functional theory and Green's function-based multiple-scattering theory. We show that, despite satisfying the 18 valence electron Slater-Pauling rule, CrMnSb does not exhibit ground-state nonmagnetic semiconducting behavior. Instead, it reveals a half-metallic, fully compensated ferrimagnetic ground state. This anomaly originates from the presence of localized sublattice moments, resulting from antiparallel alignment between Cr and Mn sublattices, which enforces half-metallic ferrimagnetism despite its ideal 18 valence electron count.</description>

      <title>Piezoelectric truss metamaterials: data-driven design and additive manufacturing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the development of active animate materials, electromechanical coupling is highly attractive to realize mechanoresponsive functionality. Piezoelectricity is the most utilized electromechanical phenomenon due to the wide availability of materials that display precise and reliable coupling. However, the inherent directionality of these materials is constrained by the symmetry of their crystal structure, which limits the choice of available properties in natural piezoelectric materials. A solution to alleviate this limitation could be to leverage geometry or architecture at the mesoscale. Here, we present an integrated framework to design and 3D-print piezoelectric truss metamaterials with customizable anisotropic responses. To explore the vast design space of truss metamaterials, we employ generative machine learning to optimize the topology and geometry of truss lattices and achieve target piezoelectricity. Then, we develop an in-gel-3D printing method to fabricate polymer-ceramic piezoelectric truss metamaterial structures using a composite slurry of photo-curable resin and lead-free piezoelectric particles. The ML framework discovers designs exhibiting unconventional behaviors, including auxetic, unidirectional, and omnidirectional piezoelectricity, while the additive manufacturing technique ensures shaping freedom and precision in fabricating these metamaterials at small scales. Our results show an improvement of over 48% in the specific hydrostatic piezoelectric coefficient in optimized metamaterials over bulk lead zirconate titanate (PZT). We successfully achieved metamaterials with higher transverse piezoelectric coupling coefficient than its longitudinal coefficient, which is a phenomenon that is rare in bulk materials. Our approach enables customizable piezoelectric responses and paves the way towards the development of a new generation of electro-active animate materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study focuses on the synthesis and characterization of advanced polymeric composite electrospun nanofibers (NFs) containing magnetic oxide nanoparticles (NPs). By leveraging the method of electrospinning, the research aims to investigate polymer composites with enhanced interfacial properties, improved double-layer capacitance, and adequate biocompatibility. Electrospun polyacrylonitrile (PAN) NFs embedded with Fe2O3 and MnZn ferrite NPs were comprehensively characterized using advanced techniques, i.e., Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), high-resolution scanning electron microscopy (HR-SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and alternating gradient field magnetometry (AGFM). The incorporation of metal oxide NPs led to significant changes in the thermal, spectroscopic, and morphological properties of the NFs. XPS analysis confirmed increased oxidation, graphitic carbon content, and the formation of new nitrogen functionalities after heat treatment. Furthermore, interactions between nitrile groups and metal ions were observed, indicating the influence of nanoparticles on surface chemistry. Magnetic characterization demonstrated the potential of these composite NFs to generate magnetic fields for biomedical manipulation. Cytocompatibility studies revealed no significant impact on the viability or morphology of human mesenchymal stromal cells, highlighting their biocompatibility. These findings suggest the promising use of PAN-magnetic NFs in applications including targeted drug administration, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and magnetic hyperthermia for cancer treatment.</description>

      <title>Ultra-High-Temperature Vacuum Prober for Electrical and Thermal Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop an ultra-high-temperature vacuum probe station (UHT-VPS) featuring a sample holder heated by thermal radiation from a silicon carbide heater. This contactless configuration electrically isolates the sample from the high-power heating source through a vacuum gap, ensuring reliable measurements under extreme conditions. The capability of this UHT-VPS to measure electrical signals from 30 nV upward on bulk sapphire is demonstrated using the 3w/2w method. Measurements are continuously operated from 300 to 1150 K, under high vacuum, for a total of about 66 hours without readjusting the contact. They yield the linear and quadratic temperature coefficients of resistance of chromium/platinum micro-resistances, as well as the sapphire's thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity. By recording the heater and sensor temperature signals up to 30 kHz and fitting them with theoretical models that account for the quadratic TCR of Cr/Pt microwires, we obtain values in agreement with literature data obtained by optical methods. In this temperature range, we also measure thermal conductivity, which cannot be directly accessed by optical techniques. Our system thus provides an effective solution for simultaneously retrieving the electrical and thermal properties of materials using a single set of 3w/2w data up to unprecedented temperature levels.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Grazing incidence X-ray scattering experiments are designed to achieve strong scattering signals from materials, such as molecular monolayers, island films, or thin films that are localized to the surfaces of flat substrates. Optimal signals can be achieved with precise alignment of a substrate surface with the X-ray beam. Here, we outline a simple method that utilizes the area detector, generally available on such systems, to observe reflections from the sample to determine the sample-detector distance and the motor positions corresponding to the film being parallel to and centered in the beam. Observations of the reflected and transmitted beams are used to determine the critical angle of the sample and inform ideal motor angles that will lead to scattered X-ray intensity enhancement.</description>

      <title>Gigantic Harmonic Generation in N\'eel-Torque Antiferromagnetic Resonance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the resonant and higher-harmonic magnetic responses of a collinear antiferromagnet induced by N\'eel spin-orbit torques (NSOTs). By deriving the dynamical susceptibilities up to the third harmonic, we find remarkable NSOT-induced amplifications of the linear and nonlinear magnetic dynamics by orders of magnitude compared to conventional spin-orbit torques, enabling highly-efficient frequency conversion in the sub-terahertz frequency range. We then propose a multilayer antiferromagnetic nano-device leveraging the gigantic harmonic generation to achieve unprecedented frequency amplifiers and converters. Our work uncovers a previously overlooked role of the NSOTs in nonlinear dynamics.</description>

      <title>Insights into Ionic Diffusion in C-S-H Gel Pore from MD Simulations: Spatial Distributions, Energy Barriers, and Structural Descriptor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding transport behavior in nanoconfined environments is critical to many natural and engineering systems, including cementitious materials, yet its molecular-level mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were used to investigate Na+, Cl-, and water diffusion inside a 4 nm calcium-silicate-hydrate (C-S-H) pore channel over temperatures ranging from 300 K to 360 K. Spatially resolved analysis revealed strong suppression of diffusivity near the solid-liquid interface and gradual recovery toward the pore center. Arrhenius analysis further quantified the spatial variation of activation energy barriers and intrinsic mobilities across the pore channel, showing distinct confinement effects. The spatially resolved structural analysis uncovers a mechanistic transition from structure-controlled to hydrodynamics-controlled transport regimes with increasing distance from the pore surface. A structural descriptor, total coordination strength (TCS), was introduced, providing a predictive link between local liquid structure and molecular mobility within approximately 1 nm of the interface. Beyond 1 nm, suppressed diffusivities were well captured by an exponential decay model based on the Darcy-Brinkman framework. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first MD study to comprehensively resolve the spatial heterogeneity of transport, thermal kinetics, and structure within cementitious nanopores. These findings deepen the fundamental understanding of nanoscale transport phenomena and suggest that tailoring the nanochannel structure and interfacial chemistry of cementitious gels, such as surface coordination environments, pore size distributions, and adsorption sites, may offer a promising strategy to suppress ionic ingress and enhance the durability of cement-based materials.</description>

      <title>Quantitative electron beam-single atom interactions enabled by sub-20-pm precision targeting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability to probe and control matter at the picometer scale is essential for advancing quantum and energy technologies. Scanning transmission electron microscopy offers powerful capabilities for materials analysis and modification, but sample damage, drift, and scan distortions hinder single atom analysis and deterministic manipulation. Materials analysis and modification via electron-solid interactions could be transformed by precise electron delivery to a specified atomic location, maintaining the beam position despite drift, and minimizing collateral dose. Here we develop a fast, low-dose, sub-20-pm precision electron beam positioning technique, atomic lock-on, (ALO), which offers the ability to position the beam on a specific atomic column without previously irradiating that column. We use this technique to lock onto the same selected atomic location to repeatedly measure its weak electron energy loss signal despite sample drift. Moreover, we quantitatively measure electron beam matter interactions of single atomic events with microsecond time resolution. This enables us to observe single atom dynamics such as atomic bistability in the electron microscope, revealing partially bonded atomic configurations and recapture phenomena. We discuss the prospects for high-precision measurements and deterministic control of matter for quantum technologies using electron microscopy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The unique physical properties of altermagnets, when transplanted to photonic systems, are anticipated to offer a new degree of freedom for engineering electromagnetic waves. Here, we show that a photonic analogue of altermagnetism can be mimicked in photonic crystals, where engineered photonic crystals can host spin space group symmetries. Our approach allows for the creation of spin-split bands and the corresponding transport properties provide an effective platform for circularly polarized light isolation without the need of geometrodynamic spin-orbit interaction. Beyond the concurrent solid-state materials, we anticipate our work to offer photonic crystals as a versatile platform to test the spin-split band properties and inspire optical designs for photospintronic applications.</description>

      <title>High-mobility heavy quasiparticles in a van der Waals antiferromagnetic dense Kondo lattice CeTe$_3$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional van der Waals (vdW) materials exhibit high carrier mobility and tunability, making them suitable for low-power, high-performance electronic and spintronic applications. Incorporating narrow-band electronic correlation effects could further promote tunability, though mass renormalization may impact carrier mobility. It is therefore challenging to identify a vdW material with both high mobility and strong correlation. Herein, by a combination of optical spectroscopy and high-field quantum-oscillation measurements, we observe significant effective-mass enhancement in CeTe$_3$ at low temperature, arising from not only the band-structure modulation by antiferromagnetic ordering but also the narrow-band correlation effect. Despite the mass enhancement, the quantum mobility surprisingly \textit{increases} and reaches $\sim$2403 cm$^2$/Vs, likely benefiting from topological protection. Remarkably, these unique properties are maintained in atomically thin nanoflakes with quantum mobility enhanced to $\sim$3158 cm$^2$/Vs. Thus, CeTe$_3$ emerges as a promising vdW antiferromagnetic metal with high-mobility heavy quasiparticles, potentially unlocking new device concepts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetized charge-neutral graphene supports collective hybrid electronic excitations - polaritons - which have quantum origin. In contrast to polaritons in doped graphene, which arise from intraband electronic transitions, those in charge-neutral graphene originate from interband transitions between Landau levels, enabled by the applied magnetic field. Control of such quantum polaritons and shaping their wavefronts remains totally unexplored. Here we design an artificial two-dimensional quantum material formed by charge-neutral graphene nanoribbons exposed to an external magnetic field. In such metasurface, quantum polaritons acquire a hyperbolic dispersion. We find that the topology of the isofrequency curves of quantum hyperbolic magnetoexciton polaritons excited in this quantum material can change, so that the shape of isofrequency curves transforms from a closed to open one by tuning the external magnetic field strength. At the topological transition, we observe canalization phenomena, consisting of the propagation of all the polaritonic plane waves in the continuum along the same direction when excited by a point source. From a general perspective, our fundamental findings introduce a novel type of actively-tunable quantum polaritons with hyperbolic dispersion and can be further generalized to other types of quantum materials and polaritons in them. In practice, quantum hyperbolic polaritons can be used for applications related to quantum sensing and computing.</description>

      <title>Pressure and doping effects on the electronic structure and magnetism of the single-layer nickelate La$_2$NiO$_4$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: La$_2$NiO$_4$ is a prototypical member of the Ruddlesden-Popper nickelate series that offers a valuable reference point for elucidating the key ingredients behind the intriguing properties of these systems. However, the structural and electronic properties of La$_2$NiO$_4$ under pressure and doping remain surprisingly underexplored. Here, we investigate these properties using density-functional-theory calculations. We find that its tetragonal $I4/mmm$ structure can be stabilized, not only under comparatively low pressures of $\sim$ 8 GPa, but also at ambient pressure via the partial substitution of La with Ba. Moreover, we show that the combined effects of Ba substitution and pressure leads to qualitative changes in the electronic structure towards the formal $d^{7.5}$ configuration of the superconducting bilayer nickelates. Further, while La$_2$NiO$_4$ can undergo a insulator-metal transition with pressure retaining G-type antiferromagnetic order, La$_{1.5}$Ba$_{0.5}$NiO$_4$ exhibits metallic behavior with an enhanced competition between different magnetic states. Our results thus offer new insights into the interplay of structure, doping, and magnetism across the Ruddlesden-Popper nickelate series.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Scaling Laws of Dispersion Interactions in Anisotropic Nanostructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The van der Waals (vdW) dispersion interaction between two finite neutral objects typically follows the standard nonretarded $d^{-6}$ law. Here, we reveal an anomalous $d^{-10}$ scaling law between nanostructures with strong geometric or electric anisotropy, driven intrinsically by symmetry-restricted plasmon interactions. At finite anisotropy ratios, a scaling crossover from $d^{-10}$ to $d^{-6}$ occurs due to plasmon mode competition, marked by a finite critical separation. Furthermore, we demonstrate tunability of interlayer vdW forces in two-dimensional materials with strong in-plane electronic anisotropy. By pushing the conventional lower bound of vdW scaling laws, these findings open new opportunities for tailoring nanoscale forces, with potential applications in low-stiction nanomechanical devices, vdW superstructure assembly, metamaterials, and molecular simulations.</description>

      <title>Topological two-body interaction obstructing trivial ground states: an indicator of fractional Chern insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The search for candidate materials for fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) has mainly focused on the topological and geometrical structures of single-particle Chern bands. However, there are inherent limitations in approaches that neglect interaction effects, highlighting the need for complementary methods. In this work, we discuss how the Chern number defined for the effective interaction projected onto a Chern band is related to the stabilization of FCIs. Specifically, by formulating both the effective interaction and the two-particle problem using a common matrix, we establish a connection between the two-particle band structure and the effective interaction. This formulation allows us to characterize the effective interaction through the topology of the two-particle band. To investigate the relationship between topological effective interactions and FCIs, we perform numerical calculations primarily based on exact diagonalization. We find a notable correlation between the fact that the dominant two-particle bands carry a unit Chern number and the realization of a robust FCI at the filling fraction $\nu = 1/3$. This result is consistent with the presumed correspondence between pseudopotentials in the fractional quantum Hall effect and the two-particle band structure. From another perspective, our findings suggest that the topology inherent in the interaction itself can obstruct trivial ground states. We also discuss this in the context of scattering channels. Extending such topological two-body interactions could pave the way for realizing exotic states beyond FCIs.</description>

      <title>Anomalous enhancement of carrier mobility by remote phonons</title>

Abstract: Remote phonons from dielectrics are typically believed to degrade carrier mobility in adjacent semiconductors through Fr\"ohlich scattering of polar-optical phonons (POPs). Here, we challenge this conventional view by demonstrating that in van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures, remote POPs can instead enhance the mobility. To this end, we developed a first-principles computational framework to evaluate these remote phonon effects. Applying our approach to an example of monolayer InSe semiconductor encapsulated by h-BN dielectric layers, we show that electron mobility is enhanced due to coupling between POPs in InSe and h-BN, which gives rise to a new collective phonon mode where their individual Fr\"ohlich potentials partially cancel each other. Based on this insight, we further identified additional dielectrics that display similar mobility enhancement, demonstrating universality of mobility enhancement due to remote phonons. This work offers not only an effective computational method to evaluate the remote phonon effects but also new insights into mobility engineering in next-generation electronics.</description>

      <title>Quantum decoherence by magnetic fluctuations in a magnetic topological insulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03459v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In magnetic topological insulators, spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking by intrinsic magnetic order can gap the topological surface spectrum, resulting in exotic properties like axion electrodynamics, the quantum anomalous Hall effect, and other topological magnetoelectric responses. Understanding the magnetic order and its coupling to topological states is essential to harness these properties. Here, we leverage near-resonant magnetic dipole optical second harmonic generation to probe magnetic fluctuations in the candidate axion insulator EuSn$_2$(As,P)$_2$ across its antiferromagnetic phase boundary. We observe a pronounced dimensional crossover in the quantum decoherence induced by magnetic fluctuations, whereby two-dimensional in-plane ferromagnetic correlations at high temperatures give way to three-dimensional long-range order at the N\'eel temperature. We also observe the breaking of rotational symmetry within the long-range-ordered antiferromagnetic state and map out the resulting spatial domain structure. More generally, we demonstrate the unique capabilities of nonlinear optical spectroscopy to study quantum coherence and fluctuations in magnetic quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Non-reciprocity in magnon mediated charge-spin-orbital current interconversion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07044v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In magnetic systems, angular momentum is carried by spin and orbital degrees of freedom. Nonlocal devices, comprising heavy-metal nanowires on magnetic insulators like yttrium iron garnet (YIG), enable angular momentum transport via magnons. These magnons are polarized by spin accumulation at the interface through the spin Hall effect (SHE) and detected via the inverse SHE (iSHE). The processes are generally reciprocal, as demonstrated by comparable efficiencies when reversing injector and detector roles. However, introducing Ru, which enables the orbital Hall effect (OHE), disrupts this reciprocity. In our system, magnons polarized through combined SHE and OHE and detected via iSHE are 35% more efficient than the reverse process. We attribute this nonreciprocity to nonzero spin vorticity, resulting from varying electron drift velocities across the Pt/Ru interface. This study highlights the potential of orbital transport mechanisms in influencing angular momentum transport and efficiency in nonlocal spintronic devices.</description>

Abstract: Relying on the anharmonic special displacement method, we introduce an ab initio quasistatic polymorphous framework to describe local disorder, anharmonicity, and electron-phonon coupling in superionic conductors. Using the example of cubic Cu2Se, we show that positional polymorphism yields extremely overdamped anharmonic vibrations while preserving transverse acoustic phonons, consistent with experiments. We also demonstrate well-defined electronic band structures with large band gap openings due to polymorphism of 1.0 eV and calculate anharmonic electron-phonon renormalization, yielding band gap narrowing with increasing temperature in agreement with previous measurements. Our approach opens the way for efficient ab initio electronic structure calculations in superionic crystals to elucidate their compelling high figure-of-merit.</description>

      <title>Effective reduction in thermal conductivity by high-density dislocations in SrTiO3</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19430v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decreasing thermal conductivity is important for designing efficient thermoelectric devices. Traditional engineering strategies have focused on point defects and interface design. Recently, dislocations as line defects have emerged as a new tool for regulating thermal conductivity. In ceramics-based thermoelectric materials, the key challenge lies in achieving sufficiently high-density dislocations to effectively scatter phonons, as the typical dislocation density in ceramics after bulk deformation is constrained to 10 to the power of 12 per square meter. In this work, we adopted the mechanical imprinting method and achieved a dislocation density of 10 to the power of 15 per square meter in single-crystal SrTiO3, which is known for its room-temperature plasticity and acts as a promising material for thermoelectric applications. Using the time-domain thermoreflectance (TDTR) method, we measured about a 50% reduction in thermal conductivity over a broad temperature range (80 to 400 K) with the engineered high-density dislocations. These results suggest that tuning dislocations could offer a new path to minimizing thermal conductivity for engineering thermoelectric materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00574v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The structural, vibrational, electronic, and magnetic properties of inverse spinel $Co_2TiO_4$ (CTO-Sp) under high-pressure (HP) conditions are systematically investigated using X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, in situ optical microscopy, and first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations. At ambient conditions, CTO-Sp exhibits a cubic phase with a space group $Fd\bar{3}m$, and it undergoes two notable structural phase transitions at HP. The first transition, occurring at approximately 7.3 GPa, leads to the tetragonal-$I4_1/amd$ phase with minimal alteration in unit cell volume. {The second transition takes place near 17.3 GPa, where two orthorhombic phases emerge and coexist above this pressure.} This second structural transition corresponds to a first-order phase transition involving a significant reduction in unit cell volume of approximately 17.5$\%$. The bulk compressibility of CTO-Sp and its HP post-spinel phases is almost equal to the average polyhedral compressibility within each phase. DFT calculations reveal a high-spin to low-spin transition, accompanied by the collapse of local magnetic moments in the $Cmcm$ orthorhombic phase, leading to the sample's pressure-induced metallization.</description>

Abstract: Bare Si(100)-2$\times$1 surface atoms exhibit a buckled structure where one Si atom in a dimer is lowered while the other is raised, leading to two possible buckling configurations equivalent in energy. The relatively low energy barrier between these configurations allows dimers to flip rapidly and uncontrollably unless stabilized by surface defects or observed at low temperatures due to reduced thermal energy using Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM). This rapid flipping results in a time-averaged symmetric appearance under STM. In this study, we investigated variable length buckled dimer wires on the hydrogenated Si(100) surface composed of silicon dangling bonds for the first time. We demonstrate that on degenerate p-type silicon at 4.5 K, the rapid switching of these dimers can be frozen at low scanning biases. Such buckled wires can however be controllably flipped using a bias pulse. A line as long as 37 dimers was repeatedly uniformly flipped by a single pulse delivered near one terminus of the wire. The tip-directed flipping of a particular wire does not switch adjacent wires, suggesting binary wires can make well isolated rewritable binary memory elements. Furthermore, at sufficiently high biases switching generates telegraph noise that could be of utility for random number generation. The integration and encapsulation of these wires with previously described silicon dangling bond-made logic gates and binary wires might allow for self contained actuation and readout without requiring any role of an STM tip.</description>

Abstract: Understanding the non-equilibrium behavior of stainless steel under extreme electronic excitation remains a critical challenge for laser processing and radiation science. We employ a hybrid framework integrating density-functional tight binding, transport Monte Carlo, and Boltzmann equations to model austenitic stainless steel (Fe$_{0.5875}$Cr$_{0.25}$Mn$_{0.09}$Ni$_{0.07}$C$_{0.0025}$) under ultrafast irradiation. The developed approach uniquely bridges atomic-scale electronic dynamics and mesoscale material responses, enabling the quantitative mapping of electron-temperature-dependent properties (electronic heat capacity, thermal conductivity, and electron-phonon coupling) up to the the electronic temperatures Te~25,000 K. Two distinct lattice disordering mechanisms are identified: nonthermal melting at Te~10,000 K (the dose ~1.4 eV/atom), where the lattice collapses on sub-picosecond timescales without atomic heating driven by electronic excitation modifying the interatomic potential; and thermal melting (at ~0.45 eV/atom), induced by electron-phonon coupling on picosecond timescales. The derived parameters enable predictive modeling of stainless steel under extreme conditions, with implications for laser machining and radiation-resistant material design.</description>

Abstract: Silicon dioxide is a suitable material to encapsulate proteins at room temperature so that they can be analysed at the atomic level using laser-assisted atom probe tomography (La-APT). To achieve this goal, in this study we show that UV and deep UV lasers can achieve a high success rate in La-APT of silica in terms of chemical resolution and three-dimensional image volume, with both lasers providing comparable results. Since the La-APT analyses are driven by photon absorption, in order to understand the mechanisms behind the enhanced absorption of UV light, we performed density functional theory calculations to model the electronic and optical properties of amorphous silica matrices generated using a Monte Carlo approach to structural optimisation. In particular, we have investigated the role of various defects introduced during sample preparation, such as substitutional and interstitial carbon, sodium and gallium ions, and hydrogen. Our results show that the presence of defects increases the absorption of silica in the UV and deep-UV range and thus improves the La-APT capabilities of the material. However, due to the low density of free charge carriers resulting from the absorption of laser energy by defects, deviations from the nominal chemical composition and suboptimal chemical resolution may occur, potentially limiting the optimal acquisition of APT mass spectra.</description>

Abstract: We study a thin film yttrium iron garnet sample that exhibits magnetic stripe domains due to a small perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. Using wide-field magneto-optic Kerr effect measurements we reveal the domain pattern evolution as a function of applied field and discuss the role of the cubic anisotropy in the domain formation. Rich magnon spectra are observed in the stripe domain states, with a range of excitation conditions providing distinct spectra. The measurements are interpreted using micromagnetic simulations to provide the spatial profiles of each resonance mode. We further simulate domain patterns and resonance spectra accounting for the cubic anisotropy,with good correlation to experiment. This study highlights how non-collinear magnetic domain structures can host complex resonant behaviour in a low-damping magnetic material, with potential use in future magnonic applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22874v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most solar desalination efforts are photothermal: they evaporate water with ``black'' materials that absorb as much sunlight as possible. Such ``brine-boiling'' methods are limited by the high thermal mass of water, i.e., its capacity to store and release heat. Here, we study the light-enhanced evaporation by a hard, white, aluminum nitride wick, and propose a route to selectively target salt-water bonds instead of bulk heating via deep-UV interactions. Through experiments and analyses that isolate the effects of light absorption and heating in aluminum nitride, we provide experimental evidence of a light-driven, spectrum-selective path to non-photothermal saltwater evaporation. Leverage of these light-matter interactions in white ceramic wicks may achieve low-cost, low-energy desalination, reduce the heat island effects of traditional solar technologies, and contribute to new cooling technologies where drought is also a concern.</description>

Abstract: Mixed ionic-electronic conductors (MIECs) exhibit both high ionic and electronic conductivity to improve the battery performance. In this work, we investigate the mechanism and stability of transport channels in our recently developed MIEC material, amorphous Ti-doped lithium phosphorus sulfide (LPS), using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with a 99\% accurate machine-learning force field (MLFF) trained on \textit{ab-initio} MD data. The achieved MLFF helps efficient large-scale MD simulations on LPS with three Ti concentrations (10\%, 20\%, and 30\%) and six temperatures (25$^\mathrm{o}$C to 225$^\mathrm{o}$C) to calculate ionic conductivity, activation energy, Li-ion transport mechanism, and configurational entropy. Results show that ionic conductivities and activation energies are consistent with our recent experimental values. Moreover, Li-ion transport occurs via free-volume diffusion facilitated by the formation of disordered Li-S polyhedra. The enhanced stability of transport channels at 10\% and 20\% Ti doping, compared to 0\% and 30\%, is observed by analyzing the vibrational and configurational entropy of these disordered Li-S polyhedra. Overall, this study highlights the utility of MLFF-based large-scale MD simulations in explaining the transport mechanism and the stability of Li-ion in Ti-doped LPS electrolyte with significant computational efficiency.</description>

Abstract: 2D ferroelectric (FE) materials have opened new opportunities in non-volatile memories, computation and non-linear optics due to their robust polarization in the ultra-thin limit and inherent flexibility in device integration. Recently, interest has grown in the use of 2D FEs in electro-optics, demanding the exploration of their electronic and optical properties. In this work, we report the discovery of an unprecedented anomalous thickness-dependent change in refractive index, as large as $\delta n$ $\sim$ 23.2$\%$, in the 2D ferrielectric CuInP$_2$S$_6$, far above the ultra-thin limit, and at room temperature. Furthermore, CuInP$_2$S$_6$ exhibits a giant birefringence in the blue-ultraviolet regime, with a maximum $\vert n_{OOP} - n_{IP}\vert$ $\sim$ 1.24 at $t \sim$ 22 nm and $\lambda$ = 339.5 nm, which is, to the best of our knowledge, the largest of any known material in this wavelength regime. We relate changes in CuInP$_2$S$_6$ optical constants to changes in the Cu(I) FE polarization contribution, influenced by its ionic mobility, opening the door to electronic control of its optical response for use in photonics and electro-optics.</description>

      <title>Distinct element-specific nanoscale magnetization dynamics following ultrafast laser excitation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21473v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time-resolved ultrafast extreme ultraviolet (EUV) magnetic scattering is used to study laser-driven ultrafast magnetization dynamics of labyrinthine domains in a [Co/Ni/Pt] multilayer. Our measurements at the Co and Ni M-edges reveal distinct ultrafast distortions of the scattering pattern position and width for Ni compared to Co. Ni shows a strong modification of the scattering pattern, approximately 10 to 40 times stronger than Co. As distortions of the labyrinthine pattern in reciprocal space relate to the modification of domain textures in real space, significant differences in Co and Ni highlight a 3D distortion of the domain pattern in the far-from-equilibrium regime.</description>

      <title>Strain induced topological phase transitions in split and line graphs of bipartite lattices featuring flat bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11783v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, materials with topological flat bands have attracted significant attention due to their association with extraordinary transport properties and strongly correlated electrons. This includes phenomena such as high-temperature superconductivity, ferromagnetism, Wigner crystallization, and Mott-insulating behavior. Among these systems, two-dimensional (2D) materials are particularly compelling as they can host electronic states with unique band structures, such as dispersionless states alongside linearly dispersive Dirac cones. In this work, we use tight-binding models to comprehensively investigate a class of 2D lattices that generically support flat bands, and focus on the effects of strain on their electronic and topological properties. The studied lattices are constructed within a unifying graph-theoretic framework, whereupon split-graph and line-graph operations on bipartite square and hexagonal lattices are employed to generate new structures. In the absence of strain, the introduction of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) induces a bulk excitation gap, which transforms flat bands into quasi-flat bands with topologically nontrivial characteristics. By tuning system parameters and external strain, we observe the emergence of directional flat bands, and tilted and semi-Dirac cones. Remarkably, all lattices studied show phase transitions among trivial insulating, semimetallic, and topological phases. In addition to exploring understudied lattices, our contribution comprehensively analyzes the potential of strain engineering as a versatile tool for manipulating electronic and topological phases in a wide variety of 2D materials.</description>

      <title>A topology optimisation framework to design test specimens for one-shot identification or discovery of material models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12756v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The increasing availability of full-field displacement data from imaging techniques in experimental mechanics is determining a gradual shift in the paradigm of material model calibration and discovery, from using several simple-geometry tests towards a few, or even one single test with complicated geometry. The feasibility of such a "one-shot" calibration or discovery heavily relies upon the richness of the measured displacement data, i.e., their ability to probe the space of the state variables and the stress space (whereby the stresses depend on the constitutive law being sought) to an extent sufficient for an accurate and robust calibration or discovery process. The richness of the displacement data is in turn directly governed by the specimen geometry. In this paper, we propose a density-based topology optimisation framework to optimally design the geometry of the target specimen for calibration of an anisotropic elastic material model. To this end, we perform automatic, high-resolution specimen design by maximising the robustness of the solution of the inverse problem, i.e., the identified material parameters, given noisy displacement measurements from digital image correlation. We discuss the choice of the cost function and the design of the topology optimisation framework, and we analyse a range of optimised topologies generated for the identification of isotropic and anisotropic elastic responses.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the hyperpolarizability of crystals with quantum geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02660v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that higher-order electric susceptibilities in crystals can be enhanced and understood through nontrivial topological invariants and quantum geometry, using one-dimensional $\pi$-conjugated chains as representative model systems. First, we show that the crystalline-symmetry-protected topology of these chains imposes a lower bound on their quantum metric and hyperpolarizabilities. Second, we employ numerical simulations to reveal the tunability of nonlinear, quantum geometry-driven optical responses in various one-dimensional crystals in which band topology can be externally controlled. Third, we develop a semiclassical picture to deliver an intuitive understanding of these effects. Our findings offer a firm interpretation of otherwise elusive experimental observations of colossal hyperpolarizabilities and establish guidelines for designing topological materials of any dimensionality with enhanced nonlinear optical properties.</description>

      <title>Asynchronous mass inversion enriched quantum anomalous Hall states in multilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13229v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, multilayer graphene systems have attracted significant attention due to the discovery of a variety of intriguing phases, particularly quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) states. In rhombohedral pentalayer graphene (RPG), both QAH states with Chern number $C = -5$ and $C = -3$ have been observed. While the $C = -5$ QAH state is well understood, the origin of the $C = -3$ QAH state remains unclear. In this letter, we propose that the $C = -3$ QAH state, as well as the topological phase transition from $C = -3$ to $C = -5$ state in RPG, arises from an asynchronous mass inversion mechanism driven by the interplay between trigonal warping, staggered layer order, and the displacement field: Trigonal warping splits the low-energy bands of RPG into a central touching point and three satellite Dirac cones. Meanwhile, the coexistence of the staggered layer order and displacement field induces a momentum-dependent effective mass in the low-energy bands. Consequently, mass inversions at the central touching point and the satellite Dirac cones, induced by an increasing displacement field, can occur asynchronously, leading to the formation of the $C = -3$ QAH state and the topological phase transition from QAH state with $C=-3$ to $C=-5$. Additionally, based on this mechanism, we predict the presence of a $C=3$ QAH state in rhombohedral tetralayer graphene (RTG), which can be detected experimentally. Furthermore, this mechanism can also be applied to Bernal tetralayer graphene (BTG), explaining the origin of the observed $C=6$ QAH state.</description>

      <title>Sub-nm Curvature Unlocks Quantum Flexoelectricity in Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21996v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Flexoelectricity, polarization induced by strain gradients, is especially pronounced in two-dimensional (2D) materials due to their mechanical flexibility and sensitivity to mechanical deformation. In nanostructures with sub-nm curvature, this effect is governed by quantum-mechanical polarization and electrostatic modulation, not merely classical lattice distortion. Here, we present the first direct experimental and theoretical demonstration of large intrinsic quantum flexoelectricity in graphene nanowrinkles, exhibiting polarization densities (P_{th} ~ 4 C/m^{2}, P_{exp} ~ 1 C/m^{2}) that exceed those of mesoscale systems by 5 to 7 orders of magnitude. These nanowrinkles, with sub-nm radii of curvature at their apex, undergo atomic-level buckling and result in localized strain fields, as confirmed by sub-micron Raman spectroscopy. These curvatures create an asymmetry to {\pi}-orbital interactions across the atomic layer, which, in turn, leads to localized polarization densities. Kelvin probe force microscopy reveals curvature-dependent work function shifts consistent with flexoelectric polarization, while conductive atomic force microscopy detects reproducible flexoelectric currents exhibiting a threshold voltage ({\Phi}th ~1 V) that matches the band offset predicted by ab initio calculations (~1.2 V). Together, these results confirm how flexoelectric dipoles reshape the local electronic potential. Graphene nanowrinkles thus provide a pristine platform for uncovering quantum-mechanical flexoelectricity: a fundamentally ubiquitous effect, whose study in the simplest crystalline material can illuminate electromechanical behavior across condensed matter, soft matter, and biological systems.</description>

      <title>InGaN Nanopixel Arrays on Single Crystal GaN Substrate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11408v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Indium gallium nitride (InGaN) quantum well (QW) micro- and nanoscale light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are promising for next-generation ultrafast optical interconnects and augmented/virtual reality displays. However, scaling to nanoscale dimensions presents significant challenges, including enhanced nonradiative surface recombination, defect and/or dislocation-related emission degradation and nanoscale pixel contact formation. In this work, we demonstrate strain-engineered nanoscale blue LED pixels fabricated via top-down nanostructuring of an all-InGaN quantum well/barrier heterostructure grown by plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy (PAMBE) on significantly low dislocation-density single-crystal GaN substrates. Sidewall passivation using atomic layer deposition (ALD) of Al2O3 enables excellent diode behavior, including a high rectification ratio and extremely low reverse leakage. Monte Carlo analyses suggest almost 100% yield of completely dislocation-free active regions for 450 nm nanopixels. Electroluminescence measurements show bright blue emission with a peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 0.46%. Poisson Schrodinger simulations reveal partial strain relaxation in the QW, effectively mitigating the quantum confined Stark effect (QCSE). Additionally, finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations confirm that the nanoscale geometry enhances light extraction efficiency by over 40% compared to planar designs, independent of substrate materials. These results establish a scalable pathway for dislocation free, high-brightness InGaN microLED arrays suitable for advanced display and photonic systems.</description>

      <title>Nanoscale imaging of reduced forward bias at V-pits in green-emitting nitride LEDs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18025v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Record wall-plug efficiencies in long-wavelength, nitride light-emitting diodes (LEDs) have recently been achieved in devices containing high V-pit densities. Numerical modeling suggests this may be due to improved electrical efficiencies (EE). In order to test this proposition, a novel scanning tunneling luminescence microscope (STLM) is used to map the local optoelectronic properties of commercial, green-emitting LED heterostructures around V-pits with nanoscale spatial resolution. Using the STLM tip as the hole injector, injection at the lips of V-pits is found to be drastically different from injection on the heterostructure's c-plane. A $\approx$ 3-fold improvement in internal quantum efficiency near V-pits is observed at low injection, and at higher injection a $\approx$ 1.2 V reduction in the forward bias unambiguously confirms the EE hypothesis for hole injection.</description>

      <title>Site-polarized Mott phases competing with a correlated metal in twisted WSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22325v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Twisted WSe$_2$ hosts superconductivity, metal-insulator phase transitions, and field-controllable Fermi-liquid to non-Fermi-liquid transport properties. In this work, we use dynamical mean-field theory to provide a coherent understanding of the electronic correlations shaping the twisted WSe$_2$ phase diagram. We find a correlated metal competing with three distinct site-polarized correlated insulators; the competition is controlled by interlayer potential difference and interaction strength. The insulators are characterized by a strong differentiation between orbitals with respect to carrier concentration and effective correlation strength. Upon doping, a strong particle-hole asymmetry emerges, resulting from a Zaanen-Sawatzky-Allen-type charge-transfer mechanism. The associated charge-transfer physics and proximity to a van Hove singularity in the correlated metal sandwiched between two site-polarized insulators naturally explains the interlayer potential-driven metal-to-insulator transition, particle-hole asymmetry in transport, and the coherence-incoherence crossover in $3.65^\circ$ twisted WSe$_2$.</description>
