      <title>Sparse mean value estimates, algebraic number solution counting, and non-Archimedean Fourier analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate two applications of Fourier decoupling theorems over non-Archimedean local fields to real-variable problems. These include short mean value estimates for exponential sums, canonical-scale mean value estimates for exponential sums arising from phase functions with coefficients arising from the traces of powers of algebraic numbers, and solution counting bounds for Vinogradov systems whose indeterminates are families of algebraic numbers. We also record an example where real and $\mathfrak p$-adic decoupling estimates differ.</description>

      <title>Attainable Assouad-like dimensions of randomly generated Moran sets and measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the Assouad-like $\Phi$ dimensions of sets and measures that are constructed by a random weighted iterated function system of similarities. These dimensions are distinguished by the depth of the scales considered and thus provide more refined infomation about the local geometry/behaviour of a set or measure. The Assouad dimensions are important well-known examples. We determine the almost sure value of the upper and lower Assouad dimension of the random set. We also determine the range of attainable upper and lower (small) $\Phi$ dimensions of the measures, in both the situation where the probability weights can depend on the scaling factors and when they cannot. In the later case we find that there is a ``gap'' between the dimension of the set and the dimensions of the associated family of random measures.</description>

      <title>Full semiclassical asymptotics near transition points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00965v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct complete asymptotic expansions of solutions of the 1D semiclassical Schr\"odinger equation near transition points. There are three main novelties: (1) transition points of order $\kappa\geq 2$ (i.e.\ trapped points -- the simple turning point is $\kappa=1$, the simple pole is $\kappa=-1$) are handled, (2) various terms in the operator are allowed to have controlled singularities of a form compatible with the geometric structure of the problem (some applications are given in the text), and (3) the term-by-term differentiability of the expansions with respect to the semiclassical parameter is included. We prove that any solution to the semiclassical ODE with initial data of exponential type is of exponential-polyhomogeneous type on a suitable manifold-with-corners compactifying the $h\to 0^+$ regime. Consequently, such a solution has an atlas of full asymptotic expansions in terms of elementary functions, and these expansions are well-behaved. The Airy and Bessel functions show up in the expected way, as the asymptotic data at one boundary edge. We are able to handle cases that Langer--Olver could not because the framework of polyhomogeneous functions on manifolds-with-corners provides more flexibility (two matched $h\to 0^+$ expansions, possibly with logarithms, in this case) than that employed by Langer--Olver (one uniform $h\to 0^+$ expansion without logarithms). We work entirely in the $C^\infty$ category. No analyticity is ever assumed, nor proven.</description>

      <title>Maximality and completeness of orthogonal exponentials on the cube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12387v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is possible to have a packing by translates of a cube that is maximal (i.e.\ no other cube can be added without overlapping) but does not form a tiling. In the long running analogy of packing and tiling to orthogonality and completeness of exponentials on a domain, we pursue the question whether one can have maximal orthogonal sets of exponentials for a cube without them being complete. We prove that this is not possible in dimensions 1 and 2, but is possible in dimensions 3 and higher. We provide several examples of such maximal incomplete sets of exponentials, differing in size, and we raise relevant questions. We also show that even in dimension $1$ there are sets which are spectral (i.e. have a complete set of orthogonal exponentials) and yet they also possess maximal incomplete sets of orthogonal exponentials.</description>

      <title>Mutual Annihilation of Tiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16865v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given $A\subset\mathbb Z_n^2$, the purpose of this article is to investigate when is the difference set $\Delta A$ disjoint with the zero set of the Fourier transform of $A$. In the study of tiles in $\mathbb Z_n^2$, the author observed an interesting phenomenon that if $(A,B)$ is a tiling pair with $|A|=|B|$, then sometimes $(A,B)$ is also a spectral pair and vice versa. Moreover, in such cases actually one of the components would have universality (i.e., it is the universal spectrum/tiling complement for its tiling complements/spectra). It turns out that the disjointness is the critical property here, and shall be analyzed using the symplectic Fourier transform. Under such configuration it is shown that the phenomenon persists either (1) if $A$ is an order $n$ subgroup, or (2) if $n$ is a prime number and $A$ complements an order $n$ subgroup, or (3) if $n=p^2$, and $A$ complements the non-cyclic order $n$ subgroup. A side result binding number of elements in different subgroups is also given.</description>

      <title>Model agnostic signal encoding by leaky integrate and fire, performance and uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12994v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Integrate and fire is a resource efficient time-encoding mechanism that summarizes into a signed spike train those time intervals where a signal's charge exceeds a certain threshold. We analyze the IF encoder in terms of a very general notion of approximate bandwidth, which is shared by most commonly-used signal models. This complements results on exact encoding that may be overly adapted to a particular signal model. We take into account, possibly for the first time, the effect of uncertainty in the exact location of the spikes (as may arise by decimation), uncertainty of integration leakage (as may arise in realistic manufacturing), and boundary effects inherent to finite periods of exposure to the measurement device. The analysis is done by means of a concrete bandwidth-based Ansatz that can also be useful to initialize more sophisticated model specific reconstruction algorithms, and uses the earth mover's (Wassertein) distance to measure spike discrepancy.</description>

      <title>A numerical algorithm for computing the zeros of parabolic cylinder functions in the complex plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13085v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A numerical algorithm (implemented in Matlab) for computing the zeros of the parabolic cylinder function $U(a,z)$ in domains of the complex plane is presented. The algorithm uses accurate approximations to the first zero plus a highly efficient method based on a fourth-order fixed point method with the parabolic cylinder functions computed by Taylor series and carefully selected steps, to compute the rest of the zeros. For $|a|$ small, the asymptotic approximations are complemented with a few fixed point iterations requiring the evaluation of $U(a,z)$ and $U'(a,z)$ in the region where the complex zeros are located. Liouville-Green expansions are derived to enhance the performance of a computational scheme to evaluate $U(a,z)$ and $U'(a,z)$ in that region. Several tests show the accuracy and efficiency of the numerical algorithm.</description>
