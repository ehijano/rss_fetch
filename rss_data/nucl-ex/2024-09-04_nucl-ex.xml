      <title>Status report on long-time decay measurements of 137Cs radioisotope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The constancy of nuclear decay rates can be investigated via long-duration precision measurements. It is still an open question whether any (annual) modulation can be observed. Long-lasting nuclear decay rate measurements have been the subject of considerable research effort. A decay rate measurement with a 137Cs source is currently being conducted 30 meters below the ground at the J\'anossy Underground Research Laboratory (JURLab, Csilleb\'erc, Hungary) utilizing a High-purity Germanium (HPGe) detector. The laboratory is the low-radiation-background part of the Vesztergombi High Energy Laboratory (VLAB) on the KFKI campus, Csilleb\'erc, Hungary. From October 2022 to April 2024, data of 18 months' worth have been collected, providing a new opportunity to look for variations in decay rates. The experimental setup, data processing method, and the first results of this measurement are presented here.</description>

      <title>Strength measurement of the $E_{\alpha}^{lab}$ = 830 keV resonance in $^{22}\rm{Ne}(\alpha,n)^{25}\rm{Mg}$ reaction using a stilbene detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay between the $^{22}$Ne$(\alpha,\gamma)^{26}$Mg and the competing $^{22}$Ne$(\alpha,n)^{25}$Mg reactions determines the efficiency of the latter as a neutron source at the temperatures of stellar helium burning. In both cases, the rates are dominated by the $\alpha$-cluster resonance at 830 keV. This resonance plays a particularly important role in determining the strength of the neutron flux for both the weak and main $s$-process as well as the $n$-process. Recent experimental studies based on transfer reactions suggest that the neutron and $\gamma$-ray strengths for this resonance are approximately equal. In this study, the $^{22}$Ne$(\alpha,n)^{25}$Mg resonance strength has been remeasured and found to be similar to the previous direct studies. This reinforces an 830 keV resonance strength that is approximately a factor of three larger for the $^{22}$Ne$(\alpha,n)^{25}$Mg reaction than for the $^{22}$Ne$(\alpha,\gamma)^{26}$Mg reaction.</description>

      <title>Influence of incomplete fusion in $^{12}$C+$^{193}$Ir at $E_{lab}$ = 64-84 MeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Excitation functions of several evaporation residues populated via complete and/or incomplete fusion in $^{12}$C+$^{193}$Ir system have been measured at energies $\approx$ 64-84 MeV, and analyzed in the framework of theoretical model code PACE4. It has been found that the $xn$ channels are predominantly populated via complete fusion; however, some of the $pxn$ channels decay via their precursor. A significant enhancement has been observed in the case of $\alpha$-emitting channels over PACE4 calculations, indicating the onset of a reaction mechanism not included in this code, e.g., incomplete fusion. For better insights into the onset and influence of incomplete fusion, the percentage fraction of incomplete fusion has been deduced and analyzed in terms of different entrance-channel parameters. The findings of the present study underline the importance of projectile energy, entrance-channel mass-asymmetry, and the Coulomb factor of interacting partners. The impact of projectile break-up on complete fusion has also been discussed in the framework of the Universal Fusion Function, where suppression of $\approx$ 12$\%$ has been observed in the fusion function. The finding of the present work reinstates that the fusion suppression is affected by the projectile $\alpha$-break-up threshold.</description>

      <title>Charm Sivers function at EicC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Electron-Ion Collider in China (EicC) is pivotal in enhancing our knowledge of the internal structure of nucleons and nuclei, particularly through the study of transverse momentum-dependent parton distributions (TMDs). Among the leading-twist TMDs, the Sivers function is of particular interest, as it provides crucial insights into the spin and momentum structure of hadrons and plays a significant role in describing transverse single spin asymmetries (SSAs) in high-energy scatterings.
  In this study, we focus on the theoretical framework and phenomenological implications of the Sivers function in the context of small-x physics, where it is intricately connected to the spin-dependent QCD odderon, demonstrating that the SSA can be expressed in terms of transverse momentum-dependent factorization within the Color Glass Condensate effective theory. Furthermore, we present simulation results using PythiaeRHIC to assess the feasibility of measuring the charm quark Sivers function at EicC. The simulation outcomes suggest that EicC, with its unique kinematic coverage, offers distinct advantages for probing the Sivers function, which would provide compelling evidence for the existence of the elusive spin-dependent odderon.</description>

      <title>Density correlations under global and local charge conservation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a formalism to compute spatial $n$-point correlations of a conserved charge density in a large thermal system in the canonical ensemble, with explicit results presented up to 4th order. The resulting correlators contain local and balancing terms expressed through the grand-canonical susceptibilities for any equation of state. The new formalism is used to introduce a Gaussian local baryon number conservation in (spatial) rapidity in heavy-ion collisions at LHC conditions through a modulation of the balancing term. Connection to the widely used conservation volume $V_c = k dV/dy$ approach is established, indicating that the latter is appropriate for observables within $k/2$ units around midrapidity with $k \approx \sqrt{2\pi} \sigma_y$ with $\sigma_y$ being the Gaussian rapidity width of local baryon conservation. Analysis of the experimental data of the ALICE Collaboration on net proton cumulants in central Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = 5.02$ TeV constraints the range of local baryon conservation to $\sigma_{y} = 0.78^{+0.19}_{-0.16}$ units, equivalent to $V_c = (1.95^{+0.48}_{-0.39}) dV/dy$ in the conservation volume approach.</description>

      <title>Inclusive photoproduction of vector quarkonium in ultra-peripheral collisions at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the possibility of using ultra-peripheral proton-lead collisions at the LHC to study inclusive vector-quarkonium photoproduction, that occurs when a quasi-real photon emitted by a fully stripped lead ion breaks a proton to produce a vector quarkonium. Owing to the extremely large energies of the colliding hadrons circulating in the LHC, the range of accessible photon-nucleon centre-of-mass energies, W_gamma+p, largely exceeds what has been and will be studied at lepton-hadron colliders, HERA and the EIC. We perform a tune to HERA photoproduction data, use this tune to predict the yields of photoproduced J/psi, and estimate the corresponding transverse-momentum reach at LHC experiments. We also model the hadroproduction background and demonstrate that inclusive photoproduction can be isolated at the LHC from such background by imposing constraints on the hadronic activity in the lead-going direction at mid, forward, or far-forward rapidities depending on the capability of the detector under consideration. We find that the resulting cross sections are large enough to be measured by ALICE, ATLAS, CMS, and LHCb. We estimate the background-to-signal ratio after isolation to be of the order of 0.001 and 0.1 in the low and large transverse-momentum regions, respectively. In addition, we propose and assess the Jacquet-Blondel method to reconstruct the photon-nucleon centre-of-mass energy and the fractional energy of the quarkonium with respect to the photon.</description>

      <title>The ITS3 detector and physics reach of the LS3 ALICE Upgrade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: During Large Hadron Collider (LHC) Long Shutdown 3 (LS3) (2026-28), the ALICE experiment is replacing its inner-most three tracking layers by a new detector, Inner Tracking System 3. It will be based on newly developed wafer-scale monolithic active pixel sensors, which are bent into truly cylindrical layers and held in place by light mechanics made from carbon foam. Unprecedented low values of material budget (per layer) and closeness to interaction point (19 mm) lead to a factor two improvement in pointing resolutions from very low $p_\text{T}$ (O(100MeV/$c$)), achieving, for example, 20 ${\mu}$m and 15 ${\mu}$m in the transversal and longitudinal directions, respectively, for 1 GeV/c primary charged pions. After a successful R\&amp;D phase 2019-2023, which demonstrated the feasibility of this innovational detector, the final sensor and mechanics are being developed right now. This contribution will briefly review the conceptual design and the main R&amp;D achievements, as well as the current activities and road to completion and installation. It concludes with a projection of the improved physics performance, in particular for heavy-flavour hadrons, as well as for thermal dielectrons, that will come into reach with this new detector installed.</description>

      <title>Implications of first neutrino-induced nuclear recoil measurements in direct detection experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: PandaX-4T and XENONnT have recently reported the first measurement of nuclear recoils induced by the $^8$B solar neutrino flux, through the coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CE$\nu$NS) channel. As long anticipated, this is an important milestone for dark matter searches as well as for neutrino physics. This measurement means that these detectors have reached exposures such that searches for low mass, $\lesssim 10$ GeV dark matter cannot be analyzed using the background-free paradigm going forward. It also opens a new era for these detectors to be used as neutrino observatories. In this paper we assess the sensitivity of these new measurements to new physics in the neutrino sector. We focus on neutrino non-standard interactions (NSI) and show that -- despite the still moderately low statistical significance of the signals -- these data already provide valuable information. We find that limits on NSI from PandaX-4T and XENONnT measurements are comparable to those derived using combined COHERENT CsI and LAr data, as well as those including the latest Ge measurement. Furthermore, they provide sensitivity to pure $\tau$ flavor parameters that are not accessible using stopped-pion or reactor sources. With further improvements of statistical uncertainties as well as larger exposures, forthcoming data from these experiments will provide important, novel results for CE$\nu$NS-related physics.</description>

      <title>Measurement of flow coefficients in high-multiplicity $p$+Au, $d$+Au and $^{3}$He$+$Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{_{\mathrm{NN}}}}$=200 GeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07464v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Flow coefficients ($v_2$ and $v_3$) are measured in high-multiplicity $p$+Au, $d$+Au, and $^{3}$He$+$Au collisions at a center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s_{_{\mathrm{NN}}}}$ = 200 GeV using the STAR detector. The measurements are conducted using two-particle correlations with a pseudorapidity requirement of $|\eta| &lt;$ 0.9 and a pair gap of $|\Delta\eta|&gt;1.0$. The primary focus of this paper is on the analysis procedures and methods employed, especially the subtraction of non-flow contributions. Four well-established non-flow subtraction methods are applied to determine $v_n$, and their validity is verified using the HIJING event generator. The $v_n$ values are compared across the three collision systems at similar multiplicities, which allows for cancellation of final state effects and isolation of the impact of the initial geometry. While the $v_2$ values display differences among these collision systems, the $v_3$ values are largely similar, consistent with the expectations of subnucleon fluctuations in the initial geometry. The ordering of $v_n$ differs quantitatively from previous measurements obtained using two-particle correlations with a larger rapidity gap; this difference could be partially attributed to the effects of flow decorrelations in the rapidity direction.</description>

Abstract: The first systematic experimental study of the neutron-rich Br isotopes with two complementary state-of-the-art techniques is presented. These isotopes have been populated in the fission process at two different facilities, GANIL and ILL. New spectroscopic information has been obtained for odd-even $^{87-93}$Br isotopes and the experimental results have been compared with state-of-the-art Large-Scale Shell-Model and DNO Shell-Model calculations. As a result of such theoretical approaches, a transition from prolate ($^{87,89}$Br) to oblate ($^{91,93}$Br) shapes is obtained from the subtle balance between proton and neutron quadrupole deformations, as a clear signature of pseudo-SU3 quadrupole regime.</description>

      <title>New Spin Structure Constraints on Hyperfine Splitting and Proton Size</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18738v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The 1S hyperfine splitting in hydrogen is measured to an impressive ppt precision and will soon be measured to ppm precision in muonic hydrogen. The latter measurement will rely on theoretical predictions, which are limited by knowledge of the proton polarizability effect $\Delta_\text{pol}$. Data-driven evaluations of $\Delta_\text{pol}$ have long been in significant tension with baryon chiral perturbation theory. Here we present improved results for $\Delta_\text{pol}$ driven by new spin structure data, reducing the long-standing tension between theory and experiment and halving the dominating uncertainty in hyperfine splitting calculations.</description>

      <title>Seeing Beauty in the Quark-Gluon Plasma with Energy Correlators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.15110v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Heavy quarks created in heavy-ion collisions serve as an excellent probe of the produced quark-gluon plasma (QGP). The radiation pattern of jets formed from heavy quarks as they traverse the QGP exhibits a particularly interesting structure due to the interplay of two competing effects: the suppression of small-angle radiation, also known as the ``dead-cone'' effect, and the enhancement of emitted gluons by medium-induced radiation. In this Letter, we propose a new observable, based on the energy correlator approach to jet substructure, which will allow us to disentangle the two scales associated to these two phenomena and to determine under which conditions the dead-cone is filled by medium-induced radiation. Combined with the forthcoming high-statistics measurements of heavy-flavor jets, this work provides a novel tool to unravel the dynamics of the QGP.</description>

      <title>Field Theory of the Fermi Function</title>

Abstract: The Fermi function $F(Z,E)$ accounts for QED corrections to beta decays that are enhanced at either small electron velocity $\beta$ or large nuclear charge $Z$. For precision applications, the Fermi function must be combined with other radiative corrections and with scale- and scheme-dependent hadronic matrix elements. We formulate the Fermi function as a field theory object and present a new factorization formula for QED radiative corrections to beta decays. We provide new results for the anomalous dimension of the corresponding effective operator complete through three loops, and resum perturbative logarithms and $\pi$-enhancements with renormalization group methods. Our results are important for tests of fundamental physics with precision beta decay and related processes.</description>

      <title>Correlation between the charge radii difference in mirror partner nuclei and the symmetry energy slope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08982v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A correlation between the charge radii difference of mirror partner nuclei $\Delta{R_{\mathrm{ch}}}$ and the slope parameter $L$ of symmetry energy has been built to ascertain the equation of state of isospin asymmetric nuclear matter. In this work, the influences of pairing correlations and isoscalar compression modulus on the $\Delta{R_{\mathrm{ch}}}$ are systematically investigated based on the Skyrme energy density functional theory. The calculated results suggest that the linear correlation between $\Delta{R_{\mathrm{ch}}}$ and $L$ is decreased by the surface pairing correlations. The slope parameter deduced from the difference of charge radii of mirror-pair nuclei $^{32}$Ar-$^{32}$Si, $^{36}$Ca-$^{36}$S, $^{38}$Ca-$^{38}$Ar, and $^{54}$Ni-$^{54}$Fe falls into the range of $L$=42.57-50.64 MeV, that is, the rather soft equation of state of asymmetric nuclear matter. Besides, the range of the slope parameter can also be influenced by the effective forces classified by various isoscalar incompressibility coefficients.</description>

      <title>The environmental low-frequency background for macro-calorimeters at the millikelvin scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13602v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many of the most sensitive physics experiments searching for rare events, like neutrinoless double beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay and dark matter interactions, rely on cryogenic macro-calorimeters operating at the mK-scale. Located underground at the Gran Sasso National Laboratory (LNGS), in central Italy, CUORE (Cryogenic Underground Observatory for Rare Events) is one of the leading experiments for the search of $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay, implementing the low-temperature calorimetric technology. We present a novel multi-detector analysis to correlate environmental phenomena with the low-frequency noise of low-temperature calorimeters. Indeed, the correlation of marine and seismic data with data from a pair of CUORE detectors indicates that cryogenic detectors are sensitive not only to intense vibrations generated by earthquakes, but also to the much fainter vibrations induced by marine microseisms in the Mediterranean Sea due to the motion of sea waves. Proving that cryogenic macro-calorimeters are sensitive to such environmental sources of noise opens the possibility of studying their impact on the detectors physics-case sensitivity. Moreover, this study could pave the road for technology developments dedicated to the mitigation of the noise induced by marine microseisms, from which the entire community of cryogenic calorimeters can benefit.</description>

      <title>Calorimetry for the ePIC Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11075v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The EIC will deliver collisions of electrons with protons and nuclei at a wide variety of energies and at luminosities up to 1000 times higher than HERA. Precise measurement of both the scattered electron and the hadronic final state is crucial for the physics of the EIC, necessitating unique designs for the electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters in the backward, central, and forward regions. To ensure maximal containment of energy and acceptance for the required physics processes, the ePIC detector employs calorimetry over almost the entire polar angle. These proceedings provide an overview of the current calorimeter designs being employed in ePIC.</description>

      <title>Vertex correction to nuclear matrix elements of double-$\beta$ decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13254v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The predicted neutrinoless double-$\beta$ ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay is the crucial phenomenon to prove the existence of the Majorana neutrino, which gives a foundation to leptogenesis to explain the matter prevalence of the universe. The nuclear matrix element (NME) of $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay is an important theoretical quantity to determine the effective neutrino mass and help the detector design for the next generation of the $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay search. Reliable calculation of this NME is a long-standing problem because of the diversity of the predicted values of the NME. The main reason for this difficulty is that the effective strength of the Gamow-Teller transition operator $g_A$ for this decay is unknown. I will show the lowest-order vertex corrections for the $0\nu\beta\beta$ and the $2\nu\beta\beta$ NME of $^{136}$Xe in the framework of the hybrid application of the quantum field theory to the leptons and the Rayleigh-Schr\"{o}dinger perturbation to the nucleus. The unperturbed nuclear states are obtained by the quasiparticle random-phase approximation. These corrections reduce the $0\nu\beta\beta$ NME by 30%. The effective $g_A$ referring to this reduced NME is also obtained, and it is shown for the first time that the effective $g_A$ for the $0\nu\beta\beta$ NME is not quite different from that for the $2\nu\beta\beta$ NME; the difference is only 10%. This indicates the possibility that the phenomenological effective $g_A$ to reproduce the experimental half-life of the $2\nu\beta\beta$ decay can be approximately used for the calculation of the $0\nu\beta\beta$ NME.</description>
