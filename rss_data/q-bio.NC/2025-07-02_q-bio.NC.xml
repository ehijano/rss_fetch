      <title>Feature Integration Spaces: Joint Training Reveals Dual Encoding in Neural Network Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current sparse autoencoder (SAE) approaches to neural network interpretability assume that activations can be decomposed through linear superposition into sparse, interpretable features. Despite high reconstruction fidelity, SAEs consistently fail to eliminate polysemanticity and exhibit pathological behavioral errors. We propose that neural networks encode information in two complementary spaces compressed into the same substrate: feature identity and feature integration. To test this dual encoding hypothesis, we develop sequential and joint-training architectures to capture identity and integration patterns simultaneously. Joint training achieves 41.3% reconstruction improvement and 51.6% reduction in KL divergence errors. This architecture spontaneously develops bimodal feature organization: low squared norm features contributing to integration pathways and the rest contributing directly to the residual. Small nonlinear components (3% of parameters) achieve 16.5% standalone improvements, demonstrating parameter-efficient capture of computational relationships crucial for behavior. Additionally, intervention experiments using 2x2 factorial stimulus designs demonstrated that integration features exhibit selective sensitivity to experimental manipulations and produce systematic behavioral effects on model outputs, including significant interaction effects across semantic dimensions. This work provides systematic evidence for (1) dual encoding in neural representations, (2) meaningful nonlinearly encoded feature interactions, and (3) introduces an architectural paradigm shift from post-hoc feature analysis to integrated computational design, establishing foundations for next-generation SAEs.</description>

      <title>Mapping Brain-Behavior Correlations in Autism Using Heat Kernel Smoothing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a streamlined image analysis framework for correlating behavioral measures to anatomical measures on the cortex and detecting the regions of abnormal brain-behavior correlates. We correlated a facial emotion discrimination task score and its response time to cortical thickness measurements in a group of high functioning autistic subjects. Many previous correlation studies in brain imaging neglect to account for unwanted age effect and other variables and the subsequent statistical parametric maps may report spurious results. We demonstrate that the partial correlation mapping strategy proposed here can remove the effect of age and global cortical area difference effectively while localizing the regions of high correlation difference. The advantage of the proposed correlation mapping strategy over the general linear model framework is that we can directly visualize more intuitive correlation measures across the cortex in each group.</description>

      <title>Examining Reject Relations in Stimulus Equivalence Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulations offer a valuable tool for exploring stimulus equivalence (SE), yet the potential of reject relations to disrupt the assessment of equivalence class formation is contentious. This study investigates the role of reject relations in the acquisition of stimulus equivalence using computational models. We examined feedforward neural networks (FFNs), bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT), and generative pre-trained transformers (GPT) across 18 conditions in matching-to-sample (MTS) simulations. Conditions varied in training structure (linear series, one-to-many, and many-to-one), relation type (select-only, reject-only, and select-reject), and negative comparison selection (standard and biased). A probabilistic agent served as a benchmark, embodying purely associative learning. The primary goal was to determine whether artificial neural networks could demonstrate equivalence class formation or whether their performance reflected associative learning. Results showed that reject relations influenced agent performance. While some agents achieved high accuracy on equivalence tests, particularly with reject relations and biased negative comparisons, this performance was comparable to the probabilistic agent. These findings suggest that artificial neural networks, including transformer models, may rely on associative strategies rather than SE. This underscores the need for careful consideration of reject relations and more stringent criteria in computational models of equivalence.</description>

      <title>EEG-Based Auditory BCI for Communication in a Completely Locked-In Patient Using Volitional Frequency Band Modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in the completely locked-in state (CLIS) can lose all reliable motor control and are left without any means of communication. It remains unknown whether non-invasive electroencephalogram (EEG) based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) can support volitional communication in CLIS. Here, we show that a CLIS patient was able to operate an EEG-based BCI across multiple online sessions to respond to both general knowledge and personally relevant assistive questions. The patient delivered "Yes"/"No" responses by volitionally modulating alpha and beta band power at different channels, guided by real-time auditory feedback from the BCI. The patient communicated assistive needs above chance in all sessions, achieving a perfect score in the final session. Performance on general knowledge questions varied across sessions, with two sessions showing accurate and above-chance responses, while the first and last sessions remained at chance level. The patient also showed consistent modulation patterns over time. These findings suggest that non-invasive BCIs may offer a potential pathway for restoring basic communication in CLIS.</description>

      <title>Exploring Theory-Laden Observations in the Brain Basis of Emotional Experience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the science of emotion, it is widely assumed that folk emotion categories form a biological and psychological typology, and studies are routinely designed and analyzed to identify emotion-specific patterns. This approach shapes the observations that studies report, ultimately reinforcing the assumption that guided the investigation. Here, we reanalyzed data from one such typologically-guided study that reported mappings between individual brain patterns and group-averaged ratings of 34 emotion categories. Our reanalysis was guided by an alternative view of emotion categories as populations of variable, situated instances, and which predicts a priori that there will be significant variation in brain patterns within a category across instances. Correspondingly, our analysis made minimal assumptions about the structure of the variance present in the data. As predicted, we did not observe the original mappings and instead observed significant variation across individuals. These findings demonstrate how starting assumptions can ultimately impact scientific conclusions and suggest that a hypothesis must be supported using multiple analytic methods before it is taken seriously.</description>

      <title>Storing overlapping associative memories on latent manifolds in low-rank spiking networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17485v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Associative memory architectures such as the Hopfield network have long been important conceptual and theoretical models for neuroscience and artificial intelligence. However, translating these abstract models into spiking neural networks has been surprisingly difficult. Indeed, much previous work has been restricted to storing a small number of primarily non-overlapping memories in large networks, thereby limiting their scalability. Here, we revisit the associative memory problem in light of recent advances in understanding spike-based computation. Using a recently-established geometric framework, we show that the spiking activity for a large class of all-inhibitory networks is situated on a low-dimensional, convex, and piecewise-linear manifold, with dynamics that move along the manifold. We then map the associative memory problem onto these dynamics, and demonstrate how the vertices of a hypercubic manifold can be used to store stable, overlapping activity patterns with a direct correspondence to the original Hopfield model. We propose several learning rules, and demonstrate a linear scaling of the storage capacity with the number of neurons, as well as robust pattern completion abilities. Overall, this work serves as a case study to demonstrate the effectiveness of using a geometrical perspective to design dynamics on neural manifolds, with implications for neuroscience and machine learning.</description>
