      <title>Robust Econometrics for Growth-at-Risk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Growth-at-Risk (GaR) framework has garnered attention in recent econometric literature, yet current approaches implicitly assume a constant Pareto exponent. We introduce novel and robust econometrics to estimate the tails of GaR based on a rigorous theoretical framework and establish validity and effectiveness. Simulations demonstrate consistent outperformance relative to existing alternatives in terms of predictive accuracy. We perform a long-term GaR analysis that provides accurate and insightful predictions, effectively capturing financial anomalies better than current methods.</description>

      <title>Multi-Band Variable-Lag Granger Causality: A Unified Framework for Causal Time Series Inference across Frequencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding causal relationships in time series is fundamental to many domains, including neuroscience, economics, and behavioral science. Granger causality is one of the well-known techniques for inferring causality in time series. Typically, Granger causality frameworks have a strong fix-lag assumption between cause and effect, which is often unrealistic in complex systems. While recent work on variable-lag Granger causality (VLGC) addresses this limitation by allowing a cause to influence an effect with different time lags at each time point, it fails to account for the fact that causal interactions may vary not only in time delay but also across frequency bands. For example, in brain signals, alpha-band activity may influence another region with a shorter delay than slower delta-band oscillations. In this work, we formalize Multi-Band Variable-Lag Granger Causality (MB-VLGC) and propose a novel framework that generalizes traditional VLGC by explicitly modeling frequency-dependent causal delays. We provide a formal definition of MB-VLGC, demonstrate its theoretical soundness, and propose an efficient inference pipeline. Extensive experiments across multiple domains demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms existing methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets, confirming its broad applicability to any type of time series data. Code and datasets are publicly available.</description>

      <title>Electric vehicle pricing and battery costs: A misaligned assumption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00458v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although electric vehicles (EVs) are a climate friendly alternative to internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs), EV adoption is challenged by higher up-front procurement prices. Existing discourse attributes this price differential to high battery costs and reasons that lowering these costs will reduce EV upfront price differentials. However, other factors beyond battery price may influence prices. Leveraging data for over 400 EV models and trims sold in the United Sates between 2011-2023, we scrutinize these factors. We find that contrary to existing discourse, EV MSRP has increased over time despite declining EV battery costs. We attribute this increase to the growing accommodation of attributes that strongly influence EV prices but have long been underappreciated in mainstream discourse. Furthermore, and relevant to decarbonization efforts, we observe that continued reductions in pack-level battery costs are unlikely to deliver price parity between EVs and ICEVs. Were pack level battery costs reduced to zero, EV MSRP would decrease by $4,025, estimates that are insufficient to offset observed price differences between EVs and ICEVs. These findings warrant attention as decarbonization efforts increasingly emphasize EVs as a pathway for complying with domestic and international climate agreements.</description>

      <title>Invalid proxies and volatility changes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08753v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When in proxy-SVARs the covariance matrix of VAR disturbances is subject to exogenous, permanent breaks that cause IRFs to change across volatility regimes, even strong, exogenous external instruments yield inconsistent estimates of the dynamic causal effects. However, if these volatility shifts are properly incorporated into the analysis through (testable) "stability restrictions", we demonstrate that the target IRFs are point-identified and can be estimated consistently under a necessary and sufficient rank condition. If the shifts in volatility are sufficiently informative, standard asymptotic inference remains valid even with (i) local-to-zero covariance between the proxies and the instrumented structural shocks, and (ii) potential failures of instrument exogeneity. Intuitively, shifts in volatility act similarly to strong instruments that are correlated with both the target and non-target shocks. We illustrate the effectiveness of our approach by revisiting a seminal fiscal proxy-SVAR for the US economy. We detect a sharp change in the size of the tax multiplier when the narrative tax instrument is complemented with the decline in unconditional volatility observed during the transition from the Great Inflation to the Great Moderation. The narrative tax instrument contributes to identify the tax shock in both regimes, although our empirical analysis raises concerns about its "statistical" validity.</description>
