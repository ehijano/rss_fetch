      <title>Hubble's Multi-Year Search for Exospheres in the TRAPPIST-1 System Reveals Frequent Microflares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ly-$\alpha$ observations provide a powerful probe of stellar activity and atmospheric escape in exoplanetary systems. We present here an analysis of 104 HST/STIS orbits monitoring the TRAPPIST-1 system between 2017 and 2022, covering 3--5 transits for each of its seven planets. We rule out transit depths $\gtrsim20\%$, which translates into an upper limit on the escape rate of $1064~EO_H$/Gyr for planet b ($1~EO_H$ is the Earth-ocean-equivalent hydrogen content), in agreement with recent claims that planet b should be airless. These upper limits are $\sim$3 times larger than expected from the photon noise due to a large baseline scatter, which we ultimately link to TRAPPIST-1's intrinsic Ly-$\alpha$ variability from frequent ``microflares.'' While JWST observations of TRAPPIST-1 in the near infrared have shown that $\sim10^{30}$-erg flares occur every $\sim$6 hours, we report here $\sim10^{29}$-erg flares on sub-hour timescales in the HST/STIS and also Very Large Telescope (VLT) $g^{'}$ observations. The FUV and optical amplitudes ($\sim$400$\%$ vs $\sim$3$\%$, respectively) for flares with similar waiting-times indicate flare temperatures of 11000$^{+4200}_{-3100}$~K over 0.011$^{+0.03}_{-0.01}$\% of the stellar disk. Finally, our multi-year baseline reveals a variability with $P = 3.27 \pm 0.04$ days, providing further validation of the previously reported 3.295-day rotation period for TRAPPIST-1. These results highlight the importance of accounting for stellar microvariability when searching for exospheres around active M dwarfs.</description>

      <title>The Detection-vs-Retrieval Challenge: Titan as an Exoplanet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cassini's observations of Titan's atmosphere are exemplary benchmarks for exoplanet atmospheric studies owing to (1) their precision and (2) our independent knowledge of Titan. Leveraging these observations, we perform retrievals (i.e., analyses) of Titan's transmission spectrum to investigate the strengths/limitations of exoplanet atmospheric retrievals with a particular focus on the underlying assumptions regarding the molecular species included in the retrieval. We find that multiple hydrocarbons can be ``retrieved'' depending on the selection made ahead of a retrieval. More importantly, we find that the estimates of other parameters such as the abundance of key absorbers like methane can be biased by $\sim$0.5 dex (by a factor of $\sim$3) due to such choices. This shows that beyond the possible misidentification of a molecular feature (e.g., current debate surrounding dimethyl sulfide, DMS, in K2-18 b), the implicit molecular detections made pre-retrieval to avoid retrieving for hundreds of molecules at a time can bias a large range of parameters. We thus recommend sensitivity analysis to assess the dependencies of atmospheric inferences on such selections in tandem with complementary information (e.g., chemistry models) to support any pre-retrieval selection. Finally, we introduce an independent path to constrain the dominant atmospheric constituent, even when lacking observable absorption feature (e.g., H$_2$ and N$_2$) through the scale height.</description>

      <title>Tides Tighten the Hycean Habitable Zone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hycean planets -- exoplanets with substantial water ice layers, deep surface oceans, and hydrogen-rich atmospheres -- are thought to be favorable environments for life. Due to a relative paucity of atmospheric greenhouse gases, hycean planets have been thought to have wider habitable zones than Earth-like planets, extending down to a few times 0.001 au for those orbiting M dwarfs. In this Letter, we reconsider the hycean habitable zone accounting for star-planet tidal interaction. We show that for a moderately eccentric hycean planet, the surface temperature contribution from tidal heating truncates the habitable zone at significantly larger orbital radii, and that moderate eccentricity is readily obtained from any massive outer companion in the system. Though few current hycean planet candidates orbit stars of low enough mass for tides to plausibly significantly alter the extent of the habitable zone, this effect will be important to note as more such candidates are identified orbiting M dwarfs. We suggest that tides are a significant factor both for determining the extent of the hycean habitable zone around low-mass stars and for the development of a detectable hycean biosphere.</description>

      <title>Re-analysis of 10 Hot-Jupiter Atmospheres with disequilibrium chemistry retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constraining the chemical structure of exoplanetary atmospheres is pivotal for interpreting spectroscopic data and understanding planetary evolution. Traditional retrieval methods often assume thermochemical equilibrium or free profiles, which may fail to capture disequilibrium processes like photodissociation and vertical mixing. This study leverages the TauREx 3.1 retrieval framework coupled with FRECKLL, a disequilibrium chemistry model, to address these challenges. The study aims to (1) assess the impact of disequilibrium chemistry on constraining metallicity and C/O ratios; (2) evaluate the role of refractory species (TiO and VO) in spectral retrievals; (3) explore consistency between transit and eclipse observations for temperature and chemical profiles; and (4) determine the effects of retrieval priors and data reduction methods. Ten hot-Jupiter atmospheres were reanalyzed using Hubble Space Telescope (HST) WFC3 data in eclipse and transit. The TauREx-FRECKLL model incorporated disequilibrium chemistry calculations with a Bayesian framework to infer atmospheric properties. The disequilibrium approach significantly altered retrieved metallicity and C/O ratios compared to equilibrium models, impacting planet formation insights. Retrievals reconciled transit and eclipse temperature profiles in deeper atmospheric layers but not in upper layers. Results were highly dependent on spectral resolution and retrieval priors, emphasizing limitations of HST data and the need for broader spectral coverage from instruments like JWST. This study demonstrates the feasibility and importance of incorporating disequilibrium chemistry in atmospheric retrievals, highlighting its potential for advancing our understanding of exoplanetary atmospheres with next-generation telescopes.</description>

      <title>A Far-Infrared Search for Planet Nine Using AKARI All-Sky Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An unusual orbital element clustering of Kuiper belt objects (KBOs) has been observed. The most promising dynamic solution is the presence of a giant planet in the outer Solar system, Planet Nine. However, due to its extreme distance, intensive searches in optical have not been successful. We aim to find Planet Nine in the far-infrared, where it has the peak of the black body radiation, using the most sensitive all-sky far-infrared survey to date, AKARI. In contrast to optical searches, where the energy of reflected sunlight decreases by $d^{4}$, thermal radiation in the infrared decreases with the square of the heliocentric distance $d^{2}$. We search for moving objects in the AKARI Single Scan Detection List. We select sources from a promising region suggested by an N-body simulation from Millholland and Laughlin 2017: $30^{\circ}&lt;$ R.A. $&lt;50^{\circ}$ and $-20^{\circ}&lt;$ Dec. $&lt;20^{\circ}$. Known sources are excluded by cross-matching AKARI sources with 9 optical and infrared catalogues. Furthermore, we select sources with small background strength to avoid sources in the cirrus. Since Planet Nine is stationary in a timescale of hours but moves on a monthly scale, our primary strategy is to select slowly moving objects that are stationary in 24 hours but not in six months, using multiple single scans by AKARI. The selected slowly moving AKARI sources are scrutinised for potential contamination from cosmic rays. Our analysis reveals two possible Planet Nine candidates whose positions and flux are within the theoretical prediction ranges. These candidates warrant further investigation through follow-up observations to confirm the existence and properties of Planet Nine.</description>

      <title>Heating, Excitation, Dissociation, and Ionization of Molecules by High-Energy Photons in Planetary Atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photoionization by high-energy photons creates nonthermal electrons with a broad range of energies that heat and chemically transform the atmospheres of planets. The specifics of the interactions are notably different when the gas is atomic or molecular. Motivated by the idea that molecules survive to high altitudes in some exoplanets, we built a model for the energy transfer from nonthermal electrons to the H2O, H2, and O2 molecules. Our calculations show that the primary electrons of energy above about a hundred eV, a likely outcome from X-ray photoionization at moderately high atmospheric densities, expend most of their energy in ionization, dissociation, and electronic excitation collisions. In contrast, the primary electrons of less than about ten eV, such as those produced by extreme-ultraviolet photons at low densities, expend most of their energy in momentum transfer (heating), rotational, and vibrational excitation collisions. The partitioning between channels with weak thresholds is particularly sensitive to local fractional ionization. The transition between these two situations introduces a parallel transition in the way that the stellar energy is deposited in the atmosphere. Our calculations show that the nonthermal electrons enhance the ionization rate by a factor of a few or more with respect to photoionization alone but may not greatly contribute to the direct dissociation of molecules unless the local flux of far-ultraviolet photons is relatively weak. These findings highlight the importance of tracking the energy from the incident photons to the nonthermal electrons and onto the gas for problems concerned with the remote sensing and energy balance of exoplanet atmospheres.</description>

      <title>SpaceTrack-TimeSeries: Time Series Dataset towards Satellite Orbit Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of aerospace technology and the large-scale deployment of low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellations, the challenges facing astronomical observations and deep space exploration have become increasingly pronounced. As a result, the demand for high-precision orbital data on space objects-along with comprehensive analyses of satellite positioning, constellation configurations, and deep space satellite dynamics-has grown more urgent. However, there remains a notable lack of publicly accessible, real-world datasets to support research in areas such as space object maneuver behavior prediction and collision risk assessment. This study seeks to address this gap by collecting and curating a representative dataset of maneuvering behavior from Starlink satellites. The dataset integrates Two-Line Element (TLE) catalog data with corresponding high-precision ephemeris data, thereby enabling a more realistic and multidimensional modeling of space object behavior. It provides valuable insights into practical deployment of maneuver detection methods and the evaluation of collision risks in increasingly congested orbital environments.</description>

      <title>Breakthrough Listen: A Technosignature Search Around 27 Eclipsing Exoplanets Selected from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite Catalogue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we analyse the archival data for a set of 27 Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) Targets of Interest (TOIs) in search for artificially generated radio signals, or 'technosignatures', interrupted by occultation. Exoplanetary eclipses are notable events to observe in the search for technosignatures, as they mark the geometrical alignment of the target, its host star, and Earth. During an eclipse event, any signal emanating from the target of interest should cease for the duration of the eclipse, and resume after the line-of-sight has been restored. Target observations were made by Breakthrough Listen (BL) using Murriyang, the CSIRO Parkes 64-m radio telescope, coupled with the Ultra-wide Low frequency (UWL) receiver covering a continuous range of frequencies spanning 704-4032 MHz inclusive. Each target was observed in a pattern consisting of six back-to-back 5-minute source and reference sky positions for comparison during data analysis. We performed a Doppler search for narrowband signals with a minimum signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio of 10, a minimum drift rate of $\pm0.1$ Hz/s, and a maximum drift rate of $\pm4.0$ Hz/s using the turboSETI pipeline. In the analysis of 1,954,880 signals, 14,639 passed automated radio interference filters where each event was presented as a set of stacked dynamic spectra. Despite manually inspecting each diagram for a signal of interest, all events were attributed to terrestrial radio frequency interference (RFI).</description>

      <title>Updated Mutual Inclination Measurement for 14 Her b and c</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mutual inclination $\psi$ between orbits within multi-planetary systems is difficult to measure directly. Through a joint analysis of RVs, Hipparcos-Gaia absolute astrometry and relative astrometry of JWST, \citet{Bardalez2025} recently found two possible values of $\psi_{bc}={32_{-15.1}^{+13.6}}^{\circ}$ and $\psi_{bc}={145.0_{-11.1}^{+15.8}}^{\circ}$ for the nearby, non-transit planet system, 14\,Her. By incorporating additional astrometry from Gaia second data release (DR2), we have further constrained the orbital orientation of 14\,Her\,b, resulting in a definitive and unambiguous mutual inclination of $\psi_{bc}={35.3_{-7.3}^{+6.8}}^{\circ}$. The unusual misaligned orbital architecture of 14\,Her system may serve as a benchmark for dynamical studies.</description>

      <title>Planetary waves can activate resonant drag instabilities in 3D dusty gaseous discs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resonant Drag Instabilities (RDIs) in protoplanetary discs are driven by the aerodynamic back-reaction of dust on gas and occur when the relative dust-gas motion resonate with a wave mode intrinsic to the gas fluid. Axisymmetric models indicate that the RDI generates filamentary perturbations, leading to grain clumping and planetesimal formation. Motivated by these findings, we investigate the dust-gas interaction in a non-axisymmetric inviscid protoplanetary disc with an embedded low-mass planet ($M_{\mathrm{p}}\in[0.3, 3] M_\oplus$, here $M_\oplus$ is the Earth mass). We conduct global 3D high-resolution two-fluid simulations, with the dust being parametrized by the Stokes number $\mathrm{St}\in[0.01,0.5]$. We find that planetary waves (PWs; also known as Rossby waves), which propagate along the downstream separatrices of the horseshoe region, resonate with the streaming motion and trigger the RDI. The consequent development of a global-scale filamentary dust distribution does not sensitively depend on the Stokes number, nor does it depend on the fast dust settling that takes place in an inviscid disc. The rapid onset of this instability, which is comparable to the dynamical orbital time-scale, suppresses the formation of asymmetric structures in the dust in the vicinity of the planet (such as dust voids and filaments). Additionally, we find that the dust feedback enables buoyancy resonances in an otherwise non-buoyant (globally isothermal) disc. Therefore, our results provide the first numerical evidence of RDIs generation driven by planetary waves.</description>

      <title>Tidal dissipation and synchronization of the temperate exo-Earth LP 791-18d</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The creep tide theory is used to explore several aspects of the tidal evolution of the planetary system of the M-star LP 791-18 . We discuss the early synchronization of the exo-Earth LP 791-18d and show that the trapping of its rotation in a 3:2 spin-orbit resonance would only have been possible if its eccentricity were approximately 0.04 or larger. The planet is likely in synchronous rotation. The perturbations of the other planets in the system do not allow the complete damping of the orbital eccentricity, and the resulting mechanical energy balance indicates that the tidal energy dissipated inside the planet may flow through the planetary surface at approximately 1 watt per square meter.</description>

      <title>Infall-driven gravitational instability in accretion discs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational instability (GI) is typically studied in cooling-dominated discs, often modelled using simplified prescriptions such as $\beta$-cooling. In this paper, we investigate the onset and evolution of GI in accretion discs subject to continuous mass injection, combining 1D and 3D numerical simulations. We explore an alternative self-regulation mechanism in which mass replenishment drives the system toward marginal stability $Q\sim 1$. In this regime, the disc establishes a steady-state disc-to-star mass ratio, balancing the mass transported to the central object with that added to the disc. Our 3D simulations reveal that the general scaling predicted from the linear theory are respected, however there are important difference compared to the cooling case in terms of morphology and pattern speed. Unlike the flocculent spirals seen in cooling-driven instability, the power is concentrated towards the dominant modes in infall-driven spirals. Additionally, spiral waves generate at the mass injection location, and propagate at constant pattern speed, unlike in the cooling case. This suggests a fundamental difference in how mass-regulated and cooling-regulated discs behave and transport angular momentum.</description>

      <title>Numerical approach to second-order canonical perturbation theory in the planetary 3-body problem. Application to exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extrasolar planetary systems commonly exhibit planets on eccentric orbits, with many systems located near or within mean-motion resonances, showcasing a wide diversity of orbital architectures. Such complex systems challenge traditional secular theories, which are limited to first-order approximations in planetary masses or rely on expansions in orbital elements--eccentricities, inclinations, and semi-major axis ratios--that are subject to convergence issues, especially in highly eccentric, inclined, or tightly-packed systems. To overcome these limitations, we develop a numerical approach to second-order perturbation theory based on the Lie transform formalism. Our method avoids the need for expansions in orbital elements, ensuring broader applicability and more robust convergence. We first outline the Hamiltonian framework for the 3-body planetary problem, and apply a canonical transformation to eliminate fast angle dependencies, deriving the secular Hamiltonian up to second order in the mass ratio. We then use the fast Fourier transform algorithm to numerically simulate, in an accurate way, the long-term evolution of planetary systems near or away from mean-motion resonances. Finally, we validate our methods against well-known planetary configurations, such as the Sun-Jupiter-Saturn system, as well as to exoplanetary systems like WASP-148, TIC 279401253 and GJ 876, demonstrating the applicability of our models across a wide range of planetary configurations.</description>

      <title>Updated line list for the principal isotopologue of carbon monoxide</title>

Abstract: The line list for the principal isotopologue of CO calculated earlier by the present authors [1, 2] with the irregular dipole-moment function (DMF) is updated with use of the recent high-precision measurements in the 3-0 [3, 4] (Bielska et al. 2022, Hodges et al. 2025) and 7-0 [5] (Balashov et al. 2023) bands. The new data came in contradiction with the experimental data on the 1-0 band [6, 7]. Therefore, we performed fitting several model DMFs to the modified original data set of Meshkov et al. [8] by including the new above-referenced data and by excluding the data for the 1-0 band. The updated line list is calculated with the irregular DMF. In particular, excellent agreement with recent high-level ab initio calculations on the 3-0 band [3] is emphasized and predictions for the 1-0 and 8-0 bands are outlined. In the new update of the HITRAN database [9], new high-precision measurements in the cold and hot fundamental bands are announced. When these data are published, they will be compared with the predictions of our new line list.</description>

Abstract: Sulfur-bearing species play crucial roles in atmospheric physical-chemical processes, atmosphere-surface interactions, and the geological evolution of Venus. This chapter provides a comprehensive overview of (1) instrumental data on the abundance and speciation of sulfur in atmospheric and crustal materials, (2) the behavior of sulfur-bearing species in the mesosphere, clouds, and lower atmosphere, (3) chemical and mineralogical aspects of atmosphere-surface interactions, and (4) the fate of sulfur during the formation, differentiation, and geological evolution of Venus, including volcanic degassing, gas-solid reactions at the surface, a proposed aqueous period, and subsequent evolution. The chapter also outlines key questions and discusses further exploration of Venus in the context of sulfur-relevant investigations.</description>

      <title>ELemental abundances of Planets and brown dwarfs Imaged around Stars (ELPIS): II. The Jupiter-like Inhomogeneous Atmosphere of the First Directly Imaged Planetary-Mass Companion 2MASS 1207 b</title>

Abstract: 2MASS 1207 b, the first directly imaged planetary-mass companion, has been instrumental in advancing our understanding of exoplanets and brown dwarfs over the past 20 years. We have performed extensive atmospheric retrieval analyses of 2MASS 1207 b's JWST/NIRSpec spectrum using petitRADTRANS and a new atmospheric inhomogeneity framework, which characterizes homogeneous atmospheres, patchy clouds, cloud-free hot spots, or the combination of patchy clouds and spots. Among 24 retrieval runs with various assumptions, the most statistically preferred model corresponds to the patchy cloud scheme, with Teff$=1174^{+4}_{-3}$ K, log(g)=$3.62^{+0.03}_{-0.02}$ dex, and R$=1.399^{+0.008}_{-0.010}$ R$_{\rm Jup}$, along with near-solar atmospheric compositions of [M/H]$=-0.05\pm0.03$ dex and C/O$=0.440\pm0.012$. This model suggests ~9% of 2MASS 1207 b's atmosphere is covered by thin iron clouds, producing L-dwarf-like spectra, while the remaining 91% consists of thick silicate and iron clouds, emitting blackbody-like spectra. These thin-cloud and thick-cloud regions resemble Jupiter's belts and zones, respectively; this scenario is consistently supported by other retrieval runs incorporating inhomogeneous atmospheres. We demonstrate that 2MASS 1207 b's weak CO absorption can be explained by the veiling effects of patchy thick clouds; the absence of 3.3um CH4 absorption is attributed to its hot thermal structure, which naturally leads to a CO-dominant, CH4-deficient atmosphere. The retrieved atmospheric models also match the observed variability amplitudes of 2MASS 1207 b. Our analysis reveals that the inferred atmospheric properties show significant scatter in less statistically preferred retrieval runs but converge to consistent values among the preferred ones. This underscores the importance of exploring diverse assumptions in retrievals to avoid biased interpretations of atmospheres and formation.</description>

      <title>Origin of the lunar inclination from tidal interaction of multiple-moon system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18837v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: According to the giant impact theory, the Moon formed through accreting the debris disk produced by Theia colliding with proto-Earth and the predicted lunar orbital inclination relative to the Earth's equatorial plane is about within one degree when Moon formed. However, the current lunar orbital inclination with five degrees relative to the Earth's orbital plane requires the Moon's orbital inclination relative to the Earth's equator to be about ten degrees when traced back to the time of lunar formation. Since two moons are also a natural outcome of simulations of lunar formation from a protolunar disk produced a giant impact, here we show that, under solar perturbation, gravitational tidal interaction between Earth and the two moons with orbital inclination of one degree relative to Earth's equatorial plane could lead to the merger of one moon with Earth, or the merger of the two moons or the ejection of one moon, resulting that the remaining moon's orbital inclination relative to Earth's equator could exceed 10 degrees. The theory proposed here may provide a way of explaining the initial large lunar inclination relative to the Earth's equator.</description>

      <title>A new approach for predicting the stability of hierarchical triple systems -- I. Coplanar Cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10076v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hierarchical triple systems play a crucial role in various astrophysical contexts, and therefore the understanding of their stability is important. Traditional empirical stability criteria rely on a threshold value of $Q$, the ratio between the outer orbit's pericenter distance and the inner orbit's semi-major axis. However, determining a single critical value of $Q$ is impossible because there is a range of the value of $Q$ for which both stable and unstable systems exist, referred to as the mixed-region. In this study, we introduce a novel method to assess the stability of triple systems within this mixed-region. We numerically integrate equal-mass, coplanar hierarchical triples within the mixed-region. By performing Fourier analysis of the time evolution of the semi-major axes ratio during the first 1000 inner orbital periods of the systems, we find notable features in stable systems: if the main peaks are periodically spaced in the frequency domain and the continuous components and irregularly spaced peaks are small, the system tends to be stable. This observation indicates that the evolution of stable triples is more periodic than that of unstable ones. We quantified the periodicity of the triples and investigated the correlation between the Fourier power distribution and the system's lifetime. Using this correlation, we show that it is possible to determine if a triple system in the mixed-region is stable or not with very high accuracy. These findings suggest that periodicity in orbital evolution can serve as a robust indicator of stability for hierarchical triples.</description>
