      <title>Overview and Analysis of Seismic Resilient Structures with Modular Rocking Shear Walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The high occupancy rates in urban multi-story buildings, combined with present safety concerns, necessarily prompt a reassessment of performance goals. Given the notable seismic damage and instances of weak-story failures that have been documented after major earthquakes, this paper studies the use of modular shear walls that are free to rock above their foundation. This paper first provides a comprehensive background in analysis of rocking elements such as columns and shear-walls. Then discusses different configurations of rocking-shear-walls. Next, the paper provides two numerical case studies on 9-story and 20-story moment-resisting frames using OpenSees. The floor displacement and interstory drifts under various earthquake excitations for both structures compared for the cases of with and without modular rocking walls. The result shows that the addition of rocking-shear-wall, makes the first mode of the frame becomes dominant which enforces a uniform distribution of interstory drifts that would avoid a soft-story failure.</description>

      <title>Source regions of carbonaceous meteorites and NEOs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The present work aims to determine the source regions of carbonaceous chondrites (CM, CI, CO, CV, CK, CR, CH, CB, or C-ungrouped). We studied 38 individual asteroid families, including young and old ones, and determined their contributions to the NEO populations at metre and kilometre sizes using collisional and orbital models. Our models are in agreement with spectroscopic observations of NEOs, cosmic-ray exposure ages of meteorites, statistics of bolides, infrared emission from dust bands, composition of interplanetary dust particles (IDPs), or abundance of extraterrestrial helium-3. We identified the Veritas, Polana and Eos families as the primary sources of CM/CR, CI and CO/CV/CK chondrites, respectively. Substantial contributions are also expected from CM-like K\"onig and CI-like Clarissa, Misa and Hoffmeister families. The source regions of kilometre-sized bodies are generally different. The Adeona family is by far the main source of CM-like NEOs, whereas the Polana (low-i) and Euphrosyne (high-i) families are at the origin of most CI-like NEOs. The Polana family is the likely source of both Ryugu and Bennu. We were able to link spectroscopically and dynamically several NEOs to the Baptistina family. Finally, it appears that the pre-atmospheric flux of carbonaceous chondrites at metre sizes is about the same as that of ordinary chondrites. Given the difference in fall statistics between the two groups (80\% versus 4.4\%), this implies either substantial atmospheric fragmentation of carbonaceous bodies at the level of ${\sim}0.5\,{\rm MPa}$, or destruction by thermal cracking and water desorption. The source regions of most meteorites and kilometre-sized NEOs have now been determined; including some minor classes like enstatite chondrites and achondrites (Nysa, Hungaria), acapulcoites/lodranites (Iannini).</description>

      <title>Evaluating potential landing sites for the Artemis III mission using a multi-criteria decision making approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The selection of a landing site within the Artemis Exploration Zone (AEZ) involves multiple factors and presents a complex problem. This study evaluates potential landing sites for the Artemis III mission using a combination of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) methodologies, specifically the TOPSIS algorithm. By integrating topographic, illumination, and mineralogy data of the Moon, we assess 1247 locations that meet the Human Landing System (HLS) requirements within 13 candidate regions and Site 004 near the lunar south pole. Criteria considered include surface visibility, HLS-astronaut line of sight, Permanently Shadowed Regions (PSRs), sunlight exposure, direct communication with Earth, geological units, and mafic mineral abundance. Site DM2 (Nobile Rim 2), particularly the point at latitude 84{\deg}12'5.61" S and longitude 60{\deg}41'59.61" E, is the optimal location for landing. Sensitivity analysis confirms the robustness of our approach, validating the suitability of the best location despite the MCDM method employed and variations in criteria weightings to prioritize illumination and PSRs. This research demonstrates the applicability of GIS-MCDM techniques for lunar exploration and the potential benefits they can bring to the Artemis program.</description>

      <title>AI for Extreme Event Modeling and Understanding: Methodologies and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.20080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has deeply impacted various fields, including Earth system sciences. Here, AI improved weather forecasting, model emulation, parameter estimation, and the prediction of extreme events. However, the latter comes with specific challenges, such as developing accurate predictors from noisy, heterogeneous and limited annotated data. This paper reviews how AI is being used to analyze extreme events (like floods, droughts, wildfires and heatwaves), highlighting the importance of creating accurate, transparent, and reliable AI models. We discuss the hurdles of dealing with limited data, integrating information in real-time, deploying models, and making them understandable, all crucial for gaining the trust of stakeholders and meeting regulatory needs. We provide an overview of how AI can help identify and explain extreme events more effectively, improving disaster response and communication. We emphasize the need for collaboration across different fields to create AI solutions that are practical, understandable, and trustworthy for analyzing and predicting extreme events. Such collaborative efforts aim to enhance disaster readiness and disaster risk reduction.</description>

      <title>Evidence of a hydrated mineral enriched in water and ammonium molecules in the Chang'e-5 lunar sample</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.05263v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The presence and distribution of water on the Moon are fundamental to our understanding of the Earth-Moon system. Despite extensive research and remote detection, the origin and chemical form of lunar water (H2O) have remained elusive. In this study, we present the discovery of a hydrated mineral, (NH4)MgCl3*6H2O, in lunar soil samples returned by the Chang'e-5 mission, containing approximately 41 wt% H2O. The mineral's structure and composition closely resemble novograblenovite, a terrestrial fumarole mineral formed through the reaction of hot basalt with water-rich volcanic gases, and carnallite, an earth evaporite mineral. We rule out terrestrial contamination or rocket exhaust as the origin of this hydrate, based on its chemical and isotopic compositions and formation conditions. The presence of ammonium indicates a more complex lunar degassing history and highlights its potential as a resource for lunar habitation. Our findings also suggest that water molecules can persist in sunlit areas of the Moon as hydrated salt, providing crucial constraints to the fugacity of water and ammonia vapor in lunar volcanic gases.</description>
