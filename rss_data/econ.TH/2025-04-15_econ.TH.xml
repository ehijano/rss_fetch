      <title>A Unified Theory of School Choice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In school choice, policymakers consolidate a district's objectives for a school into a priority ordering over students. They then face a trade-off between respecting these priorities and assigning students to more-preferred schools. However, because priorities are the amalgamation of multiple policy goals, some may be more flexible than others. This paper introduces a model that distinguishes between two types of priority: a between-group priority that ranks groups of students and must be respected, and a within-group priority for efficiently allocating seats within each group. The solution I introduce, the unified core, integrates both types. I provide a two-stage algorithm, the DA-TTC, that implements the unified core and generalizes both the Deferred Acceptance and Top Trading Cycles algorithms. This approach provides a method for improving efficiency in school choice while honoring policymakers' objectives.</description>

      <title>Diversity-Fair Online Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online selection problems frequently arise in applications such as crowdsourcing and employee recruitment. Existing research typically focuses on candidates with a single attribute. However, crowdsourcing tasks often require contributions from individuals across various demographics. Further motivated by the dynamic nature of crowdsourcing and hiring, we study the diversity-fair online selection problem, in which a recruiter must make real-time decisions to foster workforce diversity across many dimensions. We propose two scenarios for this problem. The fixed-capacity scenario, suited for short-term hiring for crowdsourced workers, provides the recruiter with a fixed capacity to fill temporary job vacancies. In contrast, in the unknown-capacity scenario, recruiters optimize diversity across recruitment seasons with increasing capacities, reflecting that the firm honors diversity consideration in a long-term employee acquisition strategy. By modeling the diversity over $d$ dimensions as a max-min fairness objective, we show that no policy can surpass a competitive ratio of $O(1/d^{1/3})$ for either scenario, indicating that any achievable result inevitably decays by some polynomial factor in $d$. To this end, we develop bilevel hierarchical randomized policies that ensure compliance with the capacity constraint. For the fixed-capacity scenario, leveraging marginal information about the arriving population allows us to achieve a competitive ratio of $1/(4\sqrt{d} \lceil \log_2 d \rceil)$. For the unknown-capacity scenario, we establish a competitive ratio of $\Omega(1/d^{3/4})$ under mild boundedness conditions. In both bilevel hierarchical policies, the higher level determines ex-ante selection probabilities and then informs the lower level's randomized selection that ensures no loss in efficiency. Both policies prioritize core diversity and then adjust for underrepresented dimensions.</description>

      <title>Dominated Actions in Imperfect-Information Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dominance is a fundamental concept in game theory. In strategic-form games dominated strategies can be identified in polynomial time. As a consequence, iterative removal of dominated strategies can be performed efficiently as a preprocessing step for reducing the size of a game before computing a Nash equilibrium. For imperfect-information games in extensive form, we could convert the game to strategic form and then iteratively remove dominated strategies in the same way; however, this conversion may cause an exponential blowup in game size. In this paper we define and study the concept of dominated actions in imperfect-information games. Our main result is a polynomial-time algorithm for determining whether an action is dominated (strictly or weakly) by any mixed strategy in n-player games, which can be extended to an algorithm for iteratively removing dominated actions. This allows us to efficiently reduce the size of the game tree as a preprocessing step for Nash equilibrium computation. We explore the role of dominated actions empirically in the "All In or Fold" No-Limit Texas Hold'em poker variant.</description>

      <title>Tractability and Phase Transitions in Endogenous Network Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10764v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dynamics of network formation are generally very complex, making the study of distributions over the space of networks often intractable. Under a condition called conservativeness, I show that the stationary distribution of a network formation process can be found in closed form, and is given by a Gibbs measure. For conservative processes, the stationary distribution of a certain class of models can be characterized for an arbitrarily large number of players. In this limit, the statistical properties of the model can exhibit phase transitions: discontinuous changes as a response to continuous changes in model parameters.</description>

      <title>TTC Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15422v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the object reallocation problem under strict preferences. On the unrestricted domain, Ekici (2024) showed that the Top Trading Cycles (TTC) mechanism is the unique mechanism that is individually rational, pair efficient, and strategyproof. We provide an alternative proof of this result, assuming only minimal richness of the unrestricted domain. This allows us to identify a broad class of restricted domains, those satisfying our top-two condition, on which the characterization continues to hold. The condition requires that, within any subset of objects, if two objects can each be most-preferred, they can also be the top two most-preferred objects (in both possible orders). We show that this condition is also necessary in the special case of three objects. These results unify and strengthen prior findings on specific domains such as single-peaked and single-dipped domain, and more broadly, offer a useful criterion for analyzing restricted preference domains.</description>

      <title>Robust Optimization of Rank-Dependent Models with Uncertain Probabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11780v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies distributionally robust optimization for a rich class of risk measures with ambiguity sets defined by $\phi$-divergences. The risk measures are allowed to be non-linear in probabilities, are represented by Choquet integrals possibly induced by a probability weighting function, and encompass many well-known examples. Optimization for this class of risk measures is challenging due to their rank-dependent nature. We show that for various shapes of probability weighting functions, including concave, convex and inverse $S$-shaped, the robust optimization problem can be reformulated into a rank-independent problem. In the case of a concave probability weighting function, the problem can be reformulated further into a convex optimization problem that admits explicit conic representability for a collection of canonical examples. While the number of constraints in general scales exponentially with the dimension of the state space, we circumvent this dimensionality curse and develop two types of algorithms. They yield tight upper and lower bounds on the exact optimal value and are formally shown to converge asymptotically. This is illustrated numerically in a robust newsvendor problem and a robust portfolio choice problem.</description>
