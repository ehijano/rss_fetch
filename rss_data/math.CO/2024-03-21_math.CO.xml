      <title>A Non-Terminating Game of Beggar-My-Neighbor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the existence of a non-terminating game of Beggar-My-Neighbor, discovered by lead author Brayden Casella. We detail the method for constructing this game and identify a cyclical structure of 62 tricks that is reached by 30 distinct starting hands. We further present a short history of the search for this solution since the problem was posed, and a record of previously found longest terminating games. The existence of this non-terminating game provides a solution to a long-standing question which John H. Conway called an `anti-Hilbert problem.'</description>

      <title>k-non-crossing trees and edge statistics modulo k</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Instead of $k$-Dyck paths we consider the equivalent concept of $k$-non-crossing trees.
  This is our preferred approach relative to down-step statistics modulo $k$ (first studied by Heuberger, Selkirk, and Wagner by different methods). One symmetry argument about subtrees is needed and the rest goes along the lines of a paper by Flajolet and Noy.</description>

      <title>On some classes of cycles-related $\Gamma$-harmonious graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph $G(V,E)$ is $\Gamma$-harmonious when there is an injection $f$ from $V$ to an Abelian group $\Gamma$ such that the induced edge labels defined as $w(xy)=f(x)+f(y)$ form a bijection from $E$ to $\Gamma$. We study $\Gamma$-harmonious labelings of several cycles-related classes of graphs, including Dutch windmills, generalized prisms, generalized closed and open webs, and superwheels.</description>

      <title>Dirac's theorem for linear hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dirac's theorem states that any $n$-vertex graph $G$ with even integer $n$ satisfying $\delta(G) \geq n/2$ contains a perfect matching. We generalize this to $k$-uniform linear hypergraphs by proving the following. Any $n$-vertex $k$-uniform linear hypergraph $H$ with minimum degree at least $\frac{n}{k} + \Omega(1)$ contains a matching that covers at least $(1-o(1))n$ vertices. This minimum degree condition is asymptotically tight and obtaining perfect matching is impossible with any degree condition. Furthermore, we show that if $\delta(H) \geq (\frac{1}{k}+o(1))n$, then $H$ contains almost spanning linear cycles, almost spanning hypertrees with $o(n)$ leaves, and ``long subdivisions'' of any $o(\sqrt{n})$-vertex graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that for all $k\geq 4$, $\varepsilon &gt;0$, and $n$ sufficiently large, every $k$-uniform hypergraph on $n$ vertices in which each set of $k-3$ vertices is contained in at least $(5/8 + \varepsilon) \binom{n}{3}$ edges contains a tight Hamilton cycle. This is asymptotically best possible.</description>

Abstract: We give a minimal counterexample for a conjecture of Ross and Yong (2015) which proposes a K-Kohnert rule for Grothendieck polynomials. We conjecture a revised version of this rule. We then prove both rules hold in the $321$-avoiding case.</description>

      <title>Performance-Guaranteed Solutions for Multi-Agent Optimal Coverage Problems using Submodularity, Curvature, and Greedy Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a class of multi-agent optimal coverage problems where the goal is to determine the optimal placement of a group of agents in a given mission space such that they maximize a joint ``coverage'' objective. This class of problems is extremely challenging due to the non-convex nature of the mission space and of the coverage objective. With this motivation, we propose to use a greedy algorithm as a means of getting feasible coverage solutions efficiently. Even though such greedy solutions are suboptimal, the submodularity (diminishing returns) property of the coverage objective can be exploited to provide performance bound guarantees - not only for the greedy solutions but also for any subsequently improved solutions. Moreover, we show that improved performance bound guarantees (beyond the standard (1-1/e) performance bound) can be established using various curvature measures that further characterize the considered coverage problem. In particular, we provide a brief review of all existing popular curvature measures found in the submodular maximization literature, including a recent curvature measure that we proposed, and discuss in detail their applicability, practicality, and effectiveness in the context of optimal coverage problems. Moreover, we characterize the dependence of the effectiveness of different curvature measures (in providing improved performance bound guarantees) on the agent sensing capabilities. Finally, we provide several numerical results to support our findings and propose several potential future research directions.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the fourth-moment phenomenon of monochromatic subgraph counts via influences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the distribution of monochromatic subgraph counts in random vertex $2$-colorings of large graphs. We give sufficient conditions for the asymptotic normality of these counts and demonstrate their essential necessity (particularly for monochromatic triangles). Our approach refines the fourth-moment theorem to establish new, local influence-based conditions for asymptotic normality; these findings more generally provide insight into fourth-moment phenomena for a broader class of Rademacher and Gaussian polynomials.</description>

      <title>A combinatorial view of Holant problems on higher domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On the Boolean domain, there is a class of symmetric signatures called ``Fibonacci gates" for which a beautiful P-time combinatorial algorithm has been designed for the corresponding $\operatorname{Holant}^*$ problems.
  In this work, we give a combinatorial view for $\operatorname{Holant}^*(\mathcal{F})$ problems on a domain of size 3 where $\mathcal{F}$ is a set of arity 3 functions with inputs taking values on the domain of size 3 and the functions share some common properties. The combinatorial view can also be extended to the domain of size 4.
  Specifically, we extend the definition of "Fibonacci gates" to the domain of size 3 and the domain of size 4. Moreover, we give the corresponding combinatorial algorithms.</description>

Abstract: Let $X$ be an affine toric variety and let $D(X)$ be the set of weights of all root subgroups. It is known that $D(X)$ together with its embedding into the character group determines $X$ as a toric variety. In this article we prove that $X$ is already determined by the abstract set $D(X)$ together with some additional combinatorial data.</description>

      <title>Induced Subforests and Superforests</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph isomorphism, subgraph isomorphism, and maximum common subgraphs are classical well-investigated objects. Their (parameterized) complexity and efficiently tractable cases have been studied. In the present paper, for a given set of forests, we study maximum common induced subforests and minimum common induced superforests. We show that finding a maximum subforest is NP-hard already for two subdivided stars while finding a minimum superforest is tractable for two trees but NP-hard for three trees. For a given set of $k$ trees, we present an efficient greedy $\left(\frac{k}{2}-\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{k}\right)$-approximation algorithm for the minimum superforest problem. Finally, we present a polynomial time approximation scheme for the maximum subforest problem for any given set of forests.</description>

      <title>Brillouin Zones of Integer Lattices and Their Perturbations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2204.01077v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a locally finite set, $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$, the $k$-th Brillouin zone of $a \in A$ is the region of points $x \in \mathbb{R}^d$ for which $\|x-a\|$ is the $k$-th smallest among the Euclidean distances between $x$ and the points in $A$. If $A$ is a lattice, the $k$-th Brillouin zones of the points in $A$ are translates of each other, which tile space. Depending on the value of $k$, they express medium- or long-range order in the set. We study fundamental geometric and combinatorial properties of Brillouin zones, focusing on the integer lattice and its perturbations. Our results include the stability of a Brillouin zone under perturbations, a linear upper bound on the number of chambers in a zone for lattices in $\mathbb{R}^2$, and the convergence of the maximum volume of a chamber to zero for the integer lattice.</description>

Abstract: This is the first in a sequence of three papers in which we prove the following generalization of Thomassen's 5-choosability theorem: Let $G$ be a finite graph embedded on a surface of genus $g$. Then $G$ can be $L$-colored, where $L$ is a list-assignment for $G$ in which every vertex has a 5-list except for a collection of pairwise far-apart components, each precolored with an ordinary 2-coloring, as long as the face-width of $G$ is $2^{\Omega(g)}$ and the precolored components are of distance $2^{\Omega(g)}$ apart. This provides an affirmative answer to a generalized version of a conjecture of Thomassen and also generalizes a result from 2017 of Dvo\v{r}\'ak, Lidick\'y, Mohar, and Postle about distant precolored vertices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.13373v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The two tableaux assigned by the Robinson--Schensted correspondence are equal if and only if the input permutation is an involution, so the RS algorithm restricts to a bijection between involutions in the symmetric group and standard tableaux. Beissinger found a concise way of formulating this restricted map, which involves adding an extra cell at the end of a row after a Schensted insertion process. We show that by changing this algorithm slightly to add cells at the end of columns rather than rows, one obtains a different bijection from involutions to standard tableaux. Both maps have an interesting connection to representation theory. Specifically, our insertion algorithms classify the molecules (and conjecturally the cells) in the pair of $W$-graphs associated to the unique equivalence class of perfect models for a generic symmetric group.</description>

Abstract: We derive linear recurrences for avoiding non-overlapping consecutive patterns in both permutations and words and identify a necessary condition for establishing c-Wilf-equivalence between two non-overlapping patterns. Furthermore, we offer alternative, elementary proofs for several known results in consecutive pattern containment that were previously demonstrated using ideas from cluster algebra and analytical combinatorics. Lastly, we establish new general bounds on the growth rates of consecutive pattern avoidance in permutations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16701v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extending the notion of sunflowers, we call a family of at least two sets an odd-sunflower if every element of the underlying set is contained in an odd number of sets or in none of them. It follows from the Erd\H os--Szemer\'edi conjecture, recently proved by Naslund and Sawin, that there is a constant $\mu&lt;2$ such that every family of subsets of an $n$-element set that contains no odd-sunflower consists of at most $\mu^n$ sets. We construct such families of size at least $1.5021^n$. We also characterize minimal odd-sunflowers of triples.</description>

Abstract: Consider a matroid where all elements are labeled with an element in $\mathbb{Z}$. We are interested in finding a base where the sum of the labels is congruent to $g \pmod m$. We show that this problem can be solved in $\tilde{O}(2^{4m} n r^{5/6})$ time for a matroid with $n$ elements and rank $r$, when $m$ is either the product of two primes or a prime power. The algorithm can be generalized to all moduli and, in fact, to all abelian groups if a classic additive combinatorics conjecture by Schrijver and Seymour holds true. We also discuss the optimization version of the problem.</description>

      <title>Hyperoctahedral group characters and a type-BC analog of graph coloring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04148v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We state combinatorial formulas for hyperoctahedral group ($\mathfrak B_n$) character evaluations of the form $\chi( {{\widetilde C}_w}^{\negthickspace\negthickspace BC}\negthickspace(1))$, where ${{\widetilde C}_w}^{\negthickspace\negthickspace BC}\negthickspace(1) \in \Bbb Z[\mathfrak B_n]$ is a type-BC Kazhdan-Lusztig basis element, with $w \in \mathfrak B_n$ corresponding to simultaneously smooth type-B and C Schubert varieties. We also extend the definition of symmetric group codominance to elements of $\mathfrak B_n$ and show that for each element $w \in \mathfrak B_n$ above, there exists a BC-codominant element $v \in \mathfrak B_n$ satisfying $\chi( {{\widetilde C}_w}^{\negthickspace\negthickspace BC}\negthickspace(1)) = \chi( {{\widetilde C}_v}^{\negthickspace\negthickspace BC}\negthickspace(1))$ for all $\mathfrak B_n$-characters $\chi$. Combinatorial structures and maps appearing in these formulas are type-BC extensions of planar networks, unit interval orders, indifference graphs, poset tableaux, and colorings. Using the ring of type-BC symmetric functions, we introduce natural generating functions $Y( {{\widetilde C}_w}^{\negthickspace\negthickspace BC}\negthickspace(1))$ for the above evaluations. These provide a new type-BC analog of Stanley's chromatic symmetric functions [Adv. Math. 111 (1995) pp. 166-194].</description>

      <title>An Improved Lower Bound on the Number of Pseudoline Arrangements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13107v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Arrangements of pseudolines are classic objects in discrete and computational geometry. They have been studied with increasing intensity since their introduction almost 100 years ago. The study of the number $B_n$ of non-isomorphic simple arrangements of $n$ pseudolines goes back to Goodman and Pollack, Knuth, and others. It is known that $B_n$ is in the order of $2^{\Theta(n^2)}$ and finding asymptotic bounds on $b_n = \frac{\log_2(B_n)}{n^2}$ remains a challenging task. In 2011, Felsner and Valtr showed that $0.1887 \leq b_n \le 0.6571$ for sufficiently large $n$. The upper bound remains untouched but in 2020 Dumitrescu and Mandal improved the lower bound constant to $0.2083$. Their approach utilizes the known values of $B_n$ for up to $n=12$.
  We tackle the lower bound by utilizing dynamic programming and the Lindstr\"om-Gessel-Viennot lemma. Our new bound is $b_n \geq 0.2721$ for sufficiently large $n$. The result is based on a delicate interplay of theoretical ideas and computer assistance.</description>

      <title>The unitary Cayley graph of upper triangular matrix rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01303v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The unitary Cayley graph $C_R$ of a finite unital ring $R$ is the simple graph with vertex set $R$ in which two elements $x$ and $y$ are connected by an edge if and only if $x-y$ is a unit of $R$. We characterize the unitary Cayley graph $C_{T_n (\mathbb{F})}$ of the ring of all upper triangular matrices $T_n(\mathbb{F})$ over a finite field $\mathbb{F}$. We show that $C_{T_n (\mathbb{F})}$ is isomorphic to the semistrong product of the complete graph $K_m$ and the antipodal graph of the Hamming graph $A(H(n,p^k))$, where $m=p^{\frac{kn(n-1)}{2}}$ and $|\mathbb{F}|=p^k$. In particular, if $|\mathbb{F}|=2$, then the graph $C_{T_n (\mathbb{F})}$ has $2^{n-1}$ connected components, each component is isomorphic to the complete bipartite graph $K_{m,m}$, where $m=2^{\frac{n(n-1)}{2}}$. We also compute the diameter, triameter, and clique number of the graph $C_{T_n (\mathbb{F})}$.</description>

      <title>Improved Lower Bounds for Property B</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05674v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: If an $n$-uniform hypergraph can be 2-colored, then it is said to have property B. Erd\H{o}s (1963) was the first to give lower and upper bounds for the minimal size $m(n)$ of an $n$-uniform hypergraph without property B. His asymptotic upper bound $O(n^22^n)$ still is the best we know, his lower bound $2^{n-1}$ has seen a number of improvements, with the current best $\Omega$ $(2^n\sqrt{n/\log(n)})$ established by Radhakrishnan and Srinivasan (2000). Cherkashin and Kozik (2014) provided a simplified proof of this result, using Pluh\'ar's (2009) idea of a random greedy coloring. In the present paper, we use a refined version of this argument to obtain improved lower bounds on $m(n)$ for small values of $n$. We also study $m(n,v)$, the size of the smallest $n$-hypergraph without property B having $v$ vertices.</description>

      <title>The q-ary Gilbert-Varshamov bound can be improved for all but finitely many positive integers q</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08727v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For any positive integer $q\geq 2$ and any real number $\delta\in(0,1)$, let $\alpha_q(n,\delta n)$ denote the maximum size of a subset of $\mathbb{Z}_q^n$ with minimum Hamming distance at least $\delta n$, where $\mathbb{Z}_q=\{0,1,\dotsc,q-1\}$ and $n\in\mathbb{N}$. The asymptotic rate function is defined by $ R_q(\delta) = \limsup_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{1}{n}\log_q\alpha_q(n,\delta n).$ The famous $q$-ary asymptotic Gilbert-Varshamov bound, obtained in the 1950s, states that \[ R_q(\delta) \geq 1 - \delta\log_q(q-1)-\delta\log_q\frac{1}{\delta}-(1-\delta)\log_q\frac{1}{1-\delta} \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}R_\mathrm{GV}(\delta,q) \] for all positive integers $q\geq 2$ and $0&lt;\delta&lt;1-q^{-1}$. In the case that $q$ is an even power of a prime with $q\geq 49$, the $q$-ary Gilbert-Varshamov bound was firstly improved by using algebraic geometry codes in the works of Tsfasman, Vladut, and Zink and of Ihara in the 1980s. These algebraic geometry codes have been modified to improve the $q$-ary Gilbert-Varshamov bound $R_\mathrm{GV}(\delta,q)$ at a specific tangent point $\delta=\delta_0\in (0,1)$ of the curve $R_\mathrm{GV}(\delta,q)$ for each given integer $q\geq 46$. However, the $q$-ary Gilbert-Varshamov bound $R_\mathrm{GV}(\delta,q)$ at $\delta=1/2$, i.e., $R_\mathrm{GV}(1/2,q)$, remains the largest known lower bound of $R_q(1/2)$ for infinitely many positive integers $q$ which is a generic prime and which is a generic non-prime-power integer. In this paper, by using codes from geometry of numbers introduced by Lenstra in the 1980s, we prove that the $q$-ary Gilbert-Varshamov bound $R_\mathrm{GV}(\delta,q)$ with $\delta\in(0,1)$ can be improved for all but finitely many positive integers $q$. It is shown that the growth defined by $\eta(\delta)= \liminf_{q\rightarrow\infty}\frac{1}{\log q}\log[1-\delta-R_q(\delta)]^{-1}$ for every $\delta\in(0,1)$ has actually a nontrivial lower bound.</description>

      <title>Universal Definitions of the Roman Factorial: Introduction to Foundational Functions and the Generalization Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09581v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new method for redefining the Roman factorial using universally applicable functions that are not expressed in closed form. We present a set of foundational functions, similar to Boolean operations, to simplify the factorial expression. Through a systematic process of generalization, termed generalization process, we aim to use these foundational functions to create recursive and non-recursive, global definitions of the Roman factorial.</description>

      <title>Universality for tropical and logarithmic maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.15719v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that every toric monoid appears in a space of maps from tropical curves to an orthant. It follows that spaces of logarithmic maps to Artin fans exhibit arbitrary toric singularities: a virtual universality theorem for logarithmic maps to pairs. The target rank depends on the chosen singularity: we show that the cone over the 7-gon never appears in a space of maps to a rank-1 target. We obtain similar results for tropical maps to affine space.</description>

      <title>Polytopes with Bounded Integral Slack Matrices Have Sub-Exponential Extension Complexity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.16159v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that any bounded integral function $f : A \times B \mapsto \{0,1, \dots, \Delta\}$ with rank $r$ has deterministic communication complexity $\Delta^{O(\Delta)} \cdot \sqrt{r} \cdot \log r$, where the rank of $f$ is defined to be the rank of the $A \times B$ matrix whose entries are the function values. As a corollary, we show that any $n$-dimensional polytope that admits a slack matrix with entries from $\{0,1,\dots,\Delta\}$ has extension complexity at most $\exp(\Delta^{O(\Delta)} \cdot \sqrt{n} \cdot \log n)$.</description>
