      <title>Plasma Induced Variation of Electron Capture and Bound-State $\beta$ Decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The slow neutron capture ($s$-process) synthesises ~50% of all elements in the universe heavier than iron, whose abundances are determined by the competition between neutron capture and nuclear $\beta$-decay rates. The latter are expected to vary inside hot and dense plasmas such as those found in $s$-process nucleosynthesis sites. Here, we present a new and general theoretical study of the effect of local and non-local thermodynamic equilibrium ((N)LTE) plasmas on $\beta$-decays, using orbital electron capture (EC) decays in $^{7}$Be as a model case. We begin from the model of Takahashi and Yokoi to calculate the lepton phase volume of $^{7}$Be as a function of its ionisation state and excitation level, and consequently, the configuration-dependent EC decay rate. We then calculate the in-plasma ion charge state distribution (CSD) and level population distribution (LPD) for a grid of plasma density and temperatures, using the population kinetics code FLYCHK. By combining the configuration-dependent EC rate with the CSD and LPD, we calculate the in-plasma orbital EC rate in $^{7}$Be. The results show a strong correlation between the half-life and thermodynamic conditions of the plasma, underlining the importance of measuring decay rates in laboratory plasmas and the relevance of high precision atomic configuration models. The model discussed in this work is capable of calculating EC and bound state $\beta$ decay (BSBD) rates in both low-density NLTE and high-density LTE plasmas. We conclude by validating our model with state-of-the-art data in literature on isotopes of Pr and Dy, and by proposing future extension of the model to laboratory magnetoplasmas and stellar interiors aimed at improving nucleosynthesis models.</description>

      <title>Efficient single-stage optimization of islands in finite-$\beta$ stellarator equilibria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first single-stage optimization of islands in finite-$\beta$ stellarator equilibria. Stellarator optimization is traditionally performed as a two-stage process; in the first stage, an optimal equilibrium is calculated which balances a set of competing constraints, and in the second stage a set of coils is found that supports said equilibrium. Stage one is generally performed using a representation for the equilibrium that assumes nestedness of flux surfaces, even though this is not warranted and occasionally undesired. The second stage optimization of coils is never perfect, and the mismatch leads to worse performing equilibria, and further deteriorates if additional constraints such as force minimization, coil torsion or port access are included. The higher fidelity of single-stage optimization is especially important for the optimization of islands as these are incredibly sensitive to changes in the field. In this paper we demonstrate an optimization scheme capable of optimizing islands in finite $\beta$ stellarator equilibria directly from coils. We furthermore develop and demonstrate a method to reduce the dimensionality of the single-stage optimization problem to that of the first stage in the two-stage approach.</description>

      <title>Observations of Switchback Chains in a Double Solar Proton Event</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although recent research suggests a link in support of a model of switchback formation in the solar corona via interchange reconnection that is propagated outward with the solar wind and similarities in their ion composition to plasma instability produced plasmoids, these plasma instabilities have yet to be observationally linked to magnetic switchbacks. In this paper we aim to use the theoretical framework of a twin coronal mass ejection event which is known to include interchange reconnection processes and compare this model with experimental observations using Parker Solar Probe FIELDS and $\isis$ instrumentationof an actual event containing two CMEs identified via the associated solar proton event in order to further test and refine the hypothesis of interchange reconnection as a possible physical origin for the magnetic switchback phenomenon. We also intend to introduce a plasma model for the formation of the switchbacks noted within the CME event.</description>

      <title>Energetic Ion Composition as a Means of Investigating the Physical Origins of Alpha Particle Heavy Magnetic Switchbacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic switchbacks are of continuing interest to the scientific community due to the fact that the phenomenon has not been completely understood. Although most of the research into them in the Parker Solar Probe era has largely focused on creating a theoretical framework for causing the field reversal through magnetic interchange reconnection, reconnecting streams of plasma in the solar wind, or shear driven turbulence, it remains unclear to what extent these models may or may not represent the underlying physical reality of magnetic switchbacks. In this paper, we present the results of our study on the energetic ion composition of magnetic switchback events using statistical methods with the aim of obtaining new insights into the underlying physics. In doing so, we find consistent differences in arrival times of the peak flux of different energetic ion species in magnetic switchbacks which are indicative of switchback formed remotely in the solar corona and propagated outwards in the solar wind. We also find that while the data does not directly contradict a linear interchange reconnection model nor the flux rope driven interchange reconnection model, the structure of the plasma within the switchbacks themselves is reminiscent of reconnection produced plasmoids.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the Trigger Mechanism of Explosive Reconnection in Partially Ionized Solar Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Plasmoid instability is usually accounted for the onset of fast reconnection events observed in astrophysical plasmas. However, the measured reconnection rate from observations can be one order of magnitude higher than that derived from MHD simulations. In this study, we present the results of magnetic reconnection in the partially ionized low solar atmosphere based on 2.5D magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulations. The whole reconnection process covers two different fast reconnection phases. In the first phase, the slow Sweet-Parker reconnection transits to the plasmoid-mediated reconnection, and the reconnection rate reaches about 0.02. In the second phase, a faster explosive reconnection appears, with the reconnection rate reaching above 0.06. At the same time, a sharp decrease in plasma temperature and density at the principle X-point is observed which is associated with the strong radiative cooling, the ejection of hot plasma from the local reconnection region or the motion of principle X-point from hot and denser region to cool and less dense one along the narrow current sheet. This causes gas pressure depletion and the increasing of magnetic diffusion at the main X-point, resulting in the local Petschek-like reconnection and a violent and rapid increase in the reconnection rate. This study for the first time reveals a common phenomenon that the plasmoid dominated reconnection transits to an explosive faster reconnection with the rate approaching the order of 0.1 in partially ionized plasma in the MHD scale.</description>

      <title>Molecular dynamics simulation for coalescence of vacancies in tungsten crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We performed molecular dynamics simulations of coalescence of two vacancies in a tungsten (W) crystal to elucidate the effect of temperature and hydrogen atoms. Simulations were performed for two types of vacancy structures, $\mathrm{V}_9 + \mathrm{W}_1 + \mathrm{V}_9$ and $\mathrm{V}_{10} + \mathrm{W}_4 + \mathrm{V}_{10}$ ($\mathrm{V}_{n}$ means that a vacancy corresponds to the absence of $n$ W atoms, and $\mathrm{W}_{m}$ indicates that there are $m$ W atoms between two vacancies) in various cases of temperature and hydrogen atom concentration. Under the vacancy structure $\mathrm{V}_9 + \mathrm{W}_1 + \mathrm{V}_9$, we observed vacancy coalescence for all the cases of the temperature and the number of hydrogen atoms. Evaluating the potential energy required for removing one of the W atoms between two vacancies, we found that high temperature and existing hydrogen atoms in the vacancies facilitate vacancy coalescence, and that under the structure $\mathrm{V}_{10} + \mathrm{W}_4 + \mathrm{V}_{10}$, hydrogen atoms facilitate vacancy coalescence most strongly when the number is around 45 to 54 in each vacancy.</description>

      <title>Quantum Electron Dynamics in Helium Ion Injection onto Tungsten Surfaces by Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The neutralization process of an ion particle on a surface is key issue of the plasma-wall interaction (PWI). We investigated helium (He) ion injection onto a tungsten surface using time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) simulation. We developed the TDDFT code QUMASUN for this study, simulating the process of electron transfer from the surface to the He nucleus by solving the time evolution of electron wave function and the classical motion of nuclei simultaneously. Our results show that the probabilities of injected $\text{He}^{2+}$ changing into $\text{He}^{1+}$ and $\text{He}^{0}$ on the surface are approximately 40 percent and 13 percent, respectively. The captured electrons by $\text{He}^{1+}$ and $\text{He}^{0}$ predominantly occupy the 2s and 2p orbitals, corresponding to excited states. In addition, we stated some challenges for applying TDDFT to plasma-wall interactions.</description>

      <title>Characterization of admissible quasisymmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03352v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We solve "half" the problem of finding three-dimensional quasisymmetric magnetic fields that do not necessarily satisfy force balance. This involves determining which hidden symmetries are admissible as quasisymmetries, and then showing explicitly how to construct quasisymmetric magnetic fields given an admissible symmetry. The admissibility conditions take the form of a system of overdetermined nonlinear partial differential equations involving second derivatives of the symmetry's infinitesimal generator.</description>
