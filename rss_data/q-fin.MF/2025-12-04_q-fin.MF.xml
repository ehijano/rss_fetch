      <title>A Stochastic Thermodynamics Approach to Price Impact and Round-Trip Arbitrage: Theory and Empirical Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a comprehensive theoretical framework that imports concepts from stochastic thermodynamics to model price impact and characterize the feasibility of round-trip arbitrage in financial markets. A trading cycle is treated as a non-equilibrium thermodynamic process, where price impact represents dissipative work and market noise plays the role of thermal fluctuations. The paper proves a Financial Second Law: under general convex impact functionals, any round-trip trading strategy yields non-positive expected profit. This structural constraint is complemented by a fluctuation theorem that bounds the probability of profitable cycles in terms of dissipated work and market volatility. The framework introduces a statistical ensemble of trading strategies governed by a Gibbs measure, leading to a free energy decomposition that connects expected cost, strategy entropy, and a market temperature parameter. The framework provides rigorous, testable inequalities linking microstructural impact to macroscopic no-arbitrage conditions, offering a novel physics-inspired perspective on market efficiency. The paper derives explicit analytical results for prototypical trading strategies and discusses empirical validation protocols.</description>

      <title>Asset-liability management with Epstein-Zin utility under stochastic interest rate and unknown market price of risk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02158v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper solves a consumption-investment choice problem with Epstein-Zin recursive utility under partial information--unobservable market price of risk. The main novelty is the introduction of a terminal liability constraint, a feature directly motivated by practical portfolio management and insurance applications but absent from the recursive utility literature. Such constraint gives rise to a coupled forward-backward stochastic differential equation (FBSDE) whose well-posedness has not been addressed in earlier work. We provide an explicit solution to this FBSDE system--contrasting with the typical existence and uniqueness results with no closed-form expressions in the literature. Under mild additional assumptions, we also establish the Malliavin differentiability of the solution allowing the optimal investment strategy to be expressed as a conditional expectation of random variables that can be efficiently simulated. These results allows us to obtain the explicit expressions of the optimal controls and the value function. Finally, we quantify the utility loss from ignoring learning about the market price of risk, highlighting the economic significance of partial information.</description>
