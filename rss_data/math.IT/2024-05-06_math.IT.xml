      <title>On one-orbit cyclic subspace codes of $\mathcal{G}_q(n,3)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Subspace codes have recently been used for error correction in random network coding. In this work, we focus on one-orbit cyclic subspace codes. If $S$ is an $\mathbb{F}_q$-subspace of $\mathbb{F}_{q^n}$, then the one-orbit cyclic subspace code defined by $S$ is \[ \mathrm{Orb}(S)=\{\alpha S \colon \alpha \in \mathbb{F}_{q^n}^*\}, \]where $\alpha S=\lbrace \alpha s \colon s\in S\rbrace$ for any $\alpha\in \mathbb{F}_{q^n}^*$. Few classification results of subspace codes are known, therefore it is quite natural to initiate a classification of cyclic subspace codes, especially in the light of the recent classification of the isometries for cyclic subspace codes. We consider three-dimensional one-orbit cyclic subspace codes, which are divided into three families: the first one containing only $\mathrm{Orb}(\mathbb{F}_{q^3})$; the second one containing the optimum-distance codes; and the third one whose elements are codes with minimum distance $2$. We study inequivalent codes in the latter two families.</description>

      <title>Stability of the Ghurye-Olkin Characterization of Vector Gaussian Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stability of the Ghurye-Olkin (GO) characterization of Gaussian vectors is analyzed using a partition of the vectors into equivalence classes defined by their matrix factors. The sum of the vectors in each class is near-Gaussian in the characteristic function (c.f.) domain if the GO independence condition is approximately met in the c.f. domain. All vectors have the property that any vector projection is near-Gaussian in the distribution function (d.f.) domain. The proofs of these c.f. and d.f. stabilities use tools that establish the stabilities of theorems by Kac-Bernstein and Cram\'er, respectively. The results are used to prove stability theorems for differential entropies of Gaussian vectors and blind source separation of non-Gaussian sources.</description>

      <title>One-Shot Wyner-Ziv Compression of a Uniform Source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the one-shot version of the classical Wyner-Ziv problem where a source is compressed in a lossy fashion when only the decoder has access to a correlated side information. Following the entropy-constrained quantization framework, we assume a scalar quantizer followed by variable length entropy coding. We consider compression of a uniform source, motivated by its role in the compression of processes with low-dimensional features embedded within a high-dimensional ambient space. We find upper and lower bounds to the entropy-distortion functions of the uniform source for quantized and noisy side information, and illustrate tightness of the bounds at high compression rates.</description>

      <title>Towards Green Communication: Soft Decoding Scheme for OOK Signals in Zero-Energy Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The booming of Internet-of-Things (IoT) is expected to provide more intelligent and reliable communication services for higher network coverage, massive connectivity, and low-cost solutions for 6G services. However, frequent charging and battery replacement of these massive IoT devices brings a series of challenges. Zero energy devices, which rely on energy-harvesting technologies and can operate without battery replacement or charging, play a pivotal role in facilitating the massive use of IoT devices. In order to enable reliable communications of such low-power devices, Manchester-coded on-off keying (OOK) modulation and non-coherent detections are attractive techniques due to their energy efficiency, robustness in noisy environments, and simplicity in receiver design. Moreover, to extend their communication range, employing channel coding along with enhanced detection schemes is crucial. In this paper, a novel soft-decision decoder is designed for OOK-based low-power receivers to enhance their detection performance. In addition, exact closed-form expressions and two simplified approximations are derived for the log-likelihood ratio (LLR), an essential metric for soft decoding. Numerical results demonstrate the significant coverage gain achieved through soft decoding for convolutional code.</description>

      <title>The Economy and Public Diplomacy: An Analysis of RT's Economic Content and Context on Facebook</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With globalization's rise, economic interdependence's impacts have become a prominent factor affecting personal lives, as well as national and international dynamics. This study examines RT's public diplomacy efforts on its non-Russian Facebook accounts over the past five years to identify the prominence of economic topics across language accounts. Computational analysis, including word embeddings and statistical methods, investigates how offline economic indicators, like currency values and oil prices, correspond to RT's online economic content changes. The results demonstrate that RT uses message reinforcement associated economic topics as an audience targeting strategy and differentiates their use with changing currency and oil values.</description>

      <title>GRAND Massive Parallel Decoding Framework for Low Latency in Beyond 5G</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a massive parallel decoding GRAND framework. The framework introduces two novelties: 1. A likelihood function for $M$-QAM demodulated signals that effectively reduces the symbol error pattern space from $\mathcal{O}(5^{N/\log_2 M})$ down to $\mathcal{O}(4^{N/\log_2 M})$; and 2. A massively parallel matrix-vector multiplication for matrices of size $K\times N$ ($K \leq N$) that performs the multiplication in just $\mathcal{O}(\log_2 N)$ steps. We then apply the proposed GRAND approach to codes and operational modulation techniques used in the current 5G NR standard. Our framework is applicable not just to short codewords but to the full range of codewords from 32 bits up to 1024 bits used in the control channels of 5G NR. We also present simulation results with parity-check matrices of Polar codes with rate $R=1/2$ obtained from the 5G NR universal reliability sequence.</description>

      <title>Channel Orthogonalization in Panel-Based LIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large intelligent surface (LIS) has gained momentum as a potential 6G-enabling technology that expands the benefits of massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO). On the other hand, orthogonal space-division multiplexing (OSDM) may give a promising direction for efficient exploitation of the spatial resources, analogous as what is achieved with orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) in the frequency domain. To this end, we study how to enforce channels orthogonality in a panel-based LIS scenario. Our proposed method consists of having a subset of active LIS-panels coherently serving a set of users, and another subset of LIS-panels operating in semi-passive mode by implementing a receive and re-transmit (RRTx) process. This results in an inter-symbol interference (ISI) channel, where we characterize the semi-passive processing required to achieve simultaneous orthogonality in time and space. We then employ the remaining degrees of freedom (DoFs) from the orthogonality constraint to minimize the semi-passive processing power, where we derive a closed-form global minimizer, allowing for efficient implementation of the proposed scheme.</description>

      <title>Common Randomness Generation from Sources with Infinite Polish Alphabet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the problem of common randomness (CR) generation in the basic two-party communication setting in which a sender and a receiver aim to agree on a common random variable with high probability. The terminals observe independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) samples of sources with an arbitrary distribution defined on a Polish alphabet and are allowed to communicate as little as possible over a noisy, memoryless channel. We establish single-letter upper and lower bounds on the CR capacity for the specified model. The derived bounds hold with equality except for at most countably many points where discontinuity issues might arise.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Network based Active and Passive Beamforming for Distributed STAR-RIS-Assisted Multi-User MISO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates a joint active and passive beamforming design for distributed simultaneous transmitting and reflecting (STAR) reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) assisted multi-user (MU)- mutiple input single output (MISO) systems, where the energy splitting (ES) mode is considered for the STAR-RIS. We aim to design the active beamforming vectors at the base station (BS) and the passive beamforming at the STAR-RIS to maximize the user sum rate under transmitting power constraints. The formulated problem is non-convex and nontrivial to obtain the global optimum due to the coupling between active beamforming vectors and STAR-RIS phase shifts. To efficiently solve the problem, we propose a novel graph neural network (GNN)-based framework. Specifically, we first model the interactions among users and network entities are using a heterogeneous graph representation. A heterogeneous graph neural network (HGNN) implementation is then introduced to directly optimizes beamforming vectors and STAR-RIS coefficients with the system objective. Numerical results show that the proposed approach yields efficient performance compared to the previous benchmarks. Furthermore, the proposed GNN is scalable with various system configurations.</description>

      <title>Sampling to Achieve the Goal: An Age-aware Remote Markov Decision Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Age of Information (AoI) has been recognized as an important metric to measure the freshness of information. Central to this consensus is that minimizing AoI can enhance the freshness of information, thereby facilitating the accuracy of subsequent decision-making processes. However, to date the direct causal relationship that links AoI to the utility of the decision-making process is unexplored. To fill this gap, this paper provides a sampling-control co-design problem, referred to as an age-aware remote Markov Decision Process (MDP) problem, to explore this unexplored relationship. Our framework revisits the sampling problem in [1] with a refined focus: moving from AoI penalty minimization to directly optimizing goal-oriented remote decision-making process under random delay. We derive that the age-aware remote MDP problem can be reduced to a standard MDP problem without delays, and reveal that treating AoI solely as a metric for optimization is not optimal in achieving remote decision making. Instead, AoI can serve as important side information to facilitate remote decision making.</description>

      <title>Coding for Synthesis Defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by DNA based data storage system, we investigate the errors that occur when synthesizing DNA strands in parallel, where each strand is appended one nucleotide at a time by the machine according to a template supersequence. If there is a cycle such that the machine fails, then the strands meant to be appended at this cycle will not be appended, and we refer to this as a synthesis defect. In this paper, we present two families of codes correcting synthesis defects, which are t-known-synthesis-defect correcting codes and t-synthesis-defect correcting codes. For the first one, it is assumed that the defective cycles are known, and each of the codeword is a quaternary sequence. We provide constructions for this family of codes for t = 1, 2, with redundancy log 4 and log n+18 log 3, respectively. For the second one, the codeword is a set of M ordered sequences, and we give constructions for t = 1, 2 to show a strategy for constructing this family of codes. Finally, we derive a lower bound on the redundancy for single-known-synthesis-defect correcting codes, which assures that our construction is almost optimal.</description>

      <title>Equal Requests are Asymptotically Hardest for Data Recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a distributed storage system serving hot data, the data recovery performance becomes important, captured e.g. by the service rate. We give partial evidence for it being hardest to serve a sequence of equal user requests (as in PIR coding regime) both for concrete and random user requests and server contents.
  We prove that a constant request sequence is locally hardest to serve: If enough copies of each vector are stored in servers, then if a request sequence with all requests equal can be served then we can still serve it if a few requests are changed.
  For random iid server contents, with number of data symbols constant (for simplicity) and the number of servers growing, we show that the maximum number of user requests we can serve divided by the number of servers we need approaches a limit almost surely. For uniform server contents, we show this limit is 1/2, both for sequences of copies of a fixed request and of any requests, so it is at least as hard to serve equal requests as any requests. For iid requests independent from the uniform server contents the limit is at least 1/2 and equal to 1/2 if requests are all equal to a fixed request almost surely, confirming the same.
  As a building block, we deduce from a 1952 result of Marshall Hall, Jr. on abelian groups, that any collection of half as many requests as coded symbols in the doubled binary simplex code can be served by this code. This implies the fractional version of the Functional Batch Code Conjecture that allows half-servers.</description>

      <title>Special matrices over finite fields and their applications to quantum error-correcting codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The matrix-product (MP) code $\mathcal{C}_{A,k}:=[\mathcal{C}_{1},\mathcal{C}_{2},\ldots,\mathcal{C}_{k}]\cdot A$ with a non-singular by column (NSC) matrix $A$ plays an important role in constructing good quantum error-correcting codes. In this paper, we study the MP code when the defining matrix $A$ satisfies the condition that $AA^{\dag}$ is $(D,\tau)$-monomial. We give an explicit formula for calculating the dimension of the Hermitian hull of a MP code. We provide the necessary and sufficient conditions that a MP code is Hermitian dual-containing (HDC), almost Hermitian dual-containing (AHDC), Hermitian self-orthogonal (HSO), almost Hermitian self-orthogonal (AHSO), and Hermitian LCD, respectively. We theoretically determine the number of all possible ways involving the relationships among the constituent codes to yield a MP code with these properties, respectively. We give alternative necessary and sufficient conditions for a MP code to be AHDC and AHSO, respectively, and show several cases where a MP code is not AHDC or AHSO. We provide the construction methods of HDC and AHDC MP codes, including those with optimal minimum distance lower bounds.</description>

      <title>Privacy-aware Berrut Approximated Coded Computing for Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is an interesting strategy that enables the collaborative training of an AI model among different data owners without revealing their private datasets. Even so, FL has some privacy vulnerabilities that have been tried to be overcome by applying some techniques like Differential Privacy (DP), Homomorphic Encryption (HE), or Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC). However, these techniques have some important drawbacks that might narrow their range of application: problems to work with non-linear functions and to operate large matrix multiplications and high communication and computational costs to manage semi-honest nodes. In this context, we propose a solution to guarantee privacy in FL schemes that simultaneously solves the previously mentioned problems. Our proposal is based on the Berrut Approximated Coded Computing, a technique from the Coded Distributed Computing paradigm, adapted to a Secret Sharing configuration, to provide input privacy to FL in a scalable way. It can be applied for computing non-linear functions and treats the special case of distributed matrix multiplication, a key primitive at the core of many automated learning tasks. Because of these characteristics, it could be applied in a wide range of FL scenarios, since it is independent of the machine learning models or aggregation algorithms used in the FL scheme. We provide analysis of the achieve privacy and complexity of our solution and, due to the extensive numerical results performed, it can be observed a good trade-off between privacy and precision.</description>

      <title>Identification of SNPs in genomes using GRAMEP, an alignment-free method based on the Principle of Maximum Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advances in high throughput sequencing technologies provide a large number of genomes to be analyzed, so computational methodologies play a crucial role in analyzing and extracting knowledge from the data generated. Investigating genomic mutations is critical because of their impact on chromosomal evolution, genetic disorders, and diseases. It is common to adopt aligning sequences for analyzing genomic variations, however, this approach can be computationally expensive and potentially arbitrary in scenarios with large datasets. Here, we present a novel method for identifying single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in DNA sequences from assembled genomes. This method uses the principle of maximum entropy to select the most informative k-mers specific to the variant under investigation. The use of this informative k-mer set enables the detection of variant-specific mutations in comparison to a reference sequence. In addition, our method offers the possibility of classifying novel sequences with no need for organism-specific information. GRAMEP demonstrated high accuracy in both in silico simulations and analyses of real viral genomes, including Dengue, HIV, and SARS-CoV-2. Our approach maintained accurate SARS-CoV-2 variant identification while demonstrating a lower computational cost compared to the gold-standard statistical tools.

Abstract: We establish the fundamental limits in the approximation of Lipschitz functions by deep ReLU neural networks with finite-precision weights. Specifically, three regimes, namely under-, over-, and proper quantization, in terms of minimax approximation error behavior as a function of network weight precision, are identified. This is accomplished by deriving nonasymptotic tight lower and upper bounds on the minimax approximation error. Notably, in the proper-quantization regime, neural networks exhibit memory-optimality in the approximation of Lipschitz functions. Deep networks have an inherent advantage over shallow networks in achieving memory-optimality. We also develop the notion of depth-precision tradeoff, showing that networks with high-precision weights can be converted into functionally equivalent deeper networks with low-precision weights, while preserving memory-optimality. This idea is reminiscent of sigma-delta analog-to-digital conversion, where oversampling rate is traded for resolution in the quantization of signal samples. We improve upon the best-known ReLU network approximation results for Lipschitz functions and describe a refinement of the bit extraction technique which could be of independent general interest.</description>

      <title>Cooperation and Federation in Distributed Radar Point Cloud Processing</title>

Abstract: The paper considers the problem of human-scale RF sensing utilizing a network of resource-constrained MIMO radars with low range-azimuth resolution. The radars operate in the mmWave band and obtain time-varying 3D point cloud (PC) information that is sensitive to body movements. They also observe the same scene from different views and cooperate while sensing the environment using a sidelink communication channel. Conventional cooperation setups allow the radars to mutually exchange raw PC information to improve ego sensing. The paper proposes a federation mechanism where the radars exchange the parameters of a Bayesian posterior measure of the observed PCs, rather than raw data. The radars act as distributed parameter servers to reconstruct a global posterior (i.e., federated posterior) using Bayesian tools. The paper quantifies and compares the benefits of radar federation with respect to cooperation mechanisms. Both approaches are validated by experiments with a real-time demonstration platform. Federation makes minimal use of the sidelink communication channel (20 {\div} 25 times lower bandwidth use) and is less sensitive to unresolved targets. On the other hand, cooperation reduces the mean absolute target estimation error of about 20%.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Large Language Models for Structured Science Summarization in the Open Research Knowledge Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Structured science summaries or research contributions using properties or dimensions beyond traditional keywords enhances science findability. Current methods, such as those used by the Open Research Knowledge Graph (ORKG), involve manually curating properties to describe research papers' contributions in a structured manner, but this is labor-intensive and inconsistent between the domain expert human curators. We propose using Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically suggest these properties. However, it's essential to assess the readiness of LLMs like GPT-3.5, Llama 2, and Mistral for this task before application. Our study performs a comprehensive comparative analysis between ORKG's manually curated properties and those generated by the aforementioned state-of-the-art LLMs. We evaluate LLM performance through four unique perspectives: semantic alignment and deviation with ORKG properties, fine-grained properties mapping accuracy, SciNCL embeddings-based cosine similarity, and expert surveys comparing manual annotations with LLM outputs. These evaluations occur within a multidisciplinary science setting. Overall, LLMs show potential as recommendation systems for structuring science, but further finetuning is recommended to improve their alignment with scientific tasks and mimicry of human expertise.</description>

      <title>An Information Theoretic Perspective on Conformal Prediction</title>

Abstract: Conformal Prediction (CP) is a distribution-free uncertainty estimation framework that constructs prediction sets guaranteed to contain the true answer with a user-specified probability. Intuitively, the size of the prediction set encodes a general notion of uncertainty, with larger sets associated with higher degrees of uncertainty. In this work, we leverage information theory to connect conformal prediction to other notions of uncertainty. More precisely, we prove three different ways to upper bound the intrinsic uncertainty, as described by the conditional entropy of the target variable given the inputs, by combining CP with information theoretical inequalities. Moreover, we demonstrate two direct and useful applications of such connection between conformal prediction and information theory: (i) more principled and effective conformal training objectives that generalize previous approaches and enable end-to-end training of machine learning models from scratch, and (ii) a natural mechanism to incorporate side information into conformal prediction. We empirically validate both applications in centralized and federated learning settings, showing our theoretical results translate to lower inefficiency (average prediction set size) for popular CP methods.</description>

      <title>Contraction of Locally Differentially Private Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.13386v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the contraction properties of locally differentially private mechanisms. More specifically, we derive tight upper bounds on the divergence between $PK$ and $QK$ output distributions of an $\epsilon$-LDP mechanism $K$ in terms of a divergence between the corresponding input distributions $P$ and $Q$, respectively. Our first main technical result presents a sharp upper bound on the $\chi^2$-divergence $\chi^2(PK}\|QK)$ in terms of $\chi^2(P\|Q)$ and $\varepsilon$. We also show that the same result holds for a large family of divergences, including KL-divergence and squared Hellinger distance. The second main technical result gives an upper bound on $\chi^2(PK\|QK)$ in terms of total variation distance $\mathsf{TV}(P, Q)$ and $\epsilon$. We then utilize these bounds to establish locally private versions of the van Trees inequality, Le Cam's, Assouad's, and the mutual information methods, which are powerful tools for bounding minimax estimation risks. These results are shown to lead to better privacy analyses than the state-of-the-arts in several statistical problems such as entropy and discrete distribution estimation, non-parametric density estimation, and hypothesis testing.</description>

Abstract: The unprecedented development of non-terrestrial networks (NTN) utilizes the low-altitude airspace for commercial and social flying activities. The integration of NTN and terrestrial networks leads to the emergence of low-altitude economy (LAE). A series of LAE application scenarios are enabled by the sensing, communication, and transportation functionalities of the aircrafts. The prerequisite technologies supporting LAE are introduced in this paper, including the network coverage and aircrafts detection. The LAE functionalities assisted by aircrafts with respect to sensing and communication are then summarized, including the terrestrial and non-terrestrial targets sensing, ubiquitous coverage, relaying, and traffic offloading. Finally, several future directions are identified, including aircrafts collaboration, energy efficiency, and artificial intelligence enabled LAE.</description>

      <title>The geodesic dispersion phenomenon in random fields dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14482v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Random fields are ubiquitous mathematical structures in physics, with applications ranging from thermodynamics and statistical physics to quantum field theory and cosmology. Recent works on information geometry of Gaussian random fields proposed mathematical expressions for the components of the metric tensor of the underlying parametric space, allowing the computation of the curvature in each point of the manifold. In this study, our hypothesis is that time irreversibility in Gaussian random fields dynamics is a direct consequence of intrinsic geometric properties (curvature) of their parametric space. In order to validate this hypothesis, we compute the components of the metric tensor and derive the twenty seven Christoffel symbols of the metric to define the Euler-Lagrange equations, a system of partial differential equations that are used to build geodesic curves in Riemannian manifolds. After that, by the application of the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method and Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation, we numerically build geodesic curves starting from an arbitrary initial point in the manifold. The obtained results show that, when the system undergoes phase transitions, the geodesic curve obtained by time reversing the computational simulation diverges from the original curve, showing a strange effect that we called the geodesic dispersion phenomenon, which suggests that time irreversibility in random fields is related to the intrinsic geometry of their parametric space.</description>

      <title>Random Subgraph Detection Using Queries</title>

Abstract: The planted densest subgraph detection problem refers to the task of testing whether in a given (random) graph there is a subgraph that is unusually dense. Specifically, we observe an undirected and unweighted graph on $n$ vertices. Under the null hypothesis, the graph is a realization of an Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi graph with edge probability (or, density) $q$. Under the alternative, there is a subgraph on $k$ vertices with edge probability $p&gt;q$. The statistical as well as the computational barriers of this problem are well-understood for a wide range of the edge parameters $p$ and $q$. In this paper, we consider a natural variant of the above problem, where one can only observe a relatively small part of the graph using adaptive edge queries. For this model, we determine the number of queries necessary and sufficient (accompanied with a quasi-polynomial optimal algorithm) for detecting the presence of the planted subgraph. We also propose a polynomial-time algorithm which is able to detect the planted subgraph, albeit with more queries compared to the above lower bound. We conjecture that in the leftover regime, no polynomial-time algorithms exist. Our results resolve two open questions posed in the past literature.</description>

      <title>Compressed sensing for inverse problems and the sample complexity of the sparse Radon transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.03577v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Compressed sensing allows for the recovery of sparse signals from few measurements, whose number is proportional to the sparsity of the unknown signal, up to logarithmic factors. The classical theory typically considers either random linear measurements or subsampled isometries and has found many applications, including accelerated magnetic resonance imaging, which is modeled by the subsampled Fourier transform. In this work, we develop a general theory of infinite-dimensional compressed sensing for abstract inverse problems, possibly ill-posed, involving an arbitrary forward operator. This is achieved by considering a generalized restricted isometry property, and a quasi-diagonalization property of the forward map.
  As a notable application, for the first time, we obtain rigorous recovery estimates for the sparse Radon transform (i.e., with a finite number of angles $\theta_1,\dots,\theta_m$), which models computed tomography, in both the parallel-beam and the fan-beam settings. In the case when the unknown signal is $s$-sparse with respect to an orthonormal basis of compactly supported wavelets, we prove stable recovery under the condition \[ m\gtrsim s, \] up to logarithmic factors.</description>
