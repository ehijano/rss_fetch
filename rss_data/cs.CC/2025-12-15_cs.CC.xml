      <title>On the complex zeros and the computational complexity of approximating the reliability polynomial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we relate the location of the complex zeros of the reliability polynomial to parameters at which a certain family of rational functions derived from the reliability polynomial exhibits chaotic behaviour. We use this connection to prove new results about the location of reliability zeros. In particular we show that there are zeros with modulus larger than $1$ with essentially any possible argument. We moreover use this connection to show that approximately evaluating the reliability polynomial for planar graphs at a non-positive algebraic number in the unit disk is #P-hard.</description>

      <title>A slightly improved upper bound for quantum statistical zero-knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The complexity class Quantum Statistical Zero-Knowledge ($\mathsf{QSZK}$), introduced by Watrous (FOCS 2002) and later refined in Watrous (SICOMP, 2009), has the best known upper bound $\mathsf{QIP(2)} \cap \text{co-}\mathsf{QIP(2)}$, which was simplified following the inclusion $\mathsf{QIP(2)} \subseteq \mathsf{PSPACE}$ established in Jain, Upadhyay, and Watrous (FOCS 2009). Here, $\mathsf{QIP(2)}$ denotes the class of promise problems that admit two-message quantum interactive proof systems in which the honest prover is typically \textit{computationally unbounded}, and $\text{co-}\mathsf{QIP(2)}$ denotes the complement of $\mathsf{QIP(2)}$.
  We slightly improve this upper bound to $\mathsf{QIP(2)} \cap \text{co-}\mathsf{QIP(2)}$ with a quantum linear-space honest prover. A similar improvement also applies to the upper bound for the non-interactive variant $\mathsf{NIQSZK}$. Our main techniques are an algorithmic version of the Holevo-Helstrom measurement and the Uhlmann transform, both implementable in quantum linear space, implying polynomial-time complexity in the state dimension, using the recent space-efficient quantum singular value transformation of Le Gall, Liu, and Wang (CC, to appear).</description>

      <title>The parameterized complexity of Strong Conflict-Free Vertex-Connection Colorability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper continues the study of a new variant of graph coloring with a connectivity constraint recently introduced by Hsieh et al. [COCOON 2024]. A path in a vertex-colored graph is called conflict-free if there is a color that appears exactly once on its vertices. A connected graph is said to be strongly conflict-free vertex-connection $k$-colorable if it admits a (proper) vertex $k$-coloring such that any two distinct vertices are connected by a conflict-free shortest path. Among others, we show that deciding, for a given graph $G$ and an integer $k$, whether $G$ is strongly conflict-free $k$-colorable is fixed-parameter tractable when parameterized by the vertex cover number. But under the standard complexity-theoretic assumption NP $\not\subseteq$ coNP/poly, deciding, for a given graph $G$, whether $G$ is strongly conflict-free $3$-colorable does not admit a polynomial kernel, even for bipartite graphs. This kernel lower bound is in stark contrast to the ordinal $k$-Coloring problem which is known to admit a polynomial kernel when parameterized by the vertex cover number.</description>

      <title>A Lifting Theorem for Hybrid Classical-Quantum Communication Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17227v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigates a model of hybrid classical-quantum communication complexity, in which two parties first exchange classical messages and subsequently communicate using quantum messages. We study the trade-off between the classical and quantum communication for composed functions of the form $f\circ G^n$, where $f:\{0,1\}^n\to\{\pm1\}$ and $G$ is an inner product function of $\Theta(\log n)$ bits. To prove the trade-off, we establish a novel lifting theorem for hybrid communication complexity. This theorem unifies two previously separate lifting paradigms: the query-to-communication lifting framework for classical communication complexity and the approximate-degree-to-generalized-discrepancy lifting methods for quantum communication complexity. Our hybrid lifting theorem therefore offers a new framework for proving lower bounds in hybrid classical-quantum communication models.
  As a corollary, we show that any hybrid protocol communicating $c$ classical bits followed by $q$ qubits to compute $f\circ G^n$ must satisfy $c+q^2=\Omega\big(\max\{\mathrm{deg}(f),\mathrm{bs}(f)\}\cdot\log n\big)$, where $\mathrm{deg}(f)$ is the degree of $f$ and $\mathrm{bs}(f)$ is the block sensitivity of $f$. For read-once formula $f$, this yields an almost tight trade-off: either they have to exchange $\Theta\big(n\cdot\log n\big)$ classical bits or $\widetilde\Theta\big(\sqrt n\cdot\log n\big)$ qubits, showing that classical pre-processing cannot significantly reduce the quantum communication required. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first non-trivial trade-off between classical and quantum communication in hybrid two-way communication complexity.</description>

      <title>The Query Complexity of Local Search and Brouwer in Rounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.00061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2101.00061v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the query complexity of finding a local minimum of a function defined on a graph. This abstract problem is fundamental to many optimization tasks, such as finding a local minimum of the loss function when training deep neural networks. In such applications, each query is an expensive loss evaluation, making it crucial to parallelize computations. This motivates our study of local search where at most $k$ rounds of interaction (aka adaptivity) with the oracle are allowed.
  We focus on the $d$-dimensional grid $\{1, 2, \ldots, n \}^d$, where the dimension $d \geq 2$ is a constant. Our main contribution is to give algorithms and lower bounds that characterize the query complexity of finding a local minimum in $k$ rounds, when $k$ is constant and polynomial in $n$, respectively.
  Our proof technique for lower bounding the query complexity in rounds may be of independent interest as an alternative to the classical relational adversary method of Aaronson from the fully adaptive setting. The local search analysis also enables us to characterize the query complexity of computing a Brouwer fixed point in rounds.</description>

      <title>Tight Bounds for Quantum Phase Estimation and Related Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.04908v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Phase estimation, due to Kitaev [arXiv'95], is one of the most fundamental subroutines in quantum computing. In the basic scenario, one is given black-box access to a unitary $U$, and an eigenstate $\lvert \psi \rangle$ of $U$ with unknown eigenvalue $e^{i\theta}$, and the task is to estimate the eigenphase $\theta$ within $\pm\delta$, with high probability. The cost of an algorithm for us is the number of applications of $U$ and $U^{-1}$.
  We tightly characterize the cost of several variants of phase estimation where we are no longer given an eigenstate, but are required to estimate the maximum eigenphase of $U$, aided by advice in the form of states (or a unitary preparing those states) which are promised to have at least a certain overlap $\gamma$ with the top eigenspace.
  We give algorithms and nearly matching lower bounds for all ranges of parameters.
  We show that a small number of copies of the advice state (or of an advice-preparing unitary) are not significantly better than having no advice at all. We also show that having lots of advice (applications of the advice-preparing unitary) does not significantly reduce cost, and neither does knowledge of the eigenbasis of $U$. We immediately obtain a lower bound on the complexity of the Unitary recurrence time problem, resolving an open question of She and Yuen~[ITCS'23].
  Lastly, we study how efficiently one can reduce the error probability in the basic phase-estimation scenario. We show that a phase-estimation algorithm with precision $\delta$ and error probability $\epsilon$ has cost $\Omega\left(\frac{1}{\delta}\log\frac{1}{\epsilon}\right)$, matching an easy upper bound. This contrasts with some other scenarios in quantum computing (e.g., search) where error-probability reduction costs only a factor $O(\sqrt{\log(1/\epsilon)})$. Our lower bound uses a variant of the polynomial method with trigonometric polynomials.</description>
