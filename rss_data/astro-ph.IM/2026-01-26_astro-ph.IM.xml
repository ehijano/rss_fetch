      <title>proto-Lightspeed: a high-speed, ultra-low read noise imager on the Magellan Clay Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: proto-Lightspeed is a new instrument that has been commissioned on the Nasmyth East port of the Magellan Clay Telescope at Las Campanas Observatory to deliver high-speed optical imaging with deep sub-electron read noise. Making use of commercial re-imaging lenses and the ORCA-Quest 2 camera from Hamamatsu, proto-Lightspeed images a field $1'$ in diameter at up to $200$ Hz or windowed fields at higher rates, up to 6600 Hz for a $1.6''\times 1'$ field of view. proto-Lightspeed delivers seeing-limited image quality in the $g'$, $r'$, and $i'$ bands and adjustable magnification for pixel scales between $0.017''-0.050''$. proto-Lightspeed is well suited to studying compact binary systems, exoplanet transits, rapid flaring associated with accretion, periodic optical emission from pulsars, occultations of background stars by small trans-Neptunian Objects, and any other rapidly variable source. proto-Lightspeed will be a P.I. instrument beginning in 2026B, available for use by members of the Magellan Consortium. In this paper, we discuss the design and performance of the instrument, results from its two commissioning runs, and plans for a facility instrument, Lightspeed, to support simultaneous multicolor imaging across a $7'\times4'$ field.</description>

      <title>Characterization of the commercial spectrograph system for astronomical observations: PIXIS 1300BX Camera and IsoPlane 320A Spectrograph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the result from a comprehensive laboratory and on-sky characterization of the commercial spectrograph system consisting of a PIXIS 1300BX charge-coupled device (CCD) camera and an IsoPlane 320A spectrograph as part of the preparation of the forthcoming all-sky spectroscopic survey of nearby galaxies (A-SPEC). In the laboratory, we have quantified readout noise, dark current, gain, and full-well capacity via bias, dark, and photon transfer curve analysis at all acquisition modes. To do that, we have developed a gradient correction technique to address row-dependent signal gradients in the image, which are caused by the shutter-less condition of our CCD camera test setup. The technique successfully reproduces the values in the manufacturer specifications. We also have measured quantum efficiency exceeding 80% from 400--800 nm and $\gtrsim$ 90% between 450--750 nm, with sub-second persistence decay, making it ideal for rapid, multi-object spectroscopy. Using a set of diffraction gratings (150, 300, and 600 gr mm$^{-1}$), we have evaluated the spatial separability of multiple spectra and spectral resolution. We have conducted a test observation with this spectrograph system at the Seoul National University Astronomical Observatory (SAO) 1 m telescope and successfully demonstrated its capability of multi-object spectroscopy with moderate resolution of $R \approx 600 - 2600$. We release all Python codes for the test and recipes to facilitate further instrument evaluations.</description>

      <title>ALMA publication statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The success of an astronomical facility is measured by its scientific impact. A principal metric for this impact is the ensemble of peer-reviewed publications based on the observational data obtained by the facility. We present a comprehensive study of the statistics of the 4,190 refereed publications of the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) in the period from 2012 to 2024. The publications have received 169,985 citations and are based on 2,670 ALMA projects totalling 19,265 hours of 12-m-array-equivalent observing time. Our study analyses publication statistics related to various aspects, e.g. science categories, geographical distribution, archival research, time to publication, publication fraction, and citations. We also look into the community and compare ALMA with other facilities. We find that ALMA is a high-impact observatory with an average of 41 citations per publication, ~70% of observed projects published, ~40% of publications making use of archival data in 2024, more than 9,400 unique authors, and a publication evolution following that of HST and VLT. Currently, the impact factor for ALMA publications is larger than that of all other major astronomical facilities. ALMA also plays a pivotal role in very long baseline interferometry (VLBI), substantially contributing to landmark achievements such as capturing the first image of a black hole shadow.</description>

      <title>Illuminating the Physics of Cosmic Origin and Evolution: A UK Space Frontiers 2035 White Paper</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the Universe's origins and evolution remains one of the most fundamental challenges in modern cosmology. This white paper explores three key science priorities in this field: unravelling the physics of cosmic inflation, investigating the accelerating expansion of the Universe, and precisely measuring the sum of the neutrino masses. Achieving these goals requires a dedicated survey to map the large-scale structure at high redshift in unprecedented detail. We describe how this can be achieved through a mission concept called SIRMOS, providing a high-throughput, highly multiplexed spectroscopic capability to obtain accurate redshifts for over 100 million galaxies over a wide sky area. Such a survey would leverage the deepest existing wide-area photometric catalogues for targeting, with spectra offering continuous 1.25-2.5~$\mu$m wavelength coverage at moderate resolution, allowing precise redshift measurements in the $1&lt;z&lt;4$ range with minimal bias. We outline the scientific opportunities this presents. Recent years have seen significant advances in instrumentation, including digital micromirror devices, complex telescope mirrors, large detector arrays, and data processing pipelines. While these technologies have been demonstrated in terrestrial applications, such a survey is a unique opportunity to apply these proven capabilities in space to address fundamental questions in cosmology. Participation in such a mission will simultaneously deliver a compelling science case, help align UK Space Agency and STFC strategies, demonstrate the UK's growing capability in end-to-end space missions, and strengthen the national space economy through high-value industrial participation.</description>

      <title>The Astrosky Ecosystem: An independent online platform for science communication and social networking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While almost everything that astronomers study occurs in the vacuum of space, astronomy itself does not `happen in a vacuum'. Interactions between scientists, as well as outreach to members of the public, improve extensively from access to good communication tools. Social media has become a key tool for communication in astronomy, being widely used by individuals and organizations alike for networking, outreach, and more. However, traditional social media is reliant on benevolent corporations providing a free service without compromising on quality, and the recent takeover and decline of Twitter has shown how vulnerable these platforms can be. In this proceeding, we present The Astrosky Ecosystem, which is an initiative to develop open-source tools and integrations for social media, principally the Bluesky social network. We explain how our project enables the astronomy community to operate its own social media infrastructure, independent of for-profit corporations. We also discuss some of the project's technical aspects, including its use of the AT Protocol for social networking, before concluding with ideas for the future.</description>

      <title>CosmoSlider: An educational tool for cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how cosmological parameters influence the cosmic microwave background (CMB) power spectra is a central component of modern cosmology education, but interactive exploration is often limited by computational cost or technical complexity. We present CosmoSlider, a lightweight visualization tool that enables real-time exploration of CMB power spectra as multiple cosmological parameters are varied simultaneously. The tool employs a neural-network emulator implemented using TensorFlow Lite, allowing rapid evaluation of spectra without relying on large grids of precomputed models or on-demand execution of Einstein--Boltzmann solvers. CosmoSlider is available both as an iOS application and as a web-based tool, making it accessible across platforms and suitable for use in classrooms, lectures, and self-guided study. By providing immediate visual feedback, CosmoSlider supports the development of intuition for the physical processes underlying CMB anisotropies and serves as a complementary resource to traditional theoretical instruction.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Graphical Models in Astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The field of astronomy is experiencing a data explosion driven by significant advances in observational instrumentation, and classical methods often fall short of addressing the complexity of modern astronomical datasets. Probabilistic graphical models offer powerful tools for uncovering the dependence structures and data-generating processes underlying a wide array of cosmic variables. By representing variables as nodes in a network, these models allow for the visualization and analysis of the intricate relationships that underpin theories of hierarchical structure formation within the universe. We highlight the value that graphical models bring to astronomical research by demonstrating their practical application to the study of exoplanets and host stars.</description>

      <title>A Binary-Based Reassessment of the Age and Stellar Properties of NGC 7789 Using Twelve Binary Components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a binary-based reassessment of the age of the intermediate-age open cluster NGC 7789, together with well-constrained stellar parameters for twelve components in six SB2 systems, including two eclipsing binaries. Our analysis employs a unified modelling framework that combines radial-velocity orbits, TESS light curves, and blue-to-IR spectral energy distributions (SEDs), providing a robust alternative to traditional isochrone-based age determinations. By adopting common cluster-wide parameters (age, distance, and line-of-sight extinction) when solving for the stellar parameters of the binary components, we obtain a coherent set of masses, radii, effective temperatures, and luminosities for all twelve stars. The combined SED, eclipsing-binary, and radial-velocity analysis yields a well-constrained cluster age of $1.26 \pm 0.09$ Gyr and an extinction of $A_V = 0.90 \pm 0.05$ mag, while remaining consistent with the Gaia DR3 distance of $d \simeq 2.06$ kpc used as an external prior. An independent Gaia DR3 astrometric analysis gives a distance of $2082 \pm 142$ pc and confirms the membership of all six systems. The twelve binary components occupy the turnoff and subgiant regions of the cluster, enabling stringent evolutionary tests: in the radius--mass, radius--temperature, and temperature--mass diagrams, they show excellent agreement with modern stellar evolution models for the derived cluster parameters. NGC 7789 thus serves as a valuable benchmark for multi-observable, binary-based age determinations in open cluster studies.</description>

      <title>Mercury-Ar$\chi$es: a high-performance n-body code for planet formation studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Forming planetary systems are populated by large numbers of gravitationally interacting planetary bodies, spanning from massive giant planets to small planetesimals akin to present-day asteroids and comets. All these planetary bodies are embedded in the gaseous embrace of their native protoplanetary disks, and their interactions with the disk gas play a central role in shaping their dynamical evolution and the outcomes of planet formation. These factors make realistic planet formation simulations extremely computationally demanding, which in turn means that accurately modeling the formation of planetary systems requires the use of high-performance methods. The planet formation code Mercury-Ar$\chi$es was developed to address these challenges and, since its first implementation, has been used in multiple exoplanetary and Solar System studies. Mercury-Ar$\chi$es is a parallel n-body code that builds on the widely used Mercury code and is capable of modeling the growth and migration of forming planets, the interactions between planetary bodies and the disk gas, as well as the evolving impact flux of planetesimals on forming planets across the different stages of their formation process. In this work we provide the up-to-date overview of its physical modeling capabilities and the first detailed description of its high-performance implementation based on the OpenMP directive-based parallelism for shared memory environments, to harness the multi-thread and vectorization features of modern processor architectures.</description>

      <title>The Origins of Planets for ArieL (OPAL) Key Science Project: the end-to-end planet formation campaign for the ESA space mission Ariel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing body of atmospheric observations of exoplanets from space and ground-based facilities showcases how the great diversity of the planetary population is not limited to their physical properties but extends to their compositions. The ESA space mission Ariel will observe and characterise hundreds of exoplanetary atmospheres to explore and understand the roots of this compositional diversity. To lay the foundations for the Ariel mission, the OPAL Key Science Project is tasked with creating an unprecedented library of realistic synthetic atmospheres spanning tens of elements and hundreds of molecules on which the Ariel consortium will test and validate its codes and pipelines ahead of launch. In this work we describe the aims and the pipeline of codes of the OPAL project, as well as the process through which we trace the genetic link connecting planets to their native protoplanetary disks and host stars. We present the early results of this complex and unprecedented endeavour and discuss how they highlight the great diversity of outcomes that emerge from the large degeneracy in the parameter space of possible initial conditions to the planet formation process. This, in turn, illustrates the growing importance of interdisciplinary modelling studies supported by high-performance computing methods and infrastructures to properly investigate this class of high-dimensionality problems.</description>

      <title>The 2.5-meter Wide Field Survey Telescope Real-time Data Processing Pipeline I: From raw data to alert distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15018v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Wide Field Survey Telescope (WFST) is a dedicated photometric surveying facility built jointly by the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) and the Purple Mountain Observatory (PMO). Since many of its scientific objectives rely on near-real-time data for effective analysis, prompt processing of WFST images is of great significance. To meet this need, we adapted the Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) science pipelines to handle the data collected by WFST. This paper presents the complete data processing workflow, from ingestion of raw images to the distribution of alerts, and details the primary data products generated by our pipeline. Researchers using data processed by this pipeline can refer to this document to fully understand the data processing procedures.</description>

      <title>Probing Stellar Kinematics with the Time-Asymmetric Hanbury Brown and Twiss Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13152v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Intensity interferometry (II) offers a powerful means to observe stellar objects with a high resolution. In this work, we demonstrate that II can also probe internal stellar kinematics by revealing a time-asymmetric Hanbury Brown and Twiss (HBT) effect, causing a measurable shift in the temporal correlation peak away from zero delay. We develop numerical models to simulate this effect for two distinct astrophysical scenarios: an emission-line circumstellar disk and an absorption-line binary system. Our simulations reveal a clear sensitivity of this temporal asymmetry to the system's inclination angle, velocity symmetry, and internal dynamics. This suggests that, with sufficiently high time resolution, II can be used to extract quantitative information about internal kinematics, offering a new observational window on stellar dynamics.</description>

      <title>Sustainable, Local Socio-Economic Development Through Astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04224v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Astronomy, often perceived as a distant or luxury science, holds immense potential as a driver for sustainable local socio-economic development. This paper explores how astronomy can create tangible benefits for communities through education, tourism, technology transfer, and capacity building. Using case studies from South Africa, Chile, Indonesia, and India, we demonstrate how astronomical facilities and initiatives have stimulated local economies, generated employment, supported small enterprises, and enhanced STEM participation, while simultaneously inspiring a sense of shared global heritage. The analysis identifies both successes and challenges, including unequal benefit distribution, limited local ownership, and sustainability gaps once external funding ends. Building on these lessons, we propose a practical framework/guidelines for designing, implementing, and evaluating astronomy-based community initiatives, rooted in participatory engagement and aligned with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This paper positions astronomy as a catalyst for inclusive growth, demonstrating that investment in the cosmos can translate into grounded, measurable benefits for people and places on Earth.</description>

      <title>One Attempt at Building an Inclusive &amp; Accessible Hybrid Astronomy Conference: FRB 2025</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14357</link>

Abstract: The rapid expansion of the Fast Radio Burst (FRB) field has been accompanied by a simultaneous growth of FRB conferences. While these meetings are essential for interacting with other researchers and establishing collaborations, many remain only accessible to those with substantial travel funding, flexible schedules, or geographical proximity. This introduces barriers that predominantly affect early career researchers (ECRs) and people from under-resourced regions, limiting the growth, diversity, and sustainability of the community. To address these issues, the FRB 2025 conference, held in Montr\'eal in July 2025 with over 200 participants, was designed to prioritize inclusivity and accessibility alongside scientific excellence. In this work, we describe how we implemented these goals, including: organizing committees spearheaded by ECRs, a fully hybrid format including YouTube livestreams, low registration fees, a pedagogical day at the beginning of the conference, local vegetarian catering, and the implementation of flash-talks instead of posters. From a post-conference survey of participants, we were able to assess the effectiveness of our initiatives. Notably, we received very positive feedback from the online participants, which amounted to roughly half of the attendees, especially regarding the livestreams and talk recordings. The pedagogical day was also greatly appreciated. The low registration fees naturally led to challenges, in particular with the audio-visual management, and although areas for improvement were noted, such as poster sessions and support for attendees requiring visas, the conference was generally viewed as a success. Our experience demonstrates that highly accessible, hybrid conferences are possible within modest budgets ($\$20$k CAD), and we outline recommendations for future conferences, both in the FRB field and in other domains.</description>

      <title>The FarView Low Frequency Radio Array on the Moon's Far Side: Science and Array Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16170v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: FarView is a proposed low frequency radio interferometer for deployment on the lunar far side, enabled by the Moon's radio quiet environment. Operating over 1-50 MHz inaccessible from Earth, FarView will open a new observational window and promote discovery class science in cosmology, heliophysics, Galactic and exoplanet astrophysics. The primary science is measurement of the redshifted 21 cm signal from the Cosmic Dark Ages (z=30-100), identified by the Astro2020 Decadal Survey as a priority cosmology discovery area. FarView will deliver 3D tomographic measurements and precision power spectra of neutral hydrogen in a largely linear regime, enabling tests of inflationary initial conditions, primordial non Gaussianity, dark matter properties, neutrino masses, and early dark energy. The reference design consists of 100000 crossed dipole antennas in a dense core-halo configuration spanning 200 sq km. A compact 4 km core with 83000 dipoles maximizes sensitivity to large scale cosmological modes, while 20000 halo elements extending to 14 km provide angular resolution and calibration for foreground characterization. Sensitivity forecasts indicate a 10-sigma detection of the Dark Ages 21 cm power spectrum at z=30 over five years of half duty cycle lunar night observations. An FFT-based EPIC beamformer is identified as an efficient signal processing architecture. Beyond cosmology, FarView will enable interferometric imaging of low frequency solar radio bursts, advancing space weather studies. Additional capabilities include stellar space weather observations, Galactic cosmic ray tomography via free-free absorption, and searches for auroral radio emission from exoplanet magnetospheres, a probe of exoplanet habitability. FarView represents a flagship class opportunity to establish the Moon as a platform for foundational astrophysics while delivering unique observational capabilities.</description>

      <title>Estimating Soil Electrical Parameters in the Canadian High Arctic from Impedance Measurements of the MIST Antenna Above the Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14444v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The MIST experiment aims to detect the cosmological 21-cm signal through sky observations at 25-125 MHz using a wide-beam antenna. The antenna is mounted above the soil and the beam characteristics are highly dependent on the soil's electrical properties. Accurate models for the beam obtained from electromagnetic simulations are crucial for detecting the 21-cm signal. Determining the soil properties to inform the beam simulations is therefore a very high priority for MIST. Here we report the first electrical characterization of the MIST observation site in the Canadian High Arctic, which was conducted in July, 2022. The electrical parameters were estimated using impedance measurements of the instrument's antenna, which is a very advantageous approach for MIST. Our best-fit soil model is consistent with a thawed active layer underlain by permafrost, and the parameters were estimated with a precision close to the requirements for the detection of the cosmological 21-cm signal.</description>

      <title>StarEmbed: Benchmarking Time Series Foundation Models on Astronomical Observations of Variable Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06200v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time series foundation models (TSFMs) are increasingly being adopted as highly-capable general-purpose time series representation learners. Although their training corpora are vast, they exclude astronomical time series data. Observations of stars produce peta-scale time series with unique challenges including irregular sampling and heteroskedasticity. We introduce StarEmbed, the first public benchmark for rigorous and standardized evaluation of state-of-the-art TSFMs on stellar time series observations (``light curves''). We benchmark on three scientifically-motivated downstream tasks: unsupervised clustering, supervised classification, and out-of-distribution source detection. StarEmbed integrates a catalog of expert-vetted labels with multi-variate light curves from the Zwicky Transient Facility, yielding ~40k hand-labeled light curves spread across seven astrophysical classes. We evaluate the zero-shot representation capabilities of three TSFMs (MOIRAI, Chronos, Chronos-Bolt) and a domain-specific transformer (Astromer) against handcrafted feature extraction, the long-standing baseline in the astrophysics literature. Our results demonstrate that these TSFMs, especially the Chronos models, which are trained on data completely unlike the astronomical observations, can outperform established astrophysics-specific baselines in some tasks and effectively generalize to entirely new data. In particular, TSFMs deliver state-of-the-art performance on our out-of-distribution source detection benchmark. With the first benchmark of TSFMs on astronomical time series data, we test the limits of their generalization and motivate a paradigm shift in time-domain astronomy from using task-specific, fully supervised pipelines toward adopting generic foundation model representations for the analysis of peta-scale datasets from forthcoming observatories.</description>
