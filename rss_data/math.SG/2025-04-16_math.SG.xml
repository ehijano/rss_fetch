      <title>Symplectic Non-hyperbolicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex (affine) lines are a major object of study in complex geometry, but their symplectic aspects are not well understood. We perform a systematic study based on their associated Ahlfors currents. In particular, we generalize (by a different method) a result of Bangert on the existence of complex lines. We show that Ahlfors currents control the asymptotic behavior of families of pseudoholomorphic curves, refining a result of Demailly. Lastly, we show that the space of Ahlfors currents is convex.</description>

      <title>On novel Hamiltonian descriptions of some three-dimensional non-conservative systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present novel Hamiltonian descriptions of some three-dimensional systems including two well-known systems describing the three-wave-interaction problem and some well-known chaotic systems, namely, the Chen, L\"u, and Qi systems. We show that all of these systems can be described in a Hamiltonian framework in which the Poisson matrix $\mathcal{J}$ is supplemented by a resistance matrix $\mathcal{R}$. While such resistive-Hamiltonian systems are manifestly non-conservative, we construct higher-degree Poisson matrices via the Jordan product as $\mathcal{N} = \mathcal{J} \mathcal{R} + \mathcal{R} \mathcal{J}$, thereby leading to new bi-Hamiltonian systems. Finally, we discuss conformal Hamiltonian dynamics on Poisson manifolds and demonstrate that by appropriately choosing the underlying parameters, the reduced three-wave-interaction model as well as the Chen and L\"u systems can be described in this manner where the concomitant non-conservative part of the dynamics is described with the aid of the Euler vector field.</description>

      <title>Contact non-squeezing at large scale via generating functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11993v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using SFT techniques, Eliashberg, Kim and Polterovich (2006) proved that if $\pi R_2^2 \leq K \leq \pi R_1^2$ for some integer $K$ then there is no contact squeezing in $\mathbb{R}^{2n} \times S^1$ of the prequantization of the ball of radius $R_1$ into the prequantization of the ball of radius $R_2$. This result was extended to the case of balls of radius $R_1$ and $R_2$ with $1 \leq \pi R_2^2 \leq \pi R_1^2$ by Chiu (2017) and the first author (2016), using respectively microlocal sheaves and SFT. In the present article we recover this general contact non-squeezing theorem using generating functions, a classical method based on finite dimensional Morse theory. More precisely, we develop an equivariant version, with respect to a certain action of a finite cyclic group, of the generating function homology for domains of $\mathbb{R}^{2n} \times S^1$ defined by the second author (2011). A key role in the construction is played by translated chains of contactomorphisms, a generalization of translated points.</description>

      <title>Topological consequences of null-geodesic refocusing and applications to $Z^x$ manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23565v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $(M,h)$ be a connected, complete Riemannian manifold, let $x\in M$ and $l&gt;0$. Then $M$ is called a $Z^x$ manifold if all geodesics starting at $x$ return to $x$ and it is called a $Y^x_l$ manifold if every unit-speed geodesic starting at $x$ returns to $x$ at time $l$. It is unknown whether there are $Z^x$ manifolds that are not $Y^x_l$-manifolds for some $l&gt;0$. By the B\'erard-Bergery theorem, any $Y^x_l$ manifold of dimension at least $2$ is compact with finite fundamental group. We prove the same result for $Z^x$ manifolds $M$ for which all unit-speed geodesics starting at $x$ return to $x$ in uniformly bounded time. We also prove that any $Z^x$ manifold $(M,h)$ with $h$ analytic is a $Y^x_l$ manifold for some $l&gt;0$. We start by defining a class of globally hyperbolic spacetimes (called observer-refocusing) such that any $Z^x$ manifold is the Cauchy surface of some observer-refocusing spacetime. We then prove that under suitable conditions the Cauchy surfaces of observer-refocusing spacetimes are compact with finite fundamental group and show that analytic observer-refocusing spacetimes of dimension at least $3$ are strongly refocusing. We end by stating a contact-theoretic conjecture analogous to our results in Riemannian and Lorentzian geometry.</description>

      <title>On the Destruction of Invariant Lagrangian Graphs for Conformal Symplectic Twist Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06773v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article we investigate the fragility of invariant Lagrangian graphs for dissipative maps, focusing on their destruction under small perturbations. Inspired by Herman's work on conservative systems, we prove that all $C^0$-invariant Lagrangian graphs for an integrable dissipative twist maps can be destroyed by perturbations that are arbitrarily small in the $C^{1-\varepsilon}$-topology. This result is sharp, as evidenced by the persistence of $C^1$-invariant graphs under $C^1$-perturbations guaranteed by the normally hyperbolic invariant manifold theorem.</description>

      <title>Some memos on Stable Symplectic Structured Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09968v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In these memos, we define a pregeometry $\mathcal{T}_{\mathbb{S}} ^{alg}$ and a geometry $\mathcal{G}_{\mathbb{S}} ^{alg}$ which integrate symplectic manifolds with $E_{\infty}$-ring sheaves, enabling the construction of $\mathcal{G}_{\mathbb{S}} ^{alg}$-schemes as structured $\infty$-topoi. Our framework and results establish a profound connection between algebraic invariants and homological properties, opening new pathways for exploring symplectic phenomena through the lens of higher category theory and derived geometry.</description>
