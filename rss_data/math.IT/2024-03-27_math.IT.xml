      <title>Adaptive TTD Configurations for Near-Field Communications: An Unsupervised Transformer Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: True-time delayers (TTDs) are popular analog devices for facilitating near-field wideband beamforming subject to the spatial-wideband effect. In this paper, an adaptive TTD configuration is proposed for short-range TTDs. Compared to the existing TTD configurations, the proposed one can effectively combat the spatial-widebandd effect for arbitrary user locations and array shapes with the aid of a switch network. A novel end-to-end deep neural network is proposed to optimize the hybrid beamforming with adaptive TTDs for maximizing spectral efficiency. 1) First, based on the U-Net architecture, a near-field channel learning module (NFC-LM) is proposed for adaptive beamformer design through extracting the latent channel response features of various users across different frequencies. In the NFC-LM, an improved cross attention (CA) is introduced to further optimize beamformer design by enhancing the latent feature connection between near-field channel and different beamformers. 2) Second, a switch multi-user transformer (S-MT) is proposed to adaptively control the connection between TTDs and phase shifters (PSs). In the S-MT, an improved multi-head attention, namely multi-user attention (MSA), is introduced to optimize the switch network through exploring the latent channel relations among various users. 3) Third, a multi feature cross attention (MCA) is introduced to simultaneously optimize the NFC-LM and S-MT by enhancing the latent feature correlation between beamformers and switch network. Numerical simulation results show that 1) the proposed adaptive TTD configuration effectively eliminates the spatial-wideband effect under uniform linear array (ULA) and uniform circular array (UCA) architectures, and 2) the proposed deep neural network can provide near optimal spectral efficiency, and solve the multi-user bemformer design and dynamical connection problem in real-time.</description>

      <title>The Dimensions of the Hulls of Conorm Codes from Algebraic Geometry Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chara et al. introduced conorm codes defined over algebraic geometry codes, but the hulls of conorm codes were not determined yet. In this paper, we study the dimension of the hull of conorm codes using the method introduced by Camps et al. For an algebraic geometry code $\mathcal{C}:=C_\mathscr{L}(D, G)$, we consider the divisor $\gcd(G, H)$, where $H$ is the divisor satisfying \[C_\mathscr{L}(D, G)^\perp=C_\mathscr{L}(D, H).\] Given an extension $F'/\mathbb{F}_{q^t}$ of an algebraic function field $F/\mathbb{F}_q$, we assume that the divisor $\gcd(G, H)$ is non-special. If the degree of $\gcd(G, H)$ is greater than $2g-2+{t\over [F':F]}\deg\text{Diff}(F'/F)$, then we have determined the exact dimension of the hull of the conorm of $\mathcal{C}$. If not, we have determined the lower bound of the dimension of the hull of the conorm of $\mathcal{C}$. We provide some examples for the dimension of the hull of certain conorm codes of AG codes defined over a rational function field.</description>

      <title>Mutual Information Optimization for SIM-Based Holographic MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of emerging stacked intelligent metasurface (SIM)-based holographic MIMO (HMIMO) systems, a fundamental problem is to study the mutual information (MI) between transmitted and received signals to establish their capacity. However, direct optimization or analytical evaluation of the MI, particularly for discrete signaling, is often intractable. To address this challenge, we adopt the channel cutoff rate (CR) as an alternative optimization metric for the MI maximization. In this regard, we propose an alternating projected gradient method (APGM), which optimizes the CR of a SIM-based HMIMO system by adjusting signal precoding and the phase shifts across the transmit and receive SIMs in a layer-by-layer basis. Simulation results indicate that the proposed algorithm significantly enhances the CR, achieving substantial gains proportional to those observed for the corresponding MI. This justifies the effectiveness of using the channel CR for the MI optimization. Moreover, we demonstrate that the integration of digital precoding, even on a modest scale, has a significant impact on the ultimate performance of SIM-aided systems.</description>

      <title>Intent-Aware DRL-Based Uplink Dynamic Scheduler for 5G-NR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the problem of supporting Industrial Internet of Things user equipment (IIoT UEs) with intent (i.e., requested quality of service (QoS)) and random traffic arrival. A deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based centralized dynamic scheduler for time-frequency resources is proposed to learn how to schedule the available communication resources among the IIoT UEs. The proposed scheduler leverages an RL framework to adapt to the dynamic changes in the wireless communication system and traffic arrivals. Moreover, a graph-based reduction scheme is proposed to reduce the state and action space of the RL framework to allow fast convergence and a better learning strategy. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed intelligent scheduler in guaranteeing the expressed intent of IIoT UEs compared to several traditional scheduling schemes, such as round-robin, semi-static, and heuristic approaches. The proposed scheduler also outperforms the contention-free and contention-based schemes in maximizing the number of successfully computed tasks.</description>

      <title>The Guesswork of Ordered Statistics Decoding: Complexity and Practical Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates guesswork over ordered statistics and formulates the complexity of ordered statistics decoding (OSD) in binary additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels. It first develops a new upper bound of guesswork for independent sequences, by applying the Holder's inequity to Hamming shell-based subspaces. This upper bound is then extended to the ordered statistics, by constructing the conditionally independent sequences within the ordered statistics sequences. We leverage the established bounds to formulate the best achievable decoding complexity of OSD that ensures no loss in error performance, where OSD stops immediately when the correct codeword estimate is found. We show that the average complexity of OSD at maximum decoding order can be accurately approximated by the modified Bessel function, which increases near-exponentially with code dimension. We also identify a complexity saturation threshold, where increasing the OSD decoding order beyond this threshold improves error performance without further raising decoding complexity. Finally, the paper presents insights on applying these findings to enhance the efficiency of practical decoder implementations.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis of Integrated Sensing and Communication Networks with Blockage Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Communication-sensing integration represents an up-and-coming area of research, enabling wireless networks to simultaneously perform communication and sensing tasks. However, in urban cellular networks, the blockage of buildings results in a complex signal propagation environment, affecting the performance analysis of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) networks. To overcome this obstacle, this paper constructs a comprehensive framework considering building blockage and employs a distance-correlated blockage model to analyze interference from line of sight (LoS), non-line of sight (NLoS), and target reflection cascading (TRC) links. Using stochastic geometric theory, expressions for signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and coverage probability for communication and sensing in the presence of blockage are derived, allowing for a comprehensive comparison under the same parameters. The research findings indicate that blockage can positively impact coverage, especially in enhancing communication performance. The analysis also suggests that there exists an optimal base station (BS) density when blockage is of the same order of magnitude as the BS density, maximizing communication or sensing coverage probability.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we analyze the behavior of the multivariate symmetric uncertainty (MSU) measure through the use of statistical simulation techniques under various mixes of informative and non-informative randomly generated features. Experiments show how the number of attributes, their cardinalities, and the sample size affect the MSU. In this thesis, through observation of results, it is proposed an heuristic condition that preserves good quality in the MSU under different combinations of these three factors, providing a new useful criterion to help drive the process of dimension reduction.

      <title>Characterization of Spatial-Temporal Channel Statistics from Indoor Measurement Data at D Band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Millimeter-wave (mmWave) and D Band (110--170~GHz) frequencies are poised to play a pivotal role in the advancement of sixth-generation (6G) systems and beyond, owing to their ability to enhance performance metrics such as capacity, ultra-low latency, and spectral efficiency. This paper concentrates on deriving statistical insights into power, delay, and the number of paths based on measurements conducted across four distinct locations at a center frequency of 143.1 GHz. The findings underscore the suitability of various distributions in characterizing power behavior in line-of-sight (LOS) scenarios, including lognormal, Nakagami, gamma, and beta distributions, whereas the loglogistic distribution gives the optimal fit for power distribution in non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios. Moreover, the exponential distribution shows to be the most appropriate model for the delay distribution in both LOS and NLOS scenarios. In terms of the number of paths, observations indicate a tendency for the highest concentration within the 10 m to 30 m distance range between the transmitter (Tx) and receiver (Rx). These insights shed light on the statistical nature of D band propagation characteristics, which are vital for informing the design and optimization of future 6G communication systems</description>

      <title>Channel Estimation and Beamforming for Beyond Diagonal Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Beyond diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS) is a new advance and generalization of the RIS technique. BD-RIS breaks through the isolation between RIS elements by creatively introducing inter-element connections, thereby enabling smarter wave manipulation and enlarging coverage. However, exploring proper channel estimation schemes suitable for BD-RIS aided communication systems still remains an open problem. In this paper, we study channel estimation and beamforming design for BD-RIS aided multi-antenna systems. We first describe the channel estimation strategy based on the least square (LS) method, derive the mean square error (MSE) of the LS estimation, and formulate the joint pilot sequence and BD-RIS design problem with unique constraints induced by BD-RIS architectures. Specifically, we propose an efficient pilot sequence and BD-RIS design which theoretically guarantees to achieve the minimum MSE. With the estimated channel, we then consider two BD-RIS scenarios and propose beamforming design algorithms. Finally, we provide simulation results to verify the effectiveness of the proposed channel estimation scheme and beamforming design algorithms. We also show that more interelement connections in BD-RIS improves the performance while increasing the training overhead for channel estimation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we characterize convexity in terms of algebras over a PROP, and establish a tensor-product-like symmetric monoidal structure on the category of convex sets. Using these two structures, and the theory of $\scr{O}$-monoidal categories, we state and prove a Grothendieck construction for lax $\scr{O}$-monoidal functors into convex sets. We apply this construction to the categorical characterization of entropy of Baez, Fritz, and Leinster, and to the study of quantum contextuality in the framework of simplicial distributions.</description>

      <title>Generalized Maximum Entropy Differential Dynamic Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a sampling-based trajectory optimization method derived from the maximum entropy formulation of Differential Dynamic Programming with Tsallis entropy. This method can be seen as a generalization of the legacy work with Shannon entropy, which leads to a Gaussian optimal control policy for exploration during optimization. With the Tsallis entropy, the optimal control policy takes the form of $q$-Gaussian, which further encourages exploration with its heavy-tailed shape. Moreover, in our formulation, the exploration variance, which was scaled by a fixed constant inverse temperature in the original formulation with Shannon entropy, is automatically scaled based on the value function of the trajectory. Due to this property, our algorithms can promote exploration when necessary, that is, the cost of the trajectory is high, rather than using the same scaling factor. The simulation results demonstrate the properties of the proposed algorithm described above.</description>

      <title>An Experimentally Validated Feasible Quantum Protocol for Identity-Based Signature with Application to Secure Email Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Digital signatures are one of the simplest cryptographic building blocks that provide appealing security characteristics such as authenticity, unforgeability, and undeniability. In 1984, Shamir developed the first Identity-based signature (IBS) to simplify public key infrastructure and circumvent the need for certificates. It makes the process uncomplicated by enabling users to verify digital signatures using only the identifiers of signers, such as email, phone number, etc. Nearly all existing IBS protocols rely on several theoretical assumption-based hard problems. Unfortunately, these hard problems are unsafe and pose a hazard in the quantum realm. Thus, designing IBS algorithms that can withstand quantum attacks and ensure long-term security is an important direction for future research. Quantum cryptography (QC) is one such approach. In this paper, we propose an IBS based on QC. Our scheme's security is based on the laws of quantum mechanics. It thereby achieves long-term security and provides resistance against quantum attacks. We verify the proposed design's correctness and feasibility by simulating it in a prototype quantum device and the IBM Qiskit quantum simulator. The implementation code in qiskit with Jupyternotebook is provided in the Annexure. Moreover, we discuss the application of our design in secure email communication.</description>

      <title>Clustering Change Sign Detection by Fusing Mixture Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes an early detection method for cluster structural changes. Cluster structure refers to discrete structural characteristics, such as the number of clusters, when data are represented using finite mixture models, such as Gaussian mixture models. We focused on scenarios in which the cluster structure gradually changed over time. For finite mixture models, the concept of mixture complexity (MC) measures the continuous cluster size by considering the cluster proportion bias and overlap between clusters. In this paper, we propose MC fusion as an extension of MC to handle situations in which multiple mixture numbers are possible in a finite mixture model. By incorporating the fusion of multiple models, our approach accurately captured the cluster structure during transitional periods of gradual change. Moreover, we introduce a method for detecting changes in the cluster structure by examining the transition of MC fusion. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through empirical analysis using both artificial and real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>A Construction of 2-D Z-Complementary Array Code Sets with Flexible Even Row Lengths and Applications in Massive MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.00970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.00970v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The need for two-dimensional (2-D) arrays with good 2-D correlation properties and flexible parameters has been of great interest due to their application in the field of wireless communications such as massive multiple input multiple output (MIMO), phased array antenna, multi-carrier code division multiple access (MC-CDMA), 2D-MC-CDMA, etc. In this paper, we propose a direct construction of a 2-D Z-complementary array code set (ZCACS) with flexible parameters. For this purpose, we first propose a construction of inter-group complementary (IGC) code sets using multivariable function and by using this construction 2-D Z-complementary array code (ZCAC) and 2-D ZCAC set (ZCACS) are provided. In some special case, the proposed 2-D ZCAC reduces to a 2-D Z-complementary array pair (ZCAP), which is not reported till date. The peak-to-mean envelope power ratio (PMEPR) of row and column sequences of 2-D ZCAC is shown to be better than the existing ones for use in MC-CDMA. 2-D Golay complementary array set (GCAS) and Golay complementary set (GCS) are derived from the proposed construction, which can be applied in omnidirectional precoding (OP) based transmission through massive MIMO. The proposed construction can support a more flexible number of antennas for a uniform rectangular array (URA) to transmit space-time block coded (STBC) data, than the existing constructions. The bit-error-rate (BER) simulation result also shows the performance benefits of derived 2-D GCAS and GCS compared to the existing ones.</description>

      <title>Multi-Static Target Detection and Power Allocation for Integrated Sensing and Communication in Cell-Free Massive MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12523</link>

Abstract: This paper studies an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system within a centralized cell-free massive MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) network for target detection. ISAC transmit access points serve the user equipments in the downlink and optionally steer a beam toward the target in a multi-static sensing framework. A maximum a posteriori ratio test detector is developed for target detection in the presence of clutter, so-called target-free signals. Additionally, sensing spectral efficiency (SE) is introduced as a key metric, capturing the impact of resource utilization in ISAC. A power allocation algorithm is proposed to maximize the sensing signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio while ensuring minimum communication requirements. Two ISAC configurations are studied: utilizing existing communication beams for sensing and using additional sensing beams. The proposed algorithm's efficiency is investigated in realistic and idealistic scenarios, corresponding to the presence and absence of the target-free channels, respectively. Despite performance degradation in the presence of target-free channels, the proposed algorithm outperforms the interference-unaware benchmark, leveraging clutter statistics. Comparisons with a fully communication-centric algorithm reveal superior performance in both cluttered and clutter-free environments. The incorporation of an extra sensing beam enhances detection performance for lower radar cross-section variances. Moreover, the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the integrated operation of sensing and communication compared to an orthogonal resource-sharing approach.</description>

      <title>Partial Information Decomposition for Continuous Variables based on Shared Exclusions: Analytical Formulation and Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06373v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Describing statistical dependencies is foundational to empirical scientific research. For uncovering intricate and possibly non-linear dependencies between a single target variable and several source variables within a system, a principled and versatile framework can be found in the theory of Partial Information Decomposition (PID). Nevertheless, the majority of existing PID measures are restricted to categorical variables, while many systems of interest in science are continuous. In this paper, we present a novel analytic formulation for continuous redundancy--a generalization of mutual information--drawing inspiration from the concept of shared exclusions in probability space as in the discrete PID definition of $I^\mathrm{sx}_\cap$. Furthermore, we introduce a nearest-neighbor based estimator for continuous PID, and showcase its effectiveness by applying it to a simulated energy management system provided by the Honda Research Institute Europe GmbH. This work bridges the gap between the measure-theoretically postulated existence proofs for a continuous $I^\mathrm{sx}_\cap$ and its practical application to real-world scientific problems.</description>

      <title>A Mathematical Theory of Semantic Communication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13387v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The year 1948 witnessed the historic moment of the birth of classic information theory (CIT). Guided by CIT, modern communication techniques have approached the theoretic limitations, such as, entropy function $H(U)$, channel capacity $C=\max_{p(x)}I(X;Y)$ and rate-distortion function $R(D)=\min_{p(\hat{x}|x):\mathbb{E}d(x,\hat{x})\leq D} I(X;\hat{X})$. Semantic communication paves a new direction for future communication techniques whereas the guided theory is missed. In this paper, we try to establish a systematic framework of semantic information theory (SIT). We investigate the behavior of semantic communication and find that synonym is the basic feature so we define the synonymous mapping between semantic information and syntactic information. Stemming from this core concept, synonymous mapping $f$, we introduce the measures of semantic information, such as semantic entropy $H_s(\tilde{U})$, up/down semantic mutual information $I^s(\tilde{X};\tilde{Y})$ $(I_s(\tilde{X};\tilde{Y}))$, semantic capacity $C_s=\max_{f_{xy}}\max_{p(x)}I^s(\tilde{X};\tilde{Y})$, and semantic rate-distortion function $R_s(D)=\min_{\{f_x,f_{\hat{x}}\}}\min_{p(\hat{x}|x):\mathbb{E}d_s(\tilde{x},\hat{\tilde{x}})\leq D}I_s(\tilde{X};\hat{\tilde{X}})$. Furthermore, we prove three coding theorems of SIT by using random coding and (jointly) typical decoding/encoding, that is, the semantic source coding theorem, semantic channel coding theorem, and semantic rate-distortion coding theorem. We find that the limits of SIT are extended by using synonymous mapping, that is, $H_s(\tilde{U})\leq H(U)$, $C_s\geq C$ and $R_s(D)\leq R(D)$. All these works composite the basis of semantic information theory. In addition, we discuss the semantic information measures in the continuous case. For the band-limited Gaussian channel, we obtain a new channel capacity formula, $C_s=B\log\left[S^4\left(1+\frac{P}{N_0B}\right)\right]$.</description>

      <title>Shannon Capacity of Channels with Markov Insertions, Deletions and Substitutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16063v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider channels with synchronization errors modeled as insertions and deletions. A classical result for such channels is their information stability, hence the existence of the Shannon capacity, when the synchronization errors are memoryless. In this paper, we extend this result to the case where the insertions and deletions have memory. Specifically, we assume that the synchronization errors are governed by a stationary and ergodic finite state Markov chain, and prove that such channel is information-stable, which implies the existence of a coding scheme which achieves the limit of mutual information. This result implies the existence of the Shannon capacity for a wide range of channels with synchronization errors, with different applications including DNA storage. The methods developed may also be useful to prove other coding theorems for non-trivial channel sequences.</description>

      <title>Assembly Theory is an approximation to algorithmic complexity based on LZ compression that does not explain selection or evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06629v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that Assembly Theory (AT) is reliant on Shannon Entropy and a method based upon statistical compression that belongs to the LZ family of compression algorithms, family which comprises popular algorithms used in ZIP, GZIP, or JPEG. Such popular algorithms have been shown to empirically reproduce the results of AT that were reported before in successful applications to separating organic from non-organic molecules and in the context of the study of selection and evolution. In particular, the assembly index calculation method is an LZ compression scheme, even if used for classification or explanatory purposes. We show that the assembly index value is equivalent to the size of a minimal context-free grammar. The statistical compressibility of such a method is bounded by Shannon Entropy and other equivalent traditional LZ compression schemes, such as LZ77, LZ78, or LZW. In addition, we demonstrate that AT, and the algorithms supporting its pathway complexity, assembly index, and assembly number, define compression schemes and methods that are subsumed into the theory of algorithmic (Kolmogorov-Solomonoff-Chaitin) complexity. Due to AT's current lack of logical consistency in defining causality for non-stochastic processes and lack of empirical evidence that it outperforms other complexity measures found in the literature capable of explaining the same phenomena, we conclude that the assembly index and the assembly number do not lead to an explanation or quantification of biases in generative (physical or biological) processes, including those brought about by (abiotic or Darwinian) selection and evolution that could not have been made with Shannon Entropy or had not been reported before with algorithmic complexity.</description>

      <title>Fractal spatio-temporal scale-free messaging: amplitude modulation of self-executable carriers given by the Weierstrass function's components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06633v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In many communication contexts, the capabilities of the involved actors cannot be known beforehand, whether it is a cell, a plant, an insect, or even a life form unknown to Earth. Regardless of the recipient, the message space and time scale could be too fast, too slow, too large, or too small and may never be decoded. Therefore, it pays to devise a way to encode messages agnostic of space and time scales. We propose the use of fractal functions as self-executable infinite-frequency carriers for sending messages, given their properties of structural self-similarity and scale invariance. We call it `fractal messaging'. Starting from a spatial embedding, we introduce a framework for a space-time scale-free messaging approach to this challenge. When considering a space and time-agnostic framework for message transmission, it would be interesting to encode a message such that it could be decoded at several spatio-temporal scales. Hence, the core idea of the framework proposed herein is to encode a binary message as waves along infinitely many frequencies (in power-like distributions) and amplitudes, transmit such a message, and then decode and reproduce it. To do so, the components of the Weierstrass function, a known fractal, are used as carriers of the message. Each component will have its amplitude modulated to embed the binary stream, allowing for a space-time-agnostic approach to messaging.</description>

      <title>On the Salient Limitations of `On the Salient Limitations of the Methods of Assembly Theory and their Classification of Molecular Biosignatures'</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12452v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Assembly Theory (AT) is a theory that explains how to determine if a complex object is the product of evolution. Here we explain why attempts to compare AT to compression algorithms, ref 1, does not help identify if the object is the product of selection or not. Specifically, we show why aims to perform benchmark comparisons of different compression schemes to compare the performance of Molecular Assembly Indices against standard compression schemes in determining living vs. non-living samples fails to classify the data correctly. In their approach, Uthamacumaran et al., ref 1, compress data from Marshall et al.2 describing the experimental basis for assembly theory and evaluate the difference in the resulting distributions of data. After several computational experiments Uthamacumaran et al., ref 1, conclude that other compression techniques obtain better results in the problem of detecting life and non-life that of assembly pathways. Here we explain why the approach presented by Uthamacumaran et al.1 appears to be lacking, and why it is not to reproduce their analysis with the information given.</description>

      <title>Generalization Bounds: Perspectives from Information Theory and PAC-Bayes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.04381v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A fundamental question in theoretical machine learning is generalization. Over the past decades, the PAC-Bayesian approach has been established as a flexible framework to address the generalization capabilities of machine learning algorithms, and design new ones. Recently, it has garnered increased interest due to its potential applicability for a variety of learning algorithms, including deep neural networks. In parallel, an information-theoretic view of generalization has developed, wherein the relation between generalization and various information measures has been established. This framework is intimately connected to the PAC-Bayesian approach, and a number of results have been independently discovered in both strands. In this monograph, we highlight this strong connection and present a unified treatment of PAC-Bayesian and information-theoretic generalization bounds. We present techniques and results that the two perspectives have in common, and discuss the approaches and interpretations that differ. In particular, we demonstrate how many proofs in the area share a modular structure, through which the underlying ideas can be intuited. We pay special attention to the conditional mutual information (CMI) framework; analytical studies of the information complexity of learning algorithms; and the application of the proposed methods to deep learning. This monograph is intended to provide a comprehensive introduction to information-theoretic generalization bounds and their connection to PAC-Bayes, serving as a foundation from which the most recent developments are accessible. It is aimed broadly towards researchers with an interest in generalization and theoretical machine learning.</description>

      <title>Low-Complexity Linear Decoupling of Users for Uplink Massive MU-MIMO Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03271v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Massive MIMO (mMIMO) enables users with different requirements to get connected to the same base station (BS) on the same set of resources. In the uplink of Multiuser massive MIMO (MU-mMIMO), while such heterogeneous users are served, decoupling facilitates the use of user-specific detection schemes. In this paper, we propose a low-complexity linear decoupling scheme called Sequential Decoupler (SD), which aids in the parallel detection of each user's data stream. The proposed algorithm shows significant complexity reduction. Simulations reveal that the complexity of the proposed scheme is only 0.15% of the conventional Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) based decoupling and is about 47% of the pseudo-inverse based decoupling schemes when 80 users with two antennas each are served by the BS. Also, the proposed scheme is scalable when new users are added to the system and requires fewer operations than computing the decoupler all over again. Further numerical analyses indicate that the proposed scheme achieves significant complexity reduction without any degradation in performance and is a promising low-complex alternative to the existing decoupling schemes.</description>

      <title>An Information Theoretic Treatment of Animal Movement Tracks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16290v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The two-dimensional track of an animal on a landscape has progressed over the past three decades from hourly to second-by-second recordings of locations. Track segmentation methods for analyzing the behavioral information in such relocation data has lagged somewhat behind, with scales of analysis currently at the sub-hourly to minute level. A new approach is needed to bring segmentation analysis down to a second-by-second level. Here, such an approach is presented that rests heavily on concepts from Shannon's Information Theory. In this paper, we first briefly review and update concepts relating to movement path segmentation. We then discuss how cluster analysis can be used to organize the smallest viable statistical movement elements (StaMEs), which are $\mu$ steps long, and to code the next level of movement elements called ``words'' that are $m \mu$ steps long. Centroids of these word clusters are identified as canonical activity modes (CAMs). Unlike current segmentation schemes, the approach presented here allows us to provide entropy measures for movement paths, compute the coding efficiencies of derived StaMEs and CAMs, and assess error rates in the allocation of strings of $m$ StaMEs to CAM types. In addition our approach allows us to employ the Jensen-Shannon divergence measure to assess and compare the best choices for the various parameters (number of steps in a StaME, number of StaME types, number of StaMEs in a word, number of CAM types), as well as the best clustering methods for generating segments that can then be used to interpret and predict sequences of higher order segments. The theory presented here provides another tool in our toolbox for dealing with the effects of global change on the movement and redistribution of animals across altered landscapes</description>
