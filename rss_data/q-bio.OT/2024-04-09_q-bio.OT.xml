      <title>Effectiveness of Self-Assessment Software to Evaluate Preclinical Operative Procedures</title>

Abstract: Objectives: To assess the effectiveness of digital scanning techniques for self-assessment and of preparations and restorations in preclinical dental education when compared to traditional faculty grading. Methods: Forty-four separate Class I (#30-O), Class II (#30-MO) preparations, and class II amalgam restorations (#31-MO) were generated respectively under preclinical assessment setting. Calibrated faculty evaluated the preparations and restorations using a standard rubric from preclinical operative class. The same teeth were scanned using Planmeca PlanScan intraoral scanner and graded using the Romexis E4D Compare Software. Each tooth was compared against a corresponding gold standard tooth with tolerance intervals ranging from 100{\mu}m to 500{\mu}m. These scores were compared to traditional faculty grades using a linear mixed model to estimate the mean differences at 95% confidence interval for each tolerance level. Results: The average Compare Software grade of Class I preparation at 300{\mu}m tolerance had the smallest mean difference of 1.64 points on a 100 points scale compared to the average faculty grade. Class II preparation at 400{\mu}m tolerance had the smallest mean difference of 0.41 points. Finally, Class II Restoration at 300{\mu}m tolerance had the smallest mean difference at 0.20 points. Conclusion: In this study, tolerance levels that best correlated the Compare Software grades with the faculty grades were determined for three operative procedures: class I preparation, class II preparation and class II restoration. This Compare Software can be used as a useful adjunct method for more objective grading. It also can be used by students as a great self-assessment tool.</description>
