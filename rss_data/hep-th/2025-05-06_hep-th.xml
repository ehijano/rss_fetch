      <title>Exploring amplitude criteria for weak gravity in electroweak theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Connections between weak gravity conjecture (WGC) bounds and scattering positivity have been extensively studied over the past decade. This work further explores these connections by proposing positivity as a potential amplitude criterion for weak gravity, with the aim of unifying various weak gravity bounds within a single framework. We illustrate this criterion by analyzing two-body elastic scatterings of photons and Higgs bosons in the forward limit of an electroweak (EW)-like theory. This leads to an amplitude-based criterion that extends magnetic WGC-type bounds to include not only the Abelian gauge coupling but also the non-Abelian gauge and the Yukawa coupling. Furthermore, a version of the species bound naturally emerges within this setup, suggesting that this amplitude criterion may extend to broader Swampland conjectures beyond the WGC.</description>

      <title>Universality of Colored Scalars from the Stringy KLT Kernel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new perspective on the inverse string theory Kawai-Lewellen-Tye (KLT) kernel is provided which establishes the universality of scattering amplitudes in the bi-adjoint scalar (BAS) theory, pions in the Non-linear sigma model (NLSM), and mixed amplitudes (NLSM+$\phi^3$) recently studied in the literature. We show that all these amplitudes can be viewed as equivalent, arising from a single function, the inverse string theory KLT kernel, evaluated at different kinematic points. In this way cubic colored scalars and pions become interchangeable through a procedure we call the $\alpha'$-shift. The latter complements the $\delta$-shift proposed by Arkani-Hamed et al., and demonstrates an inherent equivalence of scattering amplitudes in different quantum field theories by embedding them in a common stringy framework.</description>

      <title>Monodromies of CFT correlates on the Lorentzian Cylinder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While correlators of a CFT are single valued in Euclidean Space, they are multi valued -- and have a complicated sheet structure -- in Lorentzian space. Correlators on $R^{1,1}$ are well known to access a finite number of these sheets. In this paper we demonstrate the spiral nature of lightcones on $S^1 \times $ time allows time ordered correlators of a $CFT_2$ on this spacetime -- the Lorentzian cylinder -- to access an infinite number of sheets of the correlator. We present a complete classification, both of the sheets accessed as well as of the various distinct causal configurations that lie on a particular sheet. Our construction provides a physical interpretation for an infinite number of sheets of the correlator, while, however, leaving a larger infinity of these sheets uninterpreted.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Quantization of Gauge Field Theories: Sandwich Quantization Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantization of field theories with gauge symmetry is an extensively discussed and well-established topic. In this short note, we revisit this old problem. The gauge degrees of freedom have vanishing momenta, and hence their equations of motion appear as constraints on the system. We argue that to ensure consistency of quantization one can impose these constraints as "sandwich conditions": The physical Hilbert space of the theory consists of all states for which the constraints sandwiched between any two physical states vanish. We solve the sandwich constraints and show they have solutions not discussed in the gauge field theory literature. We briefly discuss the physical meaning of these solutions and implications of the "sandwich quantization scheme".</description>

      <title>Inflation from Anomalies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review a string-inspired model of inflation which is a consequence of condensates of chiral gravitational waves (GW) in the primordial Universe, leading in turn to a (approximately) constant condensate of a gravitational anomaly term of Chern-Simons (CS) type, present in the Lagrangian density that describes the dynamics of the very early Universe in the model. We discuss some mechanisms for the production of chiral GW, as well as the role of periodic modulations of the potential of the gravitational axion field, that couples to the CS anomaly term, in ensuring the correct inflationary slow-roll phenomenology of this model.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates kink solutions in one-dimensional scalar field theories. We begin with a review of the formalism used to obtain these solutions, presenting the BPS formalism and linear stability analysis. Next, we explore new models involving real scalar fields, generated by distinct potentials, with a focus on the topological structures responsible for the formation of kinks. Finally, we study collisions between the solutions obtained in two distinct models, analyzing their dynamic implications.</description>

      <title>Non-Abelian target space duals of Thurston geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we proceed to investigate the Thurston geometries from the point of view of their Poisson-Lie (PL) T-dualizability. First of all, we find all subalgebras of Killing vectors that generate group of isometries acting freely and transitively on the three-dimensional target manifolds, where the Thurston metrics are defined. It is shown that three-dimensional Lie subalgebras are isomorphic to the Bianchi type algebras. We take the isometry subgroup of the metric as the first subgroup of Drinfeld double. In order to investigate the non-Abelian T-duality, the second subgroup must be chosen to be Abelian. Accordingly, the non-Abelian target space duals of these geometries are found via PL T-duality approach in the absence of $B$-field. We also comment on the conformal invariance conditions of the T-dual $\sigma$-models under consideration.</description>

      <title>Chiral anomaly from (anomalous) spin hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the low energy fluctuations of spinning black Dp branes are described by a theory of spin hydrodynamics on a spacetime $\mathbb{M}_{p+1}\times \mathbb{T}^{n+2}$ in which the fluid is flowing on $\mathbb{M}_{p+1}$ and spinning on $\mathbb{T}^{n+2}$. Focusing on the hydrodynamic regime of $\mathcal{N}=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory, we provide a geometric interpretation of the R-current anomaly in terms of a gravitational anomaly from the ten-dimensional point of view. This follows from the holographic duality between a spinning fluid in ten dimensions and an anomalous chiral fluid in four dimensions. We comment on the relations between the theory of spin hydrodynamics introduced here and other theories of spin hydrodynamics in the context of heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Dirac Singleton as a Relativistic Field Beyond Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new interpretation of Dirac singletons \cite{Dirac:1963ta}, i.e. free conformal fields in $d$ dimensions, as relativistic fields in a $d+1$-dimensional space-time with cosmological constant, that differs from the Flato-Fronsdal dipole construction in $AdS_{d+1}$ \cite{Flato:1986uh}, is proposed. The $d+1$-dimensional field is described at the level of both equations and Lagrangian. It forms an infinite-dimensional representation of the $d+1$-dimensional Lorentz group that relates fields at different space-time points. The associated well-known fact is that singleton cannot be localized at a point in ${d+1}$ dimensions, hence being unobservable via local scattering/radiation phenomena in the Standard Model ($d=3$). On the other hand, that singleton respects ${d+1}$ dimensional relativistic symmetries makes it possible to introduce its interactions with gravity and other relativistic fields in $d+1$ dimensions. It is speculated that the presence of singleton in a four-dimensional field theory with non-zero cosmological constant (dark energy) can be relevant to the dark matter phenomenon and baryon asymmetry generation.</description>

      <title>Towards Lagrangian dynamics for constrained mixed-symmetric interacting higher-spin fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The necessary and sufficient conditions to construct consistent Lagrangian formulation for irreducible interacting massless higher-spin (HS) fields on $d$-dimensional Minkowski space within approach with incomplete BRST operator and off-shell holonomic constraints are found. It is shown that in addition to superconmmuting of incomplete BRST operator with appropriate traceless and Young constraints, which annihilate the field and gauge parameter vectors, these constraints should form Abelian superalgebra both with BRST operator and with operators of cubic, quartic and etc. vertices. The consistent deformation of free model with constrained HS fields with integer spin requires for the cubic vertex to be by BRST-closed, traceless and Young-symmetric solution of the generating equations. The explicit form for the vertices for irreducible constrained interacting fields are obtained by means of projectors on traceless and Young-symmetric modes.</description>

      <title>Unified exact WKB framework for resonance -- Zel'dovich and complex-scaling regularizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a unified framework for analyzing quantum mechanical resonances using the exact WKB method. The non-perturbative formulation based on the exact WKB method works for incorporating both the Zel'dovich regularization and the complex scaling method. While previous studies have demonstrated the exact WKB analysis in bound state problems, our work extends its application to quasi-stationary states. By examining the inverted Rosen-Morse potential, we illustrate how the exact WKB analysis captures resonant phenomena in a rigorous manner. We explore the equivalence and complementarity of different well-established regularizations \`a la Zel'dovich and complex scaling within this framework. This offers a deeper understanding of resonant states and their analytic structures. Our results provide a concrete demonstration of the non-perturbative accuracy of exact WKB methods in unstable quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the relaxation of constraints in gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, there were works claiming that path integral quantisation of gauge theories necessarily requires relaxation of Lagrangian constraints. As has also been noted in the literature, it is of course wrong since there perfectly exist gauge field quantisations respecting the constraints, and at the same time the very idea of changing the classical theory in this way has many times appeared in other works. On the other hand, what was done in the path integral approach is fixing a gauge in terms of zero-momentum variables. We would like to show that this relaxation is what normally happens when one fixes such a gauge at the level of action principle in a Lagrangian theory. Moreover, there is an interesting analogy to be drawn. Namely, one of the ways to quantise a gauge theory is to build an extended Hamiltonian and then add new conditions by hand such as to make it a second class system. The constraints' relaxation occurs when one does the same at the level of the total Hamiltonian, i.e. a second class system with the primary constraints only.</description>

      <title>Smooth Splitting and Zeros from On-Shell Recursion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a new approach to understanding the origins of recently discovered "hidden zeros" and "smooth splitting" of tree-level amplitudes in $\text{Tr}\phi^3$, Non-Linear Sigma Model (NLSM), Yang-Mill-Scalar (YMS) and the special Galileon. Introducing a new type of linear shift in kinematic space we demonstrate that the mysterious splitting formulae follow from a simple contour integration argument in the style of on-shell recursion. The argument makes use of only standard notions of tree-level factorization on propagators, but assumes improved UV behavior in the form of the absence of a residue at infinity. In the case of $\text{Tr}\phi^3$ and NLSM this is proven by identifying our shift as a special case of a more general construction called a $g$-vector shift; in the case of YMS it remains an unproven conjecture. This recursive perspective leads to numerous new results: we derive generalizations of the splitting formulae on more relaxed near-zero kinematics, including interesting new kinematic limits in which the amplitude splits into a triple-product; we also demonstrate that the uncolored special Galileon model has improved UV scaling and hence also splits. We also investigate the possible realization of hidden zeros in four dimensions. The conditions under which the dimensionality constraints are compatible with zero kinematics is investigated in detail for $\text{Tr}\phi^3$ and YMS; for the latter we find they can be realized only with certain restrictions on external helicity states. The realizable 4d zeros are proven by a similar recursive argument based on BCFW and is found to generalize to a new class of intrinsically 4d "helicity zeros" present in all sectors of YM and also gravity.</description>

      <title>Analytical and numerical routes to strong coupling in $\mathcal{N}=2$ SCFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the $\mathcal{N}=2$ quiver gauge theory arising from a $\mathbb{Z}_M$ orbifold of $\mathcal{N}=4$ Super Yang-Mills theory. Over the years, exploiting supersymmetric localization, exact expressions for several observables have been derived in the planar limit of this theory. In particular, some of these can be expressed as Fredholm determinants of semi-infinite matrices and their strong coupling expansions in inverse powers of the 't Hooft coupling have been calculated analytically to any desired order. On the other hand, there are also observables that cannot be rewritten in such a closed form, therefore extracting information at strong coupling is more complicated and almost no results are known beyond the leading order. In this work we focus on two observables of this type: the correlators of $n$ coincident Wilson loops and the integrated correlators of two Higgs branch operators in the presence of a Wilson line. We introduce an analytic method to evaluate the first terms of their strong coupling expansions. We also outline a numerical algorithm that serves as an independent check of the analytical results and provides predictions in cases where analytical techniques are currently not known.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define the correlation functions for the descendants in the Landau-Ginzburg-Saito theory. We show that the correlation functions obey puncture, divisor, dilaton, and topological recursion relations. We formulate the map between the descendant observables in the GW theory on the projective line and the descendant observables in the mirror LGS theory. We prove that the LGS correlation functions of the mirror observables are equal to the GW invariants with descendants.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mock modular forms, first invented by Ramanujan, provide a beautiful generalization of the usual modular forms. In recent years, it was found that they capture generating functions of the number of microstates of BPS black holes appearing in compactifications of string theory with 8 and 16 supercharges. This review describes these results and their applications which range from the actual computation of these generating functions for both compact and non-compact compactification manifolds (encoding, respectively, Donaldson-Thomas and Vafa-Witten topological invariants) to the construction of new non-commutative structures on moduli spaces of Calabi-Yau threefolds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a new identity for Feynman periods that acts on five-vertex cuts of completed primitive Feynman graphs. It is shown that in $\phi^4$ theory this identity is independent from existing identities which are the twist, the Fourier identity and the Fourier split.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamics of two-dimensional CFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the geometric action on a coadjoint orbit of the Virasoro group appropriately describes non-dissipative two-dimensional conformal fluids. While this action had already appeared in the context of AdS$_3$ gravity, the hydrodynamical interpretation given here is new. We use this to argue that the geometric action manifestly controls both sides of the fluid/gravity correspondence, where the gravitational `hologram' gives an effective hydrodynamical description of the dual CFT. As a byproduct, our work sheds light on the nature of the AdS$_3$ reparametrization theory used to effectively compute Virasoro vacuum blocks at large central charge, as the reparametrization mode is now understood as a fluctuation of the fluid velocity.</description>

      <title>Gravitational dynamics of near-extreme Kerr (Anti-)de Sitter black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the thermodynamic response near extremality of black holes with angular momentum in (3+1)-dimensional de Sitter and Anti-de Sitter spacetimes. While Kerr-AdS$_4$ is characterized by a single extremal limit, for Kerr-dS$_4$ there are three different extremal scenarios (Cold, Nariai and Ultracold). These exhibit different near horizon geometries, with AdS$_2$, dS$_2$ and Mink$_2$ factors respectively. We analyze each extremal case and contrast the response once the black holes are taken out of extremality. We study the perturbations of the near horizon geometry at the level of the 4D metric, considering a consistent truncation for the metric fluctuations, and find solutions to the linearized Einstein equations. We characterize the perturbations that are responsible for the deviations away from extremality and show that their dynamics is governed by a Schwarzian theory. We treat the Ultracold case separately, detailing how the thermodynamics in 4D is reflected in the near horizon dynamics.</description>

      <title>The area and volume laws for entanglement of scalar fields in flat and cosmological spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the area and volume laws for entanglement of free quantum scalar fields. In addition to the entropy, we use the notion of the capacity of entanglement, which measures entropy fluctuations. We consider flat spacetimes as well as the curved ones relevant for cosmology. Moreover, we put special emphasis on quench phenomena and different geometries of the entangling surfaces. First, we show that, in the Minkowski spacetime, the capacity of entanglement, like entropy, exhibits the area law for two kinds of geometries of the entangling surfaces: the sphere and strip. Moreover, we show that the ratio of both quantities takes the same values for both surfaces. Next, we turn our attention to quenches. Namely, we analyse the dynamics of capacity; in particular, contribution of the volume and surface terms. Moreover, we compare these results with theoretical predictions resulting from the quasiparticles model. In the second part, we consider the above issues for the FLRW spaces; especially, for de Sitter space as well as a metric modeling the transition to radiation-dominated era. Finally, we analyse the abrupt quenches in de Sitter space.</description>

      <title>Interacting massive/massless continuous-spin fields and integer-spin fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the framework of light-cone gauge approach, interacting continuous-spin fields and integer-spin fields propagating in flat space are studied. The continuous-spin fields are considered by using the light-cone gauge vector superspace formulation. Description of massive continuous-spin fields associated with the principal, complimentary and discrete series is presented. For the massive continuous-spin fields of the principal and supplementary series and massless continuous-spin fields, all parity-even cubic vertices realized as functions on vector superspace are obtained. Cubic vertices for cross-interaction of massive/massless continuous spin fields and massive/massless integer-spin fields are also derived. The use of the light-cone gauge vector superspace formulation considerable simplifies cubic vertices as compared to the ones in the oscillator formulation. Some cubic vertices realized as distributions are also found. Map between the oscillator formulation and the vector superspace formulation of continuous-spin field is explicitly described. Equivalence of the light-cone gauge and Lorentz covariant formulations of continuous-spin field is also demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Scientific Spirit of Chien-Shiung Wu: From Quantum Entanglement to Parity Nonconservation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1950, Chien-Shiung Wu and her student published a coincidence experiment on entangled photon pairs that were created in electron-positron annihilation. This experiment precisely verified the prediction of quantum electrodynamics. Additionally, it was also the first instance of a precisely controlled quantum entangled state of spatially separated particles, although Wu did not know about this at the time. In 1956, Wu initiated and led the so-called Wu experiment, which discovered parity nonconservation, becoming one of the greatest experiments of the 20th century. As Chen Ning Yang said, Wu's experiments were well known for their precision and accuracy. Experimental precision and accuracy manifested Wu's scientific spirit, which we investigate here in some detail. This paper is the translated transcript of the speech the author made at the International Symposium Commemorating the 110th Anniversary of the Birth of Chien-Shiung Wu, on May 31, 2022. The above abstract is the translation of the original abstract of the speech.</description>

      <title>On the new way of symmetry breaking in scalar QED and the one-loop renormalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well known that single real scalar field does not allow gauge coupling to the Abelian vector field. Using the complex scalar model as a starting point, we construct the Abelian gauge model with two real scalars. The gauge transformations for the scalars look different (albeit equivalent) from the conventional sQED. Spitting the masses of the scalars, or the scalar self-couplings, or the nonminimal parameters of scalar-curvature interaction, we arrive at a qualitatively new way of gauge symmetry breaking. Using the Schwinger-DeWitt technique, we explore the one-loop renormalization of this new model in curved spacetime.</description>

      <title>Fractionalized fermionic multicriticality in anisotropic Kitaev spin-orbital liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the low-temperature phase diagram of quantum Kitaev-Heisenberg spin-orbital models with XXZ anisotropy on the honeycomb lattice. Within a parton mean-field theory, we identify three different quantum phases, distinguished by their symmetries. Besides a disordered spin-orbital liquid with unbroken U(1) x Z2 spin rotational symmetry, there are two orbital liquid phases characterized by spin long-range order. In these phases, the spin rotational symmetry is spontaneously broken down to residual U(1) and Z2 symmetries, respectively. The symmetric spin-orbital liquid features three flavors of linearly dispersing gapless Majorana fermions. In the symmetry-broken phases, one of the three Majorana excitations remains gapless, while the other two acquire a band gap. The transitions from the symmetric to the symmetry-broken phases are continuous and fall into the fractionalized Gross-Neveu-Z2* and Gross-Neveu-SO(2)* universality classes, respectively. The transition between the ordered phases is discontinuous. Using a renormalization group analysis based on the epsilon expansion, we demonstrate that the triple point in the phase diagram features fractionalized fermionic multicriticality with emergent SO(3) symmetry.</description>

      <title>Probing "Continuous Spin" QED with Rare Atomic Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An intriguing and elementary possibility is that familiar massless particles like the photon could be "continuous spin" particles (CSP) with a small but non-zero spin Casimir $\rho$. In this case, the familiar two polarization states of the photon are accompanied by an infinite tower of integer spaced helicity modes, with couplings dictated entirely by Lorentz symmetry and the parameter $\rho$. We present a formalism for computing bound state atomic transitions for scalar QED when $\rho \neq 0$, employing path integral methods not often used for bound state computations, but that readily generalize to the CSP case. We compute several illustrative amplitudes and show that $\rho\neq 0$ opens new decay channels for atomic transitions with rates controlled by $\rho\alpha/\omega$ for transition frequency $\omega$. These new channels can appreciably modify the rates of "forbidden" transitions. For example, the lifetime of the hydrogen $2s$ state would be affected at $O(1)$ for $\rho\sim 0.1$ eV, suggesting new directions for fundamental tests of QED in laboratory experiments.</description>

      <title>Driven Non-Unitary Dynamics of Quantum Critical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the interplay between unitary and non-unitary driven many-body dynamics in (1+1)-dimensional quantum critical systems described by conformal field theory (CFT). By formulating a coherent state approach, we demonstrate that the growth of entanglement entropy and energy can be found analytically for a class of non-unitary driven CFTs, where the evolution alternates between real and imaginary time evolution, the latter corresponding to postselected weak measurements. We find that non-unitary evolution leads to the emergence of steady states at infinite times for the cases of periodic, quasiperiodic, and random drives. In a special class of drives, for mixed initial states, we uncover purification phase transitions that arise as a result of the competition between unitary evolution and weak measurements. We compare the CFT evolution with the corresponding non-unitary dynamics of critical lattice models, finding remarkable agreement.</description>

      <title>Towards an experimental implementation of entanglement harvesting in superconducting circuits: effect of detector gap variation on entanglement harvesting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the prospect of experimental implementations of entanglement harvesting in superconducting circuits, we propose a model of variable-gap particle detector that aims to bridge some of the gaps between Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) models and realistic implementations. Using parameters tailored to potential experimental setups, we investigate entanglement harvesting in both spacelike-separated and causally connected scenarios. Our findings reveal that while variations in the energy gap reduce the ability to harvest entanglement for spacelike-separated detectors, detectors in causal contact can still become entangled through their interaction with the field. Notably, our analysis shows that (due to the derivative coupling nature of the model) even for causally connected detectors, the entanglement primarily originates from the field's correlations. This demonstrates the potential for genuine entanglement harvesting in the lab and opens the door to near-future entanglement harvesting experiments in superconducting circuits.</description>

      <title>ACT DR6 Insights on the Inflationary Attractor models and Reheating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the observational constraints on $\alpha$-attractor inflationary models and their post-inflationary reheating dynamics in light of the latest CMB data from ACT DR6 combined with Planck18, BICEP/$Keck$ 2018, and DESI (collectively denoted P-ACT-LB-BK18). Focusing on both E and T type attractor potentials, we analyze how inflationary observables namely the scalar spectral index $n_s$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ are indirectly influenced by reheating parameters such as the reheating temperature $T_{\text{RH}}$, the inflaton equation-of-state $w_\phi$, and the inflaton's couplings to Starndard Model particles. We incorporate indirect constraints from the overproduction of primordial gravitational waves (PGWs), particularly via $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ bounds on BBN, which become significant for stiff post-inflationary dynamics. Our results show that E-models permit a wide range of reheating scenarios, including matter-like reheating ($w_\phi = 0$), while T-models are viable only for $w_\phi \gtrsim 0.44$. We derive bounds on inflaton-Standard Model couplings for both decay and scattering channels and identify parameter regimes compatible with recent ACT data for successful reheating. These findings establish a robust connection between inflationary theory, thermal history, and particle phenomenology, and provide predictive targets for future CMB missions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Attempts to improve LGT simulation algorithms by Fourier space preconditioning have been handicapped by the gauge dependence of momenta, familiar from perturbation theory. The continuum theory has a gauge invariant energy-momentum density, indicating this to be a fake obstacle. While perturbation-theory momenta are evidently wrong for the task, momentum-transfer carried by gluons is physical. Simulations using these momenta may become practical in the near future thanks to recent progress in generative models, stochastic and/or deterministic.</description>

      <title>Isentropic process of Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes: a possible excess of the entropy bound via a non-perturbative channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the implications of an isentropic processes applied to a Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole. This process is possible if a black hole absorbs a particle with a specific ratio of energy and charge. We show that such an absorption process is not classically allowed, not only in Einstein gravity but also in several modified gravity theories, indicating that this prohibition is quite generic. However, an isentropic absorption process is quantum mechanically allowed: the particle can penetrate the potential barrier on the event horizon. We compute the probability of this absorption process and compare it to that of semi-classical effects. Non-perturbatively, if this process is accumulated, it is possible that the entanglement entropy can be greater than its Bekenstein-Hawking entropy and violate the entropy-bound relation.</description>

      <title>Generalized susceptibilities and the properties of charm degrees of freedom across the QCD crossover temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the generalized charm susceptibilities in 2+1 flavor QCD on the lattice at several lattice spacings. We show that, below the chiral crossover, these susceptibilities are well described by the hadron resonance gas (HRG) model if charmed hadrons not listed in tables of the Particle Data Group are included. However, the HRG description abruptly breaks down just above the chiral crossover. To understand this, we use a model for the charm pressure in which it is expressed as the sum of partial pressures from charmed baryons, charmed mesons, and charm quarks. We present continuum estimates of these partial pressures and find that, while the partial pressures of charmed mesons and baryons drop below their respective HRG predictions, the charm quark pressure becomes non-zero above the chiral crossover.</description>

      <title>Deflection Angle in the Strong Deflection Limit and Quasinormal Modes in Stationary Axisymmetric Spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive a coordinate-invariant expression for the photon deflection angle in the strong deflection limit (SDL) of stationary axisymmetric spacetimes. The key logarithmic-divergence coefficient is shown to depend only on quantities locally measurable by a zero-angular-momentum observer -- curvature scalars, the circumferential radius, and the proper angular velocity. The same coefficient governs the damping rate of quasinormal modes (QNMs) in the eikonal limit, establishing a curvature-based, model-independent connection between QNMs and lensing in the SDL near rotating compact objects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collective excitations (phonons) in barotropic, irrotational, inviscid fluids exhibit an effective Lorentz invariance, where the sound speed plays the role of the invariant speed of light in special relativity. By carefully selecting the interaction potentials, we explicitly construct two hydrodynamic models in which phonons obey doubly special relativistic kinematics, with the analogue Planck scale emerging from non-Newtonian behaviour at high energies. Specifically, we demonstrate that elastic storage leads to an approximate realization of Amelino-Camelia's scenario, while the Magueijo-Smolin model naturally emerges in the presence of elastic restoring forces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This survey explores knot polynomials and their categorification, culminating in the homological invariants of knots. We begin with an overview of classical knot polynomials, progressing towards the superpolynomial and its role in unifying various knot homologies. Along the way, we provide physical and geometric insights into the unification of the $sl(N)$ Khovanov-Rozansky and the knot Floer homology. We then turn our attention to the intriguing correspondence between knots and quivers, examining how this perspective sheds light on the integrality of BPS states encoded in the Labastida-Mari\~no-Ooguri-Vafa (LMOV) invariants. We will further investigate the knot-quiver correspondence from a physics and geometric side and study the 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ theory $T[Q_K]$ for the quivers.</description>

      <title>The Boost Operator: Properties, Computation and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The transformation of radiation signals (e.g., photon occupation number and integrated intensity) between moving frames is a common task is physics, astrophysics and cosmology. Here we show that the required boost operator, relating the frequency-dependent spin-weighted spherical harmonic coefficients of the considered observable between the frames, is directly given by the aberration kernel with the Doppler weight parameter being replaced by a differential operator. The aberration kernel has been previously studied in great detail, meaning that this simplification allows us to directly compute the boost operator using the expressions of the aberration kernel. As a preparatory step, we generalize the differential equation that determines the aberration kernel to general Doppler weight. This avoids the intermediate step of Doppler-weight raising and lowering operations in computations of the boost operator. We then clarify all the properties of the boost operator (e.g., raising and lowering operations, symmetries and commutation relations) and derive a formal operator differential equation for the boost operator. This differential equation allows us to quickly generate the boost operator for which we give exact expressions up to second order in v/c. For illustration, we then apply the boost operator to transformations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), validating that measurements of the lowest CMB multipoles do not allow determining the amplitude of the primordial CMB dipole. We also derive the kinematic corrections to the Thomson scattering process (to all orders in v/c), giving explicit expressions up to second order in v/c, showcasing an application of the boost operator in radiative transfer problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the Bogomol'nyi equations in generalized Abelian Higgs theories which allow the coexistence of vortices and antivortices over a compact Riemann surface or the full plane. In the compact surface situation, we obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a unique solution describing a system of coexisting vortices and antivortices. In the full-plane situation, we prove the existence of a unique solution representing an arbitrary distribution of vortices and antivortices and obtain sharp asymptotic behavior of the solution near infinity. These solutions carry quantized magnetic fluxes and energies explicitly expressed in terms of the numbers of vortices and antivortices topologically characterized by the first Chern and Thom classes.</description>

      <title>Packaged Quantum States for Gauge-Invariant Quantum Computation and Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Packaged quantum states are gauge-invariant states in which all internal quantum numbers (IQNs) form an inseparable block. This feature gives rise to novel packaged entanglements that encompass all IQNs, which is important both for fundamental physics and for quantum technology. Here we develop a framework for gauge-invariant quantum information processing based on packaged quantum states. We propose the necessary and sufficient conditions for a valid packaged superposition state of a single particle and multi-particle. We then present the details of constructing gauge-invariant packaged qubits (or qudits), packaged gates, and packaged circuits (which commute with the total charge operator). These serve as alternative foundation for gauge-invariant quantum information science. We then adapt conventional quantum error-correction codes, quantum algorithms, and quantum communication protocols to the ($d \times D$)-dimensional hybrid-packaged subspace. This high-dimensional hybrid-packaged subspace is flexible for pruning and scaling to match available physics systems. Thus, packaged quantum information processing becomes feasible and testable. 
Our results show that the gauge-invariant packaged quantum states may provide a possible route toward robust, fault-tolerant, and secure quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Stochastic analysis of finite-temperature effects on cosmological parameters by artificial neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the impact of finite-temperature quantum gravity effects on cosmological parameters, particularly the cosmological constant $\Lambda$, by incorporating temperature-dependent quantum corrections into the Hubble parameter. For that purpose, we modify the Cosmic Linear Anisotropy Solving System. We introduce new density parameters, $\Omega_{\Lambda_2}$ and $\Omega_{\Lambda_3}$, arising from finite-temperature quantum gravity contributions, and analyze their influence on the cosmic microwave background power spectrum using advanced machine learning techniques, including artificial neural networks and stochastic optimization. Our results reveal that $\Omega_{\Lambda_3}$ assumes a negative value, consistent with dimensional regularization in renormalization and that the presence of $\Omega_{\Lambda_2}$ as well as $\Omega_{\Lambda_3}$ significantly enhances model accuracy. Numerical analyses demonstrate that the inclusion of these parameters improves the fit to 2018 Planck data, suggesting that finite-temperature quantum gravity effects play a non-negligible role in cosmological evolution. Although the Hubble tension persists, our findings highlight the potential of quantum gravitational corrections in refining cosmological models and motivate further investigation into higher-order thermal effects and polarization data constraints.</description>

      <title>Information geometry and entanglement under phase-space deformation through nonsymplectic congruence transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Fisher-Rao (FR) information matrix is a central object in multiparameter quantum estimation theory. The geometry of a quantum state can be envisaged through the Riemannian manifold generated by the FR-metric corresponding to the quantum state. Interestingly, any congruence transformation $GL(2n,\mathbb{R})$ in phase-space leaves the FR-distance for Gaussian states invariant. In the present paper, we investigate whether this isometry affects the entanglement in the bipartite system. It turns out that, even a simple choice of a congruence transformation, induces the entanglement in a bipartite Gaussian system.
  To make our study relevant to physical systems, we choose Bopp's shift in phase-space as an example of $GL(2n,\mathbb{R})$, so that the results can be interpreted in terms of noncommutative (NC) phase-space deformation. We explicitly provide a quantitative measure of the dependence of separability on NC parameters. General expressions for the metric structure are also provided.
  The crucial point in the present piece of study is the identification of the connection of phase-space deformation-induced entanglement through a general class of congruence transformation and the identification of a trade-off relationship between the initial correlations and deformation parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores how the spontaneous violation of Lorentz symmetry -- modeled through a black hole solution in the context of bumblebee gravity -- affects the propagation and dynamics of neutrinos. The investigation centers on three distinct aspects: the rate of energy deposition due to neutrino-antineutrino pair annihilation, modifications to the neutrino oscillation phase driven by the underlying spacetime structure, and the influence of gravitational lensing on flavor conversion probabilities. To support the theoretical considerations, numerical simulations are conducted for oscillation probabilities in a two-flavor framework, taking into account both normal and inverted mass orderings. For comparison, the outcomes are juxtaposed with those obtained in a different Lorentz-violating background, namely, a black hole solution within Kalb-Ramond gravity.</description>

      <title>On Charged Black Holes in Einstein-Weyl-Maxwell Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There exist two branches of static and spherically symmetric black hole solutions in Einstein-Weyl theory: one is the Schwarzschild black hole, and the other is a numerically constructed black hole that bifurcates from the Schwarzschild solution. Similarly, there are two branches of charged black holes in Einstein-Weyl-Maxwell theory. We have uncovered the relationships between the charged black holes and the neutral ones. The two charged black holes branch out from the bifurcation point of the neutral ones once charge is added. We found that one of the charged black holes is entirely different from the Reissner-Nordstr\"om (RN) black hole, while the other is similar to the RN black hole. In particular, the RN-like black hole approaches the RN black hole as the charge increases. We calculated the charge-to-mass ratio of the RN-like charged black hole in the near-extremal limit, and the value is less than that of the extremal RN black hole. Since we consider the higher-derivative Weyl square term as part of the classical gravity theory, rather than as a quantum effect, our result sets a lower bound on the charge-to-mass ratio in the context of the Weak Gravity Conjecture.</description>

      <title>Smarr formula for black holes with primary and secondary scalar hair</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we revisit the thermodynamics of black holes endowed with primary and secondary scalar hair in the shift and ${\rm Z}_2$ symmetric subclass of beyond Horndeski gravity. Under a specific fine-tuning of the scalar parameter $q$ in terms of the black hole mass, the singular black-hole solution with primary scalar hair reduces to the regular Bardeen solution featuring secondary scalar hair. We first demonstrate that the traditional thermodynamic approach fails to yield a consistent Smarr formula for both solutions under consideration. To address this issue, we adopt the approach introduced in [Phys$.$Rev$.$Lett. 132 (2024) 19, 191401], and we derive both the first law of black hole thermodynamics and the Smarr formula, offering a consistent thermodynamic description for scalar-hairy black holes. As an additional outcome, our analysis reveals a connection between the solutions with primary and secondary scalar hair.</description>

We find static charged vortex solutions of finite energy and, for the critical couplings of the quartic self-interaction coupling of complex scalar field and the cubic Yukawa type coupling between neutral and complex scalar field, these charged vortices saturate the BPS (Bogomolny-Prasad-Sommerfield) bound, that guarantees the nonperturbative classification of type I and II superconductors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the canonical seesaw mechanism, the strengths of charged-current interactions for light and heavy Majorana neutrinos are described respectively by the $3\times 3$ matrices $U$ and $R$ that are correlated with each other via the exact seesaw relation and the unitarity condition. We write out the Majorana-type invariants of CP violation of $R$ and $U$, which are insensitive to redefining the phases of three charged-lepton fields; and the Dirac-type invariants of CP violation of $R$ and $U$ that are insensitive to the rephasing of both the charged-lepton fields and the neutrino fields. Such invariants are explicitly calculated with the help of a full Euler-like block parametrization of the seesaw flavor structure containing nine active-sterile flavor mixing angles and six independent CP-violating phases, and their corresponding roles in the CP-violating asymmetries of three heavy Majorana neutrino decays and in the flavor oscillations of three light Majorana neutrinos are briefly discussed. We point out that similar rephasing invariants arising from the interplay between $R$ and $U$ may also manifest themselves in a variety of lepton-flavor-violating and lepton-number-violating processes.</description>

Abstract: We will summarize recent results on the Hamiltonian equivalence between the Jordan and Einstein frames based on the analysis of Brans-Dicke theory for both cases \omega\neq -\frac{3}{2} and \omega =-\frac{3}{2}. We will introduce and perform ADM analysis for spherically symmetric solutions of gravity. We will discuss with particular care the problem of the boundary terms to be introduced in the general case of spherical symmetry. These two frames are connected through a Hamiltonian canonical transformation on the reduced phase space obtained by gauge fixing the lapse and the radial shift functions. We introduce and discuss two static solutions (Fisher, Janis, Newman and Winicour solution in the Einstein frame and Bocharova-Bronnikov-Melnikov-Bekenstein black hole solution in the Jordan frame)</description>

      <title>Exponential improvement in quantum simulations of bosons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hamiltonian quantum simulation of bosons on digital quantum computers requires truncating the Hilbert space to finite dimensions. The method of truncation and the choice of basis states can significantly impact the complexity of the quantum circuit required to simulate the system. For example, a truncation in the Fock basis where each boson is encoded with a register of $Q$ qubits, can result in an exponentially large number of Pauli strings required to decompose the truncated Hamiltonian. This, in turn, can lead to an exponential increase in $Q$ in the complexity of the quantum circuit. For lattice quantum field theories such as Yang-Mills theory and QCD, several Hamiltonian formulations and corresponding truncations have been put forward in recent years. There is no exponential increase in $Q$ when resorting to the orbifold lattice Hamiltonian, while we do not know how to remove the exponential complexity in $Q$ in the commonly used Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonian. Specifically, when using the orbifold lattice Hamiltonian, the continuum limit, or, in other words, the removal of the ultraviolet energy cutoff, is obtained with circuits whose resources scale like $Q$, while they scale like $\mathcal{O}(\exp(Q))$ for the Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonian: this can be seen as an exponential speed up in approaching the physical continuum limit for the orbifold lattice Hamiltonian formulation. We show that the universal framework, advocated by three of the authors (M.~H., S.~M., and E.~R.) and collaborators provides a natural avenue to solve the exponential scaling of circuit complexity with $Q$, and it is the reason why using the orbifold lattice Hamiltonian is advantageous. We also point out that Hamiltonian formulations based on a gauge-invariant Hilbert space require an exponential increase in the resource requirement with respect to using an extended Hilbert space.</description>

      <title>Quantum Cosmology Without Singularities: A New Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The article is dedicated to a discussion regarding the role of Barrow's ''Zero Universes'' in quantum cosmology. In particular, we demonstrate that if quantum gravity effects are modeled by the quantum potential method associated with the ''many interacting universes'' (MIU) model, then the mere presence of the universes with a zero scale factor (the ``Zero universes'') produces a veritably remarkable outcome: the classical cosmological singularities of Big Bang, Big Crunch and Big Rip all fail to arise. In other words, those universes that are considered ill-posed at the classical level may turn out to be a necessary and sought-after ingredient in a future internally consistent quantum theory of gravity. Finally, we argue that the MIU quantization method might shed light on a number of other cosmological mysteries; for example, it might account for a decoherence which preceded the eternal inflation, and elucidate how the quantum superposition of vacuum decays occurring at different places might give birth to actual bubble universes there. In addition, the new method might help explain why our universe was born in an extremely low-entropy initial state required to trigger the initial inflation.</description>

      <title>Constraining the neutron star equation of state by including the isoscalar-vector and isovector-vector coupling using the Bayesian analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We constrain the nuclear matter equation of state within the relativistic mean field model by including the isoscalar-vector and isovector-vector coupling term at a fundamental level using the Bayesian analysis. We used the nuclear saturation properties and recent astrophysical observations to constrain the dense matter equation of state. We obtained about 20000 sets of equations of states out of sampling about 60 millions sets of equations of states. All 20000 equations of states satisfy nuclear matter saturation properties at saturation densities and produces high mass neutron stars. In our findings, we find that the non-zero value of isoscalar-vector and isovector-vector coupling parameter and negative value of sigma meson self-coupling stiffen the equation of state. Our sets of equations of state produces neutron stars of mass larger than 2.5 M$_{\odot}$ to include the recent gravitational waves observation GW190419.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the latest empirical constraints on cosmology from a combination of DESI, CMB and supernova data, can be accounted for if a small component of dark matter has an evolving and oscillating equation of state within $-1&lt;w&lt;1$. From a fundamental physics perspective, this interpretation is more appealing than an evolving phantom dark energy with $w&lt;-1$, which violates the null energy condition.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the cosmological dynamics of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity models in a four-dimensional spatially flat FLRW metric. These models are described by $f\left( R,\mathcal{G}\right) =f\left( R+\mu \mathcal{G}\right) $ theory of gravity. They are equivalent to models linear in the Ricci scalar $R$ and in the Gauss-Bonnet scalar $\mathcal{G}$ with one nonminimally coupled scalar field without kinetic term. We analyze the stability of the de Sitter solutions and construct the phase space of the field equations to investigate the cosmological evolution. We show that $f\left( R+\mu \mathcal{G}\right) $-theory provides a double inflationary epoch, this can be used to unify the early-time and late-time acceleration phases of the universe. Moreover, we discuss the initial value problem for theory to be cosmologically viable. Finally, the effects of the cold dark matter in cosmic evolution are discussed.</description>

Abstract: We apply the formalism of coherent states in quantum optics to pomeron evolution and show that evolving squeezed pomeron states are equivalent to pomeron fan diagrams at the leading order of perturbative expansion.

      <title>Entanglement between pair-created universes bridged by a wormhole and its implications to big bang cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Invoking the Klebanov-Susskind-Banks Euclidean wormhole as a bridge, we investigate the power spectrum and the entanglement between two pair-created universes. We construct a suitable global vacuum for the perturbations of the inflaton field in the Euclidean regime, which becomes a mixed state when restricted to one of the paired universes. This mixed state leads to an enhancement of the power spectrum for long-wavelength modes. In addition, entanglement between the two universes is realized by the existence of the wormhole. Thus, the power spectrum enhancement in the long-wavelength regime might be evidence of our universe being created from a Euclidean wormhole that was entangled with a partner universe, and hence our universe does not begin with a pure state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.00770v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Form factors of self-dual gauge theory are equal to correlators of an (extended) celestial chiral algebra. This suggests that these form factors can be computed using the "bootstrap" method familiar from 2d CFTs. The method can also be applied to certain QCD amplitudes, which are built from form-factors of self-dual gauge theory.
  In this paper this bootstrap method is applied to compute two-loop all-plus QCD amplitudes, for $SU(N)$ gauge theory with certain special matter content. A closed formula is presented for all single-trace amplitudes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.15671v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the study of entanglement island in the Karch-Randall braneworld, it has been conjectured and proven in general that entanglement island is not consistent with long-range (massless) gravity. In this paper, we provide a careful check of this conclusion in a model of massless gravity that is constructed using the Karch-Randall braneworld. We show that there is indeed no entanglement island and hence not a nontrivial Page curve due to the diffeomorphism invariance if we are studying the correct question which is though subtle. Moreover, we show that this conclusion is not affected by deforming the setup with the Dvali--Gabadadze--Porrati (DGP) terms. Furthermore, we show that the consistency of holography in this model will provide nontrivial constraints to the DGP parameters. This study provides an example that causality and holography in anti-de Sitter space can be used to constrain low energy effective theories. At the end, we clarify several subtleties in the braneworld gravity which are overlooked in the literature and we discuss the robustness of the above results against possible coarse-graining protocols to define a subregion in a gravitational theory.</description>

Abstract: A well-established organisational principle for Argyres--Douglas-type $\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal field theories in four dimensions is to characterise such theories by the data defining a(n irregular) Hitchin system on $\mathbb{CP}^1$. The dictionary between Hitchin system data and various features of the corresponding SCFT has been studied extensively, but the overall structure of the resulting space of SCFTs still appears quite complicated. In this work, we systematically delineate a variety of simplifications that arise within this class of constructions due to several large classes of isomorphisms between SCFTs associated with inequivalent Hitchin system data (and their exactly marginal gaugings). We restrict to the most studied class of theories, namely the type $A$ theories without outer automorphism twists.</description>

Abstract: We continue our analysis of bad theories, focusing on quiver theories with bad unitary and special unitary gauge groups in three dimensions. By extending the dualization algorithm we prove that the partition function of bad linear quivers can be written as a distribution, given by a sum of terms involving a product of delta functions times the partition function of a good quiver theory. We describe in detail the good quiver theories appearing in the partition function of the bad theory and discuss the brane interpretation of our result. We also discuss in detail the lift of these theories to 4d quivers with symplectic gauge groups, in which our results can be recovered by studying the Higgsing triggered by the expectation value for certain chiral operators. The paper is accompanied by a Mathematica file which implements the algorithm for an arbitrary unitary bad linear quiver.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17303v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive necessary and sufficient conditions for AdS$_3$ solutions of $d=11$ supergravity to preserve ${\cal N}=(1,1)$ supersymmetry in terms of G-structures. Such solutions necessarily support an SU(3)-structure on the internal 8-manifold M$_8$, in terms of which we phrase the conditions for supersymmetry preservation. We use this to derive the local form of all ${\cal N}=(4,4)$ supersymmetric AdS$_3$ solutions in $d=11$, for which M$_8$ decomposes as a foliation of a 3-sphere over a 5 dimensional base. There are 3 independent classes, 2 of which preserve the small superconformal algebra and one preserving its large counterpart for which M$_5$ contains a second 3-sphere. We show that for each solution with large (4,4) supersymmetry there are two corresponding solutions with small $(4,4)$, one for which M$_5$ maintains its 3-sphere, one where this blows up to $\mathbb{R}^3$ which can be compactified to $\mathbb{T}^3$. We use our results to construct several new solutions that lie within our derived classes as well as recovering some existing solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03820v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A basic datum of a rank-$r$ $\mathcal{N}{=}2$ superconformal field theory (SCFT) is the $r$-tuple of its Coulomb branch scaling dimensions, i.e., the scaling dimensions of a set of special protected scalar operators whose vevs generate the coordinate ring of the Coulomb branch of the theory. It is well known that when the coordinate ring is freely generated these scaling dimensions can only take values in a small set of rational numbers. But there are further constraints on which $r$-tuples of these numbers can appear. The main aim of this work is to clarify what these are. Along the way we also compute explicitly the $r$-tuples of allowed scaling dimensions for theories of ranks $r = 2, 3, 4$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, working in the eikonal approximation, we present a proof for the exponentiation of the 2-body eikonal phase to {\it all orders in the eikonal expansion}, for scalar particles interacting electromagnetically or gravitationally. The proof is based on the worldline formalism, which is an alternative, first quantized method to the standard QFT calculation of the scattering amplitude. We show that in the worldline formalism the 2-body scattering amplitude written in impact parameter space naturally factorizes at each loop order. This factorization is responsible for the exponentiation of the eikonal phase, a result which was anticipated in the work of Mogull, Plefka, and Steinhoff [2010.02865 [hep-th]].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15193v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the homogeneous breaking of spatial translation symmetry concomitantly with the spontaneous breaking of other internal and spacetime symmetries, including dilations. We use the symmetry-breaking pattern as the only input to derive, via the coset construction, general effective field theories for the symmetry-originated modes associated with Goldstone's theorem, namely the Nambu-Goldstone candidates. Through explicit computations, we show that integrating out the explicit massive Nambu-Goldstone candidates or imposing symmetric constraints, namely the inverse Higgs constraints, to express massive modes in terms of the massless ones leads to physically distinct effective field theories. This sensitivity to the chosen method can be traced back to the homogeneous breaking of translations, the homogeneous aspect of the breaking induces a mixing between internal and spacetime symmetries at the level of the Lie algebra. This, in turn, leads to subtle discussions about the inverse Higgs constraints, in particular that they lead to a loss of generality in our specific examples. The derived general effective field theories also give rise to a broad class of theories exhibiting emergent enhanced shift symmetries, which constrain the mobility of the modes. The latter are referred to as fractonic modes.</description>

      <title>Worldline Formalism, Eikonal Expansion and the Classical Limit of Scattering Amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17866v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the fundamentals of two different methods for calculating classical observables: the eikonal method, which is a scattering amplitude-based method, and the worldline quantum field theory (WQFT) method. The latter has been considered an extension of the worldline effective field theory. We show that the eikonal and WQFT methods are equivalent and that calculations can be translated freely between them.
  Concretely, we focus on 2-into-2 scattering processes mediated by massless force carriers. On the one hand, taking the classical limit of the QFT scattering amplitude leads to the eikonal method. On the other hand, since in the classical limit the scattering particles are almost on-shell throughout the scattering process, the worldline, a first quantized formalism, is the most efficient framework to study the scattering amplitude. This is an alternate but equivalent formalism to the quantum field theoretic (QFT) framework. By taking the classical limit of the scattering amplitude computed in the worldline, we can derive the WQFT rules of Mogull, Plefka and Steinhoff. In WQFT, the Feynman diagrams are reorganized into a new set of diagrams that facilitate the $\hbar$ expansion. Unlike the QFT eikonal method, which works recursively in identifying the eikonal phase, the worldline-based computation allows to target and systematically extract the classical contributions directly through a specific set of WQFT diagrams. In worldline formalism the perturbative expansion of the scattering amplitude is naturally organized in diagrams which factorize (reducible) and diagrams which are new to that order (irreducible), in a one-to-one map with the structure of the amplitude in the eikonal method. This opened up the possibility to investigate and prove the conjectured exponentiation of the eikonal phase in arXiv: 2409.12895.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01435v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a new construction of superfield collinear twist-$2$ operators as infinite-dimensional, irreducible representations of the collinear superconformal algebra in $\mathcal{N}=1$ superconformal field theories. As an application, we realize the above representations in terms of free superfields, in a manifestly gauge-invariant and supersymmetric-covariant fashion, in the zero coupling limit of $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills (SYM) theory. This realization makes manifest their mixing and renormalization properties at one loop. We also extend to the superfield formalism the perturbative and nonperturbative techniques in [1-7] to a large class of supersymmetric theories that are superconformal in the zero-coupling limit. Specifically, we compute the generating functional of superfield twist-$2$ operators in $\mathcal{N}=1$ SU($N$) SYM theory in the zero coupling limit. We also work out in a closed form the corresponding asymptotic renormalization-group improved generating functional in Euclidean superspace and its planar and leading nonplanar large-$N$ expansion. We verify -- as originally predicted in [5] and verified in the component formalism [3, 4, 6, 7] -- that the leading nonplanar asymptotic RG-improved generating functional matches the structure of logarithm of a functional superdeterminant of the corresponding nonperturbative object, which it should be asymptotic to at short distances because of the asymptotic freedom. Hence, our large-$N$ computation sets strong ultraviolet asymptotic constraints on the nonperturbative solution of large-$N$ $\mathcal{N} = 1$ SYM theory that may be a pivotal guide for the search of such a solution.</description>

      <title>A universal inequality on the unitary 2D CFT partition function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18174v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the conjecture proposed by Hartman, Keller and Stoica [HKS14]: the grand-canonical free energy of a unitary 2D CFT with a sparse spectrum below the scaling dimension $\frac{c}{12}+\epsilon$ and below the twist $\frac{c}{12}$ is universal in the large $c$ limit for all $\beta_L\beta_R \neq 4\pi^2$.
  The technique of the proof allows us to derive a one-parameter (with parameter $\alpha\in(0,1]$) family of universal inequalities on the unitary 2D CFT partition function with general central charge $c\geqslant 0$, using analytical modular bootstrap. We derive an iterative equation for the domain of validity of the inequality on the $(\beta_L,\beta_R)$ plane. The infinite iteration of this equation gives the boundary of maximal-validity domain, which depends on the parameter $\alpha$ in the inequality.
  In the $c \to \infty$ limit, with the additional assumption of a sparse spectrum below the scaling dimension $\frac{c}{12} + \epsilon$ and the twist $\frac{\alpha c}{12}$ (with $\alpha \in (0,1]$ fixed), our inequality shows that the grand-canonical free energy exhibits a universal large $c$ behavior in the maximal-validity domain. This domain, however, does not cover the entire $(\beta_L, \beta_R)$ plane, except in the case of $\alpha = 1$. For $\alpha = 1$, this proves the conjecture proposed by [HKS14], and for $\alpha &lt; 1$, it quantifies how sparseness in twist affects the regime of universality. Furthermore, this implies a precise lower bound on the temperature of near-extremal BTZ black holes, above which we can trust the black hole thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>A Gapless Phase with Haagerup Symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19040v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a (1+1)d gapless theory which has Haagerup $\mathcal{H}_3$ symmetry. The construction relies on the recent exploration of the categorical Landau paradigm applied to fusion category symmetries. First, using the Symmetry Topological Field Theory, we construct all gapped phases with Haagerup symmetry. Extending this construction to gapless phases, we study the second order phase transition between gapped phases, and determine analytically a Haagerup-symmetric conformal field theory. This is given in terms of two copies of the three-state Potts model, on which we realise the full $\mathcal{H}_3$ symmetry action and determine the relevant deformations to the $\mathcal{H}_3$-symmetric gapped phases. This continuum analysis is corroborated by a lattice model construction of the gapped and gapless phases, using the anyon chain.</description>

      <title>Nonsingular black holes as dark matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21577v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is commonly assumed that low-mass primordial black holes cannot constitute a significant fraction of the dark matter in our universe due to their predicted short lifetimes from the conventional Hawking radiation and evaporation process. Assuming physical black holes are nonsingular--likely due to quantum gravity or other high-energy physics--we demonstrate that a large class of nonsingular black holes have finite evaporation temperatures. This can lead to slowly evaporating low-mass black holes or to remnant mass states that circumvent traditional evaporation constraints. As a proof of concept, we explore the limiting curvature hypothesis and the evaporation process of a nonsingular black hole solution in two-dimensional dilaton gravity. We identify generic features of the radiation profile and compare them with known regular black holes, such as the Bardeen solution in four dimensions. Remnant masses are proportional to the fundamental length scale, and we argue that slowly evaporating low-mass nonsingular black holes, or remnants, are viable dark matter candidates.</description>

Abstract: We discuss, at leading order in $\hbar$, the quantum mechanics of a specific realization in phase space of the Yang model describing noncommutative geometry in a curved background. In particular, we show how the deformation of the Heisenberg uncertainty relations crucially depends on the signs of the coupling constants of the model. We also discuss the dynamics of the free particle and of the harmonic oscillator. Also in this case the results depend on the signs of the coupling constants.</description>

      <title>An entropic puzzle in periodic dilaton gravity and DSSYK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16922v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study 2d dilaton gravity theories with a periodic potential, with special emphasis on sine dilaton gravity, which is holographically dual to double-scaled SYK. The periodicity of the potentials implies a symmetry under (discrete) shifts in the momentum conjugate to the length of geodesic slices. This results in divergences. The correct definition is to gauge this symmetry. This discretizes the geodesic lengths. Lengths below a certain threshold are null states. Because of these null states, the entropy deviates drastically from Bekenstein-Hawking and the Hilbert space becomes finite dimensional. The spacetimes have a periodic radial coordinate. These are toy models of 2d quantum cosmology with a normalizable wavefunction. We study two limiting dualities: one between flat space quantum gravity and the Heisenberg algebra, and one between topological gravity and the Gaussian matrix integral. We propose an exact density of states for certain classes of periodic dilaton gravity models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09815v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As analogues of compact objects, solitons have attracted significant attention. We reveal that cylindrical Q-strings exhibit a dynamical instability to perturbations with wavelengths exceeding a threshold $\lambda&gt;\lambda_{c}$. This instability can destroy the invariance in the cylindrical direction, as a generation mechanism for Q-balls, similar to the formation of droplets. As the interface of Q-strings approaches a thin wall, this long-wavelength instability degenerates into the Rayleigh-Plateau instability with a threshold related only to the geometric radius $\lambda_{c}=2\pi R$. Such results indicate that Q-strings, like black strings, resemble low-viscosity fluids with surface tension.</description>

      <title>Celestial Quantum Error Correction II: From Qudits to Celestial CFT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19653v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A holographic CFT description of asymptotically flat spacetimes inherits vacuum degeneracies and IR divergences from its gravitational dual. We devise a Quantum Error Correcting (QEC) framework to encode both effects as correctable fluctuations on the CFT dual. The framework is physically motivated by embedding a chain of qudits in the so-called Klein spacetime and then taking a continuum $N\to \infty$ limit. At finite $N$ the qudit chain 1) enjoys a discrete version of celestial symmetries and 2) supports a Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) code. The limit results in hard states with quantized BMS hair in the celestial torus forming the logical subspace, robust under errors induced by soft radiation. Technically, the construction leverages the recently studied $w_{1+\infty}$ hierarchy of soft currents and its realization from a sigma model in twistor space.</description>

      <title>Boundary Quantum Field Theories Perturbed by ${\rm T}\bar{\rm T}$: Towards a Form Factor Program</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11647v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our understanding of irrelevant perturbations of integrable quantum field theories has greatly expanded over the last decade. In particular, we know that, from a scattering theory viewpoint at least, their effect is realised as a modification the two-body scattering amplitudes by a CDD factor. While this sounds like a relatively small change, this CDD factor incorporates a non-trivial dependence on the perturbation parameter(s) and alters substantially the high-energy physics of the model. This occurs through the introduction of a natural length scale and is associated with phenomena such as the Hagedorn transition. In this paper we discuss how all these features extend to boundary integrable quantum field theories and propose a construction for the building blocks of matrix elements of local fields. We show that the same type of building blocks are also found in the sinh-Gordon model with Dirichlet boundary conditions.</description>

Abstract: Working in a sector of large charge is a powerful tool to analytically access models that are either strongly coupled or otherwise difficult to solve explicitly. In the context of integrable systems, Volin's method is exactly such a large-charge approach. In this note, we apply this method to the bi-Yang-Baxter deformed $SU(2)$ principal chiral model. Our main result is an explicit expression for the free energy density as an asymptotic expansion. We moreover determine the leading non-perturbative effects both via analytic methods and a resurgence analysis.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the effects of logarithms on the asymptotic behavior of power expansion/OPE in supper-renormalizable QFTs. We performed a careful investigation of the large $p^2$ expansion of a scalar-scalar two-point function at the next-to-leading order in the large-$N$ expansion, in a large-$N$ $O(N)$ quartic model that is populated by logarithms. We show that because the large-$p^2$ logarithms of the individual bubbles can be amplified by bubble-chains, there are factorial enhancements to the power expansion. We show how the factorial enhancements appear separately in the coefficient functions and operator condensates, and demonstrate how they are cancelled off-diagonally across different powers. Restricted to any given power, the factorial enhancements are no-longer canceled. The large-$p^2$ power expansion is divergent.</description>

      <title>Cherenkov emission by a fast-moving uncharged Schwarzschild black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02811v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that, in the presence of an external magnetic field, an uncharged classical Schwarzschild black hole moving superluminally in a dielectric with permittivity $\epsilon &gt; 1$ produces Cherenkov emission. This is a new physical effect: classical (non-quantum) emission of electromagnetic waves by a completely charge-neutral ``particle.'' The governing equations (involving general relativity, electromagnetism, and the physics of continuous media) have no external electromagnetic source -- it is the distortion of the initial electromagnetic fields by the gravity of the black hole that plays the role of a superluminally moving source. The effect relies on nonzero values of both the magnetic field and the gravitational radius, as well as on the usual Cherenkov condition on the velocity, $v/c &gt; 1/\sqrt{\epsilon}$. Unlike Cherenkov emission by a point charge, the effective source in this case is spatially distributed, with emission generated along the single Cherenkov emission cone. The emitted spectrum is red-dominated, with power $\propto dk_z /|k_z|$ for wave numbers $|k_z| \leq 1/R_G$, where $R_G$ is the Schwarzschild radius. We comment on possible observability of this process during black hole -- neutron star mergers.</description>

      <title>A Non-Relativistic Limit for Heterotic Supergravity and its Gauge Lagrangian</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08711v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the $D=10$ heterotic supergravity in a non-relativistic (NR) limit has a finite Lagrangian due to non-trivial cancellations of divergent parts arising from the Chern-Simons terms in the curvature of the $\hat B$-field and the Yang-Mills Lagrangian. This is similar to what happens in bosonic supergravity between the Ricci scalar, $\hat R$, and the $- \frac{1}{12} \hat H^2$ term, under the same limit. In this work we present the explicit form of the gauge transformations and curvatures after considering a NR limit and we compute the full finite Lagrangian in its covariant form. Particularly, we address both the ungauged part and the gauged part, and we write it using covariant derivatives and curvatures for the gauge fields. These results constitutes the first computation of a finite Lagrangian for heterotic supergravity under these kinds of limits. As an interesting feature of the expansion implemented, the Green-Schwarz mechanism for the two-form can be trivialized and terms equivalent to Chern-Simons contributions naturally arise from the previous property.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Phases of Higher Dimensional Floquet CFTs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00099v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the dynamical phases of Floquet Conformal Field Theories (CFTs) in space-time dimensions greater than two. Building upon our previous work [1] which introduced quaternionic representations for studying Floquet dynamics in higher-dimensional CFTs, we now explore more general square pulse drive protocols that go beyond a single SU(1,1) subgroup. We demonstrate that, for multi-step drive protocols, the system exhibits distinct dynamical phases characterized by the nature of the eigenvalues of the quaternionic matrix representing time evolution in a single cycle, leading to different stroboscopic responses. Our analysis establishes a fundamental geometric interpretation where these dynamical phases directly correspond to the presence or absence of Killing horizons in the base space of the CFT and in a higher dimensional AdS space on which a putative dual lives. The heating phase is associated with a non-extremal horizon, the critical phase with an extremal horizon which disappears in the non heating phase. We develop perturbative approaches to compute the Floquet Hamiltonians in different regimes and show, how tuning drive parameters can lead to horizons, providing a geometric framework for understanding heating phenomena in driven conformal systems.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the microscopic derivation of the entropy and the holographic RG flow in 3D C-metric. We first discuss the case of a sector in BTZ (Banados-Teitelboim-Zanelli) black hole. By rescaling the Newton's constant we recover the area law of entropy of this sector by microstate counting. Then we apply this technique to all accelerating BTZ phases in 3D C-metric. Finally, for the boundary entropy in 3D C-metric, we study the monotonicity of the $g$-function of 3D C-metric in small acceleration limit and find that the $g$-theorem is satisfied only in $\rm I_{2}$.</description>

      <title>Non-relativistic Strings: Classical solutions and exactly solvable models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20252v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss classical closed string solutions in non-relativistic two-sphere target spaces. These classes of solutions closely relate to the GKP-type, spinning and pulsating strings for the relativistic case. We derive the string dynamics in each case and construct relevant dispersion relations, both from the string Newton-Cartan intrinsic sigma model and using a large speed of light expansion of relativistic Polyakov action. We further discuss construction and characteristics of exactly solvable Neumann-Rosochatius-like dynamical systems corresponding to strings in leading and subleading orders of the expanded Polyakov theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21104v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Weyl group symmetric structure of SU(3) quantum chromodynamics (QCD) with one flavor quark is considered. It has been demonstrated that Weyl group as a finite color subgroup of SU(3) provides an intrinsic color symmetry of quark and gluon fields on mass shell. We show that standard QCD equations of motion lead to systems of equations for quarks and gluons forming non-trivial irreducible multiplets in one- and two-dimensional representations of the Weyl group. Some implications of Weyl multiplet structure in QCD and hadron physics are considered.</description>

      <title>Two New Avatars of Moonshine for the Thompson Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.08277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.08277v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Thompson sporadic group admits special relationships to modular forms of two kinds. On the one hand, last century's generalized moonshine for the monster equipped the Thompson group with a module for which the associated McKay-Thompson series are distinguished weight zero modular functions. On the other hand, Griffin and Mertens verified the existence of a module for which the McKay-Thompson series are distinguished modular forms of weight one-half, that were assigned to the Thompson group in this century by the last two authors of this work. In this paper we round out this picture by proving the existence of two new avatars of Thompson moonshine: a new module giving rise to weight zero modular functions, and a new module giving rise to forms of weight one-half. We explain how the newer modules are related to the older ones by Borcherds products and traces of singular moduli. In so doing we clarify the relationship between the previously known modules, and expose a new arithmetic aspect to moonshine for the Thompson group. We also present evidence that this phenomenon extends to a correspondence between other cases of generalized monstrous moonshine and penumbral moonshine, and thereby enriches these phenomena with counterparts in weight one-half and weight zero, respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03558v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scalar-tensor theories have shown promise in many sectors of cosmology. However, recent constraints from the speed of gravitational waves have put severe limits on the breadth of models such classes of theories can realize. In this work, we explore the possibility of a Horndeski Lagrangian that is equipped with two dilaton fields. The evolution of a two-dilation coupled cosmology is not well-known in the literature. We explore the tensor perturbations in order to assess the behavior of the model again the speed of gravitational wave constraint. Our main result is that this model exhibits of a class of cosmological theories that is consistent with this observational constraint.</description>

Abstract: We define and study the face stratification of the m=2 amplituhedron. We show that the face poset is an upper order ideal in the face poset of the totally nonnegative Grassmannian.

      <title>Experimental Bounds on Deformed Muon Lifetime Dilation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05150v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze Planck scale induced modifications of the relativistic time dilation using data from the Muon Storage Ring experiment at CERN. By examining the lifetimes of muons, we establish, for the first time, a constraint on such quantum gravity-inspired deformations using this channel. The magnitude of the effect indicates that the study of cosmic rays is a well suited arena for this scenario. We show, that the spectrum of muons would be significantly affected for particles at the PeV scale. Since this later observation of the effect of time dilation is more indirect compared to a direct lifetime measurement, we encourage to perform a high precision measurement of the muon lifetime as a function of the muon's energy.</description>

      <title>Dimension-8 SMEFT contact-terms for vector-pair production via on-shell Higgsing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07945v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive the dimension-8 standard-model effective theory (SMEFT) contact terms relevant for vector-pair production at the LHC and lepton colliders. We first list the relevant dimension-8 massless SMEFT amplitudes, and then obtain the low-energy amplitudes using on-shell Higgsing. In all cases, the contributions we calculate are the leading-order contributions to 4-point contact-terms; the dimension-6 SMEFT merely corrects the three-point couplings entering the amplitudes. Since they are given in terms of physical quantities, namely momenta and polarizations, the results allow for a direct mapping of EFT effects to low-energy observables. The vector amplitudes are sensitive to both anomalous vector couplings and Higgs self-couplings. The left-handed fermion amplitudes feature SU(2) violating effects first generated at dimension-8. We also compare our results to HEFT predictions. Interestingly, the dimension-8 SMEFT populates almost all the novel structures generated by the dimension-8 HEFT.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12462v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a few recent manuscripts, we used the affine connection to introduce two massless scalar fields in the Einstein-Palatini action. These fields lead to non-metricity. In this article, we will discuss the significance of these fields in inflation and dark energy. We will construct a Lagrangian formalism to include these scalar fields in a theory of gravity coupled with ordinary matter and radiation. We will find that these fields need not to be included in the actions of interacting gauge theories coupled with conserved fermionic vector currents as a part of the connection. The same remains valid for ordinary scalar fields. We can couple the connection-scalars with ordinary matter by adding suitable interaction terms. In this context, we will find that Stokes' theorem leads us to include the right-handed neutrinos in the electroweak theory in curved spacetime even with the Levi-Civita connection. This is required to obtain consistent equations of motion and anomaly-free conserved vector current for the neutrinos. Axial vector currents for different Dirac fields may remain anomalous. The right-handed neutrinos can be useful to explain neutrino oscillation and dark matter. We will also discuss the possibility of introducing massless finite integer spin particles using second rank symmetric traceless tensors with reference to the corresponding little group in flat spacetime. We will show that we can use massless (A,A) type fields in Minkowski space to introduce massless finite integer spin particles.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Seebeck effect of the QGP medium using a novel relaxation time approximation model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04244v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The highly energetic particle medium formed in the ultrarelativistic heavy ion collision displays a notable difference in the temperatures between its central and peripheral regions. This temperature gradient can generate an electric field within the medium, a phenomenon referred to as the Seebeck effect. We have estimated the Seebeck coefficient for a dense quark-gluon plasma medium by using the relativistic Boltzmann transport equation in the recently developed novel relaxation time approximation (RTA) model within the kinetic theory framework. This study explores the Seebeck coefficient of individual quark flavors as well as the entire partonic medium. Our observation indicates that, for given current quark masses, the magnitude of the Seebeck coefficient for each quark flavor as well as for the partonic medium decreases as the temperature rises and increases as the chemical potential increases. Furthermore, we have investigated the Seebeck effect by considering the partonic interactions within the quasiparticle model. In addition, we have presented a comparison between our findings and the results of the standard RTA model. We have observed that the Seebeck coefficient of the QGP medium gets conspicuously decreased in the novel RTA model as compared to that in the standard RTA model. A decreased Seebeck coefficient in the novel RTA model describes a smaller magnitude of induced electric field in the medium than that estimated by the standard RTA model. However, the rate of decline gets gradually smaller as the medium gets hotter for both the current quark mass scenario and the quasiparticle mass scenario. It is also found that, in the noninteracting case, the Seebeck coefficient possesses a slightly negative value in the high temperature region, unlike the quasiparticle description, where the Seebeck coefficient remains positive for the entire temperature range.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09732v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a model for a finite-size particle detector, which allows us to derive its stress-energy tensor. This tensor is obtained from a covariant Lagrangian that describes not only the quantum field that models the detector, $\phi_{\text{d}}$, but also the systems responsible for its localization: a complex scalar field, $\psi_{\text{c}}$, and a perfect fluid. The local interaction between the detector and the complex field ensures the square integrability of the detector modes, while the fluid serves to define the spatial profile of $\psi_{\text{c}}$, localizing it in space. We then demonstrate that, under very general conditions, the resulting energy tensor -- incorporating all components of the system -- is physically reasonable and satisfies the energy conditions.</description>

Abstract: We analyze how non-relativistic effective models for the magnetic coupling of a spin to the electromagnetic field (proportional to $\hat{\boldsymbol{\sigma}}\cdot \boldsymbol{B}$) emerge from a full quantum field theoretical description of charged fermionic fields with the quantum electromagnetic field. This allows us to keep track of relativistic corrections to the models commonly used in experimental spin physics. We discuss how this interaction compares to the usual simplified models used in relativistic quantum information.</description>

      <title>Novel electrically charged wormhole, black hole and black bounce exact solutions in hybrid metric-Palatini gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10324v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a systematic exploration of exact solutions for electrically charged wormholes, black holes, and black bounces within the hybrid metric-Palatini gravity (HMPG) framework. HMPG combines features of the metric and Palatini formulations of modified gravity, offering a powerful approach to address challenges in General Relativity, particularly those related to cosmic acceleration and dark matter. We examine configurations characterized by a zero scalar potential under spherical symmetry, and present solutions in both the Jordan and Einstein conformal frames. A diverse set of solutions emerges, including traversable wormholes, black holes with double horizons, and ``black universe'' models in which spacetime beyond the horizon leads to an expanding cosmological solution rather than a singularity. Each configuration is categorized according to the properties of the scalar field, with an in-depth analysis of the horizon and throat structures, asymptotic behaviour, and singularities. These findings underscore the versatility of HMPG in capturing complex gravitational phenomena and broadens the scope of the theory, offering a robust framework for modelling gravitational phenomena across a range of astrophysical contexts. Future work will benefit from extending these solutions to include scalar potentials, addressing both early-universe inflation and late-time acceleration, and applying observational data, such as gravitational lensing and gravitational wave measurements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12294v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the leading order corrections to the expected value of the squared field amplitude of a massless real scalar quantum field due to curvature in a localized region of spacetime. We use Riemann normal coordinates to define localized field operators in a curved spacetime that are analogous to their flat space counterparts, and the Hadamard condition to find the leading order curvature corrections to the field correlations. We then apply our results to particle detector models, quantifying the effect of spacetime curvature in localized field probes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16051v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum Chromodynamics in two spacetime dimensions is investigated with the Functional Renormalization Group. We use a functional formulation with covariant gauge fixing and derive Renormalization Group flow equations for the gauge coupling, quark mass and an algebraically complete set of local fermion-fermion interaction vertices. The flow, based on a convenient Callan-Symanzik-type regularization, shows the expected behavior for a super-renormalizable theory in the ultraviolet regime and leads to a strongly coupled regime in the infrared. Through a detailed discussion of symmetry implications, and variations in the gauge group and flavor numbers, the analysis sets the stage for a more detailed investigation of the bound state spectrum in future work.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17407v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the deuteron gravitational form factors (GFFs) and generalized parton distributions (GPDs) within the soft-wall AdS/QCD model, where deuteron is described by the bulk vector field with twist $\tau=6$. For the finite-temperature studies, we apply the soft-wall model, which is thermalized by introducing a thermal dilaton field. GPDs and charge density are considered in impact parameter (IP) space and at zero and finite temperatures. We plot the temperature dependence of these quantities in IP space and observe a decreasing of their peaks on temperature increasing. The gravitational root means squared radius obtained here is close to the range given by experimental data for the mass radius and has low sensitivity to the temperature.</description>

      <title>Scotoseesaw mechanism from a $Z_3$ symmetry of matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08711v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the neutrino mass generation and the dark matter stability can be governed by the center of the QCD group, which is a $Z_3$ group. Three right-handed neutrinos $N_{1,2,3R}$ transform under $Z_3$ as $1,w,w^2$, where $w=e^{i2\pi/3}$ is the cube root of unity, and they couple to usual lepton doublets via the usual Higgs doublet $H$ and two new scalar doublets $\eta,\chi$, which transform under $Z_3$ as $1,w^2,w$, respectively. This leads to a scotoseesaw mechanism in which the seesaw and scotogenic neutrino mass generations are induced by the Majorana $N_{1R}$ mass and the Dirac $N_{2,3R}$ mass, respectively. Although the lightest of the $Z_3$ fields is stabilized, responsible for dark matter, the model lacks an explanation for relic density and/or direct detection. The issue can be solved in a $U(1)_{B-L}$ gauge completion of the model, for which the center of the QCD group is isomorphic to $Z_3=\{1,T,T^2\}$ for $T=w^{3(B-L)}$.</description>

      <title>Analog charged black hole formation via percolation: Exploring cosmic censorship and Hoop conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09317v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate an analog model of charged black hole (BH) formation using the framework of classical percolation. By analyzing the scaling behavior of key quantities, including surface gravity and Komar mass, we establish a robust correspondence between this analog system and gravitational collapse in general relativity. Our numerical simulations of the lattice model show excellent agreement with analytical predictions for the continuum limit, highlighting the potential of analog systems to capture essential features of BH physics. Interestingly, we find that while geometric criteria related to the hoop conjecture are necessary, they are not sufficient for BH formation in our model. Instead, the exponential growth of energy and cluster size emerges as the key indicator, suggesting a novel interpretation of the hoop conjecture and providing further support for cosmic censorship within our analog framework by ensuring horizon formation. This work offers a fresh perspective on the organization of matter within BH event horizons and lays the groundwork for future quantum extensions that could shed light on Hawking radiation and the BH information paradox by linking entanglement entropy in quantum percolation models to BH entropy.</description>

      <title>Perturbing the vortex: quasinormal and quasibound spectra of rotating acoustic geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11274v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strong-field gravity simulators are laboratory experiments that can investigate a wide range of both classical and quantum phenomena occurring in nature. In this work, we introduce an effective geometry that captures most of the characteristics of the strong-field regime of astrophysical, rotating black holes. This geometry can represent a vortex made from a variety of fluid and superfluid profiles with zero viscosity, making it a promising finite-temperature quantum-field-theory simulator for rotating curved spacetimes. Our geometry includes not only the typical radial flow which gives rise to an acoustic horizon, but also azimuthal circulation of the fluid. We compute the quasinormal modes, semi-analytically, and the exact quasibound states of acoustic excitations interacting with this effective geometry. The resulting spectra can be identified for both co-rotating and counter-rotating surface acoustic waves. In particular, the behavior of our acoustic geometry with circulation aligns with the phenomenology observed in recent experiments that include superfluids.</description>

      <title>Gradient corrections to the local-equilibrium energy-momentum tensor in the Zubarev approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01706v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the expectation value of the energy-momentum tensor of a real scalar field in an approximation which accounts for space-time gradients of the hydrodynamical variables in local thermodynamical equilibrium. We show that the energy-momentum tensor receives corrections with respect to the standard local-equilibrium result. Notably, the relation between the energy density and pressure, i.e., the equation of state, is modified with respect to the one in global equilibrium. The obtained corrections might be relevant for systems created in relativistic hadron and heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06961v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new rotating black hole solution to the Einstein equations as an extension of the Kerr spacetime. To derive this solution, we use the Newman-Janis algorithm and results from the non-complexification procedure. Interestingly, the solution we find may not be uniquely characterized by asymptotic parameters such as mass, angular momentum, and charge, thereby challenging the no-hair theorem. We also analyze in detail how this additional characteristics (``hair") affects the thermodynamic properties of the black hole.</description>

      <title>Universal inverse Radon transforms: Inhomogeneity, angular restrictions and boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01744v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An alternative method to invert the Radon transforms without the use of Courant-Hilbert's identities has been proposed and developed independently from the space dimension. For the universal representation of inverse Radon transform, we study the consequences of inhomogeneity of outset function without the restrictions on the angular Radon coordinates. We show that this inhomogeneity yields a natural evidence for the presence of the extra contributions in the case of the full angular region. In addition, if the outset function is well-localized in the space, we demonstrate that the corresponding boundary conditions and the angular restrictions should be applied for both the direct and inverse Radon transforms. Besides, we relate the angular restrictions on the Radon variable to the boundary exclusion of outset function and its Radon image.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave with Domain Wall Dominance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02462v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Domain walls (DWs) can be produced when a discrete symmetry is spontaneously broken, and long-lived DWs can dominate the energy density of the universe. In this work, we explore the possibility that a "domain wall dominant (DWD)" phase existed in the early universe and ended with DW decay. During the DWD phase, the universe undergoes a power-law accelerated expansion of the scale factor and exhibits temporal superhorizon evolution of the relevant frequency modes. We show that this can lead to distinct features imprinted on the stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background. Our findings provide a comprehensive framework for evaluating GW emission associated with DWD, leading to distinguishable long-lived DW-induced GWs from other cosmological sources, with significant implications for future GW observatories.</description>

      <title>Probing loop quantum effects through solar system experiments: observational signatures and parameter constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03218v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigates quantum gravity effects within the framework of an effective loop quantum gravity (LQG) black hole model parameterized by $\zeta$, utilizing precision measurements from solar system experiments and astrophysical observations. We analyze three classical tests of general relativity (GR): (1) Light deflection constrained by very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) observations of quasar radio signals, (2) Shapiro time delay measurements from the Cassini mission, and (3) Mercury's perihelion precession determined by MESSENGER mission data. Additionally, we extend our analysis to Earth-orbiting LAGEOS satellites and the relativistic trajectory of the S2 star orbiting the Galactic Center supermassive black hole Sagittarius $\rm{A}^*$ (Sgr $\rm{A}^{*}$). Our multi-probe approach reveals that the tightest constraint on the LQG parameter comes from Mercury's perihelion precession, yielding an upper bound $\zeta \lesssim 10^{-2}$. These results establish new observational benchmarks for probing quantum gravity effects.</description>

      <title>Dynamical dark energy with AdS-dS transitions vs. Baryon Acoustic Oscillations at $z =$ 2.3-2.4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07299v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, written in memory of Alexei Starobinsky, we discuss the observational viability of the Ph-$\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM model - a dynamical dark energy scenario based on a phantom scalar field undergoing an anti-de Sitter (AdS) to de Sitter (dS) transition - and revisit the Sahni-Shtanov braneworld model in light of updated BAO Ly-$\alpha$ data at $z \sim 2.3$. Both models are able to remain consistent with Planck CMB data while offering potential resolutions to the $H_0$ tension. In both cases, the expansion rate $H(z)$ is suppressed relative to Planck-$\Lambda$CDM at high redshift and enhanced at low redshift, while remaining consistent with the comoving distance to recombination as estimated by Planck-$\Lambda$CDM. Comparing model predictions with BAO-inferred values of $H(z)$, we find that SDSS Ly-$\alpha$ data at $z \approx 2.33$ mildly favor such dynamical models, whereas the recent DESI Ly-$\alpha$ measurements agree more closely with $\Lambda$CDM. Although current high-redshift BAO data do not decisively favor one model over another, our findings illustrate how frameworks originally developed to address earlier anomalies - such as the braneworld scenario - may gain renewed relevance in confronting today's cosmological tensions.</description>

      <title>Interacting Chern insulator transition on the sphere: revealing the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15338v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In two spatial dimensions, the transition between topological and trivial Chern insulators exemplifies a class of beyond-Landau critical phenomena. We show that the interaction-driven multicritical point of this transition falls into the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa (GNY) universality class, a topic of considerable interest in both high-energy and condensed matter physics. In this work, we focus on the $N=2$ case of the GNY criticality. We employ exact diagonalization of Dirac fermions on a sphere to circumvent the parity anomaly, capitalize on full SO(3) symmetry to reduce finite-size effects, and directly extract operator scaling dimensions from the excitation spectrum. Despite working with only modest system sizes, our results closely match conformal bootstrap predictions for low-scaling dimension operators and reveal several previously uncharacterized higher primaries. These findings highlight the efficacy of spherical geometry for probing interacting Dirac criticality.</description>
