      <title>Non-Bloch band theory for time-modulated discrete mechanical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09871v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study establishes a non-Bloch band theory for time-modulated discrete mechanical systems. We consider simple mass-spring chains whose stiffness is periodically modulated in time. Using the temporal Floquet theory, the system is characterized by linear algebraic equations in terms of Fourier coefficients. This allows us to employ a standard linear eigenvalue analysis. Unlike non-modulated linear systems, the time modulation makes the coefficient matrix non-Hermitian, which gives rise to, for example, parametric resonance, non-reciprocal wave transmission, and non-Hermitian skin effects. In particular, we study finite-length chains consisting of spatially periodic mass-spring units and show that the standard Bloch band theory is not valid for estimating their eigenvalue distribution. To remedy this, we propose a non-Bloch band theory based on a generalized Brillouin zone. The proposed theory is verified by some numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Topics in Continuum Mechanics: Grand Ideas, Errors &amp; Horrors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08129v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Shortly after the middle of the past century, a comprehensive presentation of Continuum Mechanics was written under supervision of Clifford Ambrose Truesdell III in two volumes of Siegfried Fluegge's Handbuch der Physik, a first in 1960 with Richard Toupin on The Classical Field Theories (the monster), including an Appendix on Tensor Analysis by Jerald LaVerne Ericksen, and a second volume in 1965 with Walter Noll on The Non-Linear Field Theories of Mechanics (the monsterino). Both nicknames are due to Truesdell. These contributions were gradually taken as turning points by the Mechanics Community worldwide, due to completeness of analysis and profoundness of documentation. Vastness of treatment acted however as a shield to careful reasoning on delicate but basilar notions which, in the wake of some scholars of the XIX century, were taken to be worthy of belief and incorporated in the presentation with a valuable historical background. Lack of engineering perspective didn't favour the necessary caution to be taken in facing a number of issues. Scholars in Continuum Mechanics, fascinated by the monumental work conceived and carried out by Truesdell and associates, did not dare any accurate revision. The analysis is here centred on unsatisfactory formulations presently disseminated in literature by followers of such authoritative treatment as Truesdell's opus magnum. The geometric approach in 4D Euclid spacetime adopted here is self-proposing even in classical context and provides clarity of notions, methods and results not achievable by the more familiar but less powerful and prone to confusing 3D treatment.</description>

      <title>Fundamental longitudinal electromagnetic (EM) force investigation using DC current</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08749v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this work was to investigate historical claims of the existence of a longitudinal ElectroMagnetic (EM) force component acting on metallic atomic current elements in a direction parallel to the current flowing through them. This lies outside conventional textbook physics predictions, yet its reality has been indicated previously and if eventually confirmed will have a significant effect on physics theory and many technological applications, especially those involving high current density ( &gt; 10^9 A/m^2) including EM mass drivers such as railguns with liquid metal sliding contacts, flux compression generators and also high energy plasmas including fusion and other energy technologies. The experiment described here is based on the measurement of force on a supported copper armature submerged in a trough containing liquid metal through which constant DC current is passing. The coaxial symmetry of the experiment (CRE-Coaxial Recoil Experiment) was able to limit all net force on the centred armature to the direction of interest, parallel to the current within it. All the experimental data related the measured forces on the armature to the total current flowing through the circuit. Variations were made to the length and location of the armature along the central axis as well as modifications to the liquid metal configuration. Raw and processed results are presented, and an experimental technique is described that revealed strong evidence for the existence of, and discrimination between, axial mechanical contact forces between solid and liquid metal as well as longitudinal EM force. The original EM force law, proposed in 1822 by Amp\`ere, includes a longitudinal component and has been found to be qualitatively consistent with all experiments to date, including these reported findings, and is considered a candidate explanatory theory.</description>
