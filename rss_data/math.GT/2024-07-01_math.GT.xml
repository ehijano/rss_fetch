      <title>Dehn functions of subgroups of products of free groups: 3-factor case, $F_{n-1}$ case, and Bridson-Dison group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Subgroups of direct products of finitely many finitely generated free groups form a natural class that plays an important role in geometric group theory. Its members include fundamental examples, such as the Stallings-Bieri groups. This raises the problem of understanding their geometric invariants. We prove that finitely presented subgroups of direct products of three free groups, as well as subgroups of finiteness type $\mathcal{F}_{n-1}$ in a direct product of $n$ free groups, have Dehn function bounded above by $N^9$. This gives a positive answer to a question of Dison within these important subclasses and provides new insights in the context of Bridson's conjecture that finitely presented subgroups of direct products of free groups have polynomially bounded Dehn function. We also give the first precise computation of a superquadratic Dehn function of a finitely presented subgroup of a direct product of finitely many free groups: we show that the Bridson-Dison group is a subgroup of a direct product of three free groups with Dehn function $N^4$. To prove our results we generalise techniques for "pushing fillings" into normal subgroups and define a new invariant for obtaining optimal lower bounds on Dehn functions.</description>

      <title>Characterizing slopes for satellite knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.00739v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A slope $p/q$ is said to be characterizing for a knot $K$ if the homeomorphism type of the $p/q$-Dehn surgery along $K$ determines the knot up to isotopy. Extending previous work of Lackenby and McCoy on hyperbolic and torus knots respectively, we study satellite knots to show that for a knot $K$, any slope $p/q$ is characterizing provided $|q|$ is sufficiently large. In particular, we establish that every non-integral slope is characterizing for a composite knot. Our approach consists of a detailed examination of the JSJ decomposition of a surgery along a knot, combined with results from other authors giving constraints on surgery slopes that yield manifolds containing certain surfaces.</description>

      <title>State sum invariants of knots from idempotents in quandle rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14661v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use idempotents in quandle rings in combination with the state sum invariants of knots to distinguish all of the 12965 prime oriented knots up to 13 crossings using only 21 connected quandles and three quandles made of idempotents in quandle rings. We also distinguish all knots up to 13 crossings from their mirror images using the same 24 quandles. Furthermore, we distinguish all of the 2977 prime oriented knots up to 12 crossings using only 10 connected quandles and three quandles made of idempotents in quandle rings. This improves a result in [Quandle colorings of knots and applications, J. Knot Theory Ramifications 23 (2014), no. 6, 1450035]. Our computations are achieved with the help of Python and Maple softwares.</description>
