      <title>Improving Network Degree Correlation by Degree-preserving Rewiring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Degree correlation is a crucial measure in networks, significantly impacting network topology and dynamical behavior. The degree sequence of a network is a significant characteristic, and altering network degree correlation through degree-preserving rewiring poses an interesting problem. In this paper, we define the problem of maximizing network degree correlation through a finite number of rewirings and use the assortativity coefficient to measure it. We analyze the changes in assortativity coefficient under degree-preserving rewiring and establish its relationship with the s-metric. Under our assumptions, we prove the problem to be monotonic and submodular, leading to the proposal of the GA method to enhance network degree correlation. By formulating an integer programming model, we demonstrate that the GA method can effectively approximate the optimal solution and validate its superiority over other baseline methods through experiments on three types of real-world networks. Additionally, we introduce three heuristic rewiring strategies, EDA, TA and PEA, and demonstrate their applicability to different types of networks. Furthermore, we extend our investigation to explore the impact of these rewiring strategies on several spectral robustness metrics based on the adjacency matrix. Finally, we examine the robustness of various centrality metrics in the network while enhancing network degree correlation using the GA method.</description>

      <title>Auditing health-related recommendations in social media: A Case Study of Abortion on YouTube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recommendation algorithms (RS) used by social media, like YouTube, significantly shape our information consumption across various domains, especially in healthcare. Hence, algorithmic auditing becomes crucial to uncover their potential bias and misinformation, particularly in the context of controversial topics like abortion. We introduce a simple yet effective sock puppet auditing approach to investigate how YouTube recommends abortion-related videos to individuals with different backgrounds. Our framework allows for efficient auditing of RS, regardless of the complexity of the underlying algorithms</description>

      <title>Detection of financial opportunities in micro-blogging data with a stacked classification system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Micro-blogging sources such as the Twitter social network provide valuable real-time data for market prediction models. Investors' opinions in this network follow the fluctuations of the stock markets and often include educated speculations on market opportunities that may have impact on the actions of other investors. In view of this, we propose a novel system to detect positive predictions in tweets, a type of financial emotions which we term "opportunities" that are akin to "anticipation" in Plutchik's theory. Specifically, we seek a high detection precision to present a financial operator a substantial amount of such tweets while differentiating them from the rest of financial emotions in our system. We achieve it with a three-layer stacked Machine Learning classification system with sophisticated features that result from applying Natural Language Processing techniques to extract valuable linguistic information. Experimental results on a dataset that has been manually annotated with financial emotion and ticker occurrence tags demonstrate that our system yields satisfactory and competitive performance in financial opportunity detection, with precision values up to 83%. This promising outcome endorses the usability of our system to support investors' decision making.</description>

      <title>Predicting Mergers and Acquisitions in Competitive Industries: A Model Based on Temporal Dynamics and Industry Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: M&amp;A activities are pivotal for market consolidation, enabling firms to augment market power through strategic complementarities. Existing research often overlooks the peer effect, the mutual influence of M&amp;A behaviors among firms, and fails to capture complex interdependencies within industry networks. Common approaches suffer from reliance on ad-hoc feature engineering, data truncation leading to significant information loss, reduced predictive accuracy, and challenges in real-world application. Additionally, the rarity of M&amp;A events necessitates data rebalancing in conventional models, introducing bias and undermining prediction reliability. We propose an innovative M&amp;A predictive model utilizing the Temporal Dynamic Industry Network (TDIN), leveraging temporal point processes and deep learning to adeptly capture industry-wide M&amp;A dynamics. This model facilitates accurate, detailed deal-level predictions without arbitrary data manipulation or rebalancing, demonstrated through superior evaluation results from M&amp;A cases between January 1997 and December 2020. Our approach marks a significant improvement over traditional models by providing detailed insights into M&amp;A activities and strategic recommendations for specific firms.</description>

      <title>Illicit Promotion on Twitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an extensive study of the promotion of illicit goods and services on Twitter, a popular online social network(OSN). This study is made possible through the design and implementation of multiple novel tools for detecting and analyzing illicit promotion activities as well as their underlying campaigns. As the results, we observe that illicit promotion is prevalent on Twitter, along with noticeable existence on other three popular OSNs including Youtube, Facebook, and TikTok. Particularly, 12 million distinct posts of illicit promotion (PIPs) have been observed on the Twitter platform, which are widely distributed in 5 major natural languages and 10 categories of illicit goods and services, e.g., drugs, data leakage, gambling, and weapon sales. What are also observed are 580K Twitter accounts publishing PIPs as well as 37K distinct instant messaging (IM) accounts that are embedded in PIPs and serve as next hops of communication, which strongly indicates that the campaigns underpinning PIPs are also of a large scale. Also, an arms race between Twitter and illicit promotion operators is also observed. On one hand, Twitter is observed to conduct content moderation in a continuous manner and almost 80% PIPs will get gradually unpublished within six months since posted. However, in the meantime, miscreants adopt various evasion tactics to masquerade their PIPs, which renders more than 90% PIPs keeping hidden from the detection radar for two months or longer.</description>

      <title>Analyzing Toxicity in Deep Conversations: A Reddit Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Online social media has become increasingly popular in recent years due to its ease of access and ability to connect with others. One of social media's main draws is its anonymity, allowing users to share their thoughts and opinions without fear of judgment or retribution. This anonymity has also made social media prone to harmful content, which requires moderation to ensure responsible and productive use. Several methods using artificial intelligence have been employed to detect harmful content. However, conversation and contextual analysis of hate speech are still understudied. Most promising works only analyze a single text at a time rather than the conversation supporting it. In this work, we employ a tree-based approach to understand how users behave concerning toxicity in public conversation settings. To this end, we collect both the posts and the comment sections of the top 100 posts from 8 Reddit communities that allow profanity, totaling over 1 million responses. We find that toxic comments increase the likelihood of subsequent toxic comments being produced in online conversations. Our analysis also shows that immediate context plays a vital role in shaping a response rather than the original post. We also study the effect of consensual profanity and observe overlapping similarities with non-consensual profanity in terms of user behavior and patterns.</description>

      <title>Spectral clustering in the Gaussian mixture block model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.00979v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gaussian mixture block models are distributions over graphs that strive to model modern networks: to generate a graph from such a model, we associate each vertex $i$ with a latent feature vector $u_i \in \mathbb{R}^d$ sampled from a mixture of Gaussians, and we add edge $(i,j)$ if and only if the feature vectors are sufficiently similar, in that $\langle u_i,u_j \rangle \ge \tau$ for a pre-specified threshold $\tau$. The different components of the Gaussian mixture represent the fact that there may be different types of nodes with different distributions over features -- for example, in a social network each component represents the different attributes of a distinct community. Natural algorithmic tasks associated with these networks are embedding (recovering the latent feature vectors) and clustering (grouping nodes by their mixture component).
  In this paper we initiate the study of clustering and embedding graphs sampled from high-dimensional Gaussian mixture block models, where the dimension of the latent feature vectors $d\to \infty$ as the size of the network $n \to \infty$. This high-dimensional setting is most appropriate in the context of modern networks, in which we think of the latent feature space as being high-dimensional. We analyze the performance of canonical spectral clustering and embedding algorithms for such graphs in the case of 2-component spherical Gaussian mixtures, and begin to sketch out the information-computation landscape for clustering and embedding in these models.</description>

      <title>A Review of Graph Neural Networks in Epidemic Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19852v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a growing interest in studying epidemiological models. Traditional mechanistic models mathematically describe the transmission mechanisms of infectious diseases. However, they often fall short when confronted with the growing challenges of today. Consequently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a progressively popular tool in epidemic research. In this paper, we endeavor to furnish a comprehensive review of GNNs in epidemic tasks and highlight potential future directions. To accomplish this objective, we introduce hierarchical taxonomies for both epidemic tasks and methodologies, offering a trajectory of development within this domain. For epidemic tasks, we establish a taxonomy akin to those typically employed within the epidemic domain. For methodology, we categorize existing work into \textit{Neural Models} and \textit{Hybrid Models}. Following this, we perform an exhaustive and systematic examination of the methodologies, encompassing both the tasks and their technical details. Furthermore, we discuss the limitations of existing methods from diverse perspectives and systematically propose future research directions. This survey aims to bridge literature gaps and promote the progression of this promising field. We hope that it will facilitate synergies between the communities of GNNs and epidemiology, and contribute to their collective progress.</description>
