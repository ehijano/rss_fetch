      <title>Configurational Thermometer for Lattice Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a diagnostic tool, a temperature estimator, for lattice gauge theory simulations. The estimator is obtained from the gradient and the Hessian of the Euclidean lattice action. It is gauge invariant, configuration-based, and independent of momentum-space information. These features enable direct checks of thermodynamic consistency in Monte Carlo simulations. We apply this tool to compact U(1) lattice gauge theories in one, two, and four dimensions. The results confirm the proposed estimator's ability to reproduce the input temperatures across different lattice ensembles. The estimator is sensitive to sampling inefficiencies and algorithmic artifacts, making it a useful diagnostic for large-scale simulations.</description>

      <title>Lattice determination of the neutrino background for $J/\psi \rightarrow \gamma + \textrm{invisible}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Searching for dark matter is a primary goal of modern astronomy and particle physics. Invisible decays of heavy quarkonia are particularly promising for probing light dark matter, attracting broad interest due to their unique sensitivity. Experiments searching for radiative invisible decays of the $J/\psi$ have steadily improved upper limits, and upcoming facilities will push sensitivity further -- making the precise determination and subtraction of the neutrino background indispensable. Here, we present the first lattice QCD calculation of the Standard Model decay $J/\psi \to \gamma\nu\bar{\nu}$, an irreducible background to $J/\psi \to \gamma + \textrm{invisible}$. Our result for the branching fraction is $\operatorname{Br}(J/\psi \to \gamma\nu\bar{\nu})=1.00(9)(7)\times 10^{-10}$, where the first uncertainty is statistical and the second is our systematic estimate. This work advances lattice-based determinations of neutrino backgrounds to quarkonium invisible decays, delivering an ab initio benchmark for $J/\psi \to \gamma + \textrm{invisible}$. Our approach generalizes to other quarkonium channels (e.g., $\Upsilon/\phi \to \gamma+\textrm{invisible}$) and provides critical theoretical support for dark matter searches at colliders.</description>

      <title>Chiral Properties of $(2\!+\!1)$-Flavor QCD in Magnetic Fields at Zero Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a lattice QCD study of the chiral properties of $(2\!+\!1)$-flavor QCD in background magnetic fields at zero temperature with physical pion masses. Simulations are performed using the highly improved staggered quark (HISQ) action across four different lattice spacings to enable a controlled continuum extrapolation. We compute the renormalized chiral condensates together with pseudoscalar meson masses and decay constants for pions, kaons, and the fictitious $\eta^0_{s\bar{s}}$ pseudoscalar as functions of the magnetic field strength $eB$ up to $eB\simeq1.2$ $\mathrm{GeV}^2$. The chiral condensates exhibit clear magnetic catalysis, increasing monotonically with the field strength. In the meson sector, neutral pseudoscalar masses decrease steadily with $eB$, whereas charged pseudoscalar masses display a non-monotonic response: they rise at small fields, consistent with the lowest-Landau-level expectation, but then saturate and slightly decrease at larger fields, signaling sizable internal-structure effects. At the same time, neutral pseudoscalar decay constants are strongly enhanced by the magnetic field. To quantify deviations from chiral symmetry relations, we isolate the magnetic-field-induced shift in the Gell-Mann--Oakes--Renner corrections, and find it to remain small for the neutral pion but to become sizable for the neutral kaon. To elucidate the origin of the magnetic response, we separately analyze the sea and valence quark contributions to both neutral and charged meson masses, finding that valence effects dominate at zero temperature. These results provide new insights into the interplay between QCD chiral symmetry breaking and strong magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Formal Naive Dirac Operators and Graph Topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by a recent conjecture of Misumi and Yumoto relating the number of zero modes of lattice Dirac operators to the sum of the Betti numbers of the underlying spacetime manifold, we study formal Dirac operators on a class of graphs admitting such in terms of their zero modes. Our main result is that for graphs on which translations commute, the conjecture of Misumi and Yumoto can be shown and indeed can be strengthened to obtain bounds on the individual Betti numbers rather than merely on their sum. Interpretations of the zero modes in terms of graph quotients and of the representation theory of abelian groups are given, and connections with a homology theory for such graphs are highlighted.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Enabled Tomography of Flux Tubes in (2+1)D Yang-Mills Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the entangling properties of the color flux tube between a static quark-antiquark pair in pure gauge Yang-Mills theory. In earlier works, we defined a gauge-invariant flux tube entanglement entropy (FTE$^2$), the excess entanglement entropy of a region of gluon fields that can be attributed to the color flux tube, and demonstrated that it is finite in the continuum limit. FTE$^2$ was shown to have two contributions, one from the vibrations of the QCD string, and the other from its internal (color) degrees of freedom. In this work, we further explore the internal color component in (2+1)D Yang-Mills theory for $SU(N_c)$ gauge groups, varying $2\le N_c\le5$. We identify a novel physical scale in the theory, the entanglement radius $\xi_0$. This radius characterizes the transverse extent of the flux tube that must be completely severed by an entangling region to capture the entanglement entropy of color degrees of freedom. The key feature underlying this phenomenon is its topological nature. This is revealed through systematic studies of multi-slab entangling regions in which FTE$^2$ changes sharply when boundaries of the slabs completely cross-cut the flux tube. We find that $\xi_0$ increases approximately linearly with $N_c$ and is independent of both R\'{e}nyi replica number and the inter-quark separation length. We also study FTE$^2$ as a function of the entangling region's transverse displacement from the static quark pair and observe behavior consistent with a previously identified intrinsic width $\lambda$ of the flux tube, with an extracted value in agreement with the inverse mass of the lightest glueball for the gauge groups studied.</description>

      <title>Tensor form factors of decuplet hyperons in QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tensor form factors encode essential information about the internal spin structure and tensor dynamics of baryons. In this work, we investigate the tensor form factors of the baryon hyperons $\Omega^-$, $\Sigma^{*+}$, and $\Xi^{*-}$ within the framework of QCD sum rules. For the $\Sigma^{*+}$ and $\Xi^{*-}$ baryons, both isosinglet and isovector tensor currents are considered, allowing us to disentangle flavor-dependent tensor contributions. The complete set of tensor form factors is numerically evaluated in the momentum transfer region $0&lt;Q^2&lt;10~\text{GeV}^2$. In addition, the quark tensor charges of the considered hyperons are extracted in the forward limit. The results provide new non-perturbative insight into the tensor structure and spin content of spin-$3/2$ baryons and offer valuable theoretical input for future phenomenological analyses and experimental studies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Normalizing flows have recently demonstrated the ability to learn the Boltzmann distribution of the Hubbard model, opening new avenues for generative modeling in condensed matter physics. In this work, we investigate the steps required to extend such simulations to larger lattice sizes and lower temperatures, with a focus on enhancing stability and efficiency. Additionally, we present the scaling behavior of stochastic normalizing flows and non-equilibrium Markov chain Monte Carlo methods for this fermionic system.</description>

      <title>Tensor-polarized parton distribution functions for spin-1 hadrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin-1 hadrons contain different aspects of spin physics from the ones of the spin-1/2 nucleon because of the existence of tensor-polarized structure functions. In the charged-lepton deep inelastic scattering from a spin-1 hadron or nucleus, such as the deuteron, there are leading-twist structure functions $b_1$ and $b_2$. In addition, there exists a gluon transversity which does not exist in the spin-1/2 nucleon. In the deuteron, these observables could probe interesting dynamical aspects beyond a simple bound system of a proton and a neutron. In addition, there are recent theoretical studies on higher-twist distributions. Tensor-polarized deuteron experiments are now under preparation at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility, so that the topic of polarized deuteron is expected to become one of exciting fields in hadron physics. This paper is a brief overview on the tensor-polarized parton distribution functions, including transverse-momentum-dependent parton distributions and fragmentation functions up to twist 4.</description>

      <title>Electric and magnetic timelike form factors of hyperons at large transfer momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There has been considerable progress in the study of the electromagnetic form factors of baryons in the timelike region, through electron-positron scattering reactions ($e^+ e^- \to B \bar B$), in the last two decades. Timelike experiments reveal information about the distribution of charge and magnetism inside the hyperons that cannot be obtained in spacelike experiments (electron scattering on baryons). Motivated by the novel data, we extend to the timelike region, without any further parameter fitting, a covariant quark model developed for the spacelike region that takes into account the meson cloud excitations of the baryon cores. We use the formalism to calculate the electric ($G_E$) and magnetic ($G_M$) form factors of spin 1/2 baryons in the large square transfer momentum $q^2$ region. Our calculations are compared with the available data from CLEO and BESIII above $q^2=10$ GeV$^2$. We conclude that our predictions for the effective form factors (combination between $G_E$ and $G_M$) are in good agreement with the $q^2 &gt; 15$ GeV$^2$ data for $\Lambda$, $\Sigma^+$, $\Sigma^0$, $\Xi^-$ and $\Xi^0$. Upcoming data for $\Sigma^-$ can be used to further test our predictions. We also compare our model calculations with the available data for ratio $|G_E/G_M|$. We conclude that the present $q^2$ data range is not large enough to test our calculations, but that a more definitive test can be performed by upcoming data above $q^2=20$ GeV$^2$.</description>

      <title>Nuclear effects on longitudinal-transverse structure function ratio in the deuteron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nuclear modifications of the nucleon's structure function $F_2^N$ have been investigated mainly since the discovery of the EMC nuclear effect in 1983, and there were many experimental measurements from the deuteron to a heavy nucleus. Now, the details of the modifications of $F_2^N$ are known from small $x$ to large $x$. On the other hand, it is taken as granted that a nuclear modification does not exist for the longitudinal-transverse structure function ratio $R_N=F_L^N/(2xF_1^N)$. However, such a nuclear modification does exist theoretically. A nucleon in a nucleus moves in any space direction, which is not necessary the longitudinal direction along the virtual-photon momentum in charged-lepton scattering. Because of this transverse Fermi motion, the longitudinal and transverse structure functions mix with the mixture probability proportional to the nucleon's transverse-momentum squared $\vec p_T^{\,\, 2}/Q^2$. In this paper, the nuclear modifications are shown numerically for the deuteron by using a standard convolution description. The magnitude of the modifications is of the order of a few percent in the deuteron; however, they should be large in large nuclei. In handling high-energy nuclear data, such nuclear modifications need to be taken into account for a precise determination of physical quantities. Now, the longitudinal-transverse structure-function ratio and tensor-polarized experiments are under preparation for the deuteron at JLab. We hope that such effects will be confirmed experimentally for not only for the deuteron but also for larger nuclei.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian formulation of the $1+1$-dimensional $\phi^4$ theory in a momentum-space Daubechies wavelet basis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply the wavelet formalism of quantum field theory to investigate nonperturbative dynamics within the Hamiltonian framework. In particular, we employ Daubechies wavelets in momentum space, whose basis functions are labeled by resolution and translation indices, providing a natural nonperturbative truncation of both infrared and ultraviolet truncation of quantum field theories. As an application, we compute the energy spectra of a free scalar field theory and the interacting $1+1$-dimensional $\phi^4$ theory. This approach successfully reproduces the well-known strong-coupling phase transition in the $m^2 &gt; 0$ regime. We find that the extracted critical coupling systematically converges toward its established value as the momentum resolution is increased, demonstrating the effectiveness of the wavelet-based Hamiltonian formulation for nonperturbative field-theoretic calculations.</description>

      <title>Multi-target density matrix renormalization group for 3D CFTs on the fuzzy sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fuzzy sphere regularization provides a powerful framework for studying three-dimensional (3D) conformal field theories (CFTs) by mapping them onto numerically tractable lattice models on the spherical lowest Landau level. However, the system sizes accessible to this method have been limited by the exact diagonalization (ED). In this work, we transcend this limitation by combining the fuzzy sphere regularization with a sophisticated multi-target density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm. Focusing on the 3D Ising-type model on the spherical lowest Landau level, we calculate the 24 low-lying energies at a larger system size than previously feasible with ED. At criticality, we extract the scaling dimensions of six primary operators, and the results show significantly improved agreement with bootstrap benchmarks compared to previous ED results at smaller sizes. Our approach allows us to efficiently target multiple excited states in larger systems beyond the reach of exact diagonalization. This study establishes the fuzzy sphere regularization combined with advanced DMRG techniques as a powerful and general framework for precision physics in 3D CFTs.</description>

      <title>Efficient Trotter-Suzuki Schemes for Long-time Quantum Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately simulating long-time dynamics of many-body systems is a challenge in both classical and quantum computing due to the accumulation of Trotter errors. While low-order Trotter-Suzuki decompositions are straightforward to implement, their rapidly growing error limits access to long-time observables. We present a framework for constructing efficient high-order Trotter-Suzuki schemes by identifying their structure and directly optimizing their parameters over a high-dimensional space. This method enables the discovery of new schemes with significantly improved efficiency compared to traditional constructions, such as those by Suzuki and Yoshida. Based on the theoretical efficiency and practical performance, we recommend two novel highly efficient schemes at $4^{\textrm{th}}$ and $6^{\textrm{th}}$ order. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of these decompositions on the Heisenberg model and the quantum harmonic oscillator, and find that for a fixed final time they perform better across the computational cost. Even when using large time steps, they surpass established low-order schemes like the Leapfrog. Finally, we investigate the in-practice performance of different Trotter schemes and find the decompositions with more uniform coefficients tend to feature improved error accumulation over long times. We have included this observation into our choice of recommended schemes.</description>

      <title>Fate of many-body localization in an Abelian lattice gauge theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20379v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the fate of many-body localization (MBL) of mid-spectrum eigenstates of a matter-free $U(1)$ quantum-link gauge theory Hamiltonian with random couplings on ladder geometries. Apart from level spacing distribution indicators like disorder-averaged mean level spacing, we also consider an intensive estimator $\mathcal{D} \in [0,1/4]$, which acts as a measure of elementary plaquettes on the lattice that are active or inert in mid-spectrum eigenstates as well as the concentration of these eigenstates in Fock space, with $\mathcal{D}$ equal to its maximum value of $1/4$ for Fock states in the electric flux basis. We calculate its distribution, $p(\mathcal{D})$, for $L_x \times L_y$ lattices, with $L_y=2$ and $4$, as a function of (a dimensionless) disorder strength $\alpha$ ($\alpha=0$ implies zero disorder) using exact diagonalization in many disorder realizations. Although finite-size estimators based on level spacings do not give a reliable critical disorder strength, $\alpha_c(L_y)$, beyond which MBL prevails as $L_x \rightarrow \infty$; a different estimator based on the skewness of $p(\mathcal{D})$ gives $\alpha_c(L_y=2)=31.04 \pm 0.54$ using data for $L_x \leq 14$ due to faster convergence. $p(\mathcal{D})$ for wider ladders with $L_y=4$ show a lower tendency to localize, suggesting a lack of MBL in two dimensions. A remarkable observation is the resolution of the (monotonic) infinite-temperature autocorrelation function of single plaquette diagonal operators in typical high-energy Fock states into a plethora of emergent timescales of increasing spatio-temporal heterogeneity as the disorder is increased. At intermediate $\alpha$ as well as for $\alpha$ slightly below $\alpha_c (L_y)$, a fraction of randomly selected initial Fock states display striking oscillatory temporal behavior of such plaquette operators in spatial regions formed out of connected plaquettes.</description>

      <title>Numerical study of computational cost of maintaining adiabaticity for long paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08626v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent work argued that the scaling of a dimensionless quantity $Q_D$ with path length is a better proxy for quantifying the scaling of the computational cost of maintaining adiabaticity than the timescale. It also conjectured that generically the scaling will be superlinear (although special cases exist in which it is linear). The quantity $Q_D$ depends only on the properties of ground states along the Hamiltonian path and the rate at which the path is followed. In this paper, we demonstrate that this conjecture holds for simple Hamiltonian systems that can be studied numerically. In particular, the systems studied exhibit the behavior that $Q_D$ grows approximately as $L \log L$ where $L$ is the path length when the threshold error is fixed.</description>

      <title>Timelike electromagnetic form factors of hyperons at large $q^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15248v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the last few years there has been considerable progress in the study of the electromagnetic form factors of baryons in the timelike region, through electron-positron scattering, with increasing squared transfer momentum $q^2$. The modulus of the electric ($G_E$) and magnetic ($G_M$) form factors has been measured for nucleons, hyperons and other baryons at BaBar, CLEO, Belle and BESIII. The novel measurements motivated the extension of a covariant quark model, developed to the spacelike region ($q^2 \le 0$), to the timelike region, without any further parameter fitting. The extension is based on asymptotic relations derived from analyticity and unitarity, valid for the large-$q^2$ region. We use the model to make predictions for the effective form factor $|G|$ (combination of $G_E$ and $G_M$) and the ratio $|G_E/G_M|$ for spin 1/2 hyperons at large $q^2$ (above 10 GeV$^2$). Our calculations are in good agreement with the data from CLEO and BESIII for $\Lambda$, $\Sigma^+$ and $\Xi^-$ above $q^2=15$ GeV$^2$. Upcoming data for $\Sigma^0$, $\Sigma^-$ and $\Xi^-$ at large $q^2$ may be used to further test our predictions. We also compare our model calculations with the scarce available data for $|G_E/G_M|$. We conclude that the present $q^2$ range is not large enough to test our calculations, but that a more definitive test can be made by experiments above $q^2=20$ GeV$^2$.</description>

      <title>Drell--Yan lepton pair production at low invariant masses: transverse-momentum resummation and non-perturbative effects in QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06201v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the transverse-momentum ($q_T$) distribution of Drell-Yan lepton pairs produced with invariant masses ($M$) from low values up to the $Z$-boson peak ($4\leq M \leq 116$~GeV). We present perturbative predictions obtained by consistently combining the resummation of logarithmically enhanced QCD corrections at small $q_T$ ($q_T \ll M$) up to next-to-next-to-next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy with the available fixed-order calculations at next-to-next-to-leading order (i.e. $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_S^3)$) valid at large $q_T$. For very low $q_T$ ($q_T\sim \Lambda_{\mathrm{QCD}}$), non-perturbative (NP) QCD effects become dominant and have been included through a NP form factor with a small number of free-parameters. We compare our results with multiple experimental datasets from hadron colliders, finding excellent agreement between theory and data. By fitting the NP parameters, we achieve a precise extraction of the NP form factor and the so-called Collins-Soper kernel.</description>

      <title>Gravitational $ D$-Form Factor: The $\sigma$-Meson as a Dilaton confronted with Lattice Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18537v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the nucleon and pion gravitational $D$-form factors, by fitting a $\sigma/f_0(500)$-meson pole, together with a background term, to lattice data at $m_\pi \approx 170\text{MeV}$. We find that the fitted residues are compatible with predictions from dilaton effective theory. In this framework, the $\sigma$-meson takes on the role of the dilaton, the Goldstone boson of spontaneously broken scale symmetry. These results support the idea that QCD may be governed by an infrared fixed point and offer a physical interpretation of the $D$-form factor (or $D$-term) in the soft limit.</description>

      <title>Semileptonic $\Omega_{b}^{*}\rightarrow\Omega_{c}^{*} \ell \bar{\nu}_{\ell}$ transition in QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01195v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We employ the QCD sum rule method to study the semileptonic weak decay of the single bottom baryon $\Omega_{b}^{*}$ with spin $\frac{3}{2}$ into the single charmed baryon $\Omega_{c}^{*}$ with spin $\frac{3}{2}$, corresponding to a $\frac{3}{2}\rightarrow\frac{3}{2}$ weak transition. A three-point correlation function is calculated in both the physical and theoretical sides to derive the sum rules for the form factors of the transition. The analysis incorporates both the perturbative and non-perturbative contributions up to mass dimension six. After determining the working regions of the auxiliary parameters and performing numerical calculations of the sum rules of the form factors, we extract the $q^2$-dependent fit functions for the form factors. The obtained fit functions are then applied to compute the decay widths of the $\Omega_{b}^{*}\rightarrow\Omega_{c}^{*} \ell \bar{\nu}_{\ell}$ transition in all lepton channels. Our results, when compared with the future experimental data, can test the Standard Model predictions and probe potential deviations from the theoretical expectations in the $\Omega_{b}^{*}\rightarrow\Omega_{c}^{*} \ell \bar{\nu}_{\ell}$ weak decay.</description>

      <title>On Charge Conjugation, Correlations, Elitzur's Theorem and the Mass Gap Problem in Lattice $SU(N)$ Yang-Mills Models in $d=4$ Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03513v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a four-dimensional Euclidean Wilson lattice Yang-Mills model with gauge group $SU(N)$, and the associated lattice Euclidean quantum field theory constructed by Osterwalder-Schrader-Seiler via a Feynman-Kac formula. In this model, to each lattice bond $b$ there is assigned a bond variable $U_b\in SU(N)$. Gluon fields are parameters in the Lie algebra of $SU(N)$. We define a charge conjugation operator $\mathcal C$ in the physical Hilbert space $H$ and prove that, for $N\not=2$, $H$ admits an orthogonal decomposition into two sectors with charge conjugation $\pm1$. There is only one sector for $N=2$. In the space of correlations, a charge conjugation operator $C_E$ is defined and a similar decomposition holds. Besides, a version of Elitzur's theorem is shown; applications are given. It is proven that the expectation averages of two distinct lattice vector potential correlators is zero. Surprisingly, the expectation of two distinct field strength tensors is also zero. In the gluon field parametrization it is known that Wilson action is bounded quadratically in the gluon fields. Towards solving the mass gap problem, in the gluon field expansion of the action, we show there are no local terms, such as a mass term. However, the action associated with the exponent of the exponentiated Haar measure density has a positive local mass term which is proportional to the square of the gauge coupling $\beta=g^{-2}&gt;0$ and the $SU(N)$ quadratic Casimir operator eigenvalue. Our results also hold in dimension three. Of course, the orthogonal decomposition of the Hilbert space $H$ has consequences in the analysis of the truncated two-point plaquette field correlation and the Yang-Mills mass gap problem: for $N\not=2$ and at least for small $\beta$, a multiplicity-two one-particle glueball state (two mass gaps) is expected to be present in the energy-momentum spectrum of the Yang-Mills model.</description>

      <title>Smallness of neutrino masses and leptogenesis in 331 composite Higgs model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13245v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider 331 composite Higgs model (CHM3) in which the Lagrangian of the strongly coupled sector is invariant with respect to global SU(3)_C \times SU(3)\times U(1)_6 symmetry that can originate from SU(6) subgroup of E_6 and contains the gauge group of the standard model (SM) as a subgroup. The breakdown of the approximate SU(3)\times U(1)_6 symmetry down to SU(2)_W\times U(1)_Y subgroup around the scale f\sim 10 TeV results in a set of pseudo--Nambu--Goldstone bosons (pNGBs) that, in particular, involves Higgs doublet. The generation of the masses of the SM fermions in the CHM3 is discussed. We argue that approximate U(1)_L and discrete Z_2 symmetries may give rise to tiny masses of the left--handed neutrinos and several composite fermions with masses 1-2 TeV. The lepton and baryon asymmetries can be generated within the CHM3 via the out--of equilibrium decays of extra Majorana particle into the Higgs doublet and these composite fermions.</description>

      <title>Addressing the sign-problem in Euclidean path integrals with radial basis function neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01695v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solving interacting field theories at finite densities remains a numerically and conceptually challenging task, even with modern computational capabilities. In this paper, we propose a novel approach based on an expansion of the Euclidean path integrals using radial basis function neural networks, which allows the calculation of observables at finite densities and overcomes the sign problem in a numerically very efficient manner. The method is applied to an interacting complex scalar field theory at finite chemical potential in 3+1 dimensions, which exhibits both the sign problem and the silver blaze phenomenon, similar to QCD. The critical chemical potential at which phase transition occurs is estimated to be $\mu_c=1.17 \pm 0.018$, and the silver blaze problem is accurately described below $\mu_c$.</description>
