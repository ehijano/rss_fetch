      <title>The Stellar Populations and Rest-Frame Colors of Star-Forming Galaxies at $z \approx 8$: Exploring the Impact of Filter Choice and Star Formation History Assumption with JADES</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our understanding of the physical properties of star-forming galaxies during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR, at $z &gt; 6$) suffers from degeneracies among the apparent properties of the stars, the nebular gas, and the dust. These degeneracies are most prominent with photometry, which has insufficient (1) spectral resolution and (2) rest-frame spectral coverage. We explore ways to break these degeneracies with a sample of $N = 22$ high-redshift star-forming galaxies at $7 &lt; z_{\mathrm{phot}} \leq 9$, using some of the deepest existing imaging from JWST/NIRCam and JWST/MIRI with JADES. Key to this study is the imaging from JWST/MIRI at $7.7\ \mu\mathrm{m}$, which provides coverage of the rest-frame $I$-band at the observed redshifts. We infer stellar population properties and rest-frame colors using a variety of filter sets and star formation history assumptions to explore the impact of these choices. Evaluating these quantities both with and without the $7.7\ \mu\mathrm{m}$ data point shows that dense spectral coverage with JWST/NIRCam (eight or more filters, including at least one medium-band) can compensate for lacking the rest-frame $I$-band coverage for the vast majority ($\approx 80\%$) of our sample. Furthermore, these galaxy properties are most consistently determined by assuming the delayed-tau star formation history, which provides the smallest offsets and scatters around these offsets when including JWST/MIRI. Within extragalactic surveys like JADES and CEERS, our findings suggest that robust characterization of the stellar population properties and rest-frame colors for high-redshift star-forming galaxies is possible with JWST/NIRCam alone at $z \approx 8$.</description>

      <title>Collisionless relaxation to quasi-steady state attractors in cold dark matter halos: origin of the universal NFW profile</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collisionless self-gravitating systems such as cold dark matter halos are known to harbor universal density profiles despite the intricate non-linear physics of hierarchical structure formation in the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. The origin of these attractor states has been a persistent mystery, particularly because the physics of collisionless relaxation is not well understood. To solve this long-standing problem, we develop a self-consistent quasilinear theory in action-angle space for the collisionless relaxation of inhomogeneous, self-gravitating systems by perturbing the governing Vlasov-Poisson equations. We obtain a quasilinear diffusion equation that describes the secular evolution of the mean coarse-grained distribution function $f_0$ of accreted matter in the fluctuating force field of a halo. The diffusion coefficient not only depends on the fluctuation power spectrum but also on the evolving potential of the system, which reflects the self-consistency of the problem. Diffusive heating by an initially cored halo develops an $r^{-1}$ cusp in the density profile of the accreted material, with $r$ the halocentric radius. Subsequent accretion and relaxation around this $r^{-1}$ cusp develops an $r^{-3}$ fall-off, establishing the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) density profile, a quasi-steady state attractor of collisionless relaxation that is not particularly sensitive to initial conditions. Given enough time though, the halo tends to Maxwellianize and develop an isothermal sphere profile. We demonstrate for the first time that the universal NFW profile emerges as an attractor solution to a self-consistent theory for collisionless relaxation.</description>

      <title>Rootin' Tootin' Efficient Ray Shootin': Creating Microlensing Magnification Maps with GPUs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The impending discovery and monitoring of hundreds of new gravitationally lensed quasars and supernovae from upcoming ground and space based large area surveys such as LSST, \textit{Euclid}, and \textit{Roman} necessitates the development of improved numerical methods for studying gravitational microlensing. We present in this work the fastest microlensing map generation code currently publicly available. We utilize graphics processing units to take advantage of the inherent parallelizable nature of creating magnification maps, in addition to using 1) the fast multipole method to reduce the runtime dependence on the number of microlenses and 2) inverse polygon mapping to reduce the number of rays required. The code is available at https://github.com/weisluke/microlensing/.</description>

      <title>A GPU Code for Finding Microlensing Critical Curves and Caustics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advancements in analyses of caustic crossing events in gravitationally microlensed quasars and supernovae can benefit from numerical simulations which locate the caustics in conjunction with the creation of magnification maps. We present a GPU code which efficiently solves this problem; the code is available at https://github.com/weisluke/microlensing/. We discuss how the locations of the microcaustics can be used to determine the number of caustic crossings and the distances to caustics, both of which can be used to constrain the space of nuisance parameters such as source position and velocity within magnification maps.</description>

      <title>CLUES III: Do User Choices Impact The Results of SED Fitting? Tests of 'Off-The-Shelf' Stellar Population and Dust Extinction Models in the CLUES Sample</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The simple stellar population models produced by stellar population and spectral synthesis (SPS) codes are used as spectral templates in a variety of astrophysical contexts. In this paper, we test the predictions of four commonly used stellar population synthesis codes (YGGDRASIL, BPASS, FSPS, and a modified form of GALAXEV which we call GALAXEVneb) by using them as spectral templates for photometric SED fitting with a sample of 18 young stellar clusters. All clusters have existing HST COS FUV spectroscopy that provide constraints on their ages as well as broadband photometry from HST ACS and WFC3. We use model spectra that account for both nebular and stellar emission, and additionally test four extinction curves at different values of $R_V$. We find that for individual clusters, choice of extinction curve and SPS model can introduce significant scatter into the results of SED fitting. Model choice can introduce scatter of 34.8 Myr in age, a factor of 9.5 in mass, and 0.40mag in extinction. Extinction curve choice can introduce scatter of up to a factor of 32.3 Myr in age, a factor of 10.4 in mass, and 0.41mag in extinction. We caution that because of this scatter, one-to-one comparisons between the properties of individual objects derived using different SED fitting setups may not be meaningful. However, our results also suggest that SPS model and extinction curve choice do not introduce major systematic differences into SED fitting results when the entire cluster population is considered. The distribution of cluster properties for a large enough sample is relatively robust to user choice of SPS code and extinction curve.</description>

      <title>The Relationship Between Eddington Ratio and Column Density in U/LIRG AGN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The local X-ray AGN population appears to follow a growth cycle regulated by the AGN's own radiation, marked by changes in their obscuration and Eddington ratio during accretion events. Because AGN in infrared-selected galaxies are more likely to be Compton-thick and have evidence for over-massive black holes, we explore whether infrared-selected AGN follow the radiation-regulated AGN growth scheme. We calculate the Eddington ratios of nine U/LIRG AGN with dynamical BH mass measurements, finding that though the number of objects is limited, AGN in IR-selected galaxies appear consistent with radiation pressure-regulated growth. We suggest that enlarging the sample of dynamical BH mass measurements in IR-selected systems will provide more stringent tests of whether their AGN are primarily regulated by radiation pressure.</description>

      <title>A Wide Field Map of Ultra-Compact Dwarfs in the Coma Cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A dataset of 23,351 globular clusters (GCs) and ultra-compact dwarfs (UCDs) in the Coma cluster of galaxies was built using Hubble Space Telescope Advanced Camera for Surveys data. Based on the standard magnitude cut of $M_V \leq -11$, a total of 523 UCD candidates are found within this dataset of Compact Stellar Systems (CSS). From a color-magnitude diagram (CMD) analysis built using this catalog, we find a clear mass-magnitude relation extending marginally into the UCD parameter space. The luminosity function defined by this dataset, shows an excess of sources at bright magnitudes, suggesting a bimodal formation scenario for UCDs. We estimate the number of UCDs with a different origin than GC to be $N_{UCD} \geq 32 \pm 1$. We derive the total number of CSS within the core (1 Mpc) of Coma to be $N_{CSS} \approx 69,400 \pm 1400$. The radial distribution of UCDs in Coma shows that, like GCs, UCDs agglomerate around three giant ellipticals: NGC 4874, NGC 4889, and IC 4051. We find UCDs are more centrally concentrated around these three ellipticals than GCs. IC 4051 has a satellite population of UCDs similar to NGC 4874 and NGC 4889. We estimate only ~14% of UCDs, inhabit the intracluster space (ICUCD) between galaxies in the region, in comparison to ~24% for GCs (ICGC). We find red (metal-rich) UCDs are more likely located closer to a host galaxy, with blue (metal-poor) UCDs showing a greater dispersion and lower average density in the region.</description>

      <title>A chemical close-up of the main body of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the chemical composition of a sample of 37 red giant branch (RGB) stars belonging to the main body of the remnant of the Sagittarius (Sgr) dwarf spheroidal galaxy. All stars were observed with the FLAMES-UVES high-resolution spectrograph. Twenty-three new targets are selected along the blue side of the RGB of Sgr, but outside the galaxy stellar nucleus, in order to avoid contamination by the stars of the metal-poor globular cluster M54. Additionally, we re-analyzed archival spectra of fourteen targets located on the red RGB. For this sample, we derive the abundances of 21 chemical species (from Oxygen to Europium) representing different nucleosynthetic sites. The sample covers a large range of metallicity, from [Fe/H]~-2 to ~ -0.4 dex and we can identify the transition between the enrichment phases dominated by core-collapse (CC-SNe) and Type Ia (SNe-Ia) supernovae. The observed [{\alpha}/Fe] trend suggests a knee occurring at [Fe/H]~-1.5/-1.3 dex, compatible with the rather low star formation efficiency of Sgr. At lower [Fe/H], Sgr stars exhibit a chemical composition compatible with Milky Way stars of similar [Fe/H]. The only relevant exceptions are [Mn/Fe], [Zn/Fe], and [Eu/Fe]. At [Fe/H] higher than ~ -1.5/-1.3 dex, instead, the chemical pattern of Sgr significantly deviates from that of the Milky Way for almost all the elements analyzed in this study. Some of the abundance patterns reveal a lower contribution by very massive stars exploding as hypernovae (e.g. [Mn/Fe], [Zn/Fe]), a higher contribution by sub-Chandrasekhar progenitors of SNe Ia (e.g. [Ni/Fe]) and a high production efficiency of rapid neutron-capture elements ([Eu/Fe]).</description>

      <title>Observations of non complex organic molecules in the gas phase of the interstellar medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The field of astrochemistry has seen major advances triggered by the completion of new powerful radio telescopes, with gains in sensitivity of receivers and in bandwidth. To date, about 330 molecular species are detected, in interstellar clouds, circumstellar shells and even extragalactic sources. The first interstellar molecules were first discovered through their electronic transitions in the visual and near UV regions of the spectra in the 1930s. Then the discovery of (pure) rotational transitions of interstellar molecules dates back to the late 1960s. The improvement of detectors and the increase in telescope sizes really opened up the submillimeter sky. The radio and submillimeter ranges cover the lowest rotational lines of molecular species. The bigger the molecule, the more spectral lines at different frequencies it produces, with weaker line intensities. Over the past 30 years, we have discovered that we live in a molecular universe, where molecules are abundant and widespread, probing the structure and evolution of galaxies, as well as the temperature and density of the observed medium, opening a new field called astrochemistry. The progress has been dramatic, since the discovery of the first molecules about 100 years ago. We present in this review, the detection techniques that led to the discovery of the simple molecules in the gas phase and the methodology that lead to the abundances determinations and the comparison with chemical modelling.</description>

      <title>SCOTCH III: Complete search for Hypercompact HII regions in the fourth quadrant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present high-frequency (18-24 GHz) radio continuum observations towards 335 methanol masers, excellent signposts for young, embedded high-mass protostars. These complete the search for hypercompact HII (HCHII) regions towards young high-mass star-forming clumps within the fourth quadrant of the Galactic plane. HCHII regions are the earliest observable signatures of radio continuum emission from high-mass stars ionizing their surroundings, though their rarity and short lifetimes make them challenging to study. We have observed methanol maser sites at 20-arcsec resolution and identified 121 discrete high-frequency radio sources. Of these, 42 compact sources are embedded in dense clumps and coincide with methanol masers, making them as excellent HCHII region candidates. These sources were followed up at higher resolution (0.5-arcsec) for confirmation. We constructed spectral energy distributions across 5-24 GHz to determine their physical properties, fitting either a simple HII region model or a power-law as needed. This analysis identified 20 HCHII regions, 9 intermediate objects, 3 UCHII regions, and 3 radio jet candidates. Combining these results with previous findings, the SCOTCH survey has identified 33 HCHII regions, 15 intermediate objects, 9 UCHII regions, and 4 radio jet candidates, tripling the known number of HCHII regions. Eleven of these sources remain optically thick at 24 GHz. This survey provides a valuable sample of the youngest HII regions and insights into early massive star formation.</description>

      <title>Euclid: Early Release Observations -- The surface brightness and colour profiles of the far outskirts of galaxies in the Perseus cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Perseus field captured by Euclid as part of its Early Release Observations provides a unique opportunity to study cluster environment ranging from outskirts to dense regions. Leveraging unprecedented optical and near-infrared depths, we investigate the stellar structure of massive disc galaxies in this field. This study focuses on outer disc profiles, including simple exponential (Type I), down- (Type II) and up-bending break (Type III) profiles, and their associated colour gradients, to trace late assembly processes across various environments. Type II profiles, though relatively rare in high dense environments, appear stabilised by internal mechanisms like bars and resonances, even within dense cluster cores. Simulations suggest that in dense environments, Type II profiles tend to evolve into Type I profiles over time. Type III profiles often exhibit small colour gradients beyond the break, hinting at older stellar populations, potentially due to radial migration or accretion events. We analyse correlations between galaxy mass, morphology, and profile types. Mass distributions show weak trends of decreasing mass from the centre to the outskirts of the Perseus cluster. Type III profiles become more prevalent, while Type I profiles decrease in lower-mass galaxies with cluster centric distance. Type I profiles dominate in spiral galaxies, while Type III profiles are more common in S0 galaxies. Type II profiles are consistently observed across all morphological types. While the limited sample size restricts statistical power, our findings shed light on the mechanisms shaping galaxy profiles in cluster environments. Future work should extend observations to the cluster outskirts to enhance statistical significance. Additionally, 3D velocity maps are needed to achieve a non-projected view of galaxy positions, offering deeper insights into spatial distribution and dynamics.</description>

      <title>Distance to the Galactic centre 7$^\prime$ halo from HI absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using archival data, we have made an HI absorption study of the 7$^\prime$ halo surrounding the Sgr A complex, observed towards the Galactic centre (GC) region. We find strong HI absorption near velocities of $-$53 km s$^{-1}$, which is due to the 3-kpc arm, placing it beyond 5 kpc from us. We further examined the HI absorption properties towards 5 different parts of the 7$^\prime$ halo. Absorption by +50 km s$^{-1}$ GC cloud is seen towards only 3 parts of the halo, but not towards the other 2 regions. Strong emissions in CO and CS are, however, identified toward all the above 5 parts of the halo by the +50 km s$^{-1}$ GC molecular cloud. This does show that the 7$^\prime$ halo is partly behind, and partly in front of the +50 km s$^{-1}$ cloud. To our knowledge, this, for the first time clearly shows the 7$^\prime$ halo to be located at the same distance as the +50 km s$^{-1}$ molecular cloud, i.e., at the GC region.</description>

      <title>The chemical and spatial variations of the bulge's velocity ellipsoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the velocity ellipsoids in an $N$-body$+$SPH simulation of a barred galaxy which forms a bar with a BP bulge. We focus on the 2D kinematics, and quantify the velocity ellipses by the anisotropy, $\beta_{ij}$, the correlation, $\rho_{ij}$, and the vertex deviation, $l_{\rm v}$. We explore the variations in these quantities based on stellar age within the bulge and compare these results with the Milky Way's bulge using data from APOGEE DR16 and {\it Gaia} DR3. We first explore the variation of the model's velocity ellipses in galactocentric velocities, $v_R$ and $v_\phi$, for two bulge populations, a (relatively) young one and an old one. The bar imprints quadrupoles on the distribution of ellipse properties, which are stronger in the young population, as expected from their stronger bar. The quadrupoles are distorted if we use heliocentric velocities $v_r$ and $v_l$. We then project these kinematics along the line of sight onto the $(l,b)$-plane. Along the minor axis $\beta_{rl}$ changes from positive at low $|b|$ to negative at large $|b|$, crossing over at lower $|b|$ in the young stars. Consequently the vertex deviation peaks at lower $|b|$ in the young population, but reaches similar peak values in the old. The $\rho_{rl}$ is much stronger in the young stars, and traces the bar strength. The APOGEE stars split by the median [Fe/H] follow the same trends. Lastly we explore the velocity ellipses across the entire bulge region in $(l,b)$ space, finding good qualitative agreement between the model and observations.</description>

      <title>Probing Dark Matter Spike with Gravitational Waves from Early EMRIs in the Milky Way Center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cold dark matter may form dense structures around supermassive black holes (SMBHs), significantly influencing their local environments. These dense regions are ideal sites for the formation of extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs), in which stellar-mass compact objects gradually spiral into SMBH, emitting gravitational waves (GWs). Space-based gravitational-wave (GW) observatories such as LISA and Taiji will be sensitive to these signals, including early-stage EMRIs (E-EMRIs) that persist in the low-frequency band for extended periods. In this work, we investigate the impact of dark matter-induced dynamical friction on E-EMRIs in the Milky Way Center, model its effect on the trajectory, and calculate the resulting modifications to the GW spectrum. Our analysis suggests that this influence might be sizable and lead to detectable deviations in the spectrum, namely suppression at low frequencies and enhancement at high frequencies, therefore providing a potential probe for dark matter with future GW detectors in space, such as LISA and Taiji.</description>

      <title>Local dark matter density from Gaia DR3 K-dwarfs using Gaussian processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern astrophysical surveys have produced a wealth of data on the positions and velocities of stars in the Milky Way with varying accuracies. An ever-increasing detail in observational data calls for more complex physical models and in turn more sophisticated statistical methods to extract information. We perform a vertical Jeans analysis, including a local approximation of the tilt term, using a sample of $200\,000$ K-dwarf stars from the Gaia DR3 catalogue. After combination with the Survey-of-Surveys (SoS) catalogue, $160\,888$ of those have radial velocity measurements. We use Gaussian processes as priors for the covariance matrix of radial and vertical velocities. Joint inference of the posterior distribution of the local dark matter density and the velocity moments is performed using geometric variational inference. We find a local dark matter density of ${\rho_\mathrm{dm} = 0.0131 \pm 0.0041\, \mathrm{M}_\odot\,\mathrm{pc}^{-3} = 0.50 \pm 0.15\, \mathrm{GeV}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-3}}$ at the Sun's position, which is in agreement with most other recent analyses. By comparing a ($z$-dependent) Gaussian process prior with a ($z$-independent) scalar prior for the tilt term, we quantify its impact on estimates of the local dark matter density and argue that careful modelling is required to mitigate systematic biases.</description>

      <title>Scatter in the star formation rate-halo mass relation: secondary bias and its impact on line-intensity mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the IllustrisTNG cosmological hydrodynamical simulations to study the impact of secondary bias -- specifically, the correlation between star formation rate (SFR) and halo bias at fixed halo mass -- on the line-intensity mapping (LIM) power spectrum. In LIM, the galaxy contributions are flux-weighted, and for many emission lines (e.g., H$\alpha$), flux scales with SFR. We show that the (ensemble-averaged) large-scale two-halo term of the power spectrum depends only on the mean luminosity-halo mass relation if the scatter is uncorrelated with halo bias. However, when luminosity correlates with halo bias at fixed mass, this assumption breaks down. In IllustrisTNG, this secondary bias increases the two-halo term by 5 per cent at $z \sim 1.5$ compared to a model with random scatter. We also find that SFRs of central and satellite galaxies are correlated, enhancing the one-halo term -- sensitive to intra-halo SFR distribution -- by 10 per cent relative to random pairings. To mitigate secondary bias in the two-halo term, we identify halo concentration (for haloes with mass $\log M_h \lesssim 12$) and satellite mass (for $\log M_h \gtrsim 12$) as effective secondary parameters. These results highlight the need to account for secondary bias when building mock catalogues and interpreting LIM observations.</description>

      <title>EIGER VII. The evolving relationship between galaxies and the intergalactic medium in the final stages of reionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of the relationship between galaxies and the intergalactic medium (IGM) during the late stages of cosmic reionization, based on the complete JWST EIGER dataset. Using deep NIRCam $3.5\,\mathrm{\mu m}$ slitless spectroscopy, we construct a sample of 948 [\OIII]$\lambda5008$-emitting galaxies with $-21.4\lesssim M_\mathrm{UV}\lesssim -17.2$ spanning $5.33&lt;z&lt;6.97$ along six quasar sightlines. We correlate these galaxies with \Lya\ and \Lyb\ transmission measured from high-resolution quasar spectra across multiple redshift intervals. We find clear redshift evolution in the correlation between galaxy density and transmission: it is suppressed in overdense regions at $z&lt;5.50$, while enhanced at $5.70&lt;z&lt;6.15$. The intermediate range exhibits a transitional behavior. Cross-correlation measurements further reveal excess absorption within $\sim 8$\,cMpc of galaxies at low redshifts, and enhanced transmission at intermediate scales ($\sim$5--20\,cMpc) at $z&gt;5.70$. Statistical tests using mock catalogs with realistic galaxy clustering but no correlation with the transmission field confirm that the observed correlations are unlikely to arise by chance. The evolving signals can be explained by stronger absorption in overdense regions, combined with the competing influences of local radiation fields and the rising background radiation. While local radiation dominates ionization of the surrounding IGM at earlier times, the background becomes increasingly important, eventually surpassing the impact of nearby galaxies. These results support an inside-out progression of reionization, with ionized regions originating around clustered, star-forming galaxies and gradually extending into underdense regions.</description>

      <title>AGNBoost: A Machine Learning Approach to AGN Identification with JWST/NIRCam+MIRI Colors and Photometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present AGNBoost, a machine learning framework utilizing XGBoostLSS to identify AGN and estimate redshifts from JWST NIRCam and MIRI photometry. AGNBoost constructs 121 input features from 7 NIRCam and 4 MIRI bands-including magnitudes, colors, and squared color terms-to simultaneously predict the fraction of mid-IR $3-30\,\mu$m emission attributable to an AGN power law (frac$_\text{AGN}$) and photometric redshift. Each model is trained on a sample of $10^6$ simulated galaxies from CIGALE providing ground truth values of both frac$_\text{AGN}$ and redshift. Models are tested against both mock CIGALE galaxies set aside for testing and 698 observations from the JWST MIRI EGS Galaxy and AGN (MEGA) survey. On mock galaxies, AGNBoost achieves $15\%$ outlier fractions of $0.19\%$ (frac$_\text{AGN}$) and $0.63\%$ (redshift), with a root mean square error ($\sigma_\text{RMSE}$) of $0.027$ for frac$_\text{AGN}$ and a normalized mean absolute deviation ($\sigma_\text{NMAD}$) of 0.011 for redshift. On MEGA galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts, AGNBoost achieves $\sigma_\text{NMAD}$ = 0.074 and $17.05\%$ outliers, with most outliers at $z_\text{spec} &gt; 2$. AGNBoost frac$_\text{AGN}$ estimates broadly agree with CIGALE fitting ($\sigma_\text{RMSE} = 0.183$, $20.41\%$ outliers), and AGNBoost finds a similar number of AGNs as CIGALE SED fitting. The flexible framework of AGNBoost allows straightforward incorporation of additional photometric bands and derived qualities, and simple re-training for other variables of interest. AGNBoost's computational efficiency makes it well-suited for wide-sky surveys requiring rapid AGN identification and redshift estimation.</description>

      <title>A Fuzzy Situation Eased: Cold Dark Matter with Multipoles Can Explain The Double Radio Quad Lens HS 0810+2554</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Originally observed in isophotal density contours of elliptical galaxies, higher order perturbations in the form of Fourier modes, or multipoles, are becoming increasingly recognized as necessary to account for angular mass complexity in strong lensing analyses. When smooth, elliptical CDM mass models fail, multipoles often emerge as solutions. With the discovery of two radio jets in the source quasar, the strong gravitational lens HS 0810+2554 can no longer be well fit by elliptical mass models, suggesting perturbations on small-scales. In this paper, we investigate the efficacy of multipoles $m=1$ (lopsidedness), $m=3$ (triangleness), and $m=4$ (boxiness and diskiness) in addressing the image positional anomalies of the two radio quads of HS 0810+2554. Due to the exact pairing and arrival sequence of the images being unknown, we consider all feasible image configurations. With 64 unique best-fit models, we achieve a fit of $\chi=1.59$ ($\chi^2=2.53$), with $m=1,3,4$ multipole strengths of 0.9%, 0.4%, and 0.6%, respectively, with images in the reverse time ordering. Elliptical+shear models from previous works find $\chi\!\sim\!7\!-\!10$, for comparison. With the morphological (i.e., standard) arrival sequence, we achieve a fit of $\chi=2.95$ with two images being assigned to opposite sources. Therefore, CDM mass models with mass complexity in the form of multipoles are able to adequately explain the positional anomalies in HS 0810+2554. Alternative dark matter theories, like fuzzy dark matter, need not be invoked.</description>

      <title>Charting circumstellar chemistry of carbon-rich asymptotic giant branch stars. II. Abundances and spatial distributions of CS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The circumstellar envelopes (CSEs) of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars harbour a rich variety of molecules and are sites of complex chemistry. Our current understanding of the circumstellar chemical processes of carbon-rich AGB stars is predominantly based on observations of a single star, IRC+10216, often regarded as an archetypical carbon star. We aim to estimate stellar and circumstellar properties for five carbon stars, and constrain their circumstellar CS abundances. This study compares the CS abundances among the sources, informs circumstellar chemical models, and helps to assess if IRC+10216 is a good representative of the physics and chemistry of carbon star CSEs. We modelled the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and CO line emission to derive the stellar and outflow properties. Using these, we then retrieved CS abundance profiles with detailed radiative transfer modelling, imposing spatial and excitation constraints from ALMA and single-dish observations. We obtain good fits to the SEDs and CO lines for all sources and reproduce the CS line emission across various transitions and apertures, yielding robust estimates of the CS abundance profiles. Peak CS fractional abundances range from 1$\times$10$^{-6}$ - 4$\times$10$^{-6}$, with e-folding radii of 1.8$\times$10$^{16}$ - 6.8$\times$10$^{16}$ cm. We also derive reliable $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C and $^{32}$S/$^{34}$S ratios from CS isotopologue modelling. Our results refine previous single-dish CS abundance estimates and improve the relative uncertainty on the CS e-folding radius for IRAS 07454$-$7112 by a factor of $\sim$2.5. Chemical models reproduce our estimates of the CS radial extent, corroborating the CS photodissociation framework used therein. We find no significant differences between the derived CS abundance profiles for IRC+10216 and the rest of the sample, apart from the expected density-driven variations.</description>

      <title>Scintillation Properties of PSR B1133+16 Measured with Very Long Baseline Interferometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The scintillation of pulsars reveals small-scale structure of the interstellar medium.
  A powerful technique for characterizing the scintillating structures (screens) combines analysis of scintillation arcs and very long baseline interferometry (VLBI).
  We present the results of a VLBI analysis of the scintillation arcs of PSR B1133+16 from simultaneous observations with Arecibo, VLA, Jodrell Bank, Effelsberg, and Westerbork.
  Three arcs appear in the data set, all of which appear consistent with being the result of very anisotropic scattering screens.
  We are able to measure their orientations on the sky, down to uncertainties of $3^\circ$ for the two stronger screens, and measure distances, of $140\pm30$, $180\pm20$, and $280\pm50{\rm\,pc}$, consistent with, but substantially more precise than what was inferred previously from annual modulation patterns in the scintillation.
  Comparing with the differential dust extinction with distance in this direction, the two nearer screens appear associated with the wall of the Local Bubble.</description>

      <title>Turbulent drag on stellar mass black holes embedded in AGN discs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate how AGN disk turbulence affects the orbital dynamics of a stellar-mass black hole (BH) initially located at a migration trap, focusing on the long-term behavior of eccentricity and inclination in the quasi-embedded regime. We develop a semi-analytical framework in which turbulence is modeled as a stochastic velocity field acting through a modified drag force. We integrate the resulting stochastic differential equations both in Cartesian coordinates and in orbital elements using a linearized perturbative approach, and compare these results with full numerical simulations. Eccentricity and inclination evolve toward steady-state Rayleigh distributions, with variances determined by the local disk properties and the ratio of the gas damping rate to the orbital frequency. The analytical predictions agree well with the numerical simulations. We provide closed-form expressions for the variances in both the fast and slow damping regimes. These results are directly applicable to Monte Carlo population models and can serve as physically motivated initial conditions for hydrodynamical simulations. Turbulent forcing prevents full circularization and alignment of BH orbits in AGN disks, even in the presence of strong gas drag. This has important implications for BH merger and binary formation rates, which are sensitive to the residual eccentricity and inclination. Our results highlight the need to account for turbulence-induced stochastic heating when modeling the dynamical evolution of compact objects in AGN environments.</description>

      <title>Stability of a cluster-disrupted mean-motion resonance (chain) in HR 8799 and PDS 70</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: HR~8799 is a planetary system with four planets potentially in a mean-motion resonance chain. It is unclear from the observations if they are in mean-motion resonance. Similarly, PDS~70 has two observed planets also potentially in mean-motion resonance. We simulate HR~8799 and PDS~70 under external perturbations to study their responds if in resonance or mean-motion resonance. We integrate the equations of motion for HR~8799 and PDS~70 starting with either in resonance or in mean-motion resonance and study their in isolation and in a star cluster. In the star cluster, we take the effects of passing stars into account. The dynamics of the star cluster is resolved using the Lonely Planets module in AMUSE. HR~8799 and PDS~70 in mean-motion resonance are stable, whereas in non-resonance they dissolve in $0.303\pm0.042$Myr and $1.26\pm0.25$Myr, respectively. In a cluster, the non-resonant HR~8799 is slightly more stable than in isolation, but still dissolves in $0.300\pm0.043$Myr, whereas the resonant planetary system remains stable for at least $0.71$Myr. In contrast, a non-resonant PDS~70 system is approximately equally stable in a cluster compared to isolation, and dissolves in $1.03\pm0.20$Myr, whereas the resonant PDS~70 system remains stable for at least $0.83$Myr. Considering the more stable solutions of mean-motion resonance for HR~8799, we argue that the planetary system was born in mean-motion resonance and that the mean-motion resonance was preserved. If HR~8799 was not born in resonance, the probability that it survived until the present day is negligible. Similarly, we argue that PDS~70 was probably born in mean-motion resonance and that its state was preserved. We also find that it is almost possible for planetary systems with a broken mean-motion resonance chain to survive longer in a perturbing cluster environment compared to isolation.</description>

      <title>MINDS: The very low-mass star and brown dwarf sample. Detections and trends in the inner disk gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Planet-forming disks around brown dwarfs and very low-mass stars (VLMS) are on average less massive and are expected to undergo faster radial solid transport than their higher mass counterparts. Spitzer had detected C$_2$H$_2$, CO$_2$ and HCN around these objects. With better sensitivity and spectral resolving power, JWST recently revealed incredibly carbon-rich spectra from such disks. A study of a larger sample of objects is necessary to understand how common such carbon-rich inner disk regions are and to put constraints on their evolution. We present and analyze MIRI observations of 10 disks around VLMS from the MIRI GTO program. This sample is diverse, with the central object ranging in mass from 0.02 to 0.14 $M_{\odot}$. They are located in three star-forming regions and a moving group (1-10 Myr). We identify molecular emission in all sources and report detection rates. We compare the molecular flux ratios between different species and to dust emission strengths. We also compare the flux ratios with the stellar and disk properties. The spectra of these VLMS disks are extremely molecular rich, and we detect the 10 $\mu$m silicate dust emission feature in 70% of the sample. We detect C$_2$H$_2$ and HCN in all of the sources and find larger hydrocarbons such as C$_4$H$_2$ and C$_6$H$_6$ in nearly all sources. Among O-bearing molecules, we find firm detections of CO$_2$, H$_2$O, and CO in 90%, 50%, and 20% of the sample, respectively. We find that the detection rates of organic molecules correlate with other organic molecules and anti-correlate with inorganic molecules. Hydrocarbon-rich sources show a weaker 10$\mu$m dust strength as well as lower disk dust mass than the oxygen-rich sources. We find potential evidence for C/O enhancement with disk age. The observed trends are consistent with models that suggest rapid inward solid material transport and grain growth.</description>

      <title>Homogeneous Stellar Atmospheric Parameters and 22 Elemental Abundances for FGK Stars Derived From LAMOST Low-resolution Spectra with DD-Payne</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A deep understanding of our Galaxy desires detailed decomposition of its stellar populations via their chemical fingerprints. This requires precise stellar abundances of many elements for a large number of stars. Here we present an updated catalog of stellar labels derived from LAMOST low-resolution spectra in a physics-sensible and rigorous manner with DD-Payne, taking labels from high-resolution spectroscopy as training set. The catalog contains atmospheric parameters for 6.4 million stars released in LAMOST DR9, and abundances for 22 elements, namely, C, N, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Sr, Y, Zr, Ba, La, Ce, Nd, Sm, and Eu, for nearly 3.6 million stars with spectral signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) higher than 20. The [Fe/H] is valid down to $\sim$-4.0, while elemental abundance ratios [X/Fe] are mostly valid for stars with [Fe/H] $\gtrsim-2.0$. Measurement errors in these labels are sensitive to and almost inversely proportional with SNR. For stars with S/N&gt;50, we achieved a typical error of 30 K in Teff, 0.07 dex in $\log g$, $\sim0.05$ dex in abundances for most elements with atomic number smaller than Sr, and 0.1--0.2 dex for heavier elements. Homogenization to the label estimates is carried out via dedicated internal and external calibration. In particular, the non-local thermal equilibrium effect is corrected for the [Fe/H] estimates, the Teff is calibrated to the infrared flux method scale, and the $\log~g$ is validated with asteroseismic measurements. The elemental abundances are internally calibrated using wide binaries, eliminating systematic trend with effective temperature. The catalog is publicly available.</description>

      <title>Constraining the physical structure of the circumstellar environment of V838 Monocerotis remnant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: V838 Monocerotis (V838 Mon) erupted in 2002 as a luminous red nova after which it cooled and began to form dust. The remnant is predicted to become a blue straggler. Interferometric observations in the HKLM bands have uncovered a stable bipolar feature in the closest vicinity of the remnant star. We aim to constrain the physical structure and nature of the circumstellar material immediately surrounding V838 Mon. Using the radiative-transfer code RADMC3D we managed to constrain the dust density distribution that best represents recent VLTI and CHARA interferometric imaging experiments. We also present recent SAAO-HIPPO polarimetric measurements which further test dust distribution models. We find that a multi-component model consisting of jets, a torus, and an ellipsoid provides an adequate fit to H band interferometric observables, however, it struggles to reproduce the extremely small closure phase deviations in the K band. The jets in our model are vital to produce nonzero closure phases, as they help to produce a gap in the torus, which is the sole source of asymmetry. The polarimetric measurements show that the intrinsic linear polarization is currently very low, with degree of polarization &lt; 2%, consistent with our model. Although not unique, our dust model suggests a persistent torus-like structure and jet or jets in the remnant, in agreement with several predictions for an intermediate-mass merger product. However, even though these features may be important signposts of the evolution of V838 Mon to the blue straggler phase, the origin of these features, remains largely unclear.</description>

      <title>Hot exozodiacal dust around Fomalhaut: The MATISSE perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Excess over the stellar photospheric emission of main-sequence stars has been found in interferometric near-infrared observations, and is attributed to the presence of hot exozodiacal dust (HEZD). As part of our effort to detect and characterize HEZD around the nearby A3 V star Fomalhaut, we carried out the first interferometric observations with the MATISSE instrument at the VLTI in the photometric bands L and M for the Fomalhaut system. Assuming a dust distribution either as a narrow ring or spherical shell for modeling the HEZD, we aim to constrain the HEZD parameters by generating visibilities and fitting them to the MATISSE data using different approaches. The L band data provide a marginal detection of circumstellar radiation, potentially caused by the presence of HEZD, which is only the second detection of HEZD emission in the L band. An analysis of the data with different fitting approaches showed that the best-fit values for the HEZD parameters are consistent with those of previous Fomalhaut observations, which underlines the functionality of MATISSE. Assuming a dust ring, it would have an inner ring radius of \(0.11\ \mathrm{au}\), an outer ring radius of \(0.12\ \mathrm{au}\), a narrow dust grain size distribution around a dust grain radius constrained by \(0.53\ \mu\mathrm{m}\), and a total dust mass of \(3.25\times 10^{-10}\ \rm{M}_{\oplus}\). Finally, the results indicate that the choice of the geometric model has a more significant impact on the derived dust-to-star flux ratio than the specific fitting approach applied. Since different dust-to-star flux ratios can result from the applied fitting approaches, this also has an impact on the parameter values of the HEZD around Fomalhaut and most likely for other HEZD systems. Moreover, further NIR and MIR data are required for a more comprehensive description of the emission originating in the vicinity of Fomalhaut.</description>

      <title>Optical spectroscopic signatures of the red giant evolutionary state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern spectroscopic surveys output large data volumes. Theoretical models provide a means to transform the information encoded in these data to measurements of physical stellar properties. However, in detail the models are incomplete and simplified, and prohibit interpretation of the fine details in spectra. Instead, the available data provide an opportunity to use data-driven, differential analysis techniques, as a means towards understanding spectral signatures. We deploy such an analysis to examine core helium-fusing red clump (RC) and shell hydrogen-fusing red giant branch (RGB) stars, to uncover signatures of evolutionary state imprinted in optical stellar spectra. We exploit 786 pairs of RC and RGB stars from the GALAH survey, chosen to minimise spectral differences, with evolutionary state classifications from TESS and K2 asteroseismology. We report sub-percent residual, systematic spectral differences between the two classes of stars, and show that these residuals are significant compared to a reference sample of RC$-$RC and RGB$-$RGB pairs selected using the same criteria. First, we report systematic differences in the Swan ($\rm{C}_2$) band and CN bands caused by stellar evolution and a difference in mass, where RGB stars at similar stellar parameters have higher masses than RC stars. Secondly, we observe systematic differences in the line-width of the H$_{\alpha}$ and H$_{\beta}$ lines caused by a difference in microturbulence, as measured by GALAH, where we measure higher microturbulence in RC stars than RGB stars. This work demonstrates the ability of large surveys to uncover the subtle spectroscopic signatures of stellar evolution using model-free, data-driven methods.</description>

      <title>Optimised neural network predictions of galaxy formation histories using semi-stochastic corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16548v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel methodology to improve predictions of galaxy formation histories by incorporating semi-stochastic corrections to account for short-timescale variability. Our paper addresses limitations in existing models that capture broad trends in galaxy evolution, but fail to reproduce the bursty nature of star formation and chemical enrichment, resulting in inaccurate predictions of key observables such as stellar masses, optical spectra, and colour distributions. We introduce a simple technique to add a stochastic components by utilizing the power spectra of galaxy formation histories. We justify our stochastic approach by studying the correlation between the phases of the halo mass assembly and star-formation histories in the IllustrisTNG simulation, and we find that they are correlated only on timescales longer than 6 Gyr, with a strong dependence on galaxy type. We demonstrate our approach by applying our methodology to the predictions on a neural network trained on hydrodynamical simulations, which failed to recover the high-frequency components of star-formation and chemical enrichment histories. Our methodology successfully recovers realistic variability in galaxy properties at short timescales. It significantly improves the accuracy of predicted stellar masses, metallicities, spectra, and colour distributions and provides a practical framework for generating large, realistic mock galaxy catalogs, while also enhancing our understanding of the complex interplay between galaxy evolution and dark matter halo assembly.</description>

      <title>The role of accreted and in situ populations in shaping the stellar halos of low-mass galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13807v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The stellar halos of dwarf galaxies are becoming an object of interest in the extragalactic community due to their detection in some recent observations. Additionally, new cosmological simulations of very high resolution were performed, allowing their study. These stellar halos could help shed light on our understanding of the assembly of dwarf galaxies and their evolution, and allow us to test the hierarchical model for the formation of structures at small scales. We aim to characterise the stellar halos of simulated dwarf galaxies and analyse their evolution and accretion history. We use a sample of 17 simulated galaxies from the Auriga Project with a stellar mass range from 3.28x10^8 Msun to 2.08x10^10 Msun. We define the stellar halo as the stellar material located outside an ellipsoid with semi-major axes equal to 4 times the half light radius (Rh) of each galaxy. We find that the inner regions of the stellar halo (4 to 6 times the Rh) are dominated by in-situ material. For the less massive simulated dwarfs (M*&lt;=4.54x10^8 Msun), this dominance extends to all radii. We find that this in-situ stellar halo is mostly formed in the inner regions of the galaxies and then ejected into the outskirts during interactions and merger events. In ~50% of the galaxies, the stripped gas from satellites contributed to the formation of this in-situ halo. The stellar halos of the galaxies more massive than M*&gt;=1x10^9 Msun are dominated by the accreted component beyond 6 Rh. We find that the more massive dwarf galaxies accrete stellar material until later times (t90~4.44 Gyr ago, being t90 the formation time) than the less massive ones (t90~8.17 Gyr ago), impacting on the formation time of the accreted stellar halos. The galaxies have a range of 1 to 7 significant progenitors contributing to their accreted component but there is no correlation between this quantity and the galaxies' accreted mass.</description>

      <title>DESI Mg II Absorbers: Extinction Characteristics &amp; Quasar Redshift Accuracy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15383v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study how absorption-line systems affect the spectra and redshifts of quasars (QSOs), using catalogs of Mg II absorbers from the early data release (EDR) and first data release (DR1) of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). We determine the reddening effect of an absorption system by fitting an un-reddened template spectrum to a sample of 50,674 QSO spectra that contain Mg II absorbers. We find that reddening caused by intervening absorbers (voff &gt; 3500 km/s) has an average color excess of E(B-V) = 0.04 magnitudes. We find that the E(B-V) tends to be greater for absorbers at low redshifts, or those having Mg II absorption lines with higher equivalent widths, but shows no clear trend with voff for intervening systems. However, the E(B-V) of associated absorbers, those at voff &lt; 3500 km/s, shows a strong trend with voff , increasing rapidly with decreasing voff and peaking (approximately 0.15 magnitudes) around voff = 0 km/s. We demonstrate that Mg II absorbers impact redshift estimation for QSOs by investigating the distributions of voff for associated absorbers. We find that at z &gt; 1.5 these distributions broaden and bifurcate in a nonphysical manner. In an effort to mitigate this effect, we mask pixels associated with the Mg II absorption lines and recalculate the QSO redshifts. We find that we can recover voff populations in better agreement with those for z &lt; 1.5 absorbers and in doing so typically shift background QSO redshifts by delta_z approximately equal to plus or minus 0.005.</description>

      <title>Insight into the physical processes that shape the metallicity profiles in galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02080v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The distribution of chemical elements in the star-forming regions can store information on the chemical enrichment history of the galaxies. Negative metallicity gradients are expected in galaxies forming inside-out. However, observations show that the metallicity profiles can be broken. We aim to study the diversity of metallicity profiles that can arise in the current cosmological context and compare them with available observations. We also seek to identify the physical processes responsible for breaks in metallicity profiles by using two galaxies as case studies. We analyze central galaxies from the cosmological simulations of the CIELO project, within the stellar mass range [$10^{8.5}$, $10^{10.5}$] M$_\odot$ at $z=0$. A new algorithm, DB-A, was developed to fit multiple power laws to the metallicity profiles, enabling a flexible assessment of metallicity gradients in various galactic regions. The simulations include detailed modeling of gas, metal-dependent cooling, star formation, and supernova feedback. At $z=0$, we find diverse profile shapes, including inner and outer drops and rises, with some galaxies exhibiting double breaks. Gradient values align with observations. A temporal analysis of Local Group analogs shows inner and outer breaks occurring at all cosmic times, with outer breaks being more frequent. Metallicity gradients show high variability at high redshift, transitioning to mild evolution at lower redshift. Most inner breaks show central oxygen enhancement, linked to gas accretion and star formation. Inner drops result from disrupted gas due to feedback-driven outflows. Outer breaks with high metallicities arise from re-accreted material, extended star formation, and CGM-driven gas mixing. Outer drops are common at high redshift, linked to metal-poor gas accretion from cold flows. We highlight the complex interplay of these processes which often act together.</description>

      <title>Galactic foreground and CMB emissions randomization due to chaotic/turbulent dynamics of magnetized plasma dominated by magnetic helicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18379v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using results of numerical simulations and astrophysical observations (mainly in the WMAP and Planck frequency bands) it is shown that Galactic foreground emission becomes more sensitive to the mean magnetic field with the frequency, that results in the appearance of two levels of its randomization due to chaotic/turbulent dynamics of magnetized interstellar medium dominated by the magnetic helicity. The galactic foreground emission is more randomized at higher frequencies. The Galactic synchrotron and polarized dust emissions have been studied in detail. It is shown that the magnetic field imposes its level of randomization on the synchrotron and dust emission. The background magnetic field (around the lepto/baryogenesis) and CMB emission have also been briefly discussed in this context. It is shown that they are considerably less randomized than the foreground ones. The main method for the theoretical consideration used in this study is the Kolmogorov-Iroshnikov phenomenology within the framework of the distributed chaos notion. Despite the vast differences in the values of physical parameters and spatio-temporal scales between the numerical simulations and the astrophysical observations, there is a quantitative agreement between the results of the astrophysical observations and the numerical simulations within the framework of the distributed chaos notion.</description>

      <title>XMAGNET: Velocity structure functions of active galactic nucleus-driven turbulence in the multiphase intracluster medium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19486v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Significant theoretical and observational efforts are underway to investigate the properties of turbulence in the hot plasma that pervades galaxy clusters. Spectroscopy has been used to study the projected line-of-sight velocities in both the hot intracluster medium and the cold gas phase using optical and X-ray telescopes. In this paper, we characterize the velocity structure functions of the multiphase intracluster medium in a simulated galaxy cluster core and study the effects of projections on the hot and cold phase of the gas. To do so, we use the fiducial run of the XMAGNET suite, a collection of exascale magneto-hydrodynamical simulations of a cool-core cluster, to compute velocity structure functions. The simulation includes radiative cooling as well as a model for active galactic nuclei feedback. Examining three-dimensional and line-of-sight velocity structure functions, we find no clear correlation between the behavior of the hot ($10^6\, \mathrm{K}\, \leq T \leq 10^8 \, \mathrm{K}$) and cold ($T\leq 10^5$ K) phases VSFs. Assuming a power law model for the VSF, we find that the power law index $m$ of the cold phase varies significantly throughout the 4 Gyr simulation time. We compare our VSFs with observations using mock optical and X-ray images, and conclude that projection effects significantly impact the amplitude and power law index of both the hot and cold phases. In the cold phase, applying a Gaussian smoothing filter to model effects of atmospheric seeing increases significantly the power law index of the projected VSF at scales below the filter's kernel size. Moreover, the VSF amplitude and power law index vary significantly depending on the viewing orientation. We conclude that observational biases such as projection effects, atmospheric seeing and the viewing angle cannot be ignored when interpreting line-of-sight velocity structure of the intracluster medium.</description>

      <title>Deblending Overlapping Galaxies in DECaLS Using Transformer-Based Algorithm: A Method Combining Multiple Bands and Data Types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17452v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In large-scale galaxy surveys, particularly deep ground-based photometric studies, galaxy blending is inevitable and poses a potential primary systematic uncertainty for upcoming surveys. Current deblenders predominantly rely on analytical modeling of galaxy profiles, facing limitations due to inflexible and imprecise models. We present a novel approach using a U-net structured transformer-based network for deblending astronomical images, which we term the CAT-deblender. It was trained using both RGB and grz-band images, spanning two distinct data formats from the Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey (DECaLS) database, including galaxies with diverse morphologies. Our method requires only the approximate central coordinates of each target galaxy, bypassing assumptions on neighboring source counts. Post-deblending, our RGB images retain a high signal-to-noise peak, showing superior structural similarity to ground truth. For multi-band images, the ellipticity of central galaxies and median reconstruction error for the r-band consistently lie within +/-0.025 to +/-0.25, revealing minimal pixel residuals. In our comparison focused on flux recovery, our model shows a mere 1 percent error in magnitude recovery for quadruply blended galaxies, significantly outperforming SExtractor's higher error rate of 4.8 percent. By cross-matching with publicly accessible overlapping galaxy catalogs from the DECaLS database, we successfully deblended 433 overlapping galaxies. Furthermore, we demonstrated effective deblending of 63,733 blended galaxy images randomly selected from the DECaLS database.</description>

      <title>Metallicities of old open clusters: A new Galactic map</title>

Abstract: Old open clusters (OCs) can constrain the chemical evolution of the Galactic disc through their metallicity gradients and age-metallicity relation but they are affected by low statistics. This work aims to determine precise and homogeneous metallicities for a number of old clusters ($\geq$ 500 Myr) from all-sky catalogues of stellar parameters leveraging Gaia spectrophotometry. Our purpose was to revisit the metallicity distribution of the oldest OCs as a function of their Galactic position and age with improved statistics. Our sample includes ~600 old OCs with a typical precision of 0.05 dex in metallicity. We identified metal-poor or metal-rich clusters never studied before, as well as moving groups as the remnants of dissolving clusters. Galactic maps show a smooth decrease in metallicity from inside to outside the disc. Metal-rich and metal-poor clusters exist at all ages but dominate respectively in the inner and the outer disc, with different scale heights.The radial metallicity gradient was found to have a knee shape with a steep value of -0.084$\pm$0.004 dex/kpc in the inner side and -0.018$\pm$0.004 dex/kpc outside the knee. The inner radial gradient flattens with age. Vertically, the metallicity gradient is -0.415$\pm$0.030 dex/kpc. The large scatter in the distribution of metallicity versus age is nicely explained by the superposition of OC populations standing at different galactocentric distances, each with its own mean metallicity and small dispersion, less than 0.08 dex in radius bins of 1 kpc.Our results are consistent with a negative radial metallicity gradient of interstellar matter that was present in the disc when the clusters formed. The low metallicity dispersion in each radius bin reflects weak radial mixing.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Galaxy Overdensities and Ionized Bubbles on Ly$\alpha$ Emission at $z\sim7.0-8.5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24080v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ly$\alpha$ spectroscopy with JWST is opening a new window on the sizes of ionized bubbles through the reionization epoch. Theoretical expectations suggest typical bubble radii should be 0.6-1.5 pMpc at $z\simeq 7$, assuming neutral hydrogen fractions of the intergalactic medium in the range $\overline{x}_{\rm HI}$=0.5-0.7. Here we investigate this picture using JWST to characterize the environment and Ly$\alpha$ emission of 292 galaxies at $7.0&lt;z&lt;8.5$ across 5 fields spanning a comoving volume of $1.3\times10^6$ Mpc$^3$. If the reionization predictions are correct, we should see overdensities and strong Ly$\alpha$ emission clustered in redshift windows of d$z=0.04-0.08$ and angular scales of 5-11 arcmin. We detect Ly$\alpha$ emission in 36 out of 292 galaxies, including nine new Ly$\alpha$ detections, two of which (in the UDS field) show extremely large equivalent widths (EW = $200_{-78}^{+50}$ A and $284_{-75}^{+56}$ A). We identify 13 significant (4-11$\times$) galaxy overdensities using redshifts from NIRCam grism and NIRSpec. Strong Ly$\alpha$ emitters are almost uniformly found in the overdensities, with nearly all located between the center and back of the structures. The overdensities that host the strong Ly$\alpha$ emitters span typical line-of-sight distances (d$z\sim 0.14$) and angular scales ($\sim 8$ arcmin) that are comparable to the predicted bubble sizes at $z\simeq 7$. We discuss evidence that the EGS is mostly ionized along a 24 pMpc sightline at $z\simeq 7.0-7.6$, based on the presence of 3 overdense structures and 10 Ly$\alpha$ emitters in this volume, and find such a large ionized region would pose tension with standard reionization models.</description>

      <title>PolyBin3D: A Suite of Optimal and Efficient Power Spectrum and Bispectrum Estimators for Large-Scale Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07249v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By measuring, modeling and interpreting cosmological datasets, one can place strong constraints on models of the Universe. Central to this effort are summary statistics such as power spectra and bispectra, which condense the high-dimensional data into low-dimensional representations. In this work, we introduce a modern set of estimators for computing such statistics from three-dimensional clustering data, and provide a flexible Python/Cython implementation; PolyBin3D. Working in a maximum-likelihood formalism, we derive general estimators for the two- and three-point functions, which yield unbiased spectra regardless of the survey mask and weighting scheme. These can be directly compared to theory without the need for mask-convolution. Furthermore, we present a numerical scheme for computing the optimal (minimum-variance) estimators for a given survey, which is shown to reduce error-bars on large-scales. Our Python package includes both general "unwindowed" estimators and their idealized equivalents (appropriate for simulations), each of which are efficiently implemented using fast Fourier transforms and Monte Carlo summation tricks, and additionally supports GPU acceleration using JAX. These are extensively validated in this work, with Monte Carlo convergence (relevant for masked data) achieved using only a small number of iterations (typically $&lt;10$ for bispectra). This will allow for fast and unified measurement of two- and three-point functions from current and upcoming survey data.</description>

      <title>Searching for dark matter annihilating into light long-lived mediators from stars inside dwarf spheroidal galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04663v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Several astrophysical and cosmological observations suggest the existence of dark matter (DM) through its gravitational effects, yet its nature remains elusive. Despite the lack of DM signals from direct detection experiments, efforts continue to focus on the indirect detection of DM from DM-rich astrophysical objects. Dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) are among the most promising targets for such searches. In this work, we aim to investigate the expected DM capture rate from the stellar component of ten nearby DM-rich dSphs, assuming that the accumulated DM eventually annihilates into light, long-lived mediators (LLLMs) which decay into gamma rays outside the dSphs. We analyze nearly 16 years of {\it Fermi}-LAT data to search for DM annihilation through LLLMs, and, from the observed stacked flux upper limits, set limits on the DM-nucleon scattering cross section for the case of a generic DM scenario. Additionally, we incorporate the Sommerfeld enhancement (SE) effect into the DM annihilation process assuming scalar DM model, and obtain bounds on the DM-nucleon scattering cross section of $\sim~10^{-36} {\rm cm}^2$ for DM masses around 100 GeV. This allows us to explore an alternative avenue for exploring DM phenomena from dSphs and compare our results with the bounds reported by direct DM detection experiments and other celestial bodies.</description>

      <title>An Alcock-Paczynski Test on Reionization Bubbles for Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02638v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an Alcock-Paczy\'nski (AP) test to constrain cosmology using HII bubbles during the Epoch of Reionization. Similarly to cosmic voids, a stack of HII bubbles is spherically symmetric because ionizing fronts propagate isotropically on average (even if individual bubbles may not be spherical), making them standard spheres to be used in an AP test. Upcoming 21-cm observations, from the Square Kilometer Array (SKA) for instance, will contain tomographic information about HII regions during reionization. However, extracting the bubbles from this signal is made difficult because of instrumental noise and foreground systematics. Here, we use a neural network to reconstruct neutral-fraction boxes from the noisy 21-cm signal, from which we extract bubbles using a watershed algorithm. We then run the purely geometrical AP test on these stacks, showing that a SKA-like experiment will be able to constrain the product of the angular-diameter distance $D_{\text{A}}$ and Hubble parameter $H$ at reionization redshifts with $\sim 2\%$ precision, robustly to astrophysical and cosmological uncertainties within the models tested here. This AP test, whether performed on 21-cm observations or other large surveys of ionized bubbles, will allow us to fill the knowledge gap about the expansion rate of our Universe at reionization redshifts.</description>

      <title>An SS433 flare caught by TESS. Fast rise times and evidence for a 13 hours quasi-period</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02753v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: SS433 is an exotic Galactic microquasar in which there is a supercritical inflow of matter into a compact object of likely black hole nature. Here we report on an SS433 flare that occurred during a TESS observation of Sector 54 in June of 2022. The flare lasted for about 10 days and culminated in a flux increase by a factor of three relative to quiescence. The unprecedented continuous photometric coverage of the flare afforded by TESS shows that the flux can rise and fall by up to a factor of two within 4 to 7 hours. Furthermore, there is evidence that the flare peaks occur with a quasi-period $P_{\mathrm{QPO}} = 13.3$ hours. The flare can be most naturally explained by accretion rate ($\dot{M}$) variations due to oscillations in the donor star mass loss rate. We estimate $\dot{M}$ variations up to a factor of two with an increase in the photospheric radius of the accretion disk by about the same factor, implying that a transient ``common envelope'' enshrouds the binary system during the flares. If the flares are due to radial pulsations in the donor star envelope then their quasi-period $P_{\mathrm{QPO}}$ could imply a mean density $\left &lt; \rho \right &gt; \sim 18 \text{ kg} \text{ m}^{-3}$ for the donor star, compared to $\left &lt; \rho_{\mathrm{RL}} \right &gt; = 0.7-1 \text{ kg} \text{ m}^{-3}$ for a synchronized Roche-lobe filling donor star. Another SS433 lightcurve from a Sector 80 TESS observation in 2024 hints that there may be an outflow from behind the donor star.</description>

      <title>The Jiutian simulations for the CSST extra-galactic surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21368v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide an overview of the Jiutian simulations, a hybrid simulation suite for the China Space Survey Telescope (CSST) extragalactic surveys. It consists of four complementary modules: the primary runs with high resolutions with the fiducial concordance cosmology, the emulator runs exploring the parameter uncertainties around the fiducial cosmology, the reconstruction runs intended for recovering the observed Universe position by position, and the extension runs employing extended cosmologies beyond the standard model. For the primary runs, two independent pipelines are adopted to construct subhaloes and merger trees. On top of them, four sets of mock galaxy light-cone catalogs are produced from semi-analytical models and subhalo abundance matching, providing a variety of observational properties including galaxy SED, emission lines, lensing distortions, and mock images. The 129 emulator runs are used to train the CSST emulator, achieving one percent accuracy in predicting the matter power spectrum over $k\leq 10h{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ and $z\leq 2$. The reconstruction runs employ a number of subgrid baryonic models to predict the evolution and galaxy population resembling certain regions in the real Universe with constrained initial conditions, enabling controlled investigation of galaxy formation on top of structure formation. The extension runs cover models with warm dark matter, $f(R)$ gravity, interacting dark energy, and nonzero neutrino masses, revealing differences in the cosmic structure under alternative cosmological models. We introduce the specifications for each run, the data products derived from them, the corresponding pipeline developments, and present some main tests. Using the primary runs, we also show that the subhalo peak mass functions of different levels are approximately universal. These simulations form a comprehensive and open library for CSST surveys and beyond.</description>

      <title>Exploring circumstellar chemistry in X-ray emitting AGB stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19616v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Aims. Our goal is to characterize the chemistry and physical conditions of the circumstellar envelopes (CSEs) of Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) binary candidate stars with UV-excess and X-ray emission, in particular, to identify the effects of the internal X-ray emission in the abundance of certain key molecules. Methods. We observed the 86.0-94.0 and 260.0-272.5 GHz spectral ranges searching for rotational transitions of the X-ray sensitive molecule $HCO^{+}$ in four AGB stars, two of them detected in both UV and X-ray emission and the other two detected only in UV. We derived the CSEs's physical parameters from previous CO observations and determined the molecular abundances of the detected species using radiative transfer models. We developed chemical kinetics models that account for the effects of internal X-ray emission (as well as UV radiation) and compared our predictions with observations. Results. We report the detection of $HCO^{+}$ in the X-ray emitting C-rich AGB T\,Dra, while it remains undetected in the spectra of the other three sources. In T\,Dra we also detect SiO, HCN, HNC, $HC_{3}N$, $SiC_{2}$, $C_{2}H$ and SiS. For the other targets only HCN and SiO are detected. The high fractional abundance of $HCO^{+}$ derived for T\,Dra ($[1.5-3.0]\times 10^{-8}$) is in good agreement with the predictions from our chemical kinetics models including the effects of internal X-ray emission, and one order of magnitude higher than the values expected for C-rich AGB stars. Additionally, we identify abundance enhancements for HNC, and $HC_{3}N$ alongside a depletion of CO in the innermost regions of T\,Dra's envelope. Conclusions. An internal X-ray source can significantly alter molecular abundances in AGB CSEs, enhancing $HCO^{+}$, $N_{2}H^{+}$, HNC, and $HC_{3}N$ while depleting parent species like CO. UV radiation has a weaker effect unless the envelope is optically thin or porous.</description>

      <title>HDO ice detected toward an isolated low-mass protostar with JWST</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14686v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Water is detected in environments representing every stage of star and solar system formation, but its chemical evolution throughout these stages remains poorly constrained. Deuterium ratios offer a means of probing chemical links between water in different cosmic regions because of their sensitivity to physicochemical conditions. Here, we present the first detection of the 4.1 $\mu$m HDO ice feature with JWST toward a low-mass protostar, L1527 IRS, which may eventually grow to a sun-like mass. We measure an ice HDO/H$_{2}$O ratio of 4.4$^{+3.7}_{-1.7}$$\times$10$^{-3}$, where the reported error is dominated by uncertainties in continuum definition and ice band strengths. This fraction is similar to the gas HDO/H$_{2}$O ratios measured in the warm ($&gt;$100 K) inner cores of other low-mass protostellar envelopes and protoplanetary disks found in comparably isolated star-forming regions. Such a similarity tentatively supports the assumption that water vapor detected in these regions is not significantly altered by gas-phase reactions following ice sublimation. It also supports the hypothesis that pre- and protostellar water ice is largely inherited in a chemically unaltered state by outer protoplanetary disks. However, the fraction is a factor of $\sim$4-10 times higher than the gas HDO/H$_{2}$O ratios measured toward comets and low-mass protostars in clustered star-forming regions. This difference may be due to either gas-phase water reprocessing in protostellar envelopes and protoplanetary disks, or differences between prestellar conditions of isolated dense cores and the clustered star-forming regions that are more analogous to the environment in which our Sun formed.</description>

Abstract: The binarity of red supergiants (RSGs) influences their evolution and the fate of supernovae. We investigate the binary fraction of RSGs in the Andromeda Galaxy (M31) and Triangulum Galaxy (M33) using photometry from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), which offers high spatial resolution to resolve more RSGs. A preliminary step involves identifying a reliable and complete RSG sample using the F110W $-$ F160W versus F160W diagram, yielding 2,612 RSGs from the Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury (PHAT) survey of M31 3,294 RSGs from the Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury: Triangulum Extended Region (PHATTER) survey of M33. These samples suggest total RSG populations in M31 and M33 of 6,563 and 7,572, respectively. These estimates significantly exceed previous ones from the ground-based observations, an increase attributed to the superior spatial resolution of the HST. The stellar parameters of these RSGs, including effective temperature ($T_{\mathrm{eff}}$), radius ($R$), and luminosity ($L$), are derived by fitting their spectral energy distribution (SED) across optical and near-infrared bands. Binary candidates are identified by detecting ultraviolet (UV) excesses in their SEDs compared to the single-star RSG model prediction. The binary fraction is determined to be 33.4% $\pm$ 0.9% for M31 and 30.9% $\pm$ 0.8% for M33. For more luminous RSGs with log $L/L_{\odot} &gt; 4.0$, the binary fraction decreases to 31.6% $\pm$ 1.9% in M31 and increases to 34.7% $\pm$ 1.8% in M33, respectively. These results are in good agreement with predictions from the BPASS binary evolution model.</description>
