      <title>Metrizability, connectedness, completeness and boundedness of generalized $u$-topology and $m$-topology in $C(X)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If $I$ is an ideal in the ring $C(X)$ of all real valued continuous functions defined over a Tychonoff space $X$, then $X$ is called $I$-$pseudocompact$ if the set $X\setminus \bigcap Z[I]$ is a bounded subset of $X$. Corresponding to $I$, the $m^I$-topology and $u^I$-topology on $C(X)$, generalizing the well-known $m$-topology and $u$-topology in $C(X)$ respectively are already there in the literature. It is proved amongst others that the $m^I$-topology is first countable if and only if the $u^I$-topology= $m^I$-topology on $C(X)$ if and only if $X$ is $I$-$pseudocompact$. A special case of this result on choosing $I=C(X)$ reads: the $u$-topology and $m$-topology on $C(X)$ coincide if and only if $X$ is pseudocompact. It is established that the $m^I$-topology on $C(X)$ is second countable if and only if it is $\aleph_0$-$bounded$ if and only if $X$ is compact, metrizable and $I=C(X)$. Furthermore it is realized that the $m^I$ topology on $C(X)$ is hemicompact if and only if it is $\sigma$-compact if and only if this topology is $H$-$bounded$ if and only if $X$ is finite and $I=C(X)$.</description>

      <title>Algebraization of infinite summation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An algebraic framework in which to study infinite sums is proposed, complementing and augmenting the usual topological tools. The framework subsumes numerous examples in the literature. It is developed using many varied examples, with a particular emphasis on infinitizing the usual group and ring axioms. Comparing these examples reveals that a few key algebraic properties play a crucial role in the behaviors of different forms of infinite summation. Special attention is given to associativity, which is particularly difficult to properly infinitize. In that context, there is an important technique called the Eilenberg-Mazer swindle that is studied and greatly generalized.
  Some special properties are singled out as potential axioms. Interactions between these potential axioms are analyzed, and numerous results explore how to impose new axioms while retaining old ones. In some cases the axioms classify or categorize a given example. Surprisingly, such axiomatizations are very concise, relying on only a handful of natural conditions.
  These investigations reveal more precisely the part that topology plays in the formation of infinite sums. Special attention is given to the methods of partial summation and unconditional summation. In the opposite direction, it is proved that from the infinite sums alone one can create a refined topology, lying between the original topology and its sequential coreflection. Another especially interesting application of these ideas is the construction of new algebraic quotient structures that retain the ability to handle infinite summation.</description>

      <title>Computing Khovanov homology of tangles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The computation of Khovanov homology for tangles has significant potential applications, yet explicit computational studies remain limited. In this work, we present a method for computing the Khovanov homology of tangles via an arc reduction approach, and we derive the Poincar\'e polynomial for simple tangles. Furthermore, we compute the Poincar\'e polynomials of tangles with at most three crossings.</description>

      <title>All Tied Up: A First Look At Modern Yo-Yo and Knot Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern Yo-Yo play has developed into a sophisticated international subculture, featuring elite competition and intricate tricks. Despite this, no systematic knot-theoretic treatment has yet been applied to the numerous string configurations realised in contemporary Yo-Yo play. This paper takes initial steps in addressing this gap, recalling fundamental results from knot theory and embeddings to develop a methodology for classifying string arrangements, known as `mounts', in both beginner and advanced single Yo-Yo play. We classify a range of mounts according to the knots they form under appropriate post-processing procedures and identify Yo-Yo maneuvers that correspond to Reidemeister moves. Furthermore, we analyse the impact of certain mounts on the writhe of their diagrammatic projections and introduce operations to facilitate discussion of composite mounts. This work seeks to initiate a dialogue between Yo-Yo practitioners and knot theorists, fostering further advancements in high-level Yo-Yo play and enabling novel physical realisations of knots, links, braids, surgeries, and other topological transformations.</description>
